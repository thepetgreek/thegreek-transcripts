1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,540
146 the sonic event rated Y and Greek. How are you tonight?

2
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:19,900
I'm doing well. I was thinking about what we did on the last podcast. And what do you mean we don't burn calories?

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:28,220
I want to start off with that. Well, and I want you to go over. This is important. This is very important because I've been watching this for decades.

4
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:36,700
Now has to do with communication. So I want you to go ahead because you got you started saying what your stance or what you take your take on it is.

5
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:43,220
And I stepped on. I said, no, no, no, don't. And I have to correct. I have to expand on that because I think it's going to help other people.

6
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,460
So I want you to start from the beginning. So what do you think about calories, Chuck?

7
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,720
Yeah, well, the thing is, I tried to explain to somebody, listen, they tell you, you burn these things. Right.

8
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:56,920
So you know what the meaning of word of the word burn is. Now, where in your body are you burning something?

9
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:04,400
You know, you got fire on your body. You got a problem. So you're not burning anything. That's a you know, that's a ridiculous term.

10
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:08,580
So think about it. And that's what calories are based on is when you burn something. Right.

11
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,340
It gets reduced down to this thing that they count up and then they say, oh, because this is what remains.

12
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:18,540
This is the count for burning. And where are you burning things in your body? You're not.

13
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,580
So let me interject. OK. Is that pretty much what you bring forward?

14
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:27,180
OK, that's pretty much what everybody knows. Everybody knows we're not burning.

15
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,800
Everybody knows we're biological beings. They're they're they're scientists and they're professionals.

16
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:36,560
And they know a lot more than we do. They've been researching it for a long time.

17
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,660
But that's so maybe we could overlook the burning part.

18
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,820
But it makes no sense, though, because if I told you, listen, if you're flying, you're flying.

19
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,580
Look, you you can't hold on.

20
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,980
It doesn't make any sense to you because you're not a scientist.

21
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,880
They know they know. Do you see where I'm going with this?

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,800
OK, sure. You're going to be OK. I want to just bring this up to people.

23
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:03,020
I'm using I'm not using Chuck as a punching bag. I will later.

24
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:11,680
I just want to show what's going on. I've been watching this for a long time, especially people that listen to stuff that I've brought forward.

25
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,880
The same thing happens with the anti-vax people. They always get defeated.

26
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,000
But when I go there, they pack up and leave. Right.

27
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,740
Why? What's the difference? I'll show you the difference.

28
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,960
So so with the calorie thing, what you just said, everybody knows we're not burning.

29
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,280
Right. Because we you know, there's spontaneous combustion is an exception.

30
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:36,240
You always bring up the facts. And so we're not burning.

31
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,960
But, you know, they know they know they know that calories do apply, even though we kind of jokingly say it's burning.

32
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,580
So calories are valid. So. So you know what? Fuck off. Right.

33
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,020
And that's what ends up happening. I hear people doing this all the time.

34
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:54,440
I've been on in person and on Skype calls, people trying to explain something.

35
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,660
And the person's like, no, that stuff you got from the Greek doesn't make any sense.

36
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,620
Does it work? Sorry. And I watch this all the time.

37
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,480
OK, so this is what's going on. This is an example.

38
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:14,360
This is not only the calories, people. So. The fact stick to the fact they will agree.

39
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:23,700
OK, how are calories? Calories are measured by it's a unit of measurement where something is measured to how much if when it's completely burned,

40
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:31,340
how much it raises the temperature of water, you know, one gram of water, one degree Celsius or cubic centimeter water.

41
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:35,780
One degree. That's a fact. OK, so, yes. No, everybody knows we're not burning.

42
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,100
That's right. So this is where you get them. This is how you get them.

43
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:47,020
So if you've ever seen a caloric experiment or data retrieved, it's a glass tube.

44
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,580
They put whatever they want to test the calorie for and they put oxygen in there.

45
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,040
You don't have to say all this. The punch line is coming.

46
00:03:53,620 --> 00:04:01,280
And there's something that looks like a spark plug and they purge it with oxygen and they hit the spark and it goes, boom, and everything in there turns to carbon.

47
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:08,600
And that vessel is underwater, which then in turn heats the water and they measure how much water is in there and the temperature.

48
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,980
And that's how many calories they have. So the issue is not whether you're burning anything they're burning.

49
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:18,399
The very intelligent scientists are burning it. The issue is, are you pooping carbon?

50
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:26,840
Because your poop can be put into that. Let's say a banana has 60 calories and you poop that banana.

51
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,680
Can you put that in, burn it and continue? Of course.

52
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:36,440
So unless you're pooping carbon, calories are not relevant because nobody's poop is carbon.

53
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:42,240
Now, there might be. Look, I haven't met everyone. I don't want to meet everyone, but maybe there is someone who poops charcoal briquettes.

54
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,840
Maybe, maybe. And then calories might apply to them. But we know that no one poops the charcoal.

55
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:58,900
So the outcome of the experiment, the resultant data is formed on the fact of the resultant being carbonized product.

56
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,960
And when we pass food that we've eaten based on what they say is caloric intake, we don't not pass that product.

57
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,620
We don't pass carbon. OK, you see. So it has to do with biocompatibility. Right.

58
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:17,560
So that's why you're the one with the vaccine. Maybe I'm wrong, but it seems to me like that's a long way around.

59
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,540
No, no, you're not. Well, I did. This is the way I would do it.

60
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,720
Yeah. Calories count. Unless you're pooping carbon.

61
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,540
Look, my cell phone might die in five seconds, right? Right.

62
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:36,720
Unless you're pooping carbon, calories have nothing to do with any human consumption of food, any rating of food at all.

63
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:44,780
Now, when I'm speaking to a multiple group of people and depending on their exposure to this scientific experiment or procedure,

64
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,780
half of them will say, holy, I don't have to explain it because they're like, oh, yeah.

65
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:54,060
But the other half don't know what how calories are obtained. So I'd say, yeah, you know, they burn it until it turns to carbon.

66
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,880
So your poop can still burn. Right. So there's no. Oh, then the rest get it.

67
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:04,760
Because most people don't know how a carb, a calorie test, a calorimeter works.

68
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:11,340
They don't know. But some people do. So all you got to say is calories don't apply because we don't poop charcoal.

69
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,400
And depending on the level of exposure or how well read they are, I'm not going to say educated.

70
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,220
But, yeah, you might I may be speaking to, let's say, 20 people and they all get it.

71
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,420
So all I have to say is they don't poop carbon and they don't get it because, you know.

72
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:33,600
Oh, are you familiar with or I might say another way to do it in less than 10 seconds is we don't poop carbon.

73
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,860
Are you familiar with the calorimeter test? They're like, oh, yeah. So, you know, I'm talking about.

74
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,940
Oh, yeah. We don't. Yeah, I get it. But if you familiar with a calorimeter.

75
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:47,060
No. You know, they burn it till it turns to carbon. Oh, now I see.

76
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,920
So you don't have to get into explaining over and over and over and over and over.

77
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,900
Now, here's the thing. I've been around some anti-vax people. Right.

78
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,860
Because I won't hang around with anyone that's vax. I mean, whatever. I mean, they just don't.

79
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:04,880
It just doesn't work out. Right. And they always when the VAX tables are out during the flu season every year.

80
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,680
I'm not just talking about the pandemic. They go in to give these people a hard time.

81
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:13,520
And they all the people that are ready to give the nurses, whatever the administrators, they laugh at them.

82
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:18,340
Here's an anti-vaxxer. I said, I knew this because look at the argument. They're not thinking.

83
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:26,720
They're not thinking. They're just OK with calories of actually what you're doing is you heard something that rang true,

84
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,140
but you can't communicate it in a way will be effective. Right. Right.

85
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,200
It's kind of like the thing with the broken glass. You know, they had a psychology experiment.

86
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,720
Five people watch a car accident, a red car and a white car. They separated them.

87
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:46,920
They watched it all together and then they asked questions. And and they asked each one, you know, a series of questions.

88
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,560
One of the questions was, what did you see? Broken glass. And everyone said yes.

89
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,700
But then they went back and played the film and there was no broken glass.

90
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,940
No, none of the windows are broken. Right. So why do people say that?

91
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:00,260
Because they're a car accident. Of course, they expect to see what there isn't.

92
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,240
They expect to see it. Now, this is a lot of things that I say are the antithesis.

93
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,500
They don't expect to hear what. OK, let's go back to the anti-vaxxers.

94
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,940
Remember the the broken glass and the calorie burning thing?

95
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:15,420
The anti-vaxxers, they get laughed at. I've seen them. I've seen them.

96
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,860
They get laughed at. And the people around them get laughed. Laugh at them, too.

97
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:23,760
Now, I go up to them and I say, are you taking you're giving out vaccine for what?

98
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:29,200
OK, and I give them the whatever given the scientific name because the flu is a certain type of thing.

99
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:33,380
Right. It's an influenza streptococci or this or that or whatever. Right.

100
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,520
So it's whatever, whatever. Yeah. Which one is it? Which strain are you going for?

101
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:42,059
And they're like, OK, all right. It's like when I used to go and question rabbis.

102
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:46,280
I know Hebrew. You know, they're not going to talk to you if you don't at least have past the bar mitzvah.

103
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,860
Right. Yeah. So you have to do you have to be able to. All right.

104
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,420
So I say, OK, so you're doing this strain for this vaccine or whatever. Right. Right.

105
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,500
But yeah, I said, are you taking into account the dosage taking each dosage

106
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:07,100
or the dosage is taking account for the person's body weight, blood type, age, sex and race?

107
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,280
Because usually there might be someone there that knows the vaccine studies.

108
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,800
And that's if you look at the NIH studies, which, by the way, none of them are online anymore.

109
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:24,380
When they did the tests and controls, those are all the things that they looked at to structure the injection.

110
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:28,700
Right. Now, if there's an old head there. Yeah. If there's an old head there.

111
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,100
Actually, those experiments are pretty good. I got more to tell you about how they structure those things.

112
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:37,600
But that's another sonic entirely. Remember, I've been looking at this since the 1980s and it hasn't changed.

113
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:45,100
It's just that it's not available. But soon as they hear me say that, they pack up and leave.

114
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:49,020
They pack up. They pack. You know, they have these folding tables, picnic tables.

115
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:57,340
Right. They pack everything up and go away. Or like if you're inside a Walgreens or so, they all go back to the they leave.

116
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,800
They leave everything and they go all the way back into the employer and sit there until I leave.

117
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:06,200
I've watched this. And when they go every time, not sometimes, every time.

118
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:12,820
But every time I'm with an anti-vaxxer that's giving off the Alex Jones or what they heard, they're getting laughed at.

119
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:20,240
Why is that? Why is that? There's a big difference. It has to do with communicating a certain amount of facts.

120
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:27,680
And don't get into something that you don't know. Right. Because eventually someone will know that you don't know and you get laughed at.

121
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:32,740
Right. Of course. Now, I know you knew the part about not pooping carbon, but you didn't bring it up. Right.

122
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:41,740
So there's a certain amount of mental laziness there. So what I'm saying is like one of the things in martial arts is laziness is not in your vocabulary.

123
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:45,860
At three o'clock in the morning, you can get up and perform. Right.

124
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,780
Because that's that's the discipline. Right. Discipline doesn't mean unpleasant.

125
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,020
Well, I'm so lazy. I'm stressing what I think is the most simple and striking part.

126
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:59,240
But it won't. That's all. What you're doing is stressing that. Yeah.

127
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,420
Well, it doesn't work. Well, it doesn't work. But it has been effective to get people to go.

128
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,560
Wait a minute. You know, I'm they're thinking to themselves, where is the burning in the process?

129
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,760
And you even mention it where it's like unless you're burning, you know, see burning.

130
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:18,760
But the result is the result. You must have the result that's done.

131
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:27,060
In other words, the conclusion, because you know how we had Dimitri on it is ground zero has been used for many things like they talked about recently.

132
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:33,640
I saw. Oh, the wood. They're not going to do another Woodstock anniversary, even though it was the ground zero for the hero hippie movement.

133
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:39,480
Right. They're using it for other things. Yeah. I'm saying you can get away with it, but it's not rock solid.

134
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,020
And I hear this very often. I've had many people through the years have discussed.

135
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:50,600
Yeah. My girlfriend's a Ph.D. and whatever. And I brought up some stuff and she laughed at it.

136
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:55,120
And I'm like, well, how did you what did you say? And I started laughing as I'm laughing at you.

137
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,660
Don't don't try it. How many times have we had a sonic? And I say, don't do what I would do.

138
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:05,820
You're going to fall on it. Now, it doesn't mean you can't. It is a discipline there.

139
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:11,140
And the discipline is there. You have to hear it and visualize it and then be able to communicate it.

140
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,380
So I just want to bring that up because you mentioned the burning last night.

141
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,900
That doesn't get any because like the word grounds here, everyone's using it. Right.

142
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,500
You have to stress that it's a technique only. Right. So the definition of a calorie is carbon.

143
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,660
Let's let's go back to the cat for a second. You have a calorimeter and we put a banana.

144
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:34,920
That's a calorie. OK, so we purge it with oxygen. Everything gets sealed and it goes.

145
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:39,420
It burns and it goes boom. Now we open the calorimeter, but there's still banana in there.

146
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,720
It didn't turn to carbon. Guess what? That cannot be counted. Right. Right.

147
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:47,560
You see, cannot be counted back to the vaccines. The same thing.

148
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:53,160
The other thing with the vaccines is there is no regardless of how harmful it is.

149
00:12:53,260 --> 00:13:00,700
There is no such thing as a one size fits all. Even when you look at something like pain pills for children,

150
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:07,800
they say half a tablet. Right. Depending on body or or if you have a 350 pound, you know, Greek guy,

151
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,260
he's going to need four ibuprofen. Right. Maybe so. Yeah. Right.

152
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,900
So it goes by weight. Everything goes by weight. Right. Children get very small doses.

153
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:21,760
Right. If you're distributing a chemical and the idea is to distribute a chemical throughout the body, then, yeah,

154
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:27,440
you have to take into account what the size of the body, the amount of stuff that you got to do because it's based on dilution.

155
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:33,740
Now, the other thing is there are other things that are based on dilution before they're taken in the body.

156
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:37,260
It's the opposite. The less of it you have.

157
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,740
A 90 pound, a 90 pound woman, you know, who is perfectly healthy, has a headache.

158
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:46,280
I'm 230 pounds. I have a headache. You know what, though?

159
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:50,540
We're going to distribute this chemical throughout the body. We're going to need two different levels here.

160
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,820
It's just that simple. I mean, because I'm I'm more than double her.

161
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,160
You know, it wouldn't wouldn't that make sense or no. Right.

162
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,820
Because you got to do that. You know, the chemical never gets into never passes the intestine.

163
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:09,580
Well, when you take more of it, because the induction that happens in the body is proportionate.

164
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,140
Well, to encourage that induction. Right. That's right. It's proportional.

165
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:18,140
So, you know, if you have just a drop of this versus, you know, a whole eyedropper full,

166
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,120
it's going to be a different proportion that you're introducing for induction.

167
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:28,700
That's yes. That's why in homeopathics, you can have an angstrom, which is the smallest smaller than nano.

168
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,060
Right. Angstroms are what the width of supposedly atoms are even smaller than light waves.

169
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:44,920
You can have angstroms of it of it in a gallon of water and give the small lady and the 230 pound man a glass of water and it will work the same.

170
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:51,380
OK. Right. That's the beauty of homeopathics, because, you know, homeopathics, there used to be a state.

171
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:57,260
OK. The situation that we're in is never going to be able to recall what I'm about to say.

172
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,700
Like, you know, you have psychologists where you get to the questions. I'll make this short.

173
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,700
Years ago, before psychology, psychology is a new thing.

174
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,040
Didn't come out till the 20s or teens, let's say of the 20th century.

175
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,540
Before that, you were known as a master of lunacy.

176
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:16,560
And it was right to see if to judge if someone was competent, mentally competent.

177
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,860
Right. Until they started to codify the schools of thought or so somewhere around the turn of that century.

178
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,400
Yeah. They were called master of lunacy before they had psychologists.

179
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,740
And then you had state certified herbalists.

180
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,380
You had state certified homeopathic. Right. Right. All that.

181
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,300
Where did all that go? You know, they can't say that the people say the government doesn't want.

182
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,140
No, no. The government had a lot of stuff.

183
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:43,280
There was even legitimately an agency to hunt vampires during the time of Lincoln.

184
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,980
Probably. Yeah. It's not famous, but you can look it up.

185
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,600
Yeah. All these things.

186
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:55,980
So it was quite interesting when you live in a more of a real, really proportioned society.

187
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,600
We're now we're very disproportioned. You know, it's where everyone's been enslaved.

188
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:05,220
So let's I'll stop right here. And why don't we get to the questions that you said you messaged?

189
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:10,640
There's a very lengthy one. Maybe we leave that out or abridged or let's let's get going on the questions.

190
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:16,260
I'll actually cherry pick off of it and see how that goes, because there's a bunch of explanation in there.

191
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,180
And I don't think it's entirely necessary, but. Oh, OK.

192
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,020
Hold on. Before I went, I got into the spirit and the soul last week. Yes.

193
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:29,300
And I gave my own. OK. In the Hebrew, by the way, just so as I remember, there's something called the rule of Kodesh,

194
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:34,840
which is the set apart spirit. But when you get to the Holy Spirit, it's the set apart soul.

195
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,040
When you get to Hellenic, they switch it. But either one would be correct.

196
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:42,180
But it would not be referring to the same thing. So I just wanted to bring that up.

197
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,640
And there's one day we'll do I think one of the early rated wise who got into the soul and the spirit again.

198
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,540
Yes. And maybe we'll do it again because it's one of the.

199
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:58,160
But if you don't know that you are made up of a physical living metabolism that is transferable and a spirit,

200
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:04,240
a mind that is also transferable and a body that relies on the metabolism, because you can have a body without a spirit,

201
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:07,160
by the way, just needs the metabolism. Someone in a coma. Right.

202
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:13,560
Right. Can be wandering around the whole universe or the whole city, whether bodies still pumping and beating.

203
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,400
And right. Right. So the body and the soul go together. Metabolism of the spirit.

204
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:25,520
But all three of them can be separated. I mean, the spirit and the soul, the soul and the body have to stay together.

205
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,380
Otherwise, the body dies. So that's again, I mean, there's so much once.

206
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:37,320
OK, I'm bringing this up again, because once you understand that firmly now, you know what what you're working with and how to work with it.

207
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:42,020
Right. You know, you can work with it and go on to other things that we have. OK, the questions.

208
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:50,040
OK, so since we ended off on that part, I'll go to the questions from Eddie, which are two short ones.

209
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:56,660
Questions are the wicked in Proverbs 16 for referring to NPCs.

210
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:04,000
Probably not. I have to go look at it because the word there's several words for wicked.

211
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:12,540
As a matter of fact, sometimes the word unclean to me is is is translated as wicked.

212
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:19,800
I don't know what the word is. I'd have to go look it up and see which, you know, the translation is, I'd say, a 40 percent.

213
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:26,540
Right. Correct. At best. So I don't know which word they're using in the words would mean different.

214
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:36,980
So an NPC is I don't know. No, I wouldn't know how to answer that anyway, because the NPC, I think, would be generally innocent because they're a tool.

215
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:40,980
An NPC is a tool that's been it's a throwaway. It's a throwaway.

216
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:47,260
Like, you know, those paper plates and it's not acting under its own its own will, so to speak, its own.

217
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,840
Yeah. Right. So therefore, it's really not. It's a throwaway.

218
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,680
So whether they're working, let's say, for the dark side or the light side, it doesn't matter.

219
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,440
There are throwaways. And remember, the dark side follows what the light side has outlined.

220
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:03,660
Yeah. Right. Remember in Job, you know, Satan is walking around. Hey, what are you doing? Walking around.

221
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,760
I want you to go and bother this guy. So the NPC is inconsequential.

222
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:14,960
It sucks when you find out, you know, your your family is our NPCs or your best friends are NPCs when you wake up to that fact.

223
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,000
Right. It sucks. But it's true. This is the way. Right. But I want to throw in something.

224
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:25,520
Right. I was just going to say it's as responsible, though, as like, you know, say a cave collapses and crushes, you know, 100 people and kills them.

225
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,320
The cave is not evil. It's just simply, you know, doing a fun.

226
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,140
Well, evil has affected. Yeah. Evil has happened to them. But the cave is not.

227
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,080
The cave is not right. That's what I'm saying. It's an evil.

228
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,400
It's like when I do weather work in a trailer park, it's washed out.

229
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,760
You know, I just tell myself, oh, they shouldn't have been there. They should have picked another spot.

230
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:47,880
Well, you weren't seeking. It wasn't your volition that you weren't under the idea.

231
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,160
Look, I'm going to destroy these people's place to live. I'm not going to destroy them.

232
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,260
You didn't intentionally do that, but you did take an action and something bad happened to them.

233
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:59,400
Not that time. Those are the things that I intentionally did. I got really close.

234
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:03,400
Maybe. But I'm just saying in that instance that you brought up, you're not evil in that case.

235
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,860
You just did something that. Yeah, you did evil.

236
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,080
Evil is a is a is connected to an adverb.

237
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:15,580
But that's like an adjective. An NPC is even less responsible because they've got no will involved there. It's not them.

238
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,760
Yeah. Like like here's the another tangent to the NPC thing.

239
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,400
I don't know if you guys remember there was an article.

240
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,840
Well, you know, the if you want to know what the federal government's doing, they have a monthly register.

241
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,620
Now it's quarterly because no one reads it. Right. Not Fox News, not the news.

242
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,740
You want to know what the federal government's up to. They put it in the register, federal register.

243
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:39,480
Look it up. The U.N. has a register also. And again, I think they used to be bimonthly.

244
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,700
Now it's like quarterly because no one reads it. I don't know if you guys remember.

245
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:47,320
I think it's about two decades ago. They listed the they did went through all the countries and classified them.

246
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:54,340
And the United States of America was classified as nomadic because most of the people are classified as residents.

247
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:03,160
So I saw that they called it oligarchy as opposed to, you know, when they were trying to classify us as, you know, either a democracy.

248
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,260
Yeah. But the oligarchy also applies to them. But what I mean is that no one lives here.

249
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:13,280
No one lives in the U.S. I mean, no one lives in this kind of most countries because they go on the street and ask, are you a resident?

250
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:19,120
They'll say, yeah, yeah. So where do you live? Because you only be a resident when you're either traveling or on vacation.

251
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,620
Right. Or for business. Where do you live? Oh, well, I live here, too.

252
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,960
So. Oh, so now you're not only a vagabond, you're also insane.

253
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:31,960
Because how could you be a resident and be an inhabitant at the same place? Why would you say so?

254
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:39,200
They're also insane. That's why, again, I don't know if you guys remember the psychiatry society a few years ago, again, with some outrage.

255
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:45,860
Maybe around the time of Obama, they put out an article saying 70 percent of the Americans have mental health problems or 78 percent.

256
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,420
Remember something? Do you remember that a decade ago? Yeah, absolutely.

257
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:57,640
Yeah. Well, that's OK. So that's when you say NPCs. I mean, it's a serious, you know, you know, where are they? Who are they?

258
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,940
You know, I mean, yeah, they're everywhere. You're just like when I say there's a lot of evil people in the world.

259
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:06,620
Everyone shakes their head. Yes. But it's never them or never their family.

260
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:15,820
You ever notice that? So then where are they? Of course, even, you know, like the hypocrite, the most evil thing you ever see, their hero in their own story, you know?

261
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:21,240
Yeah. So, you know. So anyway, that's the side note on the NPCs.

262
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:26,300
It's not just this. And there's no strict definition because it's I just gave you the examples with the U.N. and the SEC.

263
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,760
They're basically telling you you're all crazy and you're all vagabonds.

264
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:36,160
And yeah, OK, but there's some outrage. But OK, next question. Sure. This one's about food, actually.

265
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:41,660
Let's see. And let's see a question about an older said around 100 or so.

266
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:51,040
I mastered the carrot and the onion sticks with sesame oil and sesame seeds with organic brown rice and up the intake of cauliflower for the whole family.

267
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:55,840
All that. OK. My language skills are not good enough to take a picture of my head.

268
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:01,840
How to cut the broccoli. OK. How to cut the broccoli or the cabbage for the cabbage steak.

269
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,460
Listen to that episode several times. So do you have some advice?

270
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,280
Oh, yeah. Yeah. As large as possible. You want it. You want it just like you would.

271
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,540
What's the difference between like a roast when you do a roll?

272
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:21,940
Cabbage roast. I'm sorry. Is it the cauliflower cabbage on my mind went to the cabbage.

273
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:27,840
Sorry. Repeat that broccoli and how to call it broccoli or the cabbage for the cabbage steak.

274
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:31,680
Large head, a large head, twice the size of your fist would be good.

275
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:40,400
OK, so you cut the stem off. By the way, you know how the stems are thick on those types of veggies and the skin is very thick and chewy.

276
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:47,080
Use a peeler and just peel the stems. If the stem is thicker than your smallest finger, peel it.

277
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:50,880
Use a peeler and peel the skin off. And it's just as tender as tender can be.

278
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:59,620
So you don't waste product. By the way, when I buy broccoli or cauliflower by the pound, I break off the stem and I leave it for the grocer.

279
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:03,060
Right. Because it's good. Right. You don't need to buy the stem. You're going to break off anyway. Right.

280
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:06,860
So just to be clear, her her first language is not English.

281
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,640
And she that's fine, partially because of that. But that's the most simple way you could explain that.

282
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:19,840
But she got through the to the food instruction. Now, the thing is, the beginning, the master, the the onion and the carrot stick.

283
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:29,520
If you can get some gobu or burdock root to go with that, then you have what's called a full like Kempira, full balanced, very OK.

284
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:40,660
She didn't mention burdock, but if she can get her hands on some burdock root, B-U-R-D-O-C-K, which is a thistle plant.

285
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:46,040
When you add that to that veggie mix, it's like eating steak. It's like eating meat.

286
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,460
It has the same amount of energy. That's very important.

287
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:56,080
If you can't get the burdock root, get some kind of the next.

288
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:02,320
You can go laterally and use some kind of a radish, like a parsnip with the carrot also.

289
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:06,860
But I would say just have more grain. But the burdock root is essential.

290
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:13,520
And I sent someone an email. They didn't respond. About how burdock root and whole grain we were.

291
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:22,860
We developed on that. And they might think like, you know, from developing, you know, like the uniformitarian model where we did evolve for millions of years and hundreds of thousands of years.

292
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:39,000
That's not what I mean when I say we developed. What I mean by developed is, you know, that between 1950 and 1958, the average height of Korean children was more than two inches, grew more than two inches because they introduced dairy, commercial dairy in South Korea.

293
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:46,620
So just drinking milk, the average height went up one and a half to two inches in eight years of studying this. Right.

294
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,640
Which is very short. So they develop. You see what I mean? Development can be very quick.

295
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:59,420
There's something about the thistle root or the burdock that's essential if you're going to be veggie to incorporate that.

296
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:04,740
And if you read the chat back in the day, I brought up burdock root. People were using it.

297
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:09,940
And they were like, yeah, just like Greek said, it's like eating steak or a good hamburger. You get that kind of energy from it.

298
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:15,860
You won't get that energy from eating other vegetables that I know of. Yeah.

299
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:25,560
And that I know of, actually. No, not at all. You can create that energy in like a ratatouille, which is lots of vegetables sauteed and caramelized.

300
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:36,640
And we'll get into how to do that maybe. But no, the cabbage, the cauliflower and the broccoli, even a big head is fine, depending on people.

301
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:41,840
When I do that here, I call it broccoli steak. I put the whole head of broccoli and that's all we eat.

302
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:46,560
I might do like a sour cream blue cheese dressing or I might do a miso garlic.

303
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:53,620
And you can have that with some fresh baked bread if you do that sort of thing or some beans, lentils.

304
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:58,980
And it's a complete meal. And it's just as satisfying as cutting into a roast. Right.

305
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:04,680
And and I think I explained how I did it. So and she says she's mastered it. So that's good.

306
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:11,320
OK, excellent. So and by the way, just there was a couple of loose comments, which I'll just bundle together here.

307
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:15,160
There's a few people asking if you could do another food episode soon.

308
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:21,460
Yeah, I will. And OK, so on the yin and yang. OK, a couple of bits of feedback here.

309
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,520
These aren't questions, but just want to offer them to you because they're very short.

310
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:33,560
Yin I call discharge and yang is charge. Positive or negative are another way to discuss polarity and duality.

311
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:40,900
This is Patrick said that another yin and yang is yin as will. Yang is yang is power.

312
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:49,100
That's correct. Yeah, those are correct. But do they do they help in the descriptor? I'm not sure.

313
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:59,340
No, no. No, because what happens is I was I woke up this morning and I was barely awake and I had a metaphor running through my head at like 80 miles per hour.

314
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:04,140
And I'll use that for yin and yang. OK, anything else on the yin and yang?

315
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:09,580
And I'll show you what I know. No, no, that was just that was just the specifics on those people.

316
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:22,140
OK, that has feedback. Yeah, that's the most cursory. Even if you get books, the most cursory stuff, the quick things you'll learn about yin and yang is yin is soft, dark, flowing, cold.

317
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,920
And yang is hard, sharp, bright, hard, hot.

318
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:33,920
OK, when you get to a level where you're working it to diagnose things and not just people diagnose any situation.

319
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:41,460
Yeah, you what you'll find out is that the yang protects the yin. It's not polarity anymore.

320
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:48,180
It's it's beyond that. It's not. Even if you listen to that, Uncle Fester guy, what's his name with the tattoos?

321
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:53,060
The monkey guy called is a monkey. I forgot. Oh, Ken Wheeler, the magnet guy.

322
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:58,180
OK, yeah. Whatever he doesn't know about magnets, I know. And whatever I don't know about magnets, he knows.

323
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:02,520
OK, remember that? And that was from War of the Worlds with Tom Cruise.

324
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:05,940
They asked me a question. Oh, my brother knows that one, right? Yeah, fair enough.

325
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:10,540
And between me and my brother, we know everything. So if someone asks you a question you don't know, my brother knows that one, right?

326
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:16,580
So you look flawless, but even he says there's no polarity.

327
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,980
And I agree. That's a that's a very Walter Russell thing. He got stuck on that. It's not bad.

328
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:33,460
But Ying, let's say let's stick with the body. And then I want to use the metaphor of a can of beans in the human body and in the animal body and in the plant kingdom, let's say, and all that.

329
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:42,480
And even to the mineral kingdom and metal, the yin is the nourishment and the yang protects that nourishment.

330
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:47,720
So the let's let's say you have a protein drink as your nourishment, the container, that's yin.

331
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:52,420
And the container that it's in is the yang part of the whole of the whole system.

332
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:58,320
But within the nourishment drink itself, without the yang, there's another yin and yang in there, right?

333
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,820
The salt in the drink itself would be the yang and the water would be the yin.

334
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:08,980
So it keeps going into many directions. So this I want to give a can of beans is in the metaphor.

335
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:14,860
So I woke up thinking about so we'll use a can of beans. It's pretty typical metaphor.

336
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:22,000
So you have a can of beans, a can of beans. So let's it's a metal can use a can opener, right?

337
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,160
With a label paper label on it. The can is yang and all the beans inside are yin.

338
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:34,640
So let's go inside the beans. Now we take the beans out of the can, which are yin.

339
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:38,960
But when they're coming out of the can, that's a very yang motion, right?

340
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:45,960
Now they land in another yang container in a yin way because they spread out when they hit the other container.

341
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:54,040
They land in the bowl, they spread out, but they're kind of like soft, but they have a harder outer shell.

342
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,800
So there you have another level, right? They have a harder outer shell.

343
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,100
Look at the beans and they're preserved with some salt, which is yang.

344
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:07,140
And there's also water, which is yin. Now the bean itself has a skin on it, which is yang.

345
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:10,380
It has the starchy element on the inside, which is yin.

346
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,000
That's what I meant.

347
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:15,820
It also has a sweetness to it, which is yin. And the pithy part is more yang.

348
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,900
And when you get to the center of the bean where there's the kernel, that's yang.

349
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:23,600
But inside the kernel is a very sweet part, which becomes yin.

350
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:27,360
So it's always flipping, yin and yang. It's always flipping, right?

351
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,700
So now let's go to the can.

352
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:37,140
So the can itself, when the beans are dumped out, it becomes yin because it was full before, right?

353
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,040
It was full, now it's empty, so it's yin.

354
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:43,020
The inside of the can is yin, more than it was with the beans in it.

355
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:49,680
Now if we look at the can itself, before it was opened it was all very tight, compact, and hard.

356
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,500
Now that the lid popped open, that was a very yin action.

357
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,980
But to cut the lid is a very yang motion.

358
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,540
Remember yang is sharp and pointy.

359
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:01,160
We need a sharp pointy, right, to cut the can, right?

360
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:06,860
So now the can itself, the surface area of the can is very yin, it's spread out.

361
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,460
And then it goes to the edges which are yang, pointy.

362
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:13,940
There's a label on the can which goes all the way around, which is very yin.

363
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:18,400
But it's very thin paper, which is yang in that dimension.

364
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,980
It's also stuck on with some glue, which is very yin, it goes all the way around.

365
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,820
But that glue is very hard, which makes it yang again.

366
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,440
But it had to be yin to be applied as a liquid, right?

367
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,100
Because you can't apply hot, hard glue.

368
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,000
So you see how the yin and yang is constantly flipping.

369
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,240
As a matter of fact, when you look at the atomic scientists,

370
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,560
they say everything is frequency and oscillation.

371
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,700
You know, like they'll say this is a vibratory,

372
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:48,160
sympathetic vibratory physics, right, John Kealy.

373
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,620
You just demonstrated the oscillation.

374
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,840
That's right, the oscillation is between yin and yang.

375
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,720
So what happens is the oscillation, whether you look at it one way

376
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,820
and then there's these different ways of seeing, like one of the things,

377
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:07,040
when you understand phasing and different types of pulsations

378
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,820
and the way things work, like if you walk into a room

379
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:13,300
and you turn the light switch on and then you turn it off

380
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,860
and you're on and off, on and off, not enough.

381
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,580
But you come in and you go off and on.

382
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,920
It looks, right, so you turning the switch off, on, off, on,

383
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,120
I'm going on, off, on, off, same switch, same motion, but different.

384
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,320
But it's the same. No, it's not.

385
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,320
Because, OK, pulse width modulation, when you get into

386
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,940
certain electronic theories with imaginary numbers,

387
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,420
that takes into account.

388
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,280
So the direction of things are always switching between

389
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,060
yin and yang, yin and yang, yin and yang, and building on each other.

390
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:48,720
That's the vibratory resonance of atomic things, you know.

391
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,240
So once you understand this, for example,

392
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,740
you can get more into transmutation.

393
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,480
Like, for example, hydrogen would be the most yang element

394
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,120
and then going down to the radioactive ones is the most yin.

395
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:04,540
So if someone is very yin, you would want them to take hydrogen,

396
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:08,260
which is what this guy with Eagle Research, I forgot his name,

397
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,120
he's been telling people to breathe that.

398
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:12,280
That's good, but he's not really breathing hydrogen.

399
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:16,739
But the idea is there when you bubble from an electrolytic cell.

400
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,480
So, you know, when you see people walking around,

401
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,639
old people with those oxygen tanks, that creates,

402
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,420
they all die of pneumonia, by the way.

403
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:27,960
If you stay on that oxygen tank, you know, the thing they carry around,

404
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,320
you're going to die, I tell people, you're going to die of pneumonia.

405
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,719
And I have people that I've known who knew someone,

406
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:36,860
oh, she saw that oxygen and goes, no, I said she died of pneumonia, right?

407
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,940
Yeah, how do you know? I mean, everybody dies of pneumonia.

408
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:43,360
Yeah, it's either that or they call it COPD, but it ends up...

409
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:45,199
Yeah, that's the banker's terms.

410
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,340
So you should be doing hydrogen.

411
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,080
But anyway, the body can turn it into whatever it wants.

412
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:56,460
So the yin and yang again, and I brought up hydrogen because it's the most yang,

413
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:59,660
and everything down from that starts to become yin.

414
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:04,340
But as you're moving down the chain, how does it become more yin, right?

415
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:07,560
You need to apply yang to it, right?

416
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,640
So this yin and yang thing is a constant flipping.

417
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,860
Like we got into a little bit with the food before.

418
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:19,440
When you take sweets into the body, oils, sugars, things like that,

419
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,360
when the body induces them into the bloodstream,

420
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:26,580
the energy of those things tends to go to the upper part of the body,

421
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:30,780
right or left depending on if it's moving up or moving down.

422
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:38,100
When you take salts, minerals, and animal, that goes to the lower part of the body.

423
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:41,100
When I say lower, meaning the navel's down, right?

424
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,760
The center is the navel, so it goes down.

425
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,200
So when you hear about people having gout,

426
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:50,820
you hear people about having, what are all those diseases near reproductive organs

427
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:54,240
and all that stuff below the navel, all these organs, colon and all that,

428
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:57,480
that's animal and salt, and bad salts like that,

429
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:02,100
you know, the toxic salts that they use from industry in your food and all that,

430
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:06,380
and animal products that have been steroided and antibiotics and all that,

431
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,420
or too much unbalanced animal.

432
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,100
I was just watching someone have a steak dinner, and how unbalanced it is.

433
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:17,380
They have a steak dinner that the steak is broiled in butter, which is fat,

434
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,900
and for a side dish they have creamed spinach,

435
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,860
which is basically butter and fat and cheese in there,

436
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,920
and they have bread and butter, which is again fat.

437
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,500
There's nothing there to balance the fat.

438
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,240
It's fat and fat and fat and fat.

439
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,920
If you go to an Asian country, for example,

440
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:37,220
and again, this sounds like I'm modifying an Asian culture or diet.

441
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:37,600
I'm not.

442
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:43,460
But if you go to, I mean, I might sound like I am, but disqualify the thought.

443
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,800
If you have a bowl of like a beef broth or beef stew in an Asian country,

444
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,240
you also have daikon, which is a radish.

445
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,140
What does that radish do? It cuts the fat.

446
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,500
You have some type of horseradish, cuts the fat.

447
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,780
Some type of a soy sauce or acid that cuts the fat.

448
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,880
If you go to, for example, to a Greek country,

449
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,500
a Greek country, there's only one Greek country, right?

450
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:05,820
Okay.

451
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:12,320
But Middle Eastern, when you have a roast of meat, fatty meat,

452
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,980
what do they serve with it? Lemon.

453
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,120
What does lemon do? Cuts the fat.

454
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,920
It's another acid to cut the fat, yeah, yeah.

455
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,040
Yeah, and other things that cut the fat.

456
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:23,500
You're going to have greens that are steamed greens with olive oil,

457
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,320
which cuts the fat.

458
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,180
By the way, olive oil cuts fat because of its acidity also,

459
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,860
not more than just the acidity.

460
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:32,120
So the American diet is completely out of balance

461
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,060
because you're sitting with a meal that's fat balanced with fat,

462
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,760
balanced with fat. It's not balanced.

463
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,820
So when you have fat, you have something that cuts the fat

464
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,720
and then back and forth.

465
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,260
Okay, let's just finish off this way,

466
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,760
how horrifying it is when you understand this.

467
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,280
You're going to get a hamburger with cheese and mayonnaise

468
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,040
and all that other fatty stuff, hamburger, cheeseburger, right?

469
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,880
And you're going to have that with – it's fatty.

470
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,320
And then you're going to have that with French fries.

471
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,280
And you're going to have that with a milkshake.

472
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,900
More fat and even fattier.

473
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,620
There's more fat in the milkshake than there is in the French fries.

474
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,120
Now, people that are addicted to fried foods, you know what I used to do?

475
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,060
You know the old orange presses?

476
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,860
There's a die-cast metal.

477
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,120
You've got a lot of leverage, the ones that have like a foot-long lever.

478
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,060
They use that orange whatever.

479
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,680
I used to put a donut in there or go get some McDonald's fries.

480
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,860
And you press it down. You get a teaspoon of oil.

481
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,100
You smell that.

482
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,020
Absolutely.

483
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,640
Yeah, yeah.

484
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:35,360
So that kind of stuff I would get people to – addicted to donuts and all that stuff.

485
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,720
So that's what the yin and yang balance is.

486
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:44,080
So when you see a society like the American society, the way they eat –

487
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,600
now the British to some extent are very similar.

488
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,540
That's why you'll never – you might see American restaurants because it's fat.

489
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,300
You'll never see a British restaurant.

490
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,920
Never, ever, ever, ever, ever anywhere.

491
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,540
Even in England they don't – they have pubs that serve their food,

492
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:03,400
but the most popular food in England is an Indian.

493
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:06,240
I think the national dish is chicken tiki marsala, right?

494
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,060
Something like that, yeah.

495
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:10,080
So yeah, I can have an Indian.

496
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,860
I can just mad at one right now.

497
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:17,360
So anyway, balance is the yin and yang.

498
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:21,740
And when you have the full-fat meal, like I mentioned,

499
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:25,780
the steak with the cream spinach and the butter and this and that,

500
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,980
there's still yin and yang within each one,

501
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,480
but it's all going in one direction against you, right?

502
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:39,860
So you can predict – you can make predictions about outcomes

503
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,500
by understanding the yin and yang.

504
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,080
When there's no – it doesn't mean when there's balance

505
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:49,480
you won't have a degrading situation because that's how the art of war works, right?

506
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,280
The art of war, like one of the biggest things in the art of war

507
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:59,760
is when you have the ability to completely surround your enemy with four corners,

508
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,300
you always give one of the corners – you gild it with gold for them to leave.

509
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:04,780
Yeah.

510
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,100
Right?

511
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,340
You give them a way out.

512
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:13,480
And not only – you gild it with gold so they enjoy it, leaving.

513
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:17,520
That's what the Germans did in Dunkirk and the Americans and the British

514
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,980
because Hitler said these are Aryans, let's let them go.

515
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:25,560
They let 100,000 troops get away, and the Americans don't know that.

516
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,320
Gave them an escape route.

517
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:28,800
Yeah, yeah.

518
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,960
So that's yin and yang also to be in balance.

519
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:36,800
So it works in every combination of things,

520
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:41,240
but it doesn't mean you won't have degradation because that's still –

521
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,760
but you'll be in more control.

522
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,500
Fair enough.

523
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,980
All right, so moving on.

524
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,620
This one is, again, a different area.

525
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:54,180
And let's see, Franklin, thanks for the back catalog.

526
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,400
Okay, a question about the economy.

527
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,720
If we exist in a credit-based economy, i.e. your signature is your money,

528
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,080
but the people don't know this,

529
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:08,860
why are they changing to the blockchain tracking technology, question mark?

530
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,180
Distraction.

531
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,780
Well, there's a follow-on to this.

532
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:18,080
Is a higher force involved in making the economy more lawful, question mark?

533
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,080
He somehow thinks that blockchain is more lawful

534
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:24,120
because Greek had mentioned that this time, quote, they, end quote,

535
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:27,680
are allowing more, quote, people to live, end quote,

536
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,400
instead of being wiped out like Canaan, question mark.

537
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,840
So I'm wondering if this is the method,

538
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:37,500
is a way to correct or corral the people as a whole.

539
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,240
Yeah, I don't think it's going to work.

540
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:43,160
Weren't there others like the BRICS thing?

541
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:43,860
Yeah.

542
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,300
That was supposed to take over.

543
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,900
There was all these other things.

544
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,080
That was the opposition to the American hegemony

545
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,160
where we're using the dollar, the oil, you know, the petrodollar.

546
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,760
Yeah, that's not, it's because there is no,

547
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,620
Americans don't have a currency, which is not money.

548
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,800
What people should focus on and watch, these are all distractions,

549
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:06,440
is that the U.S. government and every government in the world

550
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,460
lost their own countries in a card game, literally,

551
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,560
in a card game with the bankers, and they didn't tell the people.

552
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,500
So what they did was they structured the laws

553
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,460
that if anybody needs anything or falls into a debt,

554
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,360
the government will satisfy that debt.

555
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,280
That's what's called full faith and credit.

556
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,720
And you're given a social security number, that's your,

557
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:28,360
but they never tell you how to access it properly.

558
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,780
Now, you can do it through a 1099-A.

559
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:34,040
I've seen where there's been a forensic audit

560
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:37,380
and someone bought a house, and this is through Rod Klassen,

561
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,180
this guy named Raja, who was an accountant,

562
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,500
and his, it was a $400,000 mortgage,

563
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,900
but they got the money through his trust fund

564
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:49,440
with a 1099-A using the social security number, right?

565
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,380
And they kept doing it.

566
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,520
Every year they pulled $400,000 up because the government won't say no.

567
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,100
You know, there's no government, but, you know, that's the,

568
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:00,920
they create it out of thin air based on your full faith and credit.

569
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,080
So once your full faith and credit goes down,

570
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:05,080
it goes towards a blockchain,

571
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:09,520
that's going to take a pressure off of people

572
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,840
demanding what I just said,

573
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:13,900
going and using the social security number as a credit card.

574
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:17,560
By the way, if you, you know how there's a thing about,

575
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,320
oh, the Nazis were so, you know, Nazis were so bad,

576
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:22,660
they tattooed the numbers on the people's arms?

577
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,340
That was a fashion in the time.

578
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:29,040
If you go on an internet search, by the way,

579
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:33,520
social security numbers tattooed on people's arms,

580
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:37,500
I think one of the sites would be the New York Historical Society.

581
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,260
And it tells you there,

582
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:42,940
all the tattoo shops were offering that, right?

583
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:47,340
To put your number so you never lose it on your arm, on your forearm.

584
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:51,260
Right? So this was a very common and popular thing

585
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:52,620
because back in those days,

586
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,420
the soup kitchens were not just soup kitchens.

587
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:59,720
Just like, for example, today they have these gospel rescue

588
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,120
or something, people that are homeless,

589
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,120
you go into town and they take care of you.

590
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,080
It's like a soup kitchen, they give you a cot.

591
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,660
They won't take you unless you have a social security number

592
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:10,820
and a birth certificate and all that because they're tapping, right?

593
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,320
Same if you spend the night in jail,

594
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,240
they have to get a social security number from you

595
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,880
because they get $700 per person per day from your,

596
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,800
you know, it could be more like $3,700.

597
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,060
Whatever it is, they're going to get it, right?

598
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:28,380
So everyone is using that except for you.

599
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,860
And the people are finding out that it exists.

600
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:35,500
There's people buying cars with 1099As and all, it takes 45 days.

601
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,260
But anyway, people that are using it.

602
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:41,280
So when you start changing people's opinion or,

603
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,680
I mean, not even opinion, opinion actually, yeah,

604
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,860
because they have no knowledge about it.

605
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:48,260
Opinion means decision or judgment with no knowledge.

606
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,300
And when you change their focus to something,

607
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,500
oh, let's get Bitcoin, all this other stuff,

608
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:56,720
which is an intelligence agency operation,

609
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:04,740
100% is going to alleviate some of that trust.

610
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:09,760
But yeah, that's why these things don't go anywhere.

611
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,120
They're what's called, when it's not mainstream,

612
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,280
what's it called? Help me here.

613
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,980
Fringe or something. Alternative or fringe.

614
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:21,060
It's always going to be fringe. It's always going to be alternative.

615
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:26,840
They're going to have a very hard time going 100% digital and everything

616
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,900
for the very fact that there's still too many people

617
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:32,380
betting and shooting pool.

618
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,280
And there's something called the Mexican drug cartel.

619
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:38,180
They're not going to use digital currency.

620
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:40,880
You know, have you ever seen pictures online where pallets

621
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,360
have pallets of $100 bills in these mansions in Mexico?

622
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,600
Pallets, right? A billion dollars.

623
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:50,180
They have figured out ways to corral the digital currency now, though.

624
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,840
That's starting to happen.

625
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,320
To be seen. To be seen. I doubt it.

626
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:59,000
I wouldn't say no and have egg on my face, but I don't see it.

627
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,820
I don't see it. Not ever happening.

628
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:05,960
I think when you get into the point where Breshears of Archaics

629
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:09,920
talks about the dark satellite where these beings disembark

630
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,920
and liberty is taken from the earth.

631
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:15,860
They can install a system like that because anyone who doesn't go with it

632
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:16,720
will be eliminated.

633
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:21,240
Yeah, but somebody already figured out how to corral a lot of that stuff.

634
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:24,340
If you have, look, all you got to do is have an authorization number to collect

635
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:28,320
and you can collect things and it looks like it's nothing.

636
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,920
You know, that's why they started up all these things

637
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:33,840
like where they were saying, hey, look, you can just take care of little debts

638
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,680
between you and your friends with this or that.

639
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:40,020
So they created these other little things that are almost like debit cards.

640
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:42,180
Well, PayPal. PayPal will do that.

641
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:42,740
Like PayPal.

642
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:47,780
But more. They got more stuff so that you have a card also.

643
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,980
And it's meant directly to exchange

644
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:52,940
just between people.

645
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:55,680
Like, OK, you guys decide to go out to dinner or whatever.

646
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,340
He pays for the whole thing. You can pay him back with this.

647
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:01,700
So it's more of a loose thing where you're exchanging with your friends.

648
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:05,180
They would have to be very loose. And you also have no regulation.

649
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,860
And because, you know, the more regulation

650
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:11,100
the so-called government puts on, the more the black market grows.

651
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:14,360
The less regulation, the more the black market goes away.

652
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:15,960
That's the thing they've been fighting over.

653
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:18,060
You've heard about this where they're fighting over the regulation.

654
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:21,020
OK, if you make over if this amount goes through an account,

655
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:23,360
then you're then they're supposed to report it.

656
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,840
That business is supposed to report it and so on and so forth.

657
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,140
Some of them are resisting it.

658
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:31,280
That's because you're doing blank endorsements.

659
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:36,520
If everything you do writes lawful money only, 12 U.S.C. 411.

660
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,220
And you could also use it in other countries and argue it

661
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:41,580
because of what's called reciprocation.

662
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:43,520
Because it's money.

663
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:47,100
In other words, if you go to E.U.

664
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:50,260
and you have, let's say, a Georgia state of Georgia driver's license,

665
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,140
it's usually honored.

666
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:54,520
But they give you a residency of like 30 days.

667
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:57,120
They don't make you go get an E.U. driver's license.

668
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,300
They'll say, OK, it's reciprocated.

669
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:01,080
The passport is reciprocated.

670
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,340
So you can, by the laws of reciprocation,

671
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:08,800
and also that I found in about 12 countries

672
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,340
they have laws where you're allowed to make a conditional endorsement.

673
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,320
So when you do a conditional endorsement

674
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,780
and it's over $10,000,

675
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:20,020
it doesn't apply.

676
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:24,580
I would be confident with a million dollars in cash

677
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,820
going through the airport.

678
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,140
They're going to want to take it.

679
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,480
I'm like, all these serial numbers are recorded

680
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,060
and they're making a demand for lawful money.

681
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:32,980
Yeah, they'll laugh.

682
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:36,260
But once their superiors get a hold of that,

683
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,980
I said call the A.G. or Secretary of State.

684
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:41,000
They're going to say, oh shit, we've got to let them go.

685
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,480
They don't know. The people are savages.

686
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:46,460
I think I once got into a Skype.

687
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:49,940
Myself and one guy were going to go down at the border.

688
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,840
Homeland Security seizes stuff like speedboats and cash

689
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:55,600
and they have to post it before they auction it off at the Treasury.

690
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,320
So we went down there.

691
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:59,820
Actually, I didn't, but I was part of it.

692
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:02,340
And we called Homeland Security and Attorney General down there

693
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:05,520
and I said, I want to come down and I want to see the stash of cash,

694
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,420
all the cash you have. Why?

695
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:11,440
Because I want to record all the serial numbers on there and claim it.

696
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:13,520
And they were like, no, you can't do that.

697
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,260
I said, of course I can. Under law, I can do it.

698
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:16,680
Because you say it's abandoned, right?

699
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:20,120
Just like, for example, the reason they post it for 30 days is it was a claim.

700
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,880
And they say, well, you're not doing anything illegal.

701
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,180
We're just not going to let you do it.

702
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:27,660
There's the problem, because if it's been abandoned,

703
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:29,600
then it is legally open for you to do that.

704
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:33,160
I can't go claim the cash, but if I take all the serial numbers

705
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:36,980
and do a conditional endorsement and make a ledger to the Treasury,

706
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:38,020
those are my notes.

707
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:38,720
Those are yours.

708
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:44,300
And it's so funny to watch how it's not the government, it's the people.

709
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:47,480
When people say the government does this, you know who really fucked you up?

710
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:51,920
Your parents. Your parents are the ones who went and filed and made you do all this stuff.

711
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:55,340
They're the ones that report you first when you're born.

712
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:58,080
That's what they do. They report you as an informant.

713
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,300
And that's your mother, is your informant.

714
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,380
So it's your parents.

715
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:08,020
And by the way, if you are a government or a propaganda machine that runs the government,

716
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:11,100
you don't go after the people, you go after the parents.

717
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,480
Because if you get the parents, you get the rest of them that are in that unit.

718
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:16,480
You see how it works?

719
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,620
So yeah, it's your parents that screwed you up, not the government.

720
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,920
And no one put a gun to their head.

721
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,580
They think it's an imaginary one.

722
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:29,520
But that's why people, you know, sometimes they'd be on private calls

723
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,920
where people are all mad at this political situation.

724
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:35,100
I said, so which one was the bigger asshole, your mom or your dad?

725
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,640
And they're like, excuse me?

726
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:39,080
It's not the government, it's your parents.

727
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,320
They got you in this.

728
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:45,040
So anyway, Jimmy should wear a hat next time.

729
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,860
That's funny.

730
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:49,920
They thought that they were doing exactly what they had to do.

731
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:55,440
But they were actually volunteering a bunch of things before you could even see.

732
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:00,580
Anyway, there was a few other comments that I'll just bundle together again.

733
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:06,440
Because apparently you mentioned something about doing a seminar on water on Skype or something.

734
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:08,040
Weather, weather.

735
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:09,600
Well, they said water.

736
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:13,780
Water is not necessary, but we could do that.

737
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:18,680
It's not necessary, meaning that could be bundled up, like you said, in 10 minutes within another seminar.

738
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:20,120
But I was thinking of weather.

739
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:23,780
Well, weather was another thing.

740
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:25,540
I think that was brought up in chat.

741
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:33,020
But this is from a separate contact I have where a couple of people had asked about doing a water Skype.

742
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:34,500
And they thought you would do that.

743
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:35,220
You had mentioned it.

744
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:36,700
Yeah, simple.

745
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:37,440
That's real simple.

746
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:39,860
I've got that since the Scalarator was developed.

747
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:43,540
I've got that even so short.

748
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:48,400
You could charge $50,000 for a water seminar that's 20 minutes.

749
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,360
And you'll walk out of 20 minutes.

750
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,440
And was it worth it?

751
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,460
And you'll say, yeah, it was worth the 50 grand.

752
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:56,780
I mean, that's how simple and how pertinent it is.

753
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:59,020
We could do that with any seminar.

754
00:51:59,820 --> 00:51:59,920
Well, sure.

755
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:03,960
But there's a lady that's a newcomer on the chat.

756
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,460
I think I've spoken with her before.

757
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:09,060
And very pleasant.

758
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:12,340
And she's interested in the weather stuff.

759
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:22,120
And what I want to do is put out now, if you have the email for the Greek, UncommonSenseRadio1 at Gmail.com, the numeric one.

760
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:27,620
Send me an email as a request that you want to do the weather seminar.

761
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:30,040
But also give me a short blurb why you want to do it.

762
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:36,040
Because when people – even if it's any seminar from now on, it's like, why do you want to come to this seminar?

763
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:38,500
Just in a few words, tell me.

764
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,360
I like it when people say, in your words.

765
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,680
Well, if you're not going to use your words, whose words are you using, right?

766
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:46,820
But anyway, in a few words, why you want to come to the weather seminar.

767
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:47,440
And be frank.

768
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:48,980
Because that lets me structure.

769
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:54,520
Like if – let's say I have 20 people come and half of them have the same reason.

770
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:56,540
Well, now I know what to focus on, right?

771
00:52:57,100 --> 00:53:01,400
And you could say, because I'm mad as hell and I want to start taking cities out with hurricanes.

772
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:02,040
That's fine.

773
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,160
That's fine.

774
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:03,640
Come on.

775
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,220
I just want to know why.

776
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:07,500
Give me a short reason why.

777
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:13,980
Because that allows the narrative to be steered in the direction to satisfy the desire, right?

778
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:14,880
Hey, look.

779
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:20,020
You can make it more applicable to what people want considering what it is they're looking to do.

780
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,420
I think that's fairly logical.

781
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:23,240
OK.

782
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,240
So that was in there.

783
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:30,680
And just for the record here, I have pointed a few people to the Chatango that didn't know about that.

784
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:38,080
But also if you're on the Patreon, there's that separate chat there, which you guys are using to chat back and forth.

785
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,720
But it was meant to be an announcement board.

786
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,180
I don't care.

787
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:42,780
You guys are communicating with it.

788
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:43,460
You're using it.

789
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:44,800
I put it out there for you to use.

790
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:45,280
It's fine.

791
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:47,960
And you can post –

792
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,040
You mean you don't mind?

793
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:49,500
Yeah.

794
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:51,740
I don't mind what you use it for.

795
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:52,460
It's fine.

796
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:56,940
Because you're communicating a bunch of things and obviously paying attention and listening.

797
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:58,920
So this is good by me.

798
00:53:59,500 --> 00:53:59,900
Anyway.

799
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:04,260
There's a lot of stuff that I can get into, but I'm afraid –

800
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:05,360
See, I have to get feedback.

801
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:06,540
I'm always asking for feedback.

802
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:12,980
I'm afraid that it's going to get a little technical because I'm working on several counter-space projects, which is anti-space.

803
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,560
Yeah, it's anti-space versus space, which –

804
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:19,160
Space doesn't exist, so how can you go to anti-space?

805
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:22,400
But yeah, and it's very simple.

806
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:27,280
But I have to – I don't know the terminology, what terminology to use because it doesn't exist,

807
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,500
and how this can be applied to many things.

808
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,660
And, of course, there's the water, the food, and the weather.

809
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:32,220
Right.

810
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:35,220
And the health things for DIY.

811
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:41,940
The first DIY probably you put out a DIY vasectomy kit, and you get to keep all your parts.

812
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:43,020
Okay.

813
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,440
But anyway.

814
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:44,860
Yeah.

815
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:50,520
But anyway, a lot of these people are catching up because they're new, and they're back on Sonic 20.

816
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:53,040
They're back on Sonic 30, and they're listening to them in order.

817
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,400
So they're coming up with different things.

818
00:54:55,400 --> 00:55:00,020
That's why we're hearing about the food, which was many Sonics ago and stuff like that.

819
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:03,200
But anyway, this one's a little more complex, but I'm going to cherry-pick from it a bit.

820
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:08,700
And this is from Shadow, and you need to cut it down.

821
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:12,000
I would appreciate it if you're a little more concise when you want to ask –

822
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:12,640
Well, you can just keep it anonymous.

823
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:14,080
You don't have to give names either.

824
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:18,400
Well, yeah, but I want to be specific to tell a guy to cut it back because he's doing this publicly anyway,

825
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:20,700
like as far as the other listeners can see this too.

826
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:22,960
So that's why I'm doing it.

827
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,800
Is this the really long?

828
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:25,220
Yes.

829
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,160
So what's the gist?

830
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:28,960
If you've read it, what would be the cliff notes?

831
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:29,760
I'm going to it.

832
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:34,900
Now the topic, which distinguishes –

833
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:40,540
I'm fascinated by the complex scientific and philosophical topics, okay?

834
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:42,720
He says it in certain places here.

835
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:46,260
He also wants to know, let's see, in the banking, all right?

836
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,040
Interesting.

837
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,240
Okay, the intersection of law and finance, okay?

838
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:57,760
You'd love to hear an episode dedicated to the concept of legal fictions in banking.

839
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,060
All right, stop right there.

840
00:55:59,220 --> 00:55:59,460
Yes.

841
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:01,480
Finance is not lawful.

842
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:04,180
It never is because in law you have money.

843
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,940
Finance is not law.

844
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:10,660
If finance is legal, it's all contracts.

845
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,720
So let me just – this is very important.

846
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:17,980
That's why you hear me say – let's say someone wants to send me quote-unquote money.

847
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:19,280
I said, all right, send the credits here.

848
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,280
You never say send me money.

849
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:23,680
Actually, there have been people who have sent me silver and gold.

850
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:24,140
Yes.

851
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,560
And thank you for them, right?

852
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:30,740
But I would say that finance is never lawful.

853
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:34,160
It's private and it's contractually legal.

854
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:36,960
In law, you have the right to make contract.

855
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:38,340
In law, it's actually a contract.

856
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,200
You go to the Bible.

857
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:41,700
You see if you do these things, you'll be my people.

858
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:44,700
And if you say you do them and you don't do them, this is what's going to happen to you.

859
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,320
It's all by contract.

860
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:49,780
But what I'm trying to say here is finance is never lawful.

861
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:52,320
It's always legal and it's always private.

862
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,160
Here's the thing that people don't understand.

863
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:58,940
They've been brainwashed by like SEC and IRS and all these regulations and all that.

864
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:03,980
Any financial system or agency can ask you for finances.

865
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,260
You could tell them to F off.

866
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:08,460
But people never do because they have accountants and attorneys.

867
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:09,460
Oh, you have to give it to them.

868
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:10,540
No, you don't.

869
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:11,340
It's all private.

870
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:18,420
It's all you have statutory and constitutional rights to your papers, right?

871
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:21,260
And not to quarter troops, you know, and all that stuff.

872
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:22,760
But there's also statutes.

873
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:23,800
All of it is private.

874
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:26,100
Yeah.

875
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,860
And you know how they get away with it?

876
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:34,380
For example, when people were fighting mortgages and, you know, you have to show that you have the note to have a claim.

877
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:37,320
And they were just telling, just say you lost the note.

878
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:38,040
That's good enough.

879
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:41,380
You can't bring it to tell the bank, oh, we lost the note.

880
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,440
So you just tell them, you know, anybody wants financial, we lost it.

881
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:45,460
We lost it.

882
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,400
You don't have to say how.

883
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,680
And that's another way of saying it's private.

884
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:50,040
But they don't say that.

885
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:51,000
Right.

886
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:53,580
So none of it is lawful because it's not money.

887
00:57:54,440 --> 00:58:01,020
So the way you do you stay in law is by demanding lawful money or conditional endorsement.

888
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:07,880
And the best place to go for that is there's a YouTube channel, Lawful Money Trust, David Merrill.

889
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:12,280
And David Merrill's YouTube 1913 Federal Reserve Remedy.

890
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,720
I think we posted that once before.

891
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:21,020
If you 1913 Federal Reserve Remedy, David Merrill, double R double L Merrill.

892
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:25,480
And he gives a 20 minute recitation that's on a PhD level.

893
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:28,260
But could understand if you have an eighth grade, you could understand it.

894
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:28,780
Education.

895
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:32,540
So he's the only one that's purporting this.

896
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:36,440
I have seen it by others, but he's the one that's put it together really well.

897
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:37,120
It's very tight.

898
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:38,840
And I heard he's doing really well.

899
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:43,240
He's got over 200 people at 5000 bucks each per year.

900
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,060
So do the math.

901
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:48,160
Finally, you know, he's doing well with it.

902
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:48,580
Absolutely.

903
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:54,240
But as a subscription thing to, you know, for building trusts and consulting and all that.

904
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:55,240
Yeah.

905
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:58,760
So basically, OK, continue.

906
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:00,720
But finance and law do not go together.

907
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,740
It's a private legal contract.

908
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:03,160
Right.

909
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:07,560
Now, this is the reason why I'm presenting these questions as a written, because this helps you take it and go.

910
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:08,940
No, wait, I got to split it apart.

911
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,360
I'm doing that on purpose, guys.

912
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:13,840
That's fine, because the thing is, I'm spending on it.

913
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:14,140
Yes.

914
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:15,220
To help others.

915
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:15,860
Exactly.

916
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:20,180
But that's why I'm posing these questions that immediately he's cutting apart.

917
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:21,900
OK, because that's the purpose of this.

918
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:22,700
OK.

919
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:27,420
Last part of this that I think is relevant is and I want you to let me finish this statement.

920
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:29,800
OK, because it's going to it's going to twist a little bit on you.

921
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:30,440
Probably.

922
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:33,880
I want a sonic that basically wants a sonic.

923
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:35,220
I'm not telling you how this is written.

924
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:48,980
How the law distinguishes between corporate entities and private individuals in the banking sector seems to align well with your series on legal complexities in modern economies.

925
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:50,840
That's how he worded it.

926
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,400
OK, that's fine.

927
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:53,860
But I get what he's trying to say.

928
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:54,360
Yes.

929
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,220
The whole system of finance, which we're in right now.

930
00:59:59,360 --> 00:59:59,540
OK.

931
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:04,160
The last time there was any law with this was watching a cowboy movie.

932
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:06,140
And they say, I got a score to settle.

933
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:11,960
When you hear a score to settle, score is 20 and 20 is what's written on a gold piece.

934
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:12,600
Gold piece.

935
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:13,040
OK.

936
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,720
Anything after that is financing.

937
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,640
That's all you're going to hear in law about settling a score.

938
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:22,300
So so everything else, their fiction, everything they do is a fiction.

939
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:27,180
If you put in legal fiction, even Wikipedia or whatever will tell you everything in legal is a fiction.

940
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:28,340
It's all presumption.

941
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:38,060
OK, so when you're dealing with legal fiction in the post 1930s era, which we're in post 1930s, they're not talking to you.

942
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:46,480
They're talking to the trust because they know that, you know, they know that you don't know that you have infinite access to money.

943
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:51,060
Everyone does. Everyone's a millionaire, you could say, or a billionaire or whatever.

944
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:54,020
There's no limit. But they know that you don't know that.

945
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:59,080
Right. So it's like, how do you let's say, you know, this is what's going on.

946
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:07,700
Give a metaphor. You there's a rumor that the house across the street in the backyard where the old lady lives, there is a bunch of gold bars buried in there.

947
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,380
And, you know, you know it for sure. Right.

948
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:14,860
Your friend has access to the satellite and they did ground penetrating radar.

949
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:17,920
And they just you want to get to it for the government does. Right.

950
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:20,420
The old lady dies and the house is sold.

951
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:25,820
You didn't make it while the house lady died. You didn't get back in there to dig the gold bars out.

952
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:28,180
Well, no one was there. Now the new people moved in.

953
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:34,600
So what do you do? You go to the new people and say, hey, there's a hundred million in gold bars in your backyard.

954
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:37,820
Let me dig it out and split it. They'll say, screw you.

955
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:41,100
It's my backyard. Right. Thanks for telling me. Screw yourself. Right.

956
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:45,020
Whatever. Yep. Or you see. Or do you want to go take it all yourself?

957
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:48,820
That's what's going on with these social security number. Right.

958
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:58,740
So everything in finance is they know. But here, let's say a credit card company or a bank or a government agency, their co-franchise boards is asking you for money.

959
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:03,240
We're using the slave term. It's not money finances or to settle something.

960
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:07,600
Yes. The people that are calling you, even attorneys don't know what I just said.

961
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:14,960
They don't know it because especially since 9-11, it's very important that anyone that deals with the public doesn't know anything at all.

962
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:23,000
Right. Even if you go to a government, if you go even I've heard even the vice counselors in embassies are dumber than rocks.

963
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:26,280
They don't know anything at all. They're like so dumb. It's scary.

964
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:30,240
No one knows anything since 9-11. It's been over 23 years.

965
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:39,340
They have plenty of time to filter out. If you want to get a government job or something like that and you know anything about government or law or anything, you will not get hired at all.

966
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:45,920
At all. You will never, never approach the place. So when you're getting the same with debt collectors, they don't know anything.

967
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:53,900
So you're going to have to address the CEO of the company if you're going to start doing correspondence or litigation.

968
01:02:53,900 --> 01:03:01,840
So if you have a problem, let's say with Amex, like Brandon Joe Williams is dealing with that, everything you sent to American Express is to the CEO.

969
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:07,260
Find out who it is. That's public information. Right. If you're dealing with the city, you go to the city manager.

970
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:11,580
If it's the state, you go to the comptroller of currency or the governor. That's all you address.

971
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:14,280
And they're not going to open it. They're going to kick it to the side.

972
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:17,960
So, you know, then you go get into what's called conditional acceptances.

973
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:23,380
There's a bunch of stuff of conditional acceptances online. They're all very lengthy and complicated.

974
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:31,360
I have a way of doing in just one paragraph. No, do not ask me how to write you one or two paragraphs.

975
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:35,480
But if you listen to enough of the sonics, you'll be able to get to the point.

976
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:40,080
Just like the calories and the vaccines. Right. You got to make it short to the point.

977
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:48,300
And no wiggle room at all. Remember, unlike Sun Tzu, where you give the enemy, you surround them on three sides.

978
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:52,500
You give them one side to leave. In fiction, you don't have to. You can surround them completely.

979
01:03:52,500 --> 01:04:00,420
In fiction, you want to completely devastate them. You want to surround them on four sides, suffocate them and burn them completely.

980
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:05,220
Because it's fiction, just like in a video game. Right. In a video game.

981
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:10,180
Are you like, oh, I'm going to let these things go right here or are you just going to annihilate everything in the video game?

982
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:15,560
Right. That's the thing about fiction. Take full advantage. You know, I watched it.

983
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:18,920
You know, they go in against an unarmed, you know, an unarmed NPC.

984
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:22,900
They go in there with a with a Gatling gun and shred the thing, even though it's got nothing.

985
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:27,100
It doesn't matter because it's fictional. Yeah. You always devastate 100 percent.

986
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:31,940
That's why it was very important to bring up the art of noise, the art of war earlier.

987
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:35,240
And in real life, you give a way out. But in fiction, you don't.

988
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:37,640
The art of noise was interesting, though. Go ahead. Sorry.

989
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:44,540
Yeah, I've been using that actually developing loudspeakers and I'm using the piano piece in Diversion One.

990
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:50,860
It's one of the greatest piano recordings ever, I think. Sure, it's only about 30 seconds, but that's all I need.

991
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:54,020
So, oh, by the way, if anyone's interested in some super high end loudspeakers,

992
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:58,100
I have a small loudspeakers like nine inches by 10 inches by 10 inches.

993
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:03,040
And it goes down to 25 cycles, extremely fast impulse response.

994
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:07,180
So it sounds like speakers that are as tall as you are and they fit under your arm.

995
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:17,180
So dynamics, it's breaking every law of physics with it because I developed them using what's called steady state physics,

996
01:05:17,820 --> 01:05:21,100
not the physics that are currently being used. That's very neat.

997
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:26,020
Anyway, though, because the majority of people, it seems to me, no longer have stereos or anything.

998
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:29,200
That's like an audio device in their house to like just listen to music.

999
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:33,380
You notice that I would be geared more towards the audio house.

1000
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:37,380
Towards the audio house, like the people who buy.

1001
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:41,160
You cut out there for a second. You're back.

1002
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:43,220
Yeah.

1003
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:45,100
Okay, you cut out for a second. Sorry.

1004
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:48,900
My clients would be people who buy, you know, 200.

1005
01:05:50,900 --> 01:06:01,540
My clients would be people who buy like Fazioli pianos for 200,000 or Ferraris for 400,000 or just someone who's interested in reproducing music in a lively way.

1006
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:02,800
It sounds like real life.

1007
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:08,280
But it used to be very common. Like almost everybody had a stereo and a stereo system in their house and a portable stereo.

1008
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:11,380
And those things are not commonplace anymore.

1009
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:14,240
Then there was the home theater and then everything's gone away now.

1010
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:18,480
Yeah, pretty much. Like nobody has any of that stuff. Everything's on a phone or a device and that's it.

1011
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:20,540
It's on a rectangle of some kind and that's it.

1012
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:23,760
And they don't actually have a sound device in their house. You know what I mean?

1013
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:26,120
It's just not one of those things. They don't carry nothing.

1014
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:32,960
Yeah, but what I'm bringing up is I'm going against physics completely and proving it that the physics is wrong.

1015
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:41,360
And this is kind of like what I'm doing is, I don't know if you remember the first men in black when it was choose your weapon and they give him this little thing called a cricket.

1016
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,080
He's like, oh, why do I get the little one? Right?

1017
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:45,900
Yeah. And the joke is, whoa, whoa, hey, don't point that thing at me.

1018
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,840
You know, he's got the big giant gun. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1019
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:49,860
But it's got the most potency. Yeah.

1020
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:55,440
And I have people that know music that have heard it and they're like, this is incredible.

1021
01:06:55,720 --> 01:07:02,120
And one person who came from cross country over about a month ago still messages me.

1022
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:04,940
He's like, I wasn't expecting that. He's still thinking about it.

1023
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:09,740
You know what you heard, right? Which is which is I go through that every day.

1024
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:11,500
It's like this is this shouldn't be happening.

1025
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:19,200
So, yeah, I'm not going to mention a price or anything, but there are about five thousand a pair if somebody wants them.

1026
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:23,800
So I know. Fair enough. I'm just saying that in general, though, people used to I miss that, though.

1027
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:30,520
Honestly, I went to even, you know, see inquire how much it would cost me to get like, you know, a stereo back in my house, just something.

1028
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:35,580
And really, that equipment is not the common stuff is not available like it used to be at all anymore.

1029
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:40,160
Well, you have to it's a system. You have to know what you're getting.

1030
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:44,300
There's nothing put to bundled up and put together for you like it used to be in the 80s.

1031
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:47,940
Well, 60s, 70s and 80s. But it depends. It's not for everyone.

1032
01:07:50,220 --> 01:08:00,120
Here's the idea is if you have a stereo, like you say, and you play a piano music piece on it and it doesn't sound like a piano, it's distortion.

1033
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:06,220
So let's say you go out and get a high, high quality, small pair of speakers that, you know, whatever.

1034
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:09,820
If you play an orchestra and it doesn't sound like an orchestra, it's distortion.

1035
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:13,860
And when you say distortion, most people think it's a crackle sound.

1036
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:22,560
No, if someone's playing guitar on the program material and you're playing it through whatever you're playing it through, and it doesn't sound like a guitar, it's distortion.

1037
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:28,260
Yeah, I mean, it's not. Right. If you play piano music and it sounds like a little toy piano, that's distortion.

1038
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:38,720
So what I'm able to do in a very small package device, have the full weight of a grand piano, which is not possible in physics.

1039
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:50,680
You need very large systems to do that. And I'm able to do that with a very small system because I'm not when people think of transducers, things moving like speakers and all that.

1040
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:56,359
They're basing it on pressure equations. And I'm telling you, there's no pressure. It's all based on steady state.

1041
01:08:56,819 --> 01:09:03,660
So when a speaker moves out a cone, people say, yeah, even I spoke to speaker designers, they think a pressure builds up on the code.

1042
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:06,819
No, it's in a steady state. Actually, it's the opposite that happens.

1043
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:13,260
The air moves out of the way just before the cone moves and there's a vacuum on the surface and there's mass to prove it.

1044
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:15,720
And there's people that can measure it, but no one wants to hear that.

1045
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:21,680
So that means that no one in the loudspeaker industry is designing things properly at all. And I could prove that.

1046
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:29,020
I have the receipts because I have got even there's a guy that made a speaker company that made a YouTube video on what I said to him.

1047
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:35,340
He's calling it some quantum whatever. And it worked. It worked. And then he took the YouTube off the thing.

1048
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:41,160
So anyway, I have the receipts in terms of dealing with engineers. They just don't want to do it.

1049
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:47,040
It's kind of like imagine saying you can do weather work. Right. Right. And going immediate meteorologist.

1050
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:52,100
What is he going to say? He's classically trained, which means shit. Right.

1051
01:09:52,279 --> 01:09:56,880
So exactly. Yeah. So this has been a long sonic longer than normal. Right.

1052
01:09:57,040 --> 01:10:02,500
But that's OK. Maybe to help welcome some people and see there's more stuff going on.

1053
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:10,060
And I've mentioned, I think, to TXPS known as Bruce there. He's interested in the loudspeaker technology.

1054
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:18,100
I might do a seminar on the steady state acoustic counter space and show how these things.

1055
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:24,380
Yeah. And how you could build these things yourself. But, yeah, if there are any audiophiles out there, get in touch with me.

1056
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:29,260
There you go. So because I've got something for you that you will. Yeah. OK.

1057
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:36,540
There you go. Fair enough. And so, look, if anybody knows a little bit information about a good place to go economically,

1058
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:42,640
where it's not going to cost, you know, a huge amount to get something, you know, decent as far as a home stereo or.

1059
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:46,220
Oh, Craigslist. I can answer that Craigslist all the time.

1060
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:51,860
Not in Georgia. I'm telling you, it sucks here. People don't have crap on Craigslist here.

1061
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:57,600
I used to. They told me that about Tucson 26 years ago before I moved here. And it's better than New York.

1062
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:01,780
Well, maybe, but but not here. It's it's all it's the way you look at it.

1063
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:06,160
OK, well, if somebody has a good way for me to search it, I don't know anything.

1064
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:10,960
If you can find me something and you have a good shortcut, you got Facebook marketplace, TikTok marketplace.

1065
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:16,040
And if you whenever you go to a store, I think when your computer broke, I said, I said, I'm not talking to a child anymore,

1066
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:22,000
because when you go to buy something from a store, you have to pay the rent, insurance and salaries, never buy anything.

1067
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:26,160
In other words, in the day and age right now, just like people don't send letters, they send an email.

1068
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:32,100
You don't buy anything from a retail store. Well, I got two things because you're paying for their.

1069
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:39,940
So if you wanted to get a stereo, you could go on Craigslist or Facebook or TikTok for three to four hundred bucks.

1070
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:44,960
And the same stuff at a used therapy should be two thousand. Right. Because that's how they roll.

1071
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:50,300
So that's foolish. Now you have to buy. In other words, you're living in the age right now where you must buy private party.

1072
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:55,320
The only reason you buy from a shop is because you want their service.

1073
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:59,140
Now, maybe I'm speaking for you. Maybe you want the service.

1074
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:02,980
Maybe you want the service and you're going to pay four times more than what you can.

1075
01:12:03,220 --> 01:12:11,380
If you know, I threw away two hundred dollars getting two different computers that were useless from from local people because they have garbage here.

1076
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:15,920
I'm telling you, these people have garbage. It's an attitude. It's an attitude thing.

1077
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:19,660
Yeah, I learned that. I learned that 26 years ago.

1078
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:24,520
I was told by everyone in Brooklyn and everyone in Manhattan that I knew I was moving to Tucson.

1079
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:29,540
It's horrible there. You won't get it's great. I'm actually having in many cases, it's easier to.
