1
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:15,620
Rated Y, Sonic Event 147. And here we go, a little skip there at the beginning on the

2
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:22,920
intro. A little glitch, a little glitch. There's glitches in the Matrix now and then. I saw

3
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,620
something in the chat, by the way, where people were talking about this article, I guess,

4
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:32,780
in the Guardian or one of, you know, one of the two British news online paper things,

5
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:38,060
right? Where they were saying there's certain traits in the face that show people scientifically

6
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:43,940
when you're gay. Well, it made me think of faces and traits.

7
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,360
I didn't look at that, but yeah, you've heard it before with the genetics, there's a gene

8
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,840
and all that. Remember, anything, anytime you hear scientific, it's bullshit now. It's

9
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:59,720
been proven already, right? Is that funny? Because they use the same term. Scientifically

10
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:05,020
proven means absolutely nothing. You're supposed to trust the science all the time, right? Trust

11
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:08,740
the science. It's part of the religion. Well, the whole thing here, let's go harken back

12
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:13,240
when one of the things about ancient Greece is there were a lot of homosexuals. What people

13
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:19,960
don't realize is when you read the classics, there is no homosexuality. You might have this

14
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:25,980
guy having an intimate relationship with this guy, but they're never called gay. Right?

15
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:31,760
So that the whole thing about the homosexuality and whatever, I think that emerged recently,

16
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,460
like past century or two, maybe three. Well, there's even the concept of, say, Achilles

17
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,920
and Patroclus, right? Or Patrick, please, whatever you want to call them. And, you know,

18
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:49,720
they were they were intimate and they were cousins or something, too, which is another

19
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:55,500
whole thing. But but it doesn't say, you know, Achilles is gay. It just says that he

20
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:01,960
has this very close relationship with Patrick. There is no stuff in the Bible to Jonathan

21
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:08,080
and David, but there's no classification. So when you start seeing these classification

22
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,520
now scripture, the Bible tells you man lay with a man or woman lay with a woman. That's

23
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,220
a death offense. Right. Right. Because it's kind of strict. It's very that's another discussion.

24
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,100
But why is it like that? It doesn't matter why. It's just that, you know, it's a set

25
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:25,860
of rules, like Simon says, let's say. Right. OK. But the there is this classifications

26
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:31,620
that create that are created are done as part of the social engineering outline. Right.

27
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,640
So then it could be used against you both when they create homosexuality as a category,

28
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:43,700
the LGBTQ, RST, UV, whatever. Yeah. As to you, P.I.D., whatever. Yeah. As to you, P.I.D.

29
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:49,560
Of course. Most that's what there may not be LGBTQ, but they're definitely as to you,

30
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:56,360
P.I.D. So it seems that way. I would say that when I say that it's to be used against you,

31
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,260
meaning both sides, both pro and con. Right. That's right. Like the. Yeah, it's so it's

32
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:08,880
all these are weaponized word magic. I recently put in the chat one of the since we had Dimitri,

33
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:14,580
I found this very rare and asked Bruce to make a copy of this. The first minute it was a member

34
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:19,900
of Bush was in the book on the goat and he was in a classroom with the black children. It's funny.

35
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:24,280
I was only black children. Yeah. Remember that? Not 11. Yeah. In Florida. He's down in Florida

36
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,600
and he's reading my pet goat or whatever the book to the class, supposedly. Something like

37
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,900
that. We never saw what we never saw a video. Did you catch the video what the children were

38
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:39,260
told to to read out loud? No, I don't think I ever put it in the chat. Yeah. Check it out.

39
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:45,720
Well, anyway, it's the teachers recite these words quickly. Steel. Children are like steel. Hit. Hit.

40
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:54,780
Plane. Plane. Must. Must. And the children recite play must hit steel. Wow. Yeah. Pretty trippy,

41
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,500
right? That is trippy. I never heard that. Yeah. Well, no, that's what I said. Let's make a copy

42
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,540
of the first. It's only in the first minute. Yeah, definitely. Because that's going to be

43
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,920
that's not going to last. And it's funny how it emerged 20 years later. It seems pretty legit.

44
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:12,020
Even if it wasn't, let's say someone put that together with AI. It looks legit.

45
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:19,320
This is how the world is based. And people don't understand. It's it's so subtle.

46
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:25,700
Let me put it this way. I'll settle. Okay. Tangent. We don't live in a real reality. In other words,

47
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:31,540
it's it's malleable. And I've had I experienced a Mandela effect every three or four months,

48
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:37,740
a big one. Give an example. Very stark. It's it's irrefutable. I have a table saw with a fence,

49
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:43,460
and it's a small, portable construction is called the construction site saw. It's not that big.

50
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:51,680
And I have some pieces of board that I cut at 10 and a quarter. Okay. You work a table size,

51
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,500
you set the fence and you measure the distance of the word between the fence and the blade,

52
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:01,000
right? Okay. So this is literally a saw a saw that's set in a table that you actually use

53
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:09,800
things to it's called a table saw tool, right? So yeah, there were like four or 500 bucks,

54
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:15,080
you get cheap ones for 150. So anyway, right, okay, I made a cut bunch of cuts at 10 and a

55
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:23,160
quarter. Well, today, I went to to make some at 11. And I bring the fence all the way to the edge,

56
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,640
and the fence doesn't go past nine and a half. So in other words, that saw was made

57
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:34,660
to only cut up to nine and a half inches. Now, how long ago did you do the 10 and a quarter?

58
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,080
A month ago, a month ago, I did I cut, I cut stuff just fine, it was setting the fence at 10

59
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,660
and a quarter with some room to spare, because you don't want to run the fence to the end of

60
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,980
the saw table, because then it's got nothing in the clamp on. Right. So you can't possibly

61
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,840
have run it to 10 and a quarter if it only goes to nine. What did you say? Nine and a half? Yeah,

62
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,580
nine and a half, it wouldn't go past. If I lined it, I said, Wait a second, because I moved the

63
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:02,980
have the tape measure open between the blade and the left side of the fence. And I have the tape

64
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:07,960
measure up a new 11, right, like 10 and three quarter. And the fence falls off the table.

65
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,640
I'm like, Wait a second, why is that possible and put it back on? And let me let's push the fence

66
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,400
over to where it doesn't fall off the extreme edge. And it was only nine and a half. So how

67
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,920
the hell did I cut 10 and a quarter the other day? Yeah, right. And I ran it's not it because

68
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:27,500
I see it in front of me when I cut and I ran a bunch of it. So how can it only be and it's

69
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,680
on the left hand side, the right hand side is the same the blades in the middle. So

70
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,800
whether you go right or left, it doesn't matter. So how was I making these 10 and a quarter cuts

71
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,340
where now the maximum cut you can do is not enough on a tool that's been sitting outside in

72
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:45,280
the rain. It's been 20 years, it still works. And it's not a new tool where maybe I you know,

73
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:51,420
maybe somebody swapped it. It's the same tool. And I was like, You know what, fuck you, whoever's

74
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:56,120
doing a skull, fuck yourself. I'm going to deal with it. I'm going to build an extension. So I

75
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:02,360
had some blocks of aluminum. I've been working with cryo, cryo sacro late CA glue, which is

76
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:08,500
crazy glue. Many things you can do with it. So actually crazy glued some large aluminum section

77
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:13,880
to the table saw it's actually holding I'm going to put I put not in a ball do I remember the crazy

78
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:19,380
glue commercials in 70 they had the guy picking up whatever actually does that can't take a shock

79
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:25,020
load. No, they had the guy actually puts it on the thing on his hand on his hard hat. He hooks

80
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:30,500
the hard hat to the girder and he hangs from it. Yeah, yeah, right. Now you could take off,

81
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:35,540
but it can't take a shock. You know, shock load is when you tap something right, right, like an egg,

82
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,640
you can drive a truck over an egg if you have it in the right, but it can't take a shock load. So

83
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,320
yeah, buildings are very sensitive. By the way, that way when I was doing engineering,

84
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,820
shock loads on buildings are very sensitive. In other words, you have a lot you can imagine a

85
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,820
floor of a skyscraper loaded with people, right? It's designed to take that, right? Like, let's say

86
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:01,640
having a big party, you don't want the thing to collapse, right? Right. So it's designed for that.

87
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,540
But the shock load is minimal. Once you start putting a shock load on that you literally can

88
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:13,980
collapse a floor with only 40 P at 40 pounds per square inch. Only 40 pounds per square is not a lot

89
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,480
and at shock load value, right? But no, you know, you're not going to get that kind of shock load.

90
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:23,040
But anyway, that's why we used to break up sidewalks, right? Jackhammer, what's jackhammer?

91
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:28,440
It's a shock load. It's a shock load focused in a particular area. Yeah.

92
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:35,360
Yeah. Yeah. So anyway, I throw a little tidbit, just see how the mind works. That's what I you

93
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,659
know, when I think about something that's like my process. But anyway, weird stuff. And yeah,

94
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,280
the whole thing, the class, watch how more back to the gay face thing or whatever you thought you

95
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:51,700
bring up because I talked about an old book from the Third Reich era on phrenology. Right? It's

96
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,300
similar to for Yeah, what they're doing is phrenology. I didn't look at it. I'm just, you

97
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:00,000
know, very rarely do I click on stuff that people send me. That's why I say if you drop a link, give

98
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,880
me a short description of what it is. So I have the option not to click on it. Keep moving, right?

99
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:10,140
Right. So and that's good. There was a message on that. But it's all bullshit. And it's going to

100
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:16,540
get thicker and thicker. It's so ridiculous. What was it? Just like ridiculous. I saw it was a

101
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:21,060
governor Newsom, California announced they're missing 24 billion or something like that. I love

102
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:27,120
it. That's a new one. Yeah. Yeah, I love it. Like what do people do? You know, it's like, what do we

103
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,440
do about this? Yeah, where's the outrage? You know, how many times you heard these people that

104
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,420
are popular, famous? I'm not suicidal. And then they're found like a month later hanging in the

105
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:39,580
garage, right? Where's the outrage? Right? Why don't the people get together? Yeah, it's a bunch

106
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:44,420
of stupid, like Dimitri says, they're stupid cowards. You know, so who cares if you know, you

107
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:48,680
know, they're stupid cowards are not going to do well. And you know, if you're not good, here's

108
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:53,180
the thing. People say let's change the world, make it better, right? For who? A bunch of stupid

109
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:58,480
cowards? The majority? No, they don't need to have it better. They need to have it go away real fast.

110
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:05,500
They need to go away real fast, whatever it takes, whatever it takes. And that's what's happening. So

111
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,680
fair enough. Fair enough. Yeah. But I mean, you know, phonology is interesting, though,

112
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:15,360
because I think there are things you can see you can actually judge, you know, instead of judging

113
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,640
a book by its cover, you can judge somebody by their face a bit. I mean, I think people do wear

114
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:27,240
things on their face. Yeah, loony Dick Tracy. Look, this is if you want to know what phonology is.

115
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:33,360
Look at who shows up on Looney Tunes and Dick Tracy type stuff. They exaggerated the phonology

116
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,540
on that. Right. You ever notice how the regular people look fairly regular and the criminals

117
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:43,880
always had an exaggerated feature of some kind? Yes, always. And Dick Tracy himself with the

118
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:49,740
strong. OK, yeah. Look at the comic cartoonists are experts on phonology and body type.

119
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:55,480
I had a roommate who was a cartoonist and he basically like every artist, you struggle to

120
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:01,180
create your own style. Right. And he was trying to create his own style. And we would go we would

121
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:10,460
trip. We take some psilocybin, mescaline, which is, again, a synthetic. We hang out by the fountain

122
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:17,320
in Prospect Park and Central Park, depending when. And he would start sketching people walking by and

123
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:22,880
he would point out this lady here. She's got the fat lady gene. And I look at the ladies pointing

124
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,920
out she's not fat. So I didn't say she was fat. I say she has the fat lady gene. What's the fat

125
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:35,520
lady gene? Slightly knockneed, small feet, cutesy face, kind of roundish around the hip area, kind

126
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:42,320
of like a pear shape. The shoulders go in narrow when the arms are laying down on their sides.

127
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:47,840
They're kind of short and they have like a double bend by the elbow. That's the fat lady gene.

128
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:52,980
And then like another person to walk by, that guy's got the skinny man gene and he's not skinny.

129
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:59,920
But look, yeah, he's kind of slender, big feet up on his crotch, middle point area. There's a gap.

130
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,040
You ever notice some people, you know, their thighs don't come. The thigh meat doesn't touch.

131
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:08,660
It's a big gap in that area. Right. Right. Kind of a long neck with an Adam's apple that's prominent.

132
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:14,100
Right. OK. OK. That's the skinny man gene. And it has nothing to do with them being skinny

133
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:21,360
or the fat lady gene. Her being fat has to do with the how they're growing, right? How they fit

134
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,520
the model. Then you can exaggerate that. You know, when you're going to draw a skinny man,

135
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,600
you make the exaggerated Adam's apple and the gap, you know, by the groin area,

136
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:36,000
wide skinny slender legs. And you start exaggerating how how bad is he a badass skinny

137
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,460
man or is a badass. Right. And you have to have those features to communicate that.

138
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,460
And that's what phrenology is. That's all. It's just what's being communicated. Yeah.

139
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:51,680
But all the science is BS. Here's the thing. Any branch of science that you study, even engineering,

140
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:56,020
if you include all the things they took out in their studies, you'll find that you're not

141
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:00,780
learning anything. It's all experiential observation. There is no laws. There is no

142
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:06,700
they have no firm body on anything at all. You know, it's pretty interesting.

143
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:12,300
So that's what do I say here all the time? I'm rated wide. I've been saying for a long time is

144
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:18,760
all fields are wide open. Every field of study you can imagine is completely wide open. Like there's

145
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:24,920
the Thomas catalog, which is for industry. I think it has like 10,000 different categories or 3,000

146
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:30,680
categories of things that are in industry. All of them are completely open, completely open.

147
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:35,360
And I'm proving this with the water stuff, with the scalarator. I'm proving it now with the acoustic

148
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:42,060
modules, counter space modules. And the world is there's stupid cowards and they're idiots.

149
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:47,780
So, you know, how well can you do in a society like that? Well, put it this way.

150
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:54,440
On one hand, you can say you'll do great because they're idiots. Right. And if you're not doing

151
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,160
it, you don't even have to be smart. You just don't have to be an idiot. Right. That puts you

152
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:04,260
ahead. Right. Sure. But then it should. But then who are you doing it for? Who are you doing it

153
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,680
with? A bunch of idiots again. And are they going to hold you back? Bet your ass they are.

154
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,620
Now, you notice how he said, on the other hand, if you're someone who's busy and you have the

155
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:18,760
wherewithal to have people around you, like, for example, a consulary, right? And you need people

156
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:23,920
around you like a right hand man. You know, they always use a right hand man. Never say left hand

157
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,420
man. Or they say, on the other hand. Anyway, when they did the Federal Reserve thing,

158
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:36,000
they brought over a German guy. It didn't speak any English. Nobody in the banking system spoke

159
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,500
any English when they brought the Federal Reserve over. Nobody cared. But one of FDR's requests was,

160
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:47,100
with this new economic system, I want a one armed man. And they were like,

161
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,760
why do you want a one armed man? Because he could never come back to me and say,

162
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:58,780
on the other hand. But anyway. OK. Fair. Was the decision was there's only one way to go all the

163
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:03,560
way to go. That's right. Yeah. And he was making that point because that's where we are right now

164
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:09,380
with that. Now, I've been getting some emails from the newer people that have joined from

165
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:14,100
the Archaic's interview. Right. Oh, I watched in our recent Archaic's interview with the Hawaii

166
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:21,560
family. Let me just say. Close your ears. No comment. No comment. I'm done with that stuff.

167
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:26,900
I'm glad he I'm glad he put forward what he did with the Phoenix and all that stuff.

168
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:32,060
It's just anybody. Well, if you've been if you know what's going on, go listen to that last.

169
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:37,620
Don't listen to it. Actually, the Hawaii video and the one before that. OK. We're being dummy

170
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:43,840
loaded with slave talk now. And that's it. I just took him off my bookmarks for now. But anyway,

171
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:48,920
nothing against him. It's just shit, you know. And I thought I had something really interesting

172
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:54,820
to fight to look forward to eventually, you know, because on the Internet is here where I work and

173
00:15:54,820 --> 00:16:00,540
live. I have speakers in every room just about and, you know, and outside and have a control

174
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:05,960
center. So if I have a YouTube video on or an audio book, I can decide where I want it to play.

175
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,920
If I'm going to be working on the shop area or whatever, I have it playing there so I can

176
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:16,880
actually put on like a book that's six hours long and in two days not read the book, but hear the

177
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,780
book. Right. And I could be doing other stuff. And I used to do it for a lot of his videos and

178
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:28,380
enjoy them. But the last whole bunch of them, I was like, OK, no more. This is over. Sorry.

179
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:34,100
And this this happens. It's not like, you know, you get enticed. In other words, what I'm trying

180
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:39,900
to say, I'm objective enough to know when things are going down. Right. It's kind of like when you

181
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,700
when your restaurant opens and I don't mean where they honeymoon you with,

182
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,280
you know, when you get in honeymoon means they're treating you better than

183
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,100
you know, will it be acceptable? Right.

184
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,780
Honeymooning is a thing that's used in a lot of terms used in a lot of places. Right. Right.

185
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,700
Yeah. It's like what I told you when you get a new job, don't do your best work in the beginning

186
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,920
because then they're going to think that's normal. And it's the standard

187
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:10,099
to do the minimum amount, minimal amount when you get hired. Don't try to impress them and then

188
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:13,800
do slightly better. And then that you're right. That's more impressive. Right. Right.

189
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,900
But people are used to it's called honeymooning. But anyway,

190
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,540
I've noticed with certain very rarely, very rarely,

191
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,020
most of the audio books, the stuff that I put on YouTube and Jason was on the list

192
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:30,840
for a go. He's got a new video. Great. It's two hours. Great. I'll be outside in the shop. Put it

193
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,300
on. You'll hear something. Right. Cool. Not anymore. In other words, like a restaurant that was good

194
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:39,300
and it's not good anymore. Right. You know what I mean? OK. And it's kind of disappointing.

195
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,980
And I'm saying it from an amici point of view, from a friendly point of view, criticism

196
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:51,340
in a good way. I'd like to see the quality stay the same or get better, not get worse.

197
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,560
And if you understand the point that I'm coming from, you listen to it.

198
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:00,840
Most people will say, great, there's nothing wrong with it. Boy, let me point like a 15,

199
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,340
25 things up. You know, it's like I just I had. In other words, I can't

200
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,480
lately with our kicks. I can't watch more than 15, 20 minutes. I turn it off.

201
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,280
You know, so it's it's because his stuff is some of the I would say Jason has put out some of the

202
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,840
best stuff that's been on the Internet in the past decade, a year ago or two years or even

203
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:26,820
six months ago. And I was very impressed. So, you know, I hope he I hope he gets he brings it back.

204
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:31,400
Now, I'm not speaking for anyone other than myself. And it's from a positive criticism.

205
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:37,480
But the reason I'm sharing this is more private area to share it. I'm not trolling him or being

206
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:42,660
a shill or anything like that. I always wish everybody the best. But if anyone hears what

207
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:48,020
I'm I'm not saying what I heard, but it's just the basic slave talk that's really hard to listen to.

208
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,580
Anyone else hearing that? I'm with you. Right. So but I'd like to see him do well. And he has

209
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:58,880
doing well because he's doing it for material reasons anyway. And he brags about it in a good

210
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:05,540
way. You know, he's not greedy and let him do what he's got to do, you know. But I've been kind of

211
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:10,560
disappointed lately. And in other words, anybody got any any anything else substitute anything else

212
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:16,820
to listen to? Because I have several projects I have to be machining and building things. I'm

213
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:23,740
making my own loudspeaker drivers. I'm actually buying a loudspeaker drivers, taking them apart.

214
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:29,700
It's kind of like remember the Johnny Cash. I brought it all one piece at a time. The song

215
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:36,020
built a car. Right. OK, so I'm building my own speaker drivers, not from scratch, but I'm buying

216
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:41,840
drivers that I passed muster, taking them apart and recombining them like Frankenstein in order

217
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,500
for them to perform, because I don't feel like spending five hundred dollars on one speaker

218
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:51,820
driver. Right. Because scan speak makes some good. And even then I would have to take them apart.

219
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:58,140
They're flawed. They don't know what they're doing at all. The industry at all. If you don't believe

220
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:04,080
that, go look at a car commercial. Aside from them touting that it's electric, it has Wi-Fi

221
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,540
or Bluetooth. Oh, my gosh. Nothing about the tolerances of the engine or the mileage anymore.

222
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:15,400
Right. You know, yeah, we were supposed to be. There was enough engineers, if you remember,

223
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:20,240
in the 80s that got fired or quit because they already had technology that would have big cars

224
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:26,240
going at 100 miles per gallon with a computerized fuel injection. And what I want to say is they

225
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,580
have this thing in a car called an oxygen sensor. Right. Right. And it's part of the emissions

226
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:35,580
pollution control. If you were really against pollution, they wouldn't call it an oxygen

227
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:42,440
sensor. They would call it a pollution sensor. Think about it. It's all backwards. It's all

228
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:48,220
backwards. So what I'm trying to say, it's all fucked. I mean, you're fucked, but you're in a

229
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:52,960
fucked up spot, fucked up place. If you're hearing my voice and you got, you know, perceiving what's

230
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,720
around you, make the best of it. It's more than just making lemonade, because the last thing you

231
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,120
want to do is take a bath in lemonade. Right. You're not always making lemonade. Right. True.

232
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:09,140
So, yeah, that's pretty much the idea. It's not a good spot. Can you be happy when you're

233
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:13,760
not in a good. Yeah, absolutely. You can you can make. OK. You know how people say I don't have any

234
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,900
time. Right. You hear that a lot. Right. They're not thinking all you have is time. You're born

235
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,600
and you die. What do you have in between time? That's that's what you have in between.

236
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:27,040
All you have is time. Right. Right. So what you do is you make happiness. No one. Right.

237
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,240
Everyone's level of what they consider to be, you know, with, you know, that bullshit they

238
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,600
said 300 years ago now, almost a pursuit of life, liberty and happiness and all that stuff. There

239
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:41,360
was they changed that. It was some other stuff because it was basically for themselves and they

240
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,120
had to take out the personification, make it sound like anyone reading it. Right. Right. But

241
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,640
and then there's other letters to prove many letters that they've things they wrote to each

242
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,380
other to prove what I said. But anyway, by the way, just to distract, you know, that Jefferson

243
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:01,040
wrote, I'm paraphrasing here that one day the governments will be able to put something into

244
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:06,080
the bodies of their citizens to be able to track their moves and everything that they do. You know,

245
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:10,040
Jefferson wrote that. You remember, I think I read that quote. I've heard about it. I've heard

246
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,660
about I don't remember you reading it, but I have heard about it. Yeah. Yeah. It was a while

247
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:18,560
back. We did it maybe on the previous iteration of our sonics or something to look it up.

248
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:23,540
And when was Jefferson around like late 1700s, early 1800s? He was an old fart by the

249
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:29,900
early 1800s. I don't know. Did he live past the 1812? I don't know. But anyway,

250
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:37,180
200 and something years ago, they were already basking in the idea, which was more than an idea

251
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:42,480
because remember, all technology exists all the time. When you get it, it's new to you.

252
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:51,940
Right. An example, I was at the CES show in Chicago in 1985. And the CD players,

253
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:56,220
Phillips and Sony was just barely hitting him. But Phillips came up with a CD player. Wow,

254
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:01,400
you know, no more scratchy albums. And I was talking to one of the engineers says,

255
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:05,200
yeah, that's good. But you know what? It's really about uncorruptible memory chips,

256
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,980
which is, you know, you don't have it on it. You don't need to play anything or spin anything and

257
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:14,480
just put it all on a chip. Right. And I was like, yeah, I know what you're talking about,

258
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,420
because I had an answering machine. Remember, answering machines, they had tapes and all.

259
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:23,260
Right. But I had bought an AT&T answering machine that didn't have any tapes that had that chip in

260
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:27,000
it. You just record everything on a solid state back then. Right. You'll just come out. It would

261
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,880
be like 100 bucks for today's money before 100 bucks for an answering machine. But anyway,

262
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:37,000
probably didn't have it. Yeah. It's like four times from the 80s. So they bypassed, you know,

263
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,280
so they put out. Right. You see what I'm saying? But when did you have all the music on a chip?

264
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:47,620
So what they call an iPod or what? The Apple made it popular. Yeah. The iPod through Apple

265
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:52,840
and the Zune through. Yeah. Which is it was a little better. I had a couple of them.

266
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,080
So you know that people don't know you could find someone wants to find it's not important.

267
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:02,640
But I remember there's a company called Logitech. That's right. They came up with it before Apple

268
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,540
and Apple stole it outright. They had it patented and all that. And Apple stole it.

269
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:13,020
And Logitech went after. I think it was not called Logitech went after Apple and they won.

270
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:18,520
They settled for 300 million or something out of court. Well, they just settled. Apple settled it.

271
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,860
And that gave them, you know, to to get into the periphery. They're a big peripheral

272
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:28,560
company. They make peripherals. Right. So you don't hear about these successes and all that

273
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:34,360
stuff. So from the supposedly little guys. But any company that does more than 10 million is

274
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:39,180
or it used to be 150 million to be in the big boys. What happens is let's say your company

275
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:44,100
doing 150 million in business. You're going to have someone planted mid-level management

276
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:49,740
or one of these positions in there that's hard to fire. That's that's part of the insider group.

277
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:53,440
You want to call them Illuminati's. You want to call them military intelligence.

278
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:58,700
You want to call them, I don't know, the secret college, you know, whatever. You know,

279
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:03,780
there's many names for these. The Deep State. What other what else are the Freemasons like

280
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:09,260
Dimitri likes the secret. So it is the secret societies of all the side. You're going to have

281
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:13,820
a secret. And they're connected with, you know, the in the bankers, the IRS and the military and

282
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:17,760
all that. And they have they're in a position where they could steer and influence your company

283
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,680
constantly. Right. And then they are also in a position where they know everything. You can't

284
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:27,320
hide anything from them because they already in a position where they can access things. Right.

285
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:33,840
Your finances, people, goings on your personal life. Right. So that's the reality. And I've

286
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,340
heard this from two different people at two different times, about 10 years apart,

287
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:42,460
separate people. And that's how it works. And from speaking with Jonathan Butts,

288
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:46,480
who died a sudden death, he started working when he died a sudden death at 49. He says,

289
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:51,460
oh, it's a lot less than that now. It's more like 10 million. It's more like 10 million now.

290
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:56,600
So they're really putting a hold on the control of what they call finances. And I think for my

291
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:04,660
last sonic financial is not money. Right. I need to stress that. Yeah. Finances is not money.

292
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:10,820
Economy is something the economy. No most means laws. It goes. It goes means house.

293
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:17,320
So equals equals. But it means like the house in a symbolic sense. That's where you get eco

294
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:23,180
ecology from. Ecology means knowledge of your house. Yeah. Knowledge of all the things that

295
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:27,940
are. But that's all the things in it. That's not just monetary. That's everything in it,

296
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:33,020
though. The ecology. Right. I mean, that's you're supposed to manage economy and economy is what

297
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:38,360
rules you use, like the Bible, biblical economy. When you say that, that has nothing to do with

298
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:42,480
gold and silver, even though it does. And when you say biblical economy, it's the way you transact

299
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,640
and the way you set things up when you live that way. Right. So when you say economy,

300
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,660
it's the whole setup. Like, for example, the communists have a slightly different economy

301
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:57,020
than the capitalists. Right. But neither one has anything to do with money. So when people say,

302
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,940
what about economy? I'm like, that is the economy, the financial part or the money part,

303
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:07,840
because you can have an economy with no money and have finances. You can have money and finances,

304
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:14,060
by the way, because this current credit system where you sign an unconditional order to pay.

305
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:23,240
Yeah. Right. That's what a bill is. And when you give it back, that whatever they when you return

306
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,740
it to them, it's good. It credits their account wherever they have it. That's been going on

307
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:35,840
since the law days way, way back, way, way back. Minimal like the John Locke days and

308
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:41,460
law. What's the other guy's name that started pushing this? It was a refined,

309
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,460
redone system from that the Medici's try to put it in. One day we'll do the history of banking.

310
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:53,960
I have to collect my thoughts because there's really two or three different styles of banking

311
00:27:53,960 --> 00:28:00,580
financial systems that were running parallel. And it didn't get finalized until the UCC in the

312
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:05,160
1940s with what we have now and Bretton Woods. So none of that really matters.

313
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,100
Yeah. You go into like Friedman and all that, right?

314
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:17,540
You can. You can. Well, in the 80s, they have all the big economists that also suggested,

315
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:22,260
just like you have Jung and Freud. You know, you had I forgot their guys names, but there's like

316
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:27,060
two or three different major economists in the 20th century. Right. And they still use their

317
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:33,000
philosophies and none of that matters because all that matters is the way you perceive scarcity.

318
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,540
Well, that's why I mentioned Milton Friedman, because he's the one of the guys who's they

319
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:39,940
say is the major one of the major economists right from the 20th century.

320
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:45,260
There's a whole bunch of them. Who's the other one? The one that was more than Friedman said

321
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:50,220
right now, I'm not I'm not accessing those files, but there's several of them.

322
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,080
No, we'll get it together on another meeting. Put it all together. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But if

323
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:59,780
you look at their stuff, it's interesting if none of it is. There's nothing really to buy.

324
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:05,860
They're not addressing bankruptcies, receiverships and the fall of nations. None of them are.
