1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,470
You already know what's rated Y because you subscribed to it and appreciate you for doing

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:09,370
that. Also, look for an announcement coming up in your messages regarding subscriptions.

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:15,129
Things are going to change in the next week or two. Anyway, all that having been said,

4
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:20,490
it's 1 48. And Greg, how are you feeling tonight? Good. I just got up from a nap,

5
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:26,330
sleep inertia. I got to give my old old ass body more than 10 minutes to wake up,

6
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:31,890
but otherwise, I'm all right. I had some really good dinner. And yeah, anybody that's in the chat,

7
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:38,470
by the way, I posted the other day on the sidebar and YouTube pays YouTube for references and stuff

8
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:43,690
like that. And because it's actually pretty ridiculous. It's all dummy load pretty much

9
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:48,450
mostly except for specific things that you're looking for. I call it YouTube University.

10
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,330
I saw people go to YouTube. Somebody asked me about some process, electrical stuff. I said,

11
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,850
go to YouTube university, calls me back the next day. He's like, I was looking for this

12
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,670
YouTube university. I can't find it. I said, Oh no, no, no. I mean, you just mean the how to stuff,

13
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:08,750
which is DIY how to stuff on YouTube. If you have a piece of electronics, you're not familiar with it.

14
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:13,890
You can find a video in five minutes. That'll get you up to speed. Somebody's already had this

15
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,870
thing three years. You're done with it in five minutes, whatever you want, let's say tear down

16
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:23,630
or inside or whatever. And you'll have someone like one of my favorite videos is you want to

17
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:28,950
replace a module inside of a, of a desktop, right? And you don't know how to do it. Okay. No problem.

18
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:35,870
You can find mechanical stuff for cars. Somebody, I wanted to change a water pump and I found the

19
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:40,950
exact same model year and everything. The guy introduces you and I did this with a starter.

20
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,430
I had no idea. And, uh, and then you said, look, just look on YouTube. You'll find it. And I said,

21
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:51,210
okay, so I went and, uh, actually I did. Yeah. So one of my favorite videos is one that I found

22
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,210
the exact what they call vehicle. And the guy starts out, says, we're going to change the

23
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:01,850
water pump on this year, whatever model make. But, uh, when you see a video, we're going to

24
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,750
change the water pump. It only takes 30 minutes, but I'm not going to do it. My girlfriend's going

25
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:11,590
to do it. I was like, Oh, cool. You know? So now what does that do for most guys? That's a confidence

26
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:16,350
builder, right? Cause what girls won't work on cars is what people typically think. Right? Well,

27
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,790
if it's, if he can make it, so it's easy enough to explain his girlfriend who does nothing with

28
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:25,770
cars, then that means it look, that means I can explain it to you. It definitely builds confidence

29
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:31,990
in that guy's video because it's like, tell you she's a tomboy and she grew up, uh, you know,

30
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:37,750
with, uh, hammers and saws, not dolby and stuff. So maybe, but yeah, either way you can have fun

31
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:45,210
with it. All right. So I posted a video, uh, again, going back to Brendan Jones came around

32
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:50,470
the sidebar and the channel, but it had this, he's interviewing someone and I'll bring up his name.

33
00:02:50,550 --> 00:03:00,710
Very impressed by him. Uh, it's a Mansa Mahatha. I'll spell it. M A N S A. And then Mahatha M A H

34
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:06,690
A T H A. It's his YouTube channel. Okay. Brother's been around for a while. And if you've been

35
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:13,750
listening to Greek on finances and stuff for me through the years, like back, back, back in the

36
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:18,690
day on revolution radio around 2009, 10, 11, whatever I was on, I would go on there. I say,

37
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:25,070
Hey, all these job fairs there. Anytime you have an application that is money that is monetized,

38
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:31,710
you know, you know, people put in applications and got refused. Yeah. Well, you want your

39
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:35,370
application back because that was deposited in the federal reserve. They got the full value of it.

40
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:40,190
That's what they're doing to treat people like idiots, but well, if you act like one, right.

41
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:45,970
So, um, or morons or infants, but he, if you understand what I've been saying for the past

42
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:53,050
12, 14 years online, he's put it all together in a very cogent, simple way that you actually had

43
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:58,870
to act on it. Now, one thing, one thing I want to mention, there's a book that needs to be acquired

44
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:05,770
because it's out of print, you know, like 500 bucks or 200 bucks, but the book is a business

45
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:12,810
law, semi-colon subtitle is the legal, ethical and international environment.

46
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:17,089
There's another one that's new. That's like 10 bucks called business law, the legal,

47
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:20,470
ethical and e-commerce. That's different. I don't know about that one.

48
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,390
So e-commerce would have to include the stuff that's, you know, on the internet, right?

49
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:30,390
Yeah. Well, we're interested more on this one and it's, uh, the author is Henry R.

50
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:37,670
Cheese man, uh, as just like, it's like cheese man. Okay, cool. Yeah. That's the author business

51
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:42,610
law, the legal, ethical and international environment. I'll, I'll do some hunting

52
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:47,130
around. Uh, maybe I'll find something on eBay or call around some of the used bookstores,

53
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:51,770
which we have a big in here in Tucson called Bookman's. Uh, I'll look around for it. The

54
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:58,950
reason, okay, this is an important book because it's basically the backbone of business law and

55
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:04,970
business, uh, transactions that are bills of exchange. So when a, one company sends another

56
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:09,410
company, a bill, they endorse it a certain way, send it back and then they bring it to the bank

57
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:14,470
and it's good. Right. Then when people try to do it with their bills, they get tested and all that.

58
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:21,610
That's why you want to, I have been enjoying the past few days listening to Mansa Mahatha.

59
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:28,550
Um, he doesn't have too many trolls or haters, but is the, just like the archaics guys, you know,

60
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:33,350
Jason, he's got some trolls in here, but they never go against him with anything of substance,

61
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:37,630
you know? So I've watched a couple of those videos and it's like, shows you how no one's

62
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:44,750
paying attention, but months, uh, is, and I do, I wouldn't say, you know, like I don't endorse Jason

63
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:49,770
or brochures. I don't say he's got great stuff, but I don't endorse him. Right. Right. And, and,

64
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:54,450
and Brandon, Joe Williams got good stuff, but I don't endorse him. Right. I'm pretty close to

65
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:59,890
saying I would endorse Mansa Mahatha tentatively. He has a pending endorsement. Really? Like,

66
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:03,990
like Pat, like patent pending, you know, it's not, you know, years ago when we used to hang

67
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:08,530
out in the ghetto making stuff, make a contraption, you know, point at it and go,

68
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:13,790
yo kid, Pat pending. And I'm like, yo, cool, man. You know, it kind of like a funny way to say,

69
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:19,450
like, you know, look how, uh, this is not really, uh, certified, but it's on its way.

70
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:26,130
I would say a pending, a pending endorsement for Mansa Mahatha so far, very impressed, uh,

71
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:31,510
for a young man, I'm allowed to say that cause I'm in my 60th year now and he's in his 32nd.

72
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:37,090
So I remember what I was doing when he was born, you know, that year, like yesterday,

73
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:46,390
by the way, uh, I'm about five 11, 175 pounds. And I still wear a 31 and a half 32 waist. Like

74
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:50,970
I did when I was in high school. So when you tell people you're in your 60th year, they think of

75
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:56,150
like, you know, what happens to most, especially white people when they hit, you know, 50, even

76
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:00,130
they fall apart. You know, I'm not talking about your body type, fat, skinny, whatever. I'm just,

77
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:05,410
you start falling apart. I am not falling apart. Uh, as a matter of fact, uh, this might be too

78
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:10,270
much information, but when I get out of the shower, I stand in front of the foggy mirror. I'm like,

79
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:14,950
how the hell did this 25 year old get in here? Wait a second. That's not a 25 year old. That's

80
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:20,690
me. Right. So in other words, is that reality or is that your perception though? You know,

81
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:25,750
my perception. Yeah. So the thing is, yeah. Uh, and you know, I really don't care about the body,

82
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:30,070
but on the other hand, I've been fortunate enough that a lot of times I say it's a lemon

83
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:36,090
whatever, but that's fine. But what I'm saying is, um, when you say this is just for most people.

84
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:40,790
Okay. When I was younger, I was, I was fortunate to have brief encounters with some wise people.

85
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:47,070
And I remember being, uh, around 1973, 74 and, uh, an older wise man says, you know,

86
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:51,490
you're going to be getting old when you go into a room and you're, and everyone in the room is

87
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:55,750
younger than you. Now, you know, you're getting old. Right. And you know what? That's been hitting

88
00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:00,950
me a lot lately where I go out into public. Oh, really? Uh, I look around and I see everyone's

89
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,790
younger than you pretty much, you know, Prissy, you know, you could tell, right. You know,

90
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:09,690
but you know, for example, when I go down by the university and I see all the college students

91
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:13,330
crossing the street, I'm like, Oh my gosh, they look like babies, but they're 20, 21. Right.

92
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:17,470
Oh yeah. Well, once, once somebody in their twenties starts to look like children to you,

93
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:23,610
you know, you pay a certain point babies. Oh my gosh. Look, 30 years ago to me, those 20 year

94
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:28,670
olds were women, baby. You know what I mean? No more. Now I look at them and I'm like,

95
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:33,010
someone sent me one in a box or whatever. I could go to the beach with, I wouldn't mind.

96
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,230
Right. Kind of thing. You know what happens? You know how people joke around with stuff like that.

97
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:41,289
But now I look at them and I go, Oh my gosh. You know? Yeah. So, but all that, I'm just giving,

98
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:47,610
the reason I brought up that stuff is because of perspective. So what I mean is, uh, uh, yeah. Uh,

99
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:52,810
he, he's also, if you listen to what I've been speaking on for a while,

100
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:56,290
and man, so he's brings up the same stuff. How could these people be called adults when

101
00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:00,830
they act like children, a lot of stupid people in the world, they choose to be that way.

102
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:04,210
Leave them alone, get away from them. Your family's going to break up. You're going to

103
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:09,050
lose your friends, very similar stuff. Uh, in that perspective, he doesn't know he,

104
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:16,110
he would do really well with like O and G uh, stuff and rated why he would take them to the next level.

105
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,530
Um, because he's, he, he doesn't understand the body. He doesn't understand history that much.

106
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:24,910
He does know that the holidays and the timekeeping is bullshit.

107
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:29,290
Well, are you sure about that? I mean, just cause he hasn't spoken on it. Doesn't mean that he has,

108
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:33,330
he has a little bit. Yeah. He thinks there's a virus and he doesn't know. Yeah. And he brought

109
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:37,370
up though that he, that, uh, you know, I don't do the new years. I'm doing the real new years,

110
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:41,510
which is in the spring and Christmas and all that is fake. Yeah. He's on his way. Okay.

111
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:45,970
So he's got part of it, but yeah, he's got part of it. Yeah. But how can you not, if you,

112
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:51,970
when you get to a certain level on one thing or two things, everything else becomes suspect,

113
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:56,190
rightly so, right? Well, that's the thing. Yeah. You start the question, you go, wait a minute.

114
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:01,030
You know, if this established idea that is supposed to be, you know, the absolute rock

115
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:04,710
solid thing, it's this agreement, this social agreement. Well, they never say, they never say

116
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:10,170
it's rock solid either. That's why I tell people to read, but it's always presumptive. We take it

117
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:14,210
to ourselves. We take it as being rocks. I'd never said it was no matter what it is. No,

118
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:18,390
it's only because it's been repeated so many times that you just kind of go, well, it must be,

119
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:23,510
you know, peer pressure, peer pressure. Perfect. Yep. Yeah. So anyway, with him, he understands,

120
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:27,410
like I've said, you know, nobody will do anything. Even if someone's coming to take

121
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:31,710
bacon off day back, no one's going to do anything. Uh, right. They just sit there

122
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:37,990
and he understands. So anyway, uh, you have a pending endorsement, um, uh, for him and for

123
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:42,690
his stuff. Why? Because he's a doer. He gets stuff done. He's this, uh, I'll try to post another

124
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:49,150
video or so where some people got remedy. The whole presumption is this, well, not a presumptive

125
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:55,150
assumption, uh, is this if you go to an institution, government doesn't matter what it is.

126
00:10:55,330 --> 00:11:00,150
Usually the corporations cause they, they get access to the federal reserve discount window

127
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:05,270
and various other trusts. Anyone asking you for social security numbers, tapping that's a credit

128
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:10,250
card. You've heard me say that before. Yes. Uh, they're billing that they're getting everything.

129
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:17,050
And then they send you a bill, which is actually a form of money that they need for you to endorse

130
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:21,250
for them to continue doing business. It doesn't mean that you're, that's going to pick. That's

131
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:25,050
why you're like, he gets into all bills. Are they positive or negative numbers? Always positive

132
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:29,930
bigger numbers. Are you the payee or the payer? In other words, who's sending the bill is the

133
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:36,050
payer. Remember how I said years ago in the Dunning process, uh, in a credit based environment,

134
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:40,170
if you send someone a bill, you also have to send them the check to pay for it with,

135
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:44,790
you know, I've been saying that for a long time. This comes out of various acts and codes that are

136
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:49,510
old that still hold true. The laws are still the same. They just modify them. Right. And

137
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:53,890
this is what he's getting about how to actually get remedy based on performance

138
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:59,190
and setting yourself up using the language. You can't go to them, say the U S is bankrupt.

139
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:02,290
There's that and the other, you know, there's no debt. No, no, no. It doesn't work that way.

140
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:07,510
It's all based on contract performance, all contracts. I've even seen people in courts

141
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:14,550
when they beat, when they beat the charges, they still had to pay fines or go to jail because they

142
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:21,730
had a contract with the court. And, uh, yeah. And also when they'd steal homes from in the state

143
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:28,470
steals homes from old ladies, uh, literally, uh, they say, don't worry. It's just business.

144
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:33,210
It's all business. That's why I stressed that book, which is brought up in one of his videos,

145
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:38,550
uh, with the remedy. So anyway, yeah, I'm very impressed. Well, he actually talks about how

146
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:45,910
to apply this too, which is to get remedy. Yeah. Yeah. Anything. So you go to a corporate real

147
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,870
estate agent for an apartment and they give you a lease and ask for a social security number

148
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:55,990
that goes okay. And that's whatever's on there. Like you go get a car. The most popular one is

149
00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:02,550
to get a car. Right? So let's say a $30,000 car with interest five years is going to cost you

150
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:10,370
46,000. And then they add this, that, and the other. So that note, they go and they get 46,000,

151
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:16,210
right? They give you the car. The car is a gift. They're just interested in security on that

152
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:20,630
security note. That note keepers put on the stock market and sold it. And they sell the note after

153
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:25,830
for maybe 70%. And that keep keeps processing and processing. So you don't want the car when

154
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:31,070
you get a car loan, you want to revise the contract or send a letter after because the

155
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:35,530
contract says you can do this, but you're revising the contract and you want full security interest

156
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:41,870
in that security and anything that happens to it. Oh, that's why there's so many people in real life,

157
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:46,010
even that don't know this when, how many times have you heard? I don't know if you understand

158
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:51,570
the car market. You'll hear this not often, maybe one out of 10, one out of 20 people,

159
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:55,390
they had the car repossessed, right? Cause they didn't make the payments. Let's say

160
00:13:55,830 --> 00:14:00,310
but three months later, they get a check for $10,000. You ever heard this happen? I have

161
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:05,350
heard of that. And usually the people don't know why it happened to be honest with you. Yeah. Yeah.

162
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:09,670
And it's not a technical error. It's because when there's certain codes and laws that when the note

163
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:14,210
gets sold a certain way, some amount has to go back to the principal and you're always the principal.

164
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:18,970
He gets into all this, you know, whatever, but he doesn't even do that. Where, okay. You know,

165
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:22,690
where you're talking about them taking old lady's houses when they take it away for a tax lien,

166
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:27,830
they turn around. If they auction off that house and you get more money than what the tax lien is

167
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:33,970
worth in the auction, they refund on your difference. But the lien, okay. Same with

168
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:39,370
the mortgage. The actual collateral you think is the house. No, it's the actual note. There's a

169
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:43,990
guy named Raja. Right. But if the note is only, let's just say the note has, you know, $10,000

170
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:49,790
left on it. Right. And they auction off the house for 40. Then that means that there's a $30,000

171
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:54,130
actually, it doesn't here. I give you a note, but does that works at all? Sorry. Well,

172
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,650
some people have gotten paid this way. I'm saying, so I'm going to explain, you know,

173
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:01,650
that's necessarily what the secure is when they do with the house. Okay. Payments are separate,

174
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:07,890
the security, which is the collateral. Okay. I've seen people, uh, it was, uh, an $80,000 mortgage.

175
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:13,310
They had $10,000 left. They couldn't do it. They left, but, and the foreclosure was for the, the

176
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:18,410
10,000 they couldn't pay or the full 80,000 all over again, the full 80,000 all over again. So

177
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:22,930
payments don't mean anything, uh, cause they're right. So anyway, you don't get a mortgage,

178
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:26,870
you don't, but anyway, the whole thing is he gets into some of the things with car loans.

179
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:30,810
You can do anything, anyone in anything that asks for a social security number,

180
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:37,010
that's your credit card. Now the guy Raja, uh, back in the day, about 2012, 2013, he, they,

181
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:42,550
he found out about this and he was an accountant that did forensic accounting where you use Fidelity

182
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:46,730
Merrill Lynch to get into the accounts. And he says, if this is true, I'm going to look up the

183
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:51,650
mortgage I got for a $400,000 house. And he found out that it was sold so many times it created

184
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:57,590
$90 million worth of transactions. Wow. Doesn't, doesn't mean it made 90 million. Just, it just

185
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:02,350
got flipped so many times that if you add it up, every time it flipped became 90 million worth of

186
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:08,810
transactions in the economy. He flipped out, sued Wells Fargo. And the second time they went to

187
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:14,450
court Wells Fargo outside of the courtroom offered him a job. I can get more into about Raja. That's

188
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:22,310
another thing. But, uh, so this goes on and on now. Um, what's his name? The, uh, uh, the fellow

189
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:28,910
I just mentioned, see, I'm not even, I'm all too, uh, Mansa. I've talked about getting accounts with

190
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:34,450
Fidelity, for example, they're the cheapest or Merrill Lynch. He went to them, he got an account.

191
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:39,090
He says, listen, I want you to look up, uh, an account for me. And they asked me, do you have

192
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:42,530
the QSIP number? He said, no, he gives them the account. They don't tell them what it's for,

193
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:47,430
for federal, for Fidelity or Merrill Lynch to look up. And these account numbers are long

194
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:53,070
enough that they're self-identifying. You know what I mean? Okay. So he gave him his Verizon

195
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:56,450
cell phone account and he says, I want you to look up this account if it's being traded

196
00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:00,030
internationally. And on the online, the guy on the computer in real time is like, yeah, it is,

197
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:07,869
uh, for 17 million, his phone bill account, you know, when he opened the account and he's like,

198
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:12,609
damn. And then he started looking up other accounts and the federal, the Fidelity guy says,

199
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:16,589
you're, you, what do you do, man? You have a lot of spending going on here. Cause he thought

200
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:20,450
the accounts that he was giving were like corporate accounts, not the social security,

201
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:26,030
what he gave out social securities for, you know? So he, he says, you're running a hundred

202
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:29,670
million dollars over the past five years. What kind of business are you doing? He,

203
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:33,550
just from a social security number, he didn't tell the guy Fidelity, he's given him cell phone

204
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:40,390
accounts and a business, I mean, um, you know, child payment, uh, service payments and basic

205
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:44,270
credit cards. You can tell them that because when you're looking up these numbers, it doesn't

206
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:49,730
classify them really. It just, it puts them in a general category, international domestic, right?

207
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:57,530
Transferable NPIs and all that stuff. So he was basically running all the accounts that he knew

208
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:01,310
who he had given a social security number to five years ago, running a hundred, over a hundred

209
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:06,350
million dollars worth of transactions. Doesn't mean there's a hundred million there. No,

210
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:11,890
it's transit. In other words, you don't want the money. You want the credit because put,

211
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:17,590
put it this way. Like he says, if you have a credit card and you have a deal, you create a deal with

212
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:25,370
the, uh, uh, credit card company, the servicer, their servicers that every month you just endorse

213
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:30,450
the bill, send it back. Right. You can get it. Let me put it this way. Why do you need cash money?

214
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:36,590
Tell me what you really can't get with a credit without with a credit card. What can you not get?

215
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,950
Right. Weren't you mentioning that there's something called cash app or something? You

216
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:44,110
got your weed dealer or whatever you give them a cash app, right? Almost anything you could do.

217
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:48,630
Yeah. The cash app they have a, what do they call it? There's a bunch of different ones. Yeah.

218
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:53,450
China. So yeah. So what you do is you could throw down some classes or have a little

219
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:58,050
bullshit subscription podcast or whatever. You get your cash from that for the weed man.

220
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:03,570
Right. Yeah. So, so otherwise, if you have a credit card that you just basically endorsed

221
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:08,170
at the end of every month or whatever billing period, they decide to give it to you on,

222
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:13,230
you're good to go. Right. You can spell like you said, I just spent the whole day in my draws.

223
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:18,270
I don't even know what day it is. No need because yeah, you got it right there. You just use everyone

224
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:23,830
is like this. If you have a social security number, you can do this too. Uh, and for years I've been

225
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:29,150
talking about, there's so many things you can do with, with credit cards, even just applying for

226
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:35,690
jobs, applying for jobs. You can make money applying for the job anyway. And someone asked

227
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:40,710
me about that recently. And I don't think that's the way to go. It's pretty tough to do it. Uh,

228
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,690
but you know, and I'm not talking to applying for a mom and pop store,

229
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:48,950
trying to like a big corporation. When they ask you certain questions and you don't want to give

230
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:52,570
them the information and they give you that in writing, you got lit a federal litigation

231
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:57,190
for three times what the salary is. So I knew that I'm not going to mention

232
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:01,790
application to like dollar general who would, would work this way. Cause they're a large

233
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:06,850
corporation. Yeah. They would ask, right. So the woman, she was doing hotel maintenance,

234
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:13,190
okay. Uh, cleaning lady, a hotel, she was looking for a job and they got to me and I said, Oh,

235
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:17,710
really? They said that, get it right. They got it writing. So wherever the salary was three times,

236
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:21,350
she assumed when they got it. So all you gotta do is apply for a job once a month and make a

237
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:25,450
hundred grand a month, you know, not right away in litigation. If you get the paper,

238
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:30,510
or if it's like the law, you know, sometimes they, they make a re you, you know, give it to me in

239
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:33,570
writing like, no, we won't give it to you in writing. Well, then it's kind of hard to prove

240
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:37,630
that they're breaking, you know, that they're right. Right. Quote, unquote, breaking the law,

241
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:43,130
but sometimes they're stupid enough to put it in writing. Now, I believe certain acts, if you tell

242
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:47,170
them that is being recorded in the beginning of the recording, that voice testimony recording is

243
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:53,870
good enough in some States. I know it is in, uh, in, in some of this, I know it's not in some of

244
00:20:53,870 --> 00:21:00,610
the States and you put it that way. Right. Like in Arizona, it's not, but what they call a single

245
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:05,030
party, like only one party needs to know in other States, both parties need to be informed as long

246
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:09,030
as they're informed. Right. Kind of like Rodney King, you know, they couldn't use the videotape

247
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:14,270
as evidence, right. Remember? Right. But if you, if you tell generally in most States though, most

248
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:19,030
in the United States, uh, if you basically inform the other person, look, you're being,

249
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:22,250
that's why they do that when they call you up and they go, this is being recorded.

250
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:25,890
You know, they tell you it's for training purposes, blah, blah, blah, blah, but it doesn't

251
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:31,550
matter. They informed you when it's not being recorded because here's the thing, the amount of,

252
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:35,870
it has to be organized when it's recorded. And I don't think they're investing in that. They're

253
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:41,090
just saying it's being recorded just in case. Yeah. Right. It's a precautionary. Uh, so anyway,

254
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:45,850
yeah. Pending, I'm saying this three times, you had a pending endorsement pending, uh, for,

255
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:51,430
again, what I've, I'm working on my acoustic modules and some stuff getting prepared for

256
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:55,870
potential big water project, which I'm keeping private right now. I think I shared a little bit

257
00:21:55,870 --> 00:22:03,150
with you, Chuck. Um, and, uh, working around here, like call it the shop, you know, the back of the

258
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:07,210
shed where all the stuff that it's called the art department, you know, when something doesn't come

259
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:13,170
right, we put it behind the shed. That's the art department. Okay. Get it. So, um, I have, uh,

260
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:18,950
outdoor sun. So while I'm doing what I'm doing during the day, I can afford to have on a podcast

261
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:24,530
or someone speaking, you know, over the airwaves here. So that's how I pretty much get my studying

262
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:29,870
done. If I'm not doing black ink on white paper reading, which I'm starting to appreciate again,

263
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:34,470
by the way, there's something about having, you know, the right reading glasses for my story asked

264
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:38,910
and, uh, the right amount of light to read a book, right? To actually read.

265
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:43,530
I've always said, I never appreciate it because people are like, Oh, you got to appreciate,

266
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:47,490
you know, you can have a million books on this device. And I'm like, no, no, no, no. Yeah. But

267
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:53,310
looking at it for summer, even what's that thing made for a reading? Uh, it's a little thing.

268
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:58,730
Yeah, that's right. Even that thing doesn't just doesn't do it. There's something about the

269
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:04,830
reflective light, not the generated light that works. So, uh, works well. It has a lot of effect

270
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:10,130
on the mind. Maybe it's, uh, you know, one thing I want to get on, by the way, also just total

271
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:15,190
segue. I think I'm done with that section of it, but I did post a video on the to tango,

272
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:22,830
which is, I wrote, watch this video, you know, before your next meal. Um, so the other thing is,

273
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:27,690
uh, what are we doing here? Essentially I've been thinking about this past few days is all these,

274
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:32,510
you know, how people say, oh yeah, you want to find an exit. Don't get into the soul trap.

275
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:37,810
There's an exodus period. I'm like, okay, that's fine. If you believe in reincarnation, by the way,

276
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:43,550
um, or you think, let's say you ponder it right now, but let's say it's considered right.

277
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:48,290
And that word considered me something totally different in contract law. But anyway,

278
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:53,770
when you can think about the afterlife of the, uh, I just gave it away reincarnation

279
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:59,110
and you were here before that makes this your incarnation. Now the afterlife does,

280
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:02,510
if not it's an afterlife to something that came before it. Yeah, that's right. Well,

281
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:10,210
just to say it makes this the, the afterlife or an afterlife. So then, so actually talking about

282
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:16,150
reincarnation negates the concepts of afterlife, right? Because you see, so, and then there's

283
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:20,010
discussions about this, that are the other, the soul trap coming down. And I'm like, but wait a

284
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:26,190
second. When people said afterlife, they literally mean a different type of circumstance that you

285
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:31,390
ascend to. That's outside. I always thought that, but if you're doing a reincarnation,

286
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:35,890
that negates that because each time you come around is another after life. It's another light

287
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:40,110
after the one, no one's discussing that. Here's the thing that one is discussing.

288
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:45,730
What about people that were sent here on administrative error and they weren't

289
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:50,510
supposed to be here. It was a fuck up. Now what? Oh, I said, well, God, I'll make no mistakes.

290
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:55,290
I'll see you. But we've already established, even in any Holy book, that the gods have people that

291
00:24:55,290 --> 00:25:00,730
work for them that take care of all this little silly shit. Like who gets to incarnate on earth,

292
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:07,470
let's say, right? So those guys are fallible. Are they not? Yes. As we find out that the angels are

293
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:12,070
quite fallible. The ones that are popular, politically correct are called angels and

294
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:15,770
saints. And the ones that are not politically correct at the time are called demons, right?

295
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:22,930
But they're all the same anyway. So, so what I would say here is there is no discussion

296
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:29,090
on people that were set here, spirits that were put here incarnated into a soul and a body

297
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:36,530
that was due to what administrative error. There's plenty of films about that kind of stuff.

298
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:41,450
There was a movie Brazil where they went and hunted this guy down because it was a clerical

299
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:46,530
error, right? A fly went on the typewriter and it was bottle instead of title. And right. There's

300
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:52,410
mistakes where a number, right. The number falls off and it's a wrong number. And the SWAT team

301
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:57,530
comes in there, you know, so whatever, or even in the case of a social security number, somebody

302
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:02,750
hits a five instead of a six, you know, or it looks like a six instead of five because it got

303
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:06,990
smeared. That's just a credit card. Social security can not be used for identification. Please read

304
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:12,190
the back of it. And if it's lost, return it back. It's not yours. It's theirs. Yeah. So yeah,

305
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:16,690
but I get it. Okay. So what about, there is no discussion about people sent here

306
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:21,110
by administrative. I didn't say by accident, because I don't believe this is thing as an

307
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:25,850
accident. I'm going to bounce around one more thing because you know how I've been talking

308
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:31,130
about yin and yang for a long time. It's the balances. I gave the can of beans last time as

309
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:36,710
an example. Right. One thing that I didn't get into too much, the bouncing back and forth, you know,

310
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:41,930
the can of beans that I did last week, the reason that you have the bouncing back and forth is the

311
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:48,450
balance, right? When, right, you have expansion balanced by contraction. So we have that, when I

312
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:53,910
say, I don't believe in accidents, this is why, because when I hear someone, oh, how such and so,

313
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:57,710
and they say, well, they got into an accident. They went through a windshield. I said, oh,

314
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:01,490
you know, most, the first thing that runs through my mind when I hear about someone going through

315
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:06,710
a windshield, I said, man, that person was so yin that they needed to go through a windshield

316
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:13,750
to make them yang. It's a balance you see. So when you fall, break your leg, that's you don't,

317
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:18,290
you see it as a misfortune, but in the big scheme, the energetic scheme, it's actually

318
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:23,450
you making balance. So when you're really far out one way, you still seem you're okay. Bam,

319
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:28,530
you get hit with something to bring you into balance. Just like when you pull a rubber band

320
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:34,030
really far and slingshot, let it go. It's not just attention. It's going the other way to make

321
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:39,390
balance to where it was before you pulled on the thing, right? You see, you're pulling it slow,

322
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:43,130
stretching. It's becoming yin, yin, yin can't come anymore. Yin, you let it go. Then boom,

323
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:49,090
yang, yang is very fast and very sharp. So when I hear about what's called an accident

324
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:54,810
or, you know, misfortunate events to people and talk to their person, to the body,

325
00:27:55,730 --> 00:28:00,790
I think my mind goes already. It's when I think about what was the cause of the most fortune?

326
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:06,530
Oh my gosh, that was one hell of a young reaction. I want to know that most people say,

327
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:10,590
I want to know how they are now that they, you know, went through the car accident. I'm like,

328
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:15,890
no, no, no. I want to know how they were right before the car accident. That's what you want

329
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:20,950
to avoid. Cause you couldn't avoid, right? Because if you avoided the condition or how they were

330
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:26,230
prior to the car accident, guess what? That car accident would not have happened. And this is

331
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:30,670
also shown in movies, two people arguing, looking at each other in the car and then bam, they get

332
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:35,030
hit. Right? Well, I'll give you a simple example. I got hit by a guy on a bicycle. I told you some

333
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:41,070
weeks ago and it slammed me down and hurt me pretty bad. But here's the thing. If I had actually

334
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:47,210
stepped probably like three feet to my right and decided to walk in a slightly different path,

335
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:52,150
I wouldn't have been in the path. This guy was on to hit me. Right. Well, then you got to see

336
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:58,270
if, did it knock you down? Did you both fall down? This is not, you know, this is not all these

337
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:04,330
little details during the thing, but what's more important to again, this guy, I know he did go

338
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:08,710
through a windshield and when I, when he recovered, he had, you could see the facial scars and all

339
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:14,330
that. Cause you still, even though it's safety glass, it will tear you up. Oh yeah. Excuse me.

340
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:17,690
Matter of fact, I think it tears you up worse, to be honest with you. The safety glasses,

341
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:21,930
they go through that. That's even more harsh. Cause it, it kind of, yeah. Well, yeah. Yeah.

342
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:29,230
It won't be a clean cut. Um, the, um, the, uh, I knew him before and after he's personality and

343
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:34,050
everything completely changed, uh, after that also. So, but anyway, when most people are like,

344
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:38,690
oh, how are they? I said, again, repeating myself, I want to know what they were doing just before,

345
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:42,870
just before. And they're like, why? I'm like, oh my gosh, you know, it's too much to explain,

346
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:48,650
but I figured I'd give this here because the, the idea of understanding balance that's why I'm

347
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:53,190
still looking for another way to explain meaning young, because it has nothing to do with modifying

348
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:58,490
some Asian philosophy. It has to do with everything forming a balance, pressure, mediation,

349
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:03,950
temperature mediation, which is also pressure mediation, uh, event mediation.

350
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:08,950
Right. How many times have you heard like, oh, that crowd is so angry. They're about to,

351
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:13,530
you know, explode. Right. Right. Let's do something to calm them down. Right. Mediation

352
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:18,250
of events. Right. Oh, you can observe that. If you observe a crowd, if you step away from it,

353
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:21,970
you can sort of see when they're going to get out. I mean, cause I used to do security and you could

354
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:28,290
see, you could predict what you were about to see, because I mean, you could sense that things were

355
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:32,970
coming to attention. You could see people getting closer together. You could see people starting to

356
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:38,530
push more and you could see the action begin before something bad would sort of blow up out

357
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:43,870
of it. You know what I mean? Uh, for the crowd, uh, Gustav Le Bon wrote a book called the crowd.

358
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:49,570
Yeah. It's crowd psychology. Excellent book. Really. Uh, what I get out of it is that he's

359
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:54,610
got the, the positives and negatives is in order when, in order to speak to the general masses on

360
00:30:54,610 --> 00:31:00,470
any concept, you have to simplify that concept so much. And so far that it no longer resembles

361
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:05,690
its original idea. That's the problem with dealing with big crowds, uh, essentially,

362
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:11,810
but he has a book called the evolution of matter, which was actually on the FBI book seizure list

363
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:19,090
for many decades. Right now, people don't know we, the FBI has had or has the dangerous,

364
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:23,690
dangerous literature, uh, kind of thing is what it's called the book seizure list, right?

365
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:28,770
Uh, the BSL, but now it's, uh, they just shut down your website, right? You go to the website

366
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:33,130
and it has an FBI page on it or something, right? That's the problem with the digital books is now

367
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:37,170
they can do what I, what I describe as digital book burning. It's much easier to flip a switch

368
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:42,310
and kill, kill a digital book and ebook. Okay. The interesting thing about that book and other

369
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:46,370
things that were written around them, other periodicals was that at the time was the time

370
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:53,930
of nuclear physics, but I'm curious, all that was talking about the 1905 or something. And, um,

371
00:31:54,110 --> 00:32:00,790
by the way, we had Dimitri here and you know, the, the nuclear thermonuclear devices and all that,

372
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:04,410
that was all well known and successfully tested in the 18 hundreds, by the way,

373
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:10,930
but on small scale, you could still see small scale nuclear detonations, uh, declassified

374
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:17,070
military where they make a small nuke and it's a, the diameter is only about six feet, right?

375
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:21,770
So it's very, very contained, but this was very well known by that. Not very well known, but it

376
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:27,330
was established that it was possible and known to be a direction they were moving in. He kind of

377
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:31,390
poked fun at the establishment saying, Hey, you can take a ordinary material, certain metals

378
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:35,770
and make them fissionable. There's no atomic fission, by the way, that's just a way to

379
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:41,050
describe and not explain what's going on. And that's, I think what, that's what I think put

380
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:47,670
it on the, uh, book seizure list, but it is available online. I don't, it, and the scans

381
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:53,990
do not look like they've been redacted and they do. He does give the material properties of things

382
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:59,270
that can be used as I explained, but no one's going to make anything like that. I'm just saying

383
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:04,350
that what we've been sold a bag of goods, the purpose of understanding what he's speaking of

384
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:09,250
is for certain, if you, you've heard of like unlimited energy or material production,

385
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:13,710
you can modify certain things like aluminum and mercury and things like that to do what,

386
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:18,610
you know, you only read about Los Alamos laboratory does with $500 million. You can do

387
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:24,030
yourself that if you, if you understand, you understand the concept and follow, you know,

388
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:29,730
what he's, what he's given with directions. So, you know, this whole thing about energy and all

389
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:35,630
that is a, is a whole other blast, so to speak. It doesn't work the way we've been told. Um,

390
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:39,310
but anyway, yeah, I think that's a, that's, unless you've got any questions or anything,

391
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:44,510
maybe this is it. Yep. I think we're good. Okay.
