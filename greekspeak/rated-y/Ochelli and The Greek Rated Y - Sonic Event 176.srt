1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,340
And Sonic Event 176, here we are, and

2
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:17,680
we're actually live on a screen tonight, trying

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,440
this out on Saturdays, looks like.

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,020
Greg, you wanted to do this, right?

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,080
Yeah, let's see if we can get some

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,380
interaction.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,180
That looks like there's about nine people or

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,820
so, or eight people.

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,320
Yeah.

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,380
Me on there, now there's seven or whatever

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,360
bouncing around, so I don't know if they

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:33,920
can hear us.

13
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,180
If you guys out there can hear us,

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,380
type something in the chat, right?

15
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:39,380
Yeah, please do.

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,120
You can type in there as anonymous, or

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,480
you can use the name on the chatango,

18
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,580
if you like, either way.

19
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,000
Yeah.

20
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,720
I think there's a delay, right?

21
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,040
About 30 seconds or less?

22
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:48,760
Yeah, it could be.

23
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,480
It could be about 30 seconds, depending on

24
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:50,920
compression.

25
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,860
It's a little irregular.

26
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,760
I use a slightly cheaper streamer, so it's

27
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,400
a little irregular, but it works, you know?

28
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,340
Yeah.

29
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,520
Anyway, so, should we start with the yin

30
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,580
and yang right now?

31
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,440
Because I think that's a good one, and

32
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,300
we've been getting feedback about that.

33
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,300
Yeah, it's important, that's how you use to

34
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,580
discern what's going on around you, whether it's

35
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,620
physical or non-physical.

36
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:15,700
Right.

37
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,300
And it never lets you down if you

38
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:17,800
do it right.

39
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,680
Here, I'll start with it, okay, yin and

40
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,960
yang, the concept of yin and yang is

41
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,300
yang.

42
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,140
So, when you're approaching something to see if

43
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,040
this is yin or yang, or using universal

44
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,640
principles, it's a yang principle, because it's focused,

45
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:34,780
right?

46
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,180
So, if you're looking at something to determine

47
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,840
whether this is yin or yang, meaning expansive,

48
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:49,640
cooling, soft, or is it contractive, warm, and

49
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,200
hard, right?

50
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,580
Those are the two contrasts.

51
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,860
When you approach something to try to diagnose

52
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,780
that, to see what it is, because you

53
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,340
know the opposites will be involved, and a

54
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,600
balance is trying to be found, that is

55
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,640
actually a yang approach, and a yang condition,

56
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,420
let's say.

57
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,340
And because of that, now that's funny, because

58
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,240
we're trying to objectify yin and yang, right?

59
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,820
See how difficult it is to objectify?

60
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,000
Well, yeah, and some things, you know...

61
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,080
You'll say, well, what is it?

62
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,260
And because you're still searching, that's the yin

63
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,820
part of it, because you don't have the

64
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,380
answer yet.

65
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,940
So, the question, questions are always yin, and

66
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,400
answers are always yang.

67
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,760
What if you ask a very specific question,

68
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,480
that's more of a yang question, but it's

69
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,600
still in the yin category.

70
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,560
So, a very narrow answer.

71
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:43,820
Specific.

72
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,080
Specific, okay.

73
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,300
Well, let's say you ask a specific question,

74
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,960
and all questions are yin, but if you

75
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,380
make it really specific and poignant, that's more

76
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:52,720
yang.

77
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,940
And if you get an answer that is

78
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:00,880
kind of general, that's a yin answer, even

79
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,900
though answers are yang.

80
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,160
So, there's a category within each...

81
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,380
Pixels are very much like this.

82
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,900
Gray matter, if you look real close, a

83
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,900
gray pixel, a gray tone will look like

84
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:18,000
black and white, varying amounts of pixels, right?

85
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,580
That's why the yin and yang symbol has

86
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,040
that, right?

87
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:20,800
Black and white.

88
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,680
But it's not really black and white.

89
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,900
It just shows you how it's broken up.

90
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,820
So, I've always, like I was in a

91
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,540
four-hour conference call with engineers and investors

92
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,800
and all that today, right?

93
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,640
And now, you don't want to be in

94
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,100
a four-hour conference call with me about

95
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,560
water and how things work, right?

96
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,300
No, you don't want to be in a

97
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,780
call like that, because...

98
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,280
Anyway, actually, you might want to, you might

99
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,620
want to, but it all ended up okay.

100
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,180
It was fine, but I was being very

101
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,120
yang as I, you know, giving, you know,

102
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,940
and they were very yin, and I expected

103
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,100
them to be yin and not get any

104
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:07,680
pushback.

105
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,980
And if I did get any pushback, it

106
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,180
was a very yin push.

107
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,620
They couldn't be specific because the specifics I

108
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,519
give are undeniable.

109
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,000
You see how it works?

110
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:18,940
Yeah, okay.

111
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,800
So, it's back and forth.

112
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,240
So, you can actually use the yin and

113
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,720
yang when you interact with people over a

114
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,300
meeting, you know, over...

115
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,640
It was a conference call over the phone,

116
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,420
partly other parts of the world, and yeah.

117
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:34,940
And I know how it's going to go

118
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:39,780
because I, you know, I see the question

119
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:44,160
is yin, you know, and it was very,

120
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,100
very yin questions, you know, right?

121
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,760
The questions were very unspecific.

122
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,240
So the only...

123
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,980
I said, let me fire back with a

124
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,920
very hard specific, right?

125
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,800
The opposite and see what happens, and it,

126
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,880
yeah, pretty interesting.

127
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,000
So, you know, you could say four or

128
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,740
five people got educated today, and the whole

129
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,100
time I'm analyzing what, you know, what's going

130
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,680
on back and forth, and it stayed in

131
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,920
harmony for four hours.

132
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,820
It was supposed to be a half-hour

133
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,140
call.

134
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,660
That happens to me all the time.

135
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,840
But you have to be conscious of what's

136
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,280
going on, and you have to control.

137
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,500
How many times have you heard me said,

138
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,120
if you go into a situation with other

139
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,040
people and you don't take control, that situation

140
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,980
right there is out of control.

141
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,140
Because, right?

142
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm not saying some people could interpret that

143
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,300
as like you're a control freak, dude, right?

144
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,400
No, not at all.

145
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,820
You're just making the best of what's going

146
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,520
on is the point, right?

147
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,260
Okay.

148
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,720
Well, what happens when it does get chaotic,

149
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,660
though, and people are speaking at a turn?

150
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,820
I mean, would you consider that as a

151
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,720
situation like that, either yin or yang?

152
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,240
It depends if it's specific chaos or just

153
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,160
general chaos.

154
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,360
General chaos would be a public show or

155
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,120
a wrestling match or a concert, and someone

156
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,900
throws a chair.

157
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,300
And then suddenly, within 10 seconds, there's another

158
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:02,880
brawl here.

159
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,540
It's very unspecific, right?

160
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,720
A specific chaos would be someone says something,

161
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,840
and the whole crowd answers against them specifically,

162
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:15,440
right?

163
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,180
So there's different ways to look at it,

164
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,400
yeah.

165
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,240
So general, okay, here's it.

166
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,080
When you have that general, someone throws a

167
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,840
chair, and then before you know it, the

168
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,020
entire audience is in brawls, right?

169
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,280
The only thing you could do there is

170
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,660
let it peter out on its own, right?

171
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,280
Because it's too unspecific.

172
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,680
Or you come in very specifically with just

173
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,260
one thing, tear gas, one thing, a loud

174
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,880
horn, right?

175
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,940
Something very separate, you know, the boys in

176
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,680
blue or something.

177
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,820
You have to be very, there's no multiple

178
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,380
ways.

179
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,780
When you have general chaos, you have to

180
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,620
come in with one hard insertion.

181
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,900
Sort of like, I hate to do this

182
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,460
because it's like, you know, school teachers, right?

183
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,560
They come into a room and there's a

184
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,880
lot of conversations going on.

185
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,920
There's noise, et cetera.

186
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,240
In my school, a lot of them used

187
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,220
to take a book and slam it on

188
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,440
the desk and create.

189
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,260
That's right.

190
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,000
That's right.

191
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,420
You have to, we normally do these principles

192
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,180
anyway.

193
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,520
We don't think of them as such, but

194
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,120
think of the advantage you have is if

195
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,340
you start breaking things down, universal principle, you

196
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,940
get to it much faster, much quicker.

197
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,980
Now, things that people usually do is because

198
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,420
they've heard about it or they did it

199
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,500
repetitively and it worked, but they didn't never

200
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,480
approached these things with a methodology on universal

201
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,000
principle.

202
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,340
You see?

203
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,920
So you have a major advantage that way.

204
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,200
Right?

205
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:38,300
Right.

206
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:39,640
Right.

207
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:39,740
Okay.

208
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,680
That makes sense.

209
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,660
That makes a lot of sense.

210
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,880
Now, the one of the yin and yang

211
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,080
questions that came in, actually, I found it,

212
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,740
I didn't have it when we first went

213
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:51,640
live here, but, um, is, uh, you have

214
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,080
various states that water can end up in,

215
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:58,420
uh, and obviously a young state for water

216
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,780
would be ice, uh, but a yin state

217
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,820
would be steam.

218
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,480
Now, if water is simply at room temperature,

219
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,000
hold on ice, when it goes young hard,

220
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,560
it also exhibits yin, which is expansion and,

221
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,380
and water vapor, regardless of temperature is young

222
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,220
because it's small.

223
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,100
Like the most young element is hydrogen, not

224
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,440
has nothing to do with H2O.

225
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,880
By the way, I recently posted, oh yeah,

226
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,900
that was water is water is not H2O

227
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,799
and the AI agreed pretty much.

228
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,220
Yeah.

229
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,000
And when I had been saying that I'm

230
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,860
the only person that I've ever heard say

231
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,640
that and for 20 years now, but at

232
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,460
least the, you know, AI knows.

233
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:43,480
Yeah.

234
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,140
Uh, yeah.

235
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,340
How did you discover that?

236
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,940
How did you actually discover that though?

237
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,520
Because you know, to me by reading, just

238
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,420
by reading their stuff, yeah.

239
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,900
The initial, I discovered, well, how do they

240
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,200
figure out water is H2O?

241
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,160
And I read the original experiment 300 years

242
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,140
ago, it has to do with metal plates

243
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,200
and ionization and breaking it into a gas.

244
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,100
And in three days they decided because it

245
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,440
separates into hydrogen and oxygen gas, water is

246
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,860
made up of those two gases, rubbish because

247
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,940
you can't take any given volume of water

248
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,000
and reduce it completely to hydrogen and oxygen

249
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,540
just can't do it.

250
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,580
So also for people that are listening live,

251
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,920
I can see you in the chat room

252
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,460
and all that by all means.

253
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,180
Uh, if you have a question or a

254
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,660
comment, yeah, absolutely.

255
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,920
Feel free to type it in.

256
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,360
Uh, you know, I, I see, uh, have

257
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,980
you noticed a TX, a two nine, you

258
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:36,700
know, and a Vandy Vandy man's land.

259
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,020
Okay.

260
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,600
Uh, I see those names specifically and a

261
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,620
few ainons, but ainons can type in the

262
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,320
chat room as well.

263
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,340
It doesn't wait.

264
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,020
I was just, you know what?

265
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,220
I might have to change a setting.

266
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,980
I might've actually shut off the ainons.

267
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,800
Let me fix that.

268
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,300
Uh, I forgot about my chat settings, you

269
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,180
know, cause we have a chat room for

270
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,960
Ocelli in the Greek and uh, no end

271
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,560
ons on that.

272
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:55,780
Yeah.

273
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,300
Yeah.

274
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,220
Well, because it kind of gets bombed.

275
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,800
I think it's a bot doing it or

276
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,580
it doesn't matter.

277
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,940
It's been very civil.

278
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,680
The atmosphere around the stuff that I do

279
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,440
has been very civil.

280
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,880
Um, and when people get uncivil or whatever,

281
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,180
they just need a little bit of schooling

282
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,080
or what they call a touch up, a

283
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,720
little touch up.

284
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:13,980
Right.

285
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:14,980
Right.

286
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:15,660
Okay.

287
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,560
So we do have a text question by

288
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,620
the way, and it is, let's see, let

289
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,100
me lean over here so I can make

290
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:22,840
sure I get it right.

291
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,740
Uh, swelling in the left knee.

292
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,820
Is that a young condition?

293
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,660
I know below the waist is young, but

294
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:34,720
in an expansive condition, what's going on there?

295
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,580
It's a, it's blocking a moment.

296
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:37,820
Yeah.

297
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,580
Well, it's, it's a yin.

298
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,660
It's okay.

299
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,440
What's happening.

300
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,420
It's young going.

301
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,480
The left side of the energy goes out

302
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,640
of the body, goes downward.

303
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:53,020
So something is swollen to slow down because

304
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,660
there's too much young flowing through there to

305
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,000
slow it.

306
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,200
Remember, these are roadblocks.

307
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,260
Whenever you have a physical manifestation in the

308
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,940
body, it's no different than a physical manifestation

309
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,160
known as a roadblock, right?

310
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,780
Whether it's a speed bump, you have speed

311
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,140
bumps, barricades, right?

312
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,620
You don't want the, what is it called?

313
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,640
The chain with the spikes.

314
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,440
You don't want that one, but essentially that's

315
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,140
an analogy.

316
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,760
So what it's doing there is the increasing

317
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,340
mass.

318
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,400
It's becoming more yin because there's a lot

319
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,800
of young going down there.

320
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,480
So the increasing, because there's more young traveling

321
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,260
down that side than the other side, because

322
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,840
that's the side that things go downward.

323
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,400
The initial balancing is to expand the area,

324
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,640
which is yin, which is right.

325
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,600
And then the, the other thing is because

326
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,120
it's leaving the body, it has to leave

327
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,940
at a certain rate.

328
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,940
It's either leaving too fast or too slow.

329
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,600
And if you have swelling and it's not

330
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,640
due to a very hard action, like, you

331
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,440
know, jumping off, you know, hurting the knee

332
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,880
and it's just manifesting on its own, it's,

333
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,320
uh, the young is in the protective side

334
00:11:59,320 --> 00:11:59,840
of the body.

335
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,160
The young is trying to leave the body

336
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,120
quicker than it should.

337
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,460
So one way to fix that is by

338
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,540
becoming more yin by sleeping more.

339
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,920
That's why I'm a big proponent of sleep

340
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,640
therapy for many things, right?

341
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,820
Well, quite often when you feel a little

342
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,900
off, actually, I think you tell me I'm

343
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,080
going to like take a nap.

344
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:16,400
Kind of.

345
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,120
That's one of your practices for sort of

346
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,960
resetting, right?

347
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,280
It can be.

348
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:20,580
Yeah.

349
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,280
Yeah.

350
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,080
I'm big on it.

351
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:22,340
Yeah.

352
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:22,720
Anything.

353
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,460
Even from a two.

354
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:24,720
Yeah.

355
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,280
Whatever.

356
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,420
Just sleep therapy.

357
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,260
It doesn't have to be adding hours to

358
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,340
the amount that you sleep during the night.

359
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,740
It would be like maybe every three or

360
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,460
four hours, take a one hour nap and

361
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,020
that would be more therapeutic than resting for

362
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,320
20 or 30 minutes.

363
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,080
We actually fall asleep.

364
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:41,280
Yeah.

365
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,940
But if you, I found that if you

366
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,180
try to schedule it, you say, okay, it's

367
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,700
two o'clock time to do some sleep

368
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,060
therapy.

369
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,600
You'll be sitting there staring at the ceiling

370
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,160
for an hour.

371
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,220
Yeah.

372
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,220
I noticed that when I decide there's a

373
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,060
hard time to go to sleep, it's always

374
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:54,660
right.

375
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,160
Yeah.

376
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:55,660
Yeah.

377
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,600
What would you say?

378
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,780
That's the, you're telling the body to be

379
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,000
yin.

380
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,580
It's like, no, let's balance that off by

381
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,760
being young and focused.

382
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,940
It's kind of like the same thing when

383
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,580
you say, I'm going to fast on Monday,

384
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,500
Monday comes around and you are so hungry,

385
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:10,700
right?

386
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,400
Not on that day that you scheduled for

387
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,140
fasting than you normally would be.

388
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,920
It's really odd how that works.

389
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,280
So we're distracting yourself when you're waiting for

390
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,640
a pot to boil kind of thing.

391
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,320
It seems to go quicker because you're now,

392
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,120
it's, it's the emo kicking in.

393
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:25,540
It's emo.

394
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,060
Okay.

395
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,780
And yin and yang and emo are related.

396
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,360
Oh, there's another piece to that question.

397
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:31,720
Sorry.

398
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,720
I just rolled on it.

399
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,860
They ask about fire because a fire has

400
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,680
different effects on different materials and it in

401
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,860
and of itself is a yin reaction, right?

402
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,060
That's what they're asking.

403
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:52,120
But sometimes it creates a young reaction and

404
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,960
other times it creates a yin reaction.

405
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,040
It seems like something turns to, I'm just,

406
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,780
yeah, it's flip flips, right?

407
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,920
It's like the checkerboard pattern.

408
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:05,680
So imagine the checkerboard pattern, each adjacent to

409
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,820
whether you're looking at a black square or,

410
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,940
or a white square, you know, a red

411
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,760
or black or whatever.

412
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:14,380
There's another opposite color adjacent to it, but

413
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,540
in a different direction.

414
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:16,780
Hmm.

415
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,580
See, I'm thinking of those, you know, remember

416
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,500
those old desks, stupid things with the, you

417
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,100
know, the metal balls that bang back and

418
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:22,600
forth.

419
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,120
Yeah.

420
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,420
The momentum can sell conservation, Newtonian, the thing

421
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,920
about that is the fact that it goes

422
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,920
one way and hits and goes the other

423
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,220
way.

424
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,000
It's like a practical demonstration of union because,

425
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,800
because it went that way, it's got to

426
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,980
go and then come back.

427
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:39,840
Yeah.

428
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:40,360
Yeah.

429
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,140
And what's cool about those, I like the

430
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,960
ones that have five or 10 balls there

431
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,460
and it's only the ones on the outside

432
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,500
that are moving, right?

433
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:48,980
Yeah.

434
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:49,900
That's a, that's an energy.

435
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You have to ponder these things and it

436
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,720
requires very fast thinking and analysis.

437
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,520
So people that are good at doing math

438
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,240
in their head will be able to do

439
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,080
this very quickly.

440
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,740
By the way.

441
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,860
Um, and if you can do, by the

442
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,480
way, I've mentioned people that are good at

443
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,600
math are also good at language because math

444
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,620
is a form of communication back and forth.

445
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,880
And people who are not good at language

446
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,160
are not good at math.

447
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:11,640
Typically.

448
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,460
I'm not saying always, but very general.

449
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,380
Like if you know someone who's not good

450
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,200
at math, ask them how many languages they

451
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,280
know and they'll say no.

452
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,040
Only English.

453
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,420
I don't, I'm not good at languages.

454
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,340
They'll volunteer the information for you.

455
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,280
Oh yeah.

456
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,080
We went over that before though.

457
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,120
That's a reaction based on something they'd seen

458
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,960
in the past though.

459
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,120
But it's, it's more of an attribute.

460
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,860
If you're not good at math, you're probably

461
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,480
not good at other languages learning.

462
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,840
Like I, I am proficient in three or

463
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,600
four languages and can say hello, goodbye and

464
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,000
thank you.

465
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:42,440
And maybe 20 languages because I, I see

466
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,000
it as being a form of communication.

467
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,960
And one of the problems we have, uh,

468
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:52,100
well, it's a systemic problem for forever.

469
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,880
It's been recorded history is, um, lack of

470
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,820
communication or effective communication.

471
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,640
You know, it's actually used against, uh, whoever

472
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,240
it can be used against, you know, look

473
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,640
at the, we've been talking a lot about

474
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,460
the financial stuff lately, right?

475
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,400
And that's about communication.

476
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,520
Um, that was today I had a conversation

477
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,360
about someone and they, and they said, uh,

478
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,460
I want to get rid of my mortgage.

479
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,700
I said, no, I can't get rid of

480
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,180
a mortgage.

481
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,800
You shouldn't.

482
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,960
Well, I want to, or I want to

483
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,780
get rid of a hospital.

484
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,800
I heard, you know how to get rid

485
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,540
of hospital bills.

486
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:23,840
Why?

487
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,800
Why do you want to get rid of

488
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,000
it?

489
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,780
Well, it can be monetized.

490
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,160
So why not do that and turn it

491
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:30,920
into something else?

492
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,840
The proper answer would be, don't you want

493
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,240
to be fair and equitable to want you

494
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:35,940
to go approach them.

495
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,800
They tell you, you can change the contract

496
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,060
with a hospital.

497
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:39,880
It's very simple.

498
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,820
They send you a bill.

499
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,560
You say, I just want to be fair

500
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:43,900
here.

501
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,340
You guys are an institution that offers services

502
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,280
that requires compensation or you ask for compensation

503
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,800
and you'd like to receive it, right?

504
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:52,140
No.

505
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:52,680
Yes, yes.

506
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,100
That's right.

507
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,800
Well, here I've given you a social security

508
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,120
number and I know, I know you have,

509
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,880
you could look up their trustee, you have

510
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,540
a so-and-so financial and they've already

511
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,839
accessed it through this act, this act, this

512
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,480
act, which you swear to uphold.

513
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,859
So you've been compensated.

514
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,839
So now you want to be compensated twice.

515
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:12,619
What does it say?

516
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,980
If it's set in the contract, you have

517
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:14,680
to pay us twice.

518
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,240
You have to pay it twice.

519
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,420
It doesn't say anywhere.

520
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,240
You have to pay it twice.

521
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:18,960
It doesn't.

522
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,640
But there's a spiritual element to honoring contracts

523
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,160
as well.

524
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,060
That's right.

525
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,720
So you just want to be honorable because

526
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,200
yeah, and usually they, they either call security

527
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:32,420
on you, which I've had done and here

528
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:32,860
they come.

529
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,420
You always know when security is coming.

530
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,120
It's all you to sit down and the

531
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,520
person you're speaking to is all the way.

532
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,860
These hallways are very long.

533
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,380
You look all the way down.

534
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,760
Why are they talking to these two security

535
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,000
guards and he's on the radio and he's

536
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,560
getting a third and they're walking faster as

537
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,560
they're getting towards me.

538
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,400
I think I should get up and maybe

539
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,460
walk out for you.

540
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,120
I always find that interesting.

541
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,520
Actually, I've observed many times that people really

542
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,680
just stay there in place and wait for

543
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,860
security to show up.

544
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,180
And I often wonder, you know, you could

545
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,000
have easily escaped.

546
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:02,300
Why?

547
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,640
Yeah, because they're not going to get in

548
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,100
the car and chase you like the popo.

549
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,520
Well, they're not going to go that far.

550
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,520
You know, I mean, you get off, you

551
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,620
get off hospital property.

552
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,620
Now it's a liability elsewhere, isn't it?

553
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:11,920
Oh yeah.

554
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,340
They will.

555
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,920
If they see you're at the door, they'll

556
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,460
just, they'll, they'll go outside and stand there

557
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,580
and look, stare you down.

558
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,860
You just, you just step over the property

559
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,060
line, you know, and stand there too, you

560
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:22,620
know, because right.

561
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,400
Like a little child, put your foot over

562
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,840
the property line and see him take a

563
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,380
step forward and take a step back.

564
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:27,880
They stop.

565
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,140
Right.

566
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,540
I was just going to say, it's like

567
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,120
shoplifting.

568
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,080
You know, once you get out of the

569
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,800
parking lot, it's over, you know, it can't

570
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:33,900
be.

571
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:34,140
Yeah.

572
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:34,620
But yeah.

573
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,960
So call it shoplifting and not stealing.

574
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:37,560
So yeah.

575
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,540
The same thing with a mortgage.

576
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,080
It tells you you can amend the contract.

577
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:40,820
Go ahead and amend it.

578
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,760
Take away their power to sell your property.

579
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,200
Remind them that it was, you, it says

580
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,820
in every mortgage says that you hold the

581
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,780
property fee simple.

582
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,240
Most people don't know what that means.

583
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,100
Fee simple means you own it and you

584
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,220
get, you put it in there and your

585
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,020
trust store, you're the grantor and you're firing

586
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,460
them as trustee cause you don't like why,

587
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,220
you know, the job they're doing.

588
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:01,600
Right.

589
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,260
They're appointing another trust.

590
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,540
And, uh, by the way, um, the most

591
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,420
taking away your security interest and I'd like

592
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,760
to take part in any kind of securities

593
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,700
tradings if you sold it more than once

594
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,460
and, uh, you sworn and I know your

595
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,680
trustee and all this and the sec is,

596
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,400
uh, very, it's got, they're overstaffed with people

597
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,380
that are underworked, uh, you know, sec, uh,

598
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:29,700
FINRA and these other regulatory authorities, they have

599
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,580
offices with 30 or 40 people that are

600
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,200
doing nothing.

601
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,180
They're watching porn and playing video games all

602
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:34,420
day.

603
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,400
Those are the, those are the ones that

604
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,820
are hired to do consumer affairs and none,

605
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,040
none of the consumers are calling.

606
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,520
The consumers go to attorneys or they try

607
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,540
to argue it themselves.

608
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,980
You call the sec on one of these

609
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,660
companies, they'll put you on speakerphone and like

610
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,920
they'll tell you and put you on speakerphone

611
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,400
cause there's like four or five agents that

612
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,460
have nothing to do and they all want

613
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,140
to be part here.

614
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,560
What you got, what you have to say

615
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,400
and they're on your side.

616
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:57,920
Yeah.

617
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,420
It's crazy.

618
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,300
It's crazy.

619
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,800
I think they do that during the time

620
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,520
they're, they're giving you the, uh, the spiel

621
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,680
about, you know, this may be recorded for

622
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,120
whatever purposes, you know, training purposes.

623
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,280
No, it's different.

624
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,100
It's very different.

625
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:09,680
Believe it or not.

626
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,480
It's very humane.

627
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,180
I should say.

628
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,660
So, uh, yeah, it's quite interesting.

629
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,680
Um, by the way, I had this four

630
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,020
hour conversation today.

631
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,480
It's a conference call actually with water engineers

632
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,200
and investors and it basically gave them the

633
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,580
thing that, you know, this world is, if

634
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,260
you've been here for more than 30 days

635
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,780
on this planet and don't know these things,

636
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,260
you're kind of in trouble and it's a,

637
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,160
and the world is populated by idiots and

638
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,760
morons, you know, very few exceptions.

639
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,560
And they took that very well.

640
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,900
They said, we'll keep you away from the

641
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:38,240
idiots.

642
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,800
It was one of their responses, you know,

643
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,340
but not the morons.

644
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:41,840
Wait a minute.

645
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,280
Yeah.

646
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:42,780
Right.

647
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:43,200
Yeah.

648
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:43,800
What happened?

649
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,220
Yeah.

650
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,580
So I, you know, you're the way I'm

651
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:47,800
here.

652
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,680
I'm, I'm, I'm, I speak, you know, this

653
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,240
is, this is who, you know, this is

654
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:51,740
how I am.

655
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:54,840
So and, um, and it's for the people's

656
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,400
around me benefit cause they're not going to

657
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,180
hear it from anyone else at all.

658
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,260
But all right.

659
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:02,180
So I got another question, um, which, uh,

660
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,800
I, I just found, uh, just now actually,

661
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,560
and I missed it last week, I guess.

662
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,480
Um, could Greek talk about the cult and

663
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,060
in parentheses prank that we are all born

664
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:18,320
with gifts in quotes and are psychic and

665
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,840
can develop it.

666
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,180
Uh, the inner knowing we think we have

667
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:27,180
is, uh, that our spirit or question mark,

668
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:30,960
uh, is emo work at all?

669
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:34,640
Like psychic development, uh, okay.

670
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,340
So it is, it's all the same.

671
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,260
Don't separate it.

672
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:41,560
If it's nonphysical, completely nonphysical, it's psychic, spiritual

673
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:41,960
emo.

674
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,480
The emo is the part that you sense

675
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,340
with the body.

676
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,300
As your emotions change, there is a physical

677
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,000
reaction in the body, right?

678
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,280
You know, I don't know all the things,

679
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,400
you know, when you're happy, it's endorphins.

680
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,600
When you're sad, it's a whatever.

681
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:59,100
Yeah.

682
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,200
And there's a bunch of reactions that occur

683
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,880
that are measurable and that's what they base.

684
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,440
It's not reliable necessarily, but the lie detector

685
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,060
tests, right?

686
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,780
The, uh, the polygamy galvanic, you know, um,

687
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,300
you know, on the surface of the skin,

688
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,200
the electrical charge changes slightly.

689
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,860
So, but the, the, there's chemicals there.

690
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,800
So when I started pondering this decades ago,

691
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,460
that chemicals are released with emotions, well, aren't

692
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,360
chemicals material.

693
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,780
So that means that we can manipulate material

694
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,400
around us with our emotions.

695
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:30,040
You know, here comes, um, the Jedi, right?

696
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,880
Or these PK people, you know, you hear,

697
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
of course that they, that's all emo work.

698
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,180
When you see PK psychokinesis, right?

699
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,260
That's all emo.

700
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,380
That's not, um, a separate thing from emo

701
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,020
or spirit or psychic.

702
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:44,960
It's all the same.

703
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,560
It's the mental energy, let's just say, and

704
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,080
the potential of the mental, because when it's

705
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,740
energy, it's no longer potential to affect the

706
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,420
physical world.

707
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,660
And your first proof when you're trying to

708
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:00,240
develop this is notice how you change physical

709
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,700
attributes in your body, the way your body

710
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,200
feels chemically and looks.

711
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,620
Uh, and the reverse is true when someone

712
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,880
is sad or depressed and you don't know

713
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,280
why for specific reason.

714
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,040
And if you know the specific reason, address

715
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,200
it.

716
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,060
But if you don't, I usually tell them,

717
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,920
look at the ceiling and smile, force a

718
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,820
smile and do that for about 30 seconds,

719
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,900
which is a long time, which changes the

720
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,760
posture and all that.

721
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,820
And it will change the way the chemicals

722
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,600
in your body, just cracking a smile or,

723
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,040
you know, gesturing a smile, looking up and

724
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,180
you in every, you know, every time it

725
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:33,480
works.

726
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,440
So that's how the physical comes back on

727
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:36,960
the emo.

728
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,900
And that's also true.

729
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,800
Like if anyone's ever taken ecstasy, it's a

730
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:46,320
chemical changes your emo, uh, quite favorably.

731
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,460
Usually everything is so much more interesting and

732
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,460
everyone is so beautiful in their own way.

733
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,000
All of a sudden you feel the air

734
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,660
much more, uh, acutely on your skin and

735
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,860
you, you feel tempers.

736
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,340
And that's, that's pure, but not that air

737
00:23:59,340 --> 00:23:59,940
is so physical.

738
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,340
I mean, what it'll do is we'll change

739
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,880
the emo, uh, you know, drugs, drugs, do

740
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,520
the physical side of the emotional side so

741
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,760
that you can changing the physical will change

742
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,020
the emotion and vice versa.

743
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:16,700
But the, the emo precursor, the psychic spiritual

744
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,840
emo precursor is far more powerful than the

745
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,820
using the material to change the emo.

746
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:23,260
Right.

747
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,400
And, but then that's how we're misled and

748
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,380
misdirected.

749
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,140
Again, when you look at the current science,

750
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,880
it's, if it's, there's no material.

751
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,220
And if you read the current science, you

752
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,400
know, they have to have some kind of

753
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,220
material evidence.

754
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,680
They tell you if it's, if there's no

755
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,600
material involved, we're not interested.

756
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,260
That's why they talk about electrons and protons

757
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,980
and all these bogus things, you know, uh,

758
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,240
and light as a photon.

759
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:51,160
So, um, they're directing everyone towards materialism and

760
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,120
it should be directed the opposite way.

761
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:56,200
And those that know that are going to

762
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,520
be much more advanced.

763
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:00,280
And this, this ties into like finance again,

764
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,500
because you know, the crypto craze, oh, you

765
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,560
better get crypto before they go digital.

766
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,980
Cause if they go digital, you don't have

767
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,080
crypto, you'll be Paul.

768
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:07,980
Right.

769
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,360
They don't understand that, that, um, the real

770
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,540
finance will always be wet ink on paper.

771
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,300
Always, always.

772
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,540
It'll never go completely digital for the poor

773
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:19,960
people.

774
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:24,480
Those that are losing, uh, there's a bunch

775
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,000
of what some person commented.

776
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,420
I think it was on the archaic thing

777
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,180
about, you know, your bills are actually checks

778
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:29,680
to you.

779
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,220
It says, no one, unless you're 80 years

780
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:33,760
old, everyone's doing electronic payment now or whatever.

781
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,060
Right.

782
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,920
Now I'm not interested in that.

783
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,080
So that is an example of a totally

784
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,700
slave circuited person.

785
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:40,660
Yeah, they're done.

786
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,260
They're finished.

787
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,820
Uh, they, they don't know what they're giving

788
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,140
up.

789
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,920
So in other words, they're putting out that's

790
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,820
perfect slave where you could be like mining

791
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:51,360
diamonds and you create, you, you find $100

792
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,180
,000 worth of diamonds a day and you

793
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,220
only get a piece of bread and, and

794
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:59,620
your shoes and have caught regardless of how

795
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,220
many, right.

796
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,640
That's the kind of people that you have.

797
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,020
Those are the people that are interested in

798
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:04,320
crypto.

799
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,280
Those are the people that, um, uh, are

800
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,620
afraid of the digital currency.

801
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,440
What they don't know is the secret.

802
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,400
Nothing will ever go purely digital.

803
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,720
The people going and signing stuff on pads

804
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,760
all the time at the bank or that

805
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,500
those are people are slave circuited.

806
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,080
They're done.

807
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:21,720
They're finished.

808
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:25,500
They're locked into brave new world status.

809
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,720
You know, um, they don't understand and they

810
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,520
never will get it.

811
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,420
That paper, wet ink signature, wet ink on

812
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,860
paper will never go away.

813
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,360
Uh, now for the majority it will, but

814
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,220
if you demand to know how to operate,

815
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,300
it doesn't matter if we had a hundred

816
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,120
years or a thousand years left or 10

817
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,340
years, it'll always be wet income paper.

818
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:45,840
You know what I mean?

819
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,940
Wet ink stuff, right?

820
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,400
Yeah, exactly.

821
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,460
On, on.

822
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:49,720
Yeah.

823
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,800
So that's, let me just put that out

824
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,980
because a lot of people think I do

825
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,360
a lot of doom and gloom, but actually

826
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,320
if you listen to what I'm saying, I

827
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,060
put out a lot of positive, very forwardly,

828
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,540
positive thinking things.

829
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,940
They may not be positive in mind, but

830
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,800
you know, well you can't say you can't

831
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,460
change the nature of the way this place

832
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,020
is set up.

833
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,760
You didn't set it up.

834
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,200
That's right.

835
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,220
I didn't.

836
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:10,400
Yeah.

837
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,680
You have to just know how it works.

838
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,940
And then you ain't, no one's going to

839
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,580
change it because that's too much momentum.

840
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,700
But what I'm saying though is that the

841
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:22,060
wet ink transactions will never go away and

842
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,280
that if you focus on that and stay

843
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,600
with that and learn how to work it,

844
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,220
you'll see what I'm talking about.

845
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,440
Those around you that go all digital are

846
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,540
completely slave circuited, very hopeless.

847
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,160
They're stuck in that system.

848
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,320
They don't have to be, but if you

849
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,720
do enough of it, you will be.

850
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:38,780
So be careful.

851
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:39,340
Yeah.

852
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,720
Now my whole life that I've been alive,

853
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,960
I mean, you absolutely always have to, if

854
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,480
anything is really significant, you have to put

855
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,140
a pen to paper, uh, even, even though,

856
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,960
yeah, absolutely.

857
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:53,100
But, but in the sense that, that, that

858
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:57,040
system going, that convention going away, just like

859
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,280
the banking conventions have changed the electronics, the

860
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:04,900
real, um, you managing what your potential is

861
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,400
will always be on paper and ink always,

862
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:10,940
um, the electronic part, it works because of

863
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,580
several things.

864
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,380
One is they want the speed of electronic

865
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,280
stuff, right?

866
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,760
They want to be able to take your

867
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,200
signature off of a pad and put it

868
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,100
on other things that you don't even know

869
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:19,620
exist.

870
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,480
Right.

871
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,480
So, uh, they can also do that when

872
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,720
you do the paper, uh, stuff also, but

873
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,720
what you're more minded, you're minded in a

874
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,340
different way when you're doing stuff on paper

875
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:33,300
and you keep checking on things differently than

876
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,560
people who just do things electronically.

877
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:39,320
Now, also the electronic part, um, works for

878
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,960
the banks and whatever group you're working with

879
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,500
because they can easily say, we lost it

880
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,340
electronically.

881
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,280
We got hacked.

882
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:47,620
Right.

883
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,080
Right.

884
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,740
Uh, and also it gets them out of

885
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,880
a lot of the securities protocols where they

886
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,460
have to send copies and things cause it's

887
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:54,900
electronic.

888
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:59,080
It gets them out of like showing, evidencing

889
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:03,780
fraudulent activity because if you copied someone's signature

890
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:06,960
electronically and put it on other electronic documents,

891
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,760
it seems less severe than if you actually

892
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,360
wrote it out on a piece of paper,

893
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,460
you know, 10 times on 10 pieces of

894
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,540
paper and sent them out.

895
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,120
You know, the one that has the hard

896
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,460
copy will get you indicted much faster than

897
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,520
the one that's electronic.

898
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,040
Right.

899
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:23,340
Right.

900
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:23,960
Right.

901
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,300
So it's to get them themselves out of

902
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,680
that position.

903
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,360
It gives them plausible deniability.

904
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:30,800
Exactly.

905
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,840
Very much so.

906
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,080
Yeah.

907
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:32,400
Yeah.

908
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,400
And so we can't access those records right

909
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:34,680
now.

910
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,260
Right.

911
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,380
Cause it's not, they're not physical.

912
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:36,740
Right.

913
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,040
So.

914
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:37,440
Right.

915
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,320
And that's always a good excuse to, you

916
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,140
know, suddenly the computers go down, you know,

917
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:41,720
stuff like that.

918
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:41,920
Yeah.

919
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,660
All that stuff.

920
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:42,960
Yeah.

921
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:43,460
Okay.

922
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,300
So a couple of comments in the chat

923
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:45,460
room.

924
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,080
I don't know if you're watching, but I

925
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,180
just wanted to bring them up as they

926
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:48,400
go.

927
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,060
And you know, God, by the way, guys,

928
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:50,980
feel free to add more.

929
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,300
I had the branch manager at the bank

930
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,460
called the police because I asked for a

931
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,860
complete record of all transactions on a loan

932
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,660
account to prove that I owed them anything.

933
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:06,220
No, no, no, no.

934
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,240
But go ahead.

935
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:07,480
Yeah.

936
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,520
And then there's one more.

937
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,500
I had words with the security thugs, but

938
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,100
I left before the popo arrived.

939
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,380
Yeah.

940
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,220
You.

941
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:14,920
Okay.

942
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:17,640
When you got a loan and all that,

943
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,780
all the performance that you people are, they,

944
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:25,980
that structured that contract was structured in a

945
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,880
way that whether, you know, they didn't lend

946
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,180
you anything or you did, you have to

947
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,340
perform according to how they tell you to

948
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:32,740
TV.

949
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,320
The TV tells you to perform.

950
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:38,060
You have to make all your payments to

951
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:40,140
them and they loaned you because right.

952
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,320
That's what the contract says.

953
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,160
The actual thing to do is if you

954
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,540
read the contract, you could have given them

955
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:52,480
a letter that you are taking full security

956
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,280
interest away.

957
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,160
And since they have your security, you want

958
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,660
to take control of it.

959
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,020
Right.

960
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:00,340
Right.

961
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,760
Because it's done already.

962
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:02,320
You're pointing.

963
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,080
Here's the other thing.

964
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,580
You never gave.

965
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:05,360
I'm sorry.

966
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:06,580
Yeah.

967
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,460
You never gave them anything of values.

968
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,500
This is what people mistake also.

969
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,960
And I'll be getting into this more.

970
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:15,600
When you sign a promissory note, it's a

971
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,980
pay to bear type thing and they have

972
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,040
to keep selling it.

973
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,480
So when they have it, the bank or

974
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,920
whatever, and it's open, it's very little value

975
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,340
to them.

976
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,060
They have to keep selling it over and

977
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,300
over to get a value out of it.

978
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,800
But when you sign it, if you actually

979
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,860
gave it value conditionally by saying pay to

980
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,540
the order of Wells Fargo Bank where the

981
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,660
signature line was.

982
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,940
Now you're giving them value.

983
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,080
Now you're telling specifically where to put it

984
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,240
in their account and they can hold it

985
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,500
in their account as an asset.

986
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,920
They don't have to keep selling it.

987
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,720
You see the difference?

988
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:55,420
And that makes it that makes you puts

989
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,760
you in a stronger position.

990
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,020
Right.

991
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,520
And very often they'll say, what are you

992
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:00,860
writing?

993
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,400
You know, I say, well, this is just

994
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,460
how I signed my, you know, legally legal

995
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,100
documents, you know, this is more voiding it

996
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:08,300
out.

997
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:08,500
Right.

998
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,200
You write.

999
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,120
No, you're not voiding.

1000
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,680
You're you actually want to give them value.

1001
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:12,920
Yeah.

1002
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,780
There's a whole process on this.

1003
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:18,280
If you're going to get a loan to

1004
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:18,980
use.

1005
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,880
In other words, 12 USC, 1431 powers and

1006
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,560
duties of the bank talks about the powers

1007
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,700
and duties of the bank is basically to

1008
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:31,180
borrow money and pay interest and also run

1009
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:31,740
debentures.

1010
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,600
Debentures are unsecured credit notes.

1011
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,520
Right.

1012
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:38,520
Which is which is a short way to

1013
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,980
describe what cash money is.

1014
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,660
It's a debenture.

1015
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:41,540
Right.

1016
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,100
But so they're the borrower, according to law.

1017
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,960
But they made you in that contract.

1018
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,080
They made you the borrower.

1019
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,680
It's different than it depends on who you're

1020
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,240
dealing with.

1021
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,400
If you're going to a bank or a

1022
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,920
car dealership, when you go to a car

1023
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,220
dealership or more, you're cosigned.

1024
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,260
The dealership is getting the loan for you

1025
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,420
from their financial company and you're cosigning for

1026
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:02,960
the dealer.

1027
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:03,540
Right.

1028
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,000
Right.

1029
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,240
So each thing is different.

1030
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,920
Credit cards are different.

1031
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:07,620
Credit card.

1032
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:10,760
You're an investor in their financial company, not

1033
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,120
not the retail company, the one that has,

1034
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,060
you know, the name on it, but their

1035
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,140
financial company.

1036
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,540
You're an investor.

1037
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,100
It's not Discover Bank.

1038
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,520
It's whatever bank and trust their trustee.

1039
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:21,780
Yeah.

1040
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,520
They might have Discover Bank Trust and then

1041
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,780
it'll be Bank of Mellon.

1042
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:26,720
There you go.

1043
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,220
New York.

1044
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:30,300
OK, that's the ones that you're investing through

1045
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,500
the second company that goes through the Bank

1046
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,000
of Mellon.

1047
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:33,340
You see.

1048
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,620
So I'm going to do a thing on

1049
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,140
this because there's a lot of people out

1050
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:37,960
there talking about.

1051
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,220
But you get little snippets and pieces.

1052
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,000
What I'm going to do.

1053
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,620
I like doing Venn diagrams and flow charts.

1054
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:44,820
Right.

1055
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,540
Because, you know, it's easier to remember what

1056
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,400
a flow chart looks like than a bunch

1057
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,340
of bullet points.

1058
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,160
Right.

1059
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,000
So I'm going to do a bunch of

1060
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,340
a flow.

1061
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,420
And what's cool about flow charts, you can

1062
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:00,000
have one bubble next to another and then

1063
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,520
you have arrows going both ways.

1064
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:01,840
Right.

1065
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,340
With another flow chart.

1066
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:03,720
You see.

1067
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,400
So that's how it works.

1068
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,440
So they now I didn't think the person

1069
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,760
who got chased out by the police did

1070
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,100
anything wrong.

1071
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,280
I just think he wasn't speaking to the

1072
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,460
right person on their side, because remember, people

1073
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:21,980
that work in banks or financial institutions, they

1074
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,679
don't know any of this, because do you

1075
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,260
think they'll be sitting there for 20 or

1076
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,739
30 dollars an hour if they knew how

1077
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:27,199
to do this?

1078
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:27,940
No, they're given.

1079
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,400
That's why they're given a procedure to deal

1080
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:30,659
with.

1081
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,600
If something comes up, you just automatically press

1082
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,679
this button or you call this number or.

1083
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,000
Yeah.

1084
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,400
No, they're just workers and they're slave circuited.

1085
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,960
Now, it's the word of the night.

1086
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,000
Slave circuit.

1087
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:43,280
It's a short circuit.

1088
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:46,120
You know, short circuiting is, you know.

1089
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,659
Solid band name, too.

1090
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:49,400
Yeah.

1091
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,199
Slave circuit.

1092
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:55,800
I remember years ago having these lunch breakfast

1093
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,760
club type stuff.

1094
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,760
We'd meet for breakfast.

1095
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,020
It was a bank manager there from one

1096
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:00,480
of the banks.

1097
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,780
I don't know if it was Citicorp or

1098
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,060
something.

1099
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,540
And he was so interested in the financial

1100
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,040
stuff.

1101
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,260
And it's like I did.

1102
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,320
He was the most interested.

1103
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,100
And I said, what do you do?

1104
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,820
He says, oh, I'm a bank assistant manager.

1105
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:10,680
I'm like, oh, shit.

1106
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,480
Why don't you say so?

1107
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:12,800
You know.

1108
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,280
Well, he got fired.

1109
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,260
He would go there and start asking questions.

1110
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,620
And they came to his desk asking him,

1111
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,640
do you like your job here?

1112
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,560
Do you like your job here?

1113
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,080
He said, yeah.

1114
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,060
And then they just walk out.

1115
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,960
They didn't tell him, if you like your

1116
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,560
job, you better stop asking questions.

1117
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,060
Then he got fired from working in the

1118
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:29,420
bank, right?

1119
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,180
Just like if you know, if anyone that

1120
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,220
works in the government, we used to have

1121
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,420
someone in the chat says, well, my sister

1122
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,420
works in the State Department.

1123
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,400
It means she knows nothing about government at

1124
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:37,660
all.

1125
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:37,980
Right.

1126
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,420
If she works at the State Department.

1127
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,860
My brother works at the IRS.

1128
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,540
It means he knows nothing about the IRS

1129
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,080
or taxes.

1130
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,580
There's no way they'll hire you if you

1131
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,600
know anything about what's going on there.

1132
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,620
Now, there are, for example, with the mob,

1133
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,320
you do have to know what's going on.

1134
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,320
Yes, you do.

1135
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,440
There are a lot better.

1136
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:56,940
I'm telling you.

1137
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,560
How many times you hear me?

1138
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,340
The mob is way better than any government.

1139
00:35:59,460 --> 00:35:59,640
Right.

1140
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,260
One of these banks are way better.

1141
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,360
This is one of our mutual agreements.

1142
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,240
And I always say this, you know, they're

1143
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,080
pretty direct, except occasionally they come to you

1144
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,660
and say, you know, you have a lovely

1145
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:12,800
family, you know, you know, stuff like that.

1146
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,760
You know, you got to watch that.

1147
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,780
That's a little more subtle.

1148
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,680
But I don't know if you guys remember

1149
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,180
the story.

1150
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,760
I opened a bike shop and I asked

1151
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,520
the previous tenants, I'm going to bridge it,

1152
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,400
make it real short here.

1153
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,140
What's your garbage?

1154
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,660
I know we have a retail.

1155
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,700
You don't rely on municipal garbage pickup.

1156
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,140
You have to pay for your own garbage.

1157
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:29,460
Right.

1158
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:29,860
Right.

1159
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,600
So I said, what do I what should

1160
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,780
I expect to pay here?

1161
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,220
This is about 150 a month.

1162
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,040
I could do that.

1163
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,120
I figured you guys were a hair salon

1164
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,640
and I'm a bike shop.

1165
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,020
I'm probably probably be double that tops, you

1166
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:43,020
know, because sometimes they go by quantity.

1167
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:43,880
Right.

1168
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,040
Restaurant would be more.

1169
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:45,380
Right.

1170
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,420
You get a shipment.

1171
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,760
Maybe you got a lot of packing materials.

1172
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,520
Yeah, exactly.

1173
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,140
I figured between 150 and 300 would be

1174
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:52,400
fair.

1175
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,880
So the guy comes in real tall through

1176
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,180
the long leather coat and he just marches

1177
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,420
through the store and he goes, I'm your

1178
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,220
garbage guy.

1179
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,080
It's going to be 750 a month.

1180
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,700
And I'm like, oh, really?

1181
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,560
What am I going to do now?

1182
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:06,580
Right.

1183
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:10,620
It was like Cavuto, you know, whatever.

1184
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:11,880
Dino's specialized.

1185
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,940
Dino Cavuto refuse service.

1186
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:15,840
Dino's.

1187
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,100
Really.

1188
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:16,940
Dino's environmental.

1189
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:17,540
Yeah.

1190
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,000
Dino's environmental cleanup.

1191
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,300
You know, really, really typical, you know, slime

1192
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,200
bag, mob type, you know, whatever.

1193
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:25,680
Right.

1194
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:28,300
And low, low level foot soldier.

1195
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,380
And I'm like, what am I going to

1196
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:31,580
do?

1197
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:34,660
So I know that the assemblymen in Brooklyn,

1198
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,540
they have assemblymen, councilmen.

1199
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,040
Right.

1200
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,580
That are below the congressman.

1201
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,580
They do the districts and the war, you

1202
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,700
know, whatever they call them.

1203
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:43,980
Burroughs district.

1204
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,260
You got your mayor assembly.

1205
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:46,380
Presidents.

1206
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,700
Then you got the guys under him.

1207
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:48,500
Assemblyman.

1208
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:49,680
Councilman.

1209
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,280
There you go.

1210
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,800
And one of the guys was I remember

1211
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,680
he came in and says, listen.

1212
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,420
No, actually, I went to his office.

1213
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,960
It wasn't too far away.

1214
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,240
His name was very similar to the garbage

1215
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,120
company's name.

1216
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,740
And I said, listen, this is what's going

1217
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:08,120
on.

1218
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,360
Everyone here pays this.

1219
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,280
And I'm a new business.

1220
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,240
And I said, you know, they told me

1221
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:13,780
750.

1222
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,320
How am I supposed to manage that as

1223
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,120
a new shop owner?

1224
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:16,640
Right.

1225
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,060
And he says, what are you doing?

1226
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:18,900
What are you doing there?

1227
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,060
And so the councilman said, well, it's a

1228
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:21,500
bike shop.

1229
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,760
He says, listen, I got I like to

1230
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,660
rub my bike.

1231
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,020
I haven't ridden it many years.

1232
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,320
I got one for my wife and my

1233
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:27,560
children.

1234
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,120
I'm going to bring these bikes to you.

1235
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,640
I want you to tune them up.

1236
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,280
Fix them up.

1237
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,040
Give them back to me.

1238
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,260
I'll take care of it.

1239
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:36,420
So about two days later, the same guy

1240
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,440
with the long leather coat comes is OK.

1241
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:38,940
All right.

1242
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:39,620
It's 150.

1243
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,160
All right.

1244
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:42,220
It'll be 150 a month for you.

1245
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,000
And he walks right back out and I

1246
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,180
cut him a check or something.

1247
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,000
They're on the spot.

1248
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:46,420
Right.

1249
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,580
Now, did he say anything like do me

1250
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:48,780
a favor?

1251
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:49,960
Don't go to the councilman again.

1252
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:50,840
No, never.

1253
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:51,800
Nothing like that.

1254
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,440
But you see how they're all connected.

1255
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,520
It's all connected.

1256
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,460
One big freaking connection.

1257
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:59,360
And I was kind of racist in that.

1258
00:38:59,560 --> 00:38:59,880
Not racist.

1259
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,100
How would you say?

1260
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,800
Because the councilman's name was very similar to

1261
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,100
the garbage company's name.

1262
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,180
I said, maybe they're related.

1263
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,800
They're not the same, you know, but very

1264
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,740
Italian name.

1265
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,260
Very Italian guy.

1266
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,420
I bet he can do something for me.

1267
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,560
And he did.

1268
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,300
Yeah, that used to happen to me, too,

1269
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,760
because of the Italian name.

1270
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,340
And you see somebody else like, you know,

1271
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,520
I got the L.L.I. at the

1272
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:20,760
end.

1273
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,720
So they see somebody else with an L

1274
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,300
.L.I. And that's not that uncommon.

1275
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,700
And they go, you know, if you look

1276
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,300
around, Mazzilli, Minnelli, you know, right?

1277
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,740
So people would convolute it like, oh, you

1278
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,780
got a name just like his.

1279
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,820
No, we're not even similar.

1280
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:36,940
But, yeah, I got you.

1281
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,880
Yeah, but this is, you see, this goes

1282
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,540
back to why they called the cops at

1283
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:40,900
the bank.

1284
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,960
You have to know the business, how they

1285
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,120
do business.

1286
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,520
And I'd like to find out more.

1287
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:50,180
Whoever posed that, was that an email or

1288
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:50,480
something?

1289
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,640
No, that was in the chat.

1290
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,820
And they did post a little more.

1291
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,920
I'd like to do an investigation on that

1292
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,320
more, like what you said, what they said,

1293
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,780
and, you know, more details.

1294
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,360
I'd be glad.

1295
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,280
You could shoot me an email.

1296
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,420
You could do it here or whatever.

1297
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,120
Well, right here, I got a few lines

1298
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:06,440
already.

1299
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:09,980
They said they don't keep records for longer

1300
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:10,920
than seven years.

1301
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,360
And when I asked how they prove anything,

1302
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,300
the cops were called.

1303
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,420
That's right.

1304
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,040
And then he responded to you, like you

1305
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:18,800
were saying something.

1306
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,180
So he said, yes, I didn't know any

1307
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:23,700
of that back then, you know, regarding what

1308
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,780
you were explaining about the bank.

1309
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:25,620
He didn't know all that.

1310
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,920
He just knew it's challenging, you know.

1311
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,360
So anything else you want to add?

1312
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,940
You have to challenge it on paper.

1313
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,320
Now, what happens with a lot of bankers,

1314
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,200
you don't hear about this because the last

1315
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,640
thing you want is a lot of them

1316
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,500
are threatened because there's, believe it or not,

1317
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:42,680
there are multitudes of people finding out that

1318
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,620
banks don't lend money.

1319
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:47,700
It's actually almost mainstream, just like the recent

1320
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,340
court case where the man didn't have to

1321
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:53,800
honor the mortgage contract because fiat money would

1322
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,940
never satisfy, right?

1323
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,940
The court case, right?

1324
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:59,200
So this is becoming more mainstream.

1325
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,940
Even recently, speaking to an engineer, I said,

1326
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,420
I do stuff about financial awareness and security

1327
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,900
agreements and things like that.

1328
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,940
And he says, like mortgages?

1329
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:10,460
I'm like, yeah.

1330
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,220
He says, you know, I gave him a

1331
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,180
little bit.

1332
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,820
And he says, you know, it's funny because

1333
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,060
my brother said he had his mortgage set

1334
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,520
off somehow, and now I believe it, you

1335
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:19,740
know.

1336
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:20,900
And I was like, you should go talk

1337
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:21,360
to your brother.

1338
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,440
As a matter of fact, have your brother

1339
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:22,980
talk to me.

1340
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,140
I want to see what he did and

1341
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,640
how he approached it.

1342
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,540
He says, all right, I will.

1343
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,140
Let's go get in touch with, you know,

1344
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:28,580
and all that.

1345
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,020
So in other words, there's so many people

1346
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:31,620
finding out.

1347
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,600
And what I'm trying to say with the

1348
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,200
banker, a lot of them are being threatened,

1349
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,860
and it's not being reported publicly because the

1350
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,940
last thing you want is to see a

1351
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:39,740
trend or a movement.

1352
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,780
You know, like people say, yeah, go to

1353
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,320
the bank and threaten them, just like this

1354
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,020
other guy did in the news last week,

1355
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,280
you know, or whatever.

1356
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,720
You know, they want to put the idea

1357
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,920
in people's, you know, copycats.

1358
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,420
No, they want to keep it quiet because

1359
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,120
somebody says something like, you know, if you

1360
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,800
see, look, I just showed up at this

1361
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,880
place and they fed me for free, and

1362
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,100
you see that in a newspaper, somebody else

1363
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,120
is going to show up at that place

1364
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,180
to eat for free, right?

1365
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:01,880
Yeah, yeah.

1366
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:04,980
So in other words, people are vacuous and

1367
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,660
they take all their ideas and everything from

1368
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:08,500
their environment.

1369
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,100
We all do.

1370
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,980
That's why you have to be very careful.

1371
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,140
And you said set off, by the way.

1372
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,840
I think you meant offset, right?

1373
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,280
That's right, offset.

1374
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:17,180
Or no, set off.

1375
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,580
I think set off is the proper term.

1376
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,300
I thought it was offset because they used

1377
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,480
to do that with taxes where they would

1378
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,220
say they offset it because they satisfied it

1379
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,780
before they ever sent you the papers.

1380
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,960
That's possible, yeah.

1381
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,060
I wouldn't stick to that terminology.

1382
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:35,700
But basically, you could see what terminology is

1383
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:38,280
being used as you follow along each institution.

1384
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,360
They have to swear to the SEC that

1385
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,620
they're going to do these things, and that's

1386
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:42,420
what you hold them to.

1387
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:45,680
Very simply, if you got a loan last

1388
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:50,640
November, right, in their SEC who gives them

1389
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,100
the permission to trade these securities, they stated

1390
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,860
and swore to it that within 30 days

1391
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:59,640
they discharge and set off or offset, set

1392
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,400
off all their loans.

1393
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:02,840
So that means if you got a loan

1394
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,600
last November, by the end of December or

1395
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,060
middle of January, because it could have been

1396
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:09,340
the middle of the month or whatever, it's

1397
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:11,900
been already zeroed out and cleared out.

1398
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:14,120
They've settled all liability.

1399
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,340
But they're still sending you for the next

1400
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,380
three, four years to pay on it.

1401
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:21,140
So you contact them and say, hey, do

1402
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,060
I owe you or are you lying to

1403
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:24,500
me that I don't owe you because according

1404
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,300
to the SEC I don't owe you, so

1405
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,280
which one are you lying to?

1406
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,500
Do I need to go to the SEC?

1407
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,160
That's all you got to do.

1408
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:31,520
They can't prove anything.

1409
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,800
They already did prove it by signing up

1410
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,460
to the SEC.

1411
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:37,920
That's why it's the same thing that people

1412
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,040
do when a car drives erratically or is

1413
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:40,580
a hit and run.

1414
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:41,380
Did you get the number?

1415
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,400
Did you get the license number?

1416
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:42,720
Why?

1417
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,700
Because you go to the authorities with the

1418
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,340
license number, right, and they have all the

1419
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:48,520
records supposedly, right?

1420
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,020
That's what they're supposed to have, yeah.

1421
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:51,940
Yeah, and that's what you do with these

1422
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:52,180
banks.

1423
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:55,820
You find out what their SEC filings contain,

1424
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:58,680
and they all contain the same thing, and

1425
00:43:58,680 --> 00:43:59,500
you hold them to it.

1426
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,060
And the SEC is just waiting.

1427
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:04,840
The SEC cannot take these people to court.

1428
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:07,460
They can't because there's no subject matter for

1429
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:08,680
them, right?

1430
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,140
So, yeah, it's very interesting.

1431
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:15,500
I mean, the FBI cannot just say we're

1432
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,340
arresting the whole mob without arresting someone from

1433
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:19,020
the mob.

1434
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:25,060
So it's case by case.

1435
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:26,420
It's quite interesting.

1436
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,760
The reason I've been leaning on this more

1437
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,560
is because there was a resurgence of this

1438
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,340
online, and I said, you know, I've been

1439
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:33,540
studying this for 20 years.

1440
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:35,520
I personally don't care too much.

1441
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:36,840
I just want what I need here.

1442
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,360
But I've noticed that people's behavior, attitude about

1443
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,100
life, or whatever, is based on how much

1444
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,120
money they have access, or money they can

1445
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,220
earn or spend.

1446
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,860
That's really sad, you know?

1447
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:49,600
So if this money thing is so important,

1448
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,300
why don't we start seeing how to put

1449
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,680
it together, right?

1450
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:55,860
And be on the front end.

1451
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,420
Whenever you're on the front end of something,

1452
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:00,700
see, eventually the banking system will be watered

1453
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,800
down, and there'll be some financial chaos.

1454
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,080
But get on the beginning of it, right?

1455
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,760
Get on the front end of it and

1456
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,540
do it soon, like now, and like this

1457
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,520
year, next year, the year after that.

1458
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:14,520
Because after that, it's going to be so

1459
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,700
chaotic that it won't matter.

1460
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:18,320
You know, you'll have like the type of

1461
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,120
inflation that it doesn't matter how much money

1462
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,040
you have, you know, you're going to have.

1463
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:25,500
So you do these things now to prepare,

1464
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:28,180
not in a survivalist kind of way, but

1465
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:30,640
in an understanding that the economy is going

1466
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,640
to, your ability to perform in the economy

1467
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,640
is going to go to shit, right?

1468
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:38,200
Now, I'm not saying buy gold and silver,

1469
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,180
but it would be good.

1470
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,060
I think gold is almost 3,000 now.

1471
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:42,420
I'm glad I bought it when it was

1472
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:48,060
around 400, and so on.

1473
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,120
But I don't think that's a major point

1474
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,180
because, again, that's capital investment.

1475
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:56,460
Gold and silver, you can't go and use

1476
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:57,500
it down at the stove.

1477
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,660
You really can't.

1478
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:01,280
But it's capital.

1479
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,560
So there's many ways to think about it.

1480
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:05,360
And as we go down, I say we,

1481
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,460
whoever we is, have to think about it

1482
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:08,780
some more.

1483
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,900
But right now, take responsibility of what's out

1484
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,820
there is the main point.

1485
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:16,180
No, absolutely.

1486
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:18,460
And, by the way, I looked up Offset,

1487
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:21,180
and number one, just a funny thing.

1488
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:23,320
I always find it funny when phrases become

1489
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,020
the name of a rapper, first of all.

1490
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,860
So there's a rapper named Offset.

1491
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:30,060
And, apparently, the usage of the word currently,

1492
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:33,640
according to Miriam Webster, anyway, is to place

1493
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,440
over or against something.

1494
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,660
Yeah, and set off.

1495
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,320
A set off is when it's no longer

1496
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,800
on the books as a liability, right, or

1497
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,420
something owed or something to be given or

1498
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:45,800
whatever.

1499
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,560
So maybe both apply here.

1500
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:52,840
Yeah, the financial stuff, now that I've kind

1501
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,800
of worked studying it more and more than

1502
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,900
ever before, I'm beginning to realize how important

1503
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:58,260
it is.

1504
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,120
You get more sensitive.

1505
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,640
You know when you're studying a subject, you

1506
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,700
start noticing the subject more around you, right?

1507
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,160
It's kind of like that.

1508
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:09,140
It's kind of sad because, in other words,

1509
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,800
the state of affairs that most people are

1510
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:16,340
in with their family life and whatever career

1511
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:18,500
or life they have, the people around them

1512
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:22,660
just can't stomach this kind of information, even

1513
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:26,240
in its simplest form, just approaching anyone around

1514
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,540
you and saying, you know, it's a credit

1515
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:29,480
-based economy.

1516
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:30,920
And they go, yeah, I know.

1517
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,940
That means it's not money anymore.

1518
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,020
And they're like, oh, what are you talking

1519
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:34,340
about?

1520
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:36,380
And then you start drifting off.

1521
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:38,600
And you're not going to get any support

1522
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,800
in this at all.

1523
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:42,580
So it's really a solo journey, just like

1524
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:45,480
these spiritual quests that people go on.

1525
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,740
Yeah, it's a spiritual quest.

1526
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,000
It's no different.

1527
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,500
Like you can want to do something about

1528
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:53,680
your spiritual whatever.

1529
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:56,400
Don't look for support around you.

1530
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:57,380
It's a personal thing.

1531
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:57,980
You know what I mean?

1532
00:47:58,300 --> 00:47:58,400
Yeah.

1533
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,360
That's why when you do find support, it's

1534
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:01,860
invaluable.
