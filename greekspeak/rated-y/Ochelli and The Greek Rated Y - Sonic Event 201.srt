1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,040
The Sonic entity known as S.T.E

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,880
.A.L. is here to take the lead.

3
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,500
The whole thing with academia is if you

4
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,740
study it, you know, like a lot of

5
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,700
the stuff we talk about, you know, history

6
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,100
of this, you know what this really means,

7
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,740
like the word nice or birthdays, cannibals and

8
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,560
dolls, all that stuff.

9
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:42,960
When you look at how academia is set

10
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,460
up, it's just, what do you call it,

11
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,140
atrocious, which someone looked up the word recently

12
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,500
for me and it says it's criminal, this,

13
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:50,680
that.

14
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,800
It's a pretty harsh word when you say

15
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,420
atrocious.

16
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,200
That's where atrocity, I think, comes from.

17
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,200
Atrocity, right.

18
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:55,760
Exactly.

19
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,240
Yeah, it's horrible.

20
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,120
Yeah, it's nothing like it used to be.

21
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,500
And it's programming, just like what they do

22
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,440
with television, by the way.

23
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,239
If you look at TV programs, right, when

24
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,140
they tell you it's season one, it's 1

25
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,900
-0 and then it's the number, right, for

26
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,300
the season and then the episode.

27
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,280
So when you go to the second season,

28
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,420
they begin with a 2 again.

29
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,860
That's like the same thing they do with

30
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:15,220
classes.

31
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,940
So it's programming.

32
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,800
Yeah, but you brought up the academia part.

33
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,340
Oh, man, that needs to be just, it's

34
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,260
kind of like the doctors.

35
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,960
When the medical doctors go away, people will

36
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,020
be more fit.

37
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,000
They'll get their fitness back.

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,340
Notice I didn't say the H word.

39
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,000
The H word was...

40
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,000
Oh, you disappeared on me, Greek.

41
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,880
Yeah, I'm back.

42
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,200
Whenever the phones, we're using Jitsi, by the

43
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,340
way, folks, and when the phone that's on

44
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,460
the stupid rectangle decides to turn the screen

45
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,800
off, you can't.

46
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,080
So I have to keep my finger on

47
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,600
it, you know, that and other things.

48
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,520
But yeah, we have a couple of things

49
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,380
in the chat, diversified stuff.

50
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,760
Maybe I'll start off with that.

51
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,000
Ed asked, it was mentioned years ago.

52
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,480
I'm just going to paraphrase here about the

53
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,160
Christ being a biblical Christ, which no one

54
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,100
really knows because no one reads the Bible.

55
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:07,419
Right.

56
00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:12,040
And not being facetious, we will be like

57
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,680
a model human in a way.

58
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,040
Yes.

59
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,280
And then there's judgment and all that.

60
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,780
But those words need to be looked at

61
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,420
closely again, how it's placed.

62
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,180
And there's a lot of biblical talk, by

63
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:23,420
the way.

64
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,180
This is not answering what he is asking

65
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,680
here, but none of it is accurate.

66
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,300
Very little snippets will be accurate.

67
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,660
But the general overview is not correct because

68
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,320
all we have is biblical and history.

69
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,300
And it seems like you got to pick

70
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,860
or choose because when you pick history, you

71
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,240
don't find much and at all really some.

72
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,380
And when you pick biblical, it sort of

73
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,260
lines up with history.

74
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,940
So you got to know the entire scope,

75
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,220
but you got to know it from a

76
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,060
non urban legend point of view.

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,340
It's one of these first hand things you

78
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,160
have to experience.

79
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,200
You experience the second hand information first hand

80
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,480
maybe.

81
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,580
But here he says, basically, do you think

82
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,720
that reincarnation can only be specific to certain

83
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,120
individuals?

84
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,620
No, it's granted to everyone.

85
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,140
Biblically, all men will come back.

86
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:08,380
Right.

87
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,560
But then there's like different levels.

88
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,180
It seems like if you understand what's being

89
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,160
conveyed in mostly in the New Testament or

90
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,580
even the Old Testament, doesn't get much into

91
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:19,780
it.

92
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,440
But we're sort of like in a boot

93
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,180
camp right now where we're being monitored and

94
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,940
graded to use not such a specific term.

95
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,080
Let's not be specific with the word.

96
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,800
Remember years ago I said when you grade

97
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,300
someone, that's very degrading, right?

98
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,360
So it's an open subject.

99
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,260
But there's not much of a contrast.

100
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,000
I mean, it's limited information and it's still

101
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,840
an open subject because the information that we

102
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,940
get about what happens later, the next society

103
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,620
is like Swiss cheese.

104
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,200
You know, you got a block of cheese,

105
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,240
but it's got a lot of big holes

106
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,480
in it.

107
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,320
You know, take it back.

108
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,720
Take this cheese back.

109
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,640
It's missing parts.

110
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:58,940
Right.

111
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,120
Until you find out that's how it's made.

112
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:02,380
Right.

113
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,240
You say, well, no, no, honey, that's how

114
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,080
Swiss cheese is.

115
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,020
Oh, OK.

116
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:06,980
Yeah.

117
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,600
I never saw cheese with big holes in

118
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,020
it like that.

119
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,180
You're supposed to take it back at one

120
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,260
that doesn't have the holes in it.

121
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:11,500
Right.

122
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,260
Yeah, no.

123
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,560
That's the way it comes, which is interesting

124
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,980
because it kind of ties together with one

125
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,480
of the questions I have, which is a

126
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,040
Greek said the next thing coming is to

127
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,580
be a cleansing of which you can't compare

128
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,840
to any other times.

129
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,120
Biblically speaking, this era began with the Assyrians

130
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,640
wiping out all of the neighboring tribes.

131
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,820
So if the cycle continues, that's what should

132
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,940
happen at the end.

133
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,200
Severe wiping out of humanity.

134
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,920
But wouldn't that have happened anyways with the

135
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,520
Earth shift and the cataclysms?

136
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:42,680
Yes.

137
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,340
Both.

138
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,660
Both are true.

139
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:44,980
Yeah.

140
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,380
But I believe there's a control behind it.

141
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,120
You know, there's a deliberate control, which segues

142
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,900
to the next one.

143
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,320
I think person here, individual, whatever you want

144
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,320
to call, just Brian 44 posted about his

145
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,560
sessions of ayahuasca and basically reduces it to

146
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,320
down there's malevolent and benevolent and somewhere there

147
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:06,820
to help.

148
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,160
Right.

149
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,740
Guess which ones are those?

150
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,440
Actually, sometimes the malevolent ones can help you

151
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,680
more because the benevolent ones, if you survive,

152
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,140
the benevolent ones are not giving you a

153
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,880
formula to free energy or perfect fitness.

154
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,140
And longevity, are they?

155
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,300
Right.

156
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,240
Anybody say I ran into a benevolent being

157
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,220
and here's the schematic for free energy and

158
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,320
whatever, whatever, whatever.

159
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,060
Cure cancer.

160
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,060
We know some stuff like that.

161
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,220
You can't cure cancer.

162
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,660
Actually, having cancer means that if you didn't

163
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,060
have cancer, you would have died.

164
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:41,700
Right.

165
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,760
But anyway, yeah, it's kind of tricky.

166
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,420
But the thing is the help or malice,

167
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,040
whether you're dealing with good ones or bad

168
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:56,140
ones, there's not much of a crossover because

169
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,340
being in a physical state or being animated

170
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,380
because you have a physical body is a

171
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,220
very, very, very tricky thing.

172
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,440
And usually we're left alone, believe it or

173
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,920
not, with all the screwing around that's been

174
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,920
happening to us.

175
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,140
We're left alone because we're really physically based.

176
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,480
You know all the airy fairies always talking

177
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,540
about the spirit and the physical body.

178
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,540
Actually, we're more physical than spiritual when we're

179
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,680
in the physical body because 99% of

180
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,120
your consciousness is, if not more than that,

181
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,320
actually 100% of your consciousness is based

182
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,640
on your physical body working.

183
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,100
In other words, when you're unconscious, unless you

184
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,820
speak to the NDE people, there's no consciousness.

185
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,100
So it's a very, very tricky thing.

186
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,700
They use the reference of snowflakes to people,

187
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,340
the ones that fall apart real fast.

188
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,080
We're kind of like snowflakes, all of us,

189
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,760
to these spiritual beings.

190
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,920
Now, it doesn't mean they can't be around

191
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,260
us.

192
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,840
It just means the indirect interaction and affecting

193
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:59,120
us directly is really like touching a snowflake

194
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,280
because of the physical body.

195
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,780
Well, and everybody that has these experiences, it's

196
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,260
always, did they ask for the cure to

197
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:07,580
cancer?

198
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,520
Did they ask for it?

199
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,160
No, they didn't.

200
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,060
They never asked those questions anyway.

201
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:11,200
That's true.

202
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,560
They can say you didn't ask, right?

203
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,760
That's a very typical meme you see when

204
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,520
you shake the genie out of the bottle,

205
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,040
let's say.

206
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:18,780
You didn't ask.

207
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,300
Well, right.

208
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,800
I mean, at the end of the day,

209
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,680
you didn't ask for it.

210
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,740
You know, it's like the old, well, the

211
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,680
meme is usually funny.

212
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,820
It's like, I really want to win the

213
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:27,980
lottery.

214
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,180
I really want to win the lottery.

215
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,480
And finally, you get a note that says,

216
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,420
buy a ticket, idiot.

217
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,780
You know, and so, you know what I'm

218
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:34,980
saying?

219
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:35,240
Yeah.

220
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,660
Well, it's like thing is I consider myself

221
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,340
a dream master, be able to navigate.

222
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,660
But recently I had this honest to goodness

223
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,000
nightmare that I was being killed.

224
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,620
And it didn't, I didn't say to myself,

225
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,600
well, this is just a dream.

226
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,500
I'll wake up at all.

227
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,000
I woke up in a terrible panic.

228
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,320
I couldn't go back to sleep.

229
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,620
Kind of like Donald Marshall stuff.

230
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:53,880
Right.

231
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,780
And I was like, Ooh, that was unusually

232
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,280
realistic.

233
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:57,780
Right.

234
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,040
But I didn't die.

235
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:03,340
I was just being killed by some really

236
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,060
odd creatures.

237
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,220
They look like dust mops.

238
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:05,500
Right.

239
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,620
They were like blue and there were some

240
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,380
individuals and people involved.

241
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,920
And it's kind of thing where you're in

242
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,100
the matrix where you go pull back the

243
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,260
curtains to go out the window and there's

244
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:15,820
a brick wall.

245
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,320
You open the door and there's a brick

246
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,100
wall kind of thing.

247
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:18,460
Right.

248
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,820
Very, very interesting.

249
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,660
So at the time I was, I wasn't

250
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,280
even thinking at all while I was experiencing

251
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,060
this, whether I could see my hands move

252
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:29,540
or mouths move while there was speech or

253
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,180
anything like that.

254
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,400
I kind of like forgot about it.

255
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,860
So what I'm saying is when you're in

256
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,580
the presence of something like this, it's kind

257
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,380
of hard to even remember you had a

258
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:36,700
list.

259
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:37,820
Right.

260
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,400
Oh, yeah.

261
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,700
A list of things to ask.

262
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,900
You know, you say, where's that list that

263
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,659
I had for these guys?

264
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,280
But you won't even forget that.

265
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:43,860
Oh, yeah.

266
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,260
So that's like total chaos, disorganization.

267
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,960
40 years ago, literally 40 years ago, I

268
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,820
had a dream about being wiped out in

269
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,520
a nuclear bombing.

270
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,680
And these creatures that you're describing, very similar

271
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,760
to those kind of like slashing mop sort

272
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,420
of things, they started beating the hell out

273
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:04,660
of me.

274
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,980
And I woke up thinking, you know, like

275
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,360
it took me a while to talk myself

276
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:10,740
out of.

277
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,460
That's not what actually just happened to me.

278
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,700
You know.

279
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,880
Not during, but after.

280
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,500
After.

281
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:15,940
Right.

282
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:16,520
Yeah.

283
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:16,820
Right.

284
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,780
Because during, I was fully engaged with what

285
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,280
was happening.

286
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,640
I was in a familiar place.

287
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,260
I thought what was going on was going

288
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:23,520
on.

289
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,760
I thought the bombs were dropping.

290
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,760
Everything was lighting up.

291
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,380
You know, the typical sort of.

292
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,600
Yeah, because we don't have a very strong

293
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,020
connection to keeping the lights on, your consciousness,

294
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,820
in order.

295
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,000
You know, again, just imagine having a list

296
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,740
of questions because you're going to be in

297
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,020
a situation where you could deal with.

298
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,360
You won't even remember that.

299
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,500
So you're very fragile, conscious.

300
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,360
You know, it's.

301
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,560
Yeah.

302
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,440
If I knew I was in the presence

303
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,080
of demons or gods or whatever, I would

304
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,460
have no idea about.

305
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,900
Maybe I should ask him this question.

306
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,840
No, I wouldn't because I was so engrossed

307
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,840
in the experience that there was like.

308
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,440
Yeah.

309
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,520
And even if you prep yourself and meditate

310
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,380
on the next time this happens, you'll probably

311
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,020
still forget.

312
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:05,780
Yeah.

313
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,900
It's kind of a messed up thing.

314
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,560
But, you know, there's some advantage point.

315
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,460
We only still have the vantage point of

316
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,920
surface to earth inhabitants.

317
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,360
Right.

318
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,860
So I keep talking about vantage point.

319
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,780
Also, someone plugged in YouTube short to Middle

320
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,180
Nation.

321
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:20,860
Oh, yeah.

322
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,240
That guy does some really good commentary.

323
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:24,960
Here's the thing.

324
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,600
He knows enough about the monetary system to

325
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,180
discuss that it's not fair, but he doesn't

326
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,220
know how it really works.

327
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,440
At least he seems like he's not using

328
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,540
the proper banking verbiage.

329
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,960
But he's pretty good generally overview.

330
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,820
He doesn't know about what's coming.

331
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,580
He thinks like he'll say by 2070, there

332
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,100
won't be much of Europe left, you know,

333
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,660
as an EU.

334
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,840
No, no, no.

335
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,220
You don't have that kind of time left.

336
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,220
So, yeah, but his commentary is pretty forthright,

337
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,260
meaning he puts forward stuff that if you

338
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,040
repeat it in concept, you'd be pretty close

339
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,880
to being correct on what's going on.

340
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,600
All right.

341
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,560
But by 2070, I don't expect to be

342
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:02,720
here.

343
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,300
No, no, no.

344
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,160
It's not good.

345
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,540
We're not even going to be in this.

346
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,320
Archaics is pretty close.

347
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,560
The sky won't even be the same.

348
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,400
The atmosphere won't be the same.

349
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,000
Longevity will not be the same.

350
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,020
Most of the people will not be here,

351
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,820
even the ones that could have lived that

352
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,100
long.

353
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,700
There'll still be probably population growth and all

354
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,840
that, but on a different level.

355
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:25,720
Okay, what else?

356
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,380
You got anything else?

357
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,360
There's always a remnant.

358
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,460
Yeah, well, the last thing, I was going

359
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,460
to ask if you wanted me to play

360
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,840
that clip, actually, from that guy.

361
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,700
It was pretty interesting.

362
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,980
Yeah, go ahead and play it.

363
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:34,760
Yeah, okay.

364
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,480
You want me to play that?

365
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,560
I'll pull it up right now.

366
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,180
Yeah, the last one.

367
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,560
Yeah, and then I got one more question

368
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,220
after that.

369
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,580
But let's just take a listen to what

370
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,460
that guy pulled up, because it was really,

371
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,360
really dark and direct, what he had to

372
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,700
say, and I think it's worth it, so

373
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,400
let's listen to it.

374
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:47,880
Sure is.

375
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,860
They have never operated in the world, in

376
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,360
fact, like they're even a part of the

377
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,640
human family, let's be frank.

378
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,020
They have operated in this world like some

379
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,780
sort of alien predator that has just come

380
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,600
down to drain the sweat, blood, and tears

381
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,720
of the human race and to ransack the

382
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,480
planet's resources.

383
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,380
That's how they've acted.

384
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,580
Like they have somewhere else to go where

385
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,520
it's all been depleted.

386
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,220
I mean, we have to be honest about

387
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:12,420
this.

388
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,420
We have to confront the fact that the

389
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:19,560
West has operated with absolute malice, with absolute

390
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,340
contempt for the whole world, not today, not

391
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,980
yesterday, but literally for centuries.

392
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,160
And there is no remorse.

393
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,400
There is no repentance.

394
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,120
There is no rehabilitation.

395
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,380
Literally the only thing that has changed now,

396
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,800
today, is that now their malice and their

397
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,520
contempt has made them turn on their own

398
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:36,980
nations.

399
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,560
They haven't reformed.

400
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,120
They're just repositioning.

401
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,280
This is the only difference.

402
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,220
There's no change in their character.

403
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,880
The A-National OCGFC are not our friends

404
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,380
just because they're no longer constrained by nationalism.

405
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,860
They're just as predatory and just as vicious

406
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,700
as they ever were.

407
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,160
See, now, the OGFC, what is that?

408
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,800
Yeah, it's an acronym that he came up

409
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,320
with, just like we have PWS for Pope's

410
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:04,900
Work Schedule.

411
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,100
That's his own personal thing.

412
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:06,960
I looked it up once.

413
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:11,160
It's the Overall Control, Global Control Group.

414
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,540
I think it stands for something like that.

415
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,120
Overall Global Control Group.

416
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,640
So his version of Illuminati, basically.

417
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,000
Yeah, well, not his version, but he's just

418
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,740
describing it.

419
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,740
Yeah, pretty much.

420
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,680
The Illuminati are supposedly just a section of

421
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,860
a class of people.

422
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,720
He's speaking of someone that you've never heard

423
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:30,840
of.

424
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,680
We've heard of enough of the Illuminati, at

425
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,700
least the founder and all that of the

426
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,020
group, but you'll really never know.

427
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,680
And they're not even really called the Illuminati.

428
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,780
They have a secret name.

429
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:45,980
It's someone's name they use, right?

430
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:46,480
Right.

431
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,440
So just like, you know, if I say,

432
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,700
we got any Mary Jane, right?

433
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,660
Kind of thing like that.

434
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,720
So yeah, I think he's talking about the

435
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,280
power structure.

436
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,480
I've spoken of them that way.

437
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,140
I know they're not human, and they're not

438
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:58,720
on the surface.

439
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,400
They obviously have agents and proxies on the

440
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:02,800
surface.

441
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,220
Right.

442
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,060
But it's not so.

443
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:05,880
What else you got?

444
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,820
Okay, so last thing I got is, this

445
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,920
is about the financial thing.

446
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,080
Also, if there is a new financial system

447
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,960
coming out, and if this is the seventh

448
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,420
cycle, do you think new lawful money is

449
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,480
being introduced to replace the old lawful money?

450
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,580
That's part one of the question.

451
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,300
No, I think so.

452
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,580
You're not going to get anything lawful unless

453
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,500
you do injunctions.

454
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,480
And also, if you study most laws, you

455
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,520
can turn anything into lawful money by putting

456
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,800
a restrictive endorsement.

457
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,240
Not gold and silver coin, which is real

458
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,000
money, but it will put you in the

459
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,900
category as if you were using lawful money.

460
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,300
One day when I brought up the term

461
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,880
injunction, that's the private remedy to what's going

462
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,620
on in the public.

463
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,520
For example, this ties in with an injunction

464
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,560
for driving is when the cops pull you

465
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,000
over and you don't have a driver's license,

466
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,360
he goes to you, looks up your name,

467
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,400
and on the screen it says, do not

468
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,060
arrest, do not detain, release immediately.

469
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,300
He's like, oh, you're one of those.

470
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:03,240
Right.

471
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,280
You can do that for taxes.

472
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,380
You can do it for anything.

473
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,140
And it's a private remedy.

474
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:11,340
It's basically a private lawsuit, and they always

475
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:11,960
accept it.

476
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:16,760
I've never heard of anyone had it rebutted

477
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,320
or whatever.

478
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,900
But because in public, you always have to

479
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,280
lose.

480
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,240
In private is where you really win.

481
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,440
And when there's a public win, there's still

482
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,060
a loser because in order for you to

483
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:29,680
win, someone loses.

484
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,120
So in private, you have win-win.

485
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,620
In public, you have winner-loser.

486
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:37,420
In private, you have good guy, good guy,

487
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,680
bad guy, bad guy.

488
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,960
But in public, it always has to be

489
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,940
good guy, bad guy.

490
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:43,420
Right.

491
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,000
You have to have that duality in public.

492
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:46,680
Right.

493
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,460
So like in public, magnets are North Pole,

494
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,000
South Pole.

495
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,960
In private, there's the block wall.

496
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,520
There always has to be someone is in

497
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,840
the right, someone is in the wrong.

498
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,720
A good guy, up and down.

499
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,400
Yeah, no, never in the middle, never.

500
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,660
So these things that a lot of these

501
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,680
law gurus that are talking about, it's all

502
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,580
bullshit, unless they delineate public and private, which

503
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,440
some of them do, but they don't know

504
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,560
how to operate in it.

505
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,400
Private is what you make it, right?

506
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,920
So that's why a lot of times with

507
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,020
the homosexuals, most of the commentary was what?

508
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,160
I don't care about what you do in

509
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:20,860
private.

510
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,620
In private, behind closed doors, all that.

511
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,600
But once you make it public, that's how

512
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,380
you divide everyone because, oh, part of the

513
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,260
public says, oh, those are the good guys.

514
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,740
And the other part of the public says,

515
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,540
oh, those are the bad guys.

516
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:33,880
Yeah.

517
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,520
Like it or dislike, right?

518
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:39,480
But the general consensus is it's private.

519
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,640
Whether it's good or bad, it doesn't matter.

520
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,080
It's private.

521
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,680
Private doesn't matter so long as people are

522
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,320
there of their own free will.

523
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,880
Yeah, but the maxims of law are still

524
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,540
withheld in private, the maxim of law.

525
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,380
So if you don't answer, if you acquiesce

526
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:57,160
to something, you lost the upper hand.

527
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,420
So we'll get into injunctions one of these

528
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,620
days a little bit just to see.

529
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,880
There's plenty of stuff online.

530
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,980
I don't know if I would use anything

531
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,920
there because you have to know how to

532
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,040
do a proper affidavit.

533
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,300
But sure as hell, I'm doing injunctions.

534
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,200
I mean, I already have one for travel,

535
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,599
which I've used successfully.

536
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:11,740
But it's.

537
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,640
Oh, he went away again.

538
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,200
Yeah.

539
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,319
The screen just cut off.

540
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:17,720
So, yeah.

541
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:19,359
So that was what was the second part

542
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:19,859
of the question?

543
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,180
Oh, the second part of the question has

544
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,460
come up with a lot of people, though.

545
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,740
And they've all asked the same thing, basically,

546
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:27,140
which is the current financial system in the

547
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,480
process of being destroyed.

548
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,980
Is that going on?

549
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,000
And is it being replaced with something else?

550
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,140
Which is what he says here.

551
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,380
Just another way to clean up the lawful

552
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,700
money by giving people something.

553
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,220
No, no, it's not being you can't destroy

554
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,140
something that's based purely on credit.

555
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,220
So it's already destroyed.

556
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:45,700
Right.

557
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:46,180
Right.

558
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,580
It's already it's kind of like imagine a

559
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:52,380
ship sinks and everyone's got these life preservers.

560
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,340
And someone comes up and says, do you

561
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,220
think we're going to get any life preservers?

562
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,500
You're going to say, dude, we're in life

563
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,140
preservers.

564
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,100
What are you talking about?

565
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:02,500
Right.

566
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,000
Right.

567
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,320
Now, what's going on is just like you've

568
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,780
heard, police have a license to kill.

569
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,400
Lawyers have a license to steal.

570
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,000
Right.

571
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:09,800
Yeah.

572
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,500
So they're just changing the way they're stealing

573
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:11,860
from you.

574
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,020
It's a little more obvious.

575
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,700
Kind of like when someone's cheating on you,

576
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,340
they hide it.

577
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,000
But then when you don't care, it's not

578
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,860
so they don't have to be so hiding.

579
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,600
They're just not hiding.

580
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,080
They're not doing anything that they haven't done

581
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,320
in the past 90 years anymore or any

582
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:26,680
less.

583
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:33,020
They're just making it the actions are more

584
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,140
public, I should say.

585
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,480
Like, for example, if you use a short

586
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,280
example, I remember about four or five years

587
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,500
ago, the FBI went in and took safety

588
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,300
deposit boxes out of California.

589
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:42,840
Yeah.

590
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:43,300
Right.

591
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,700
Well, that's because when you got the they

592
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,840
didn't do everyone, only the ones that were

593
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,780
standard agreement.

594
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,560
Whoever modified the agreement, because when you didn't

595
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,340
get a safety deposit, you didn't get their

596
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,280
box raided and stolen.

597
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,720
When you get a safety deposit box or

598
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,260
any agreement with the bank, it says that

599
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,540
you're basically transferring all of your security interest,

600
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,420
meaning any value that you have to them.

601
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,880
All of it, not some of it.

602
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,200
It's not it's unconditional.

603
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,900
So you need to change that.

604
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,220
Yeah, we'll get we'll get into that.

605
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,620
We talked a lot about that in the

606
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,340
financial class.

607
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:18,200
When Tomiko was around, she's she's very heavily

608
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,280
on modifying and rescinding aspects of a contract

609
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:21,780
and all that.

610
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,280
So all they're going to do is use

611
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,560
more of the what they've been doing and

612
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,220
just letting you know.

613
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,560
So in other words, when they say, oh,

614
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,640
people are losing their homes, the same amount

615
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,180
of people are losing their homes whenever it's

616
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,020
just it's more popular in the news.

617
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:37,860
Yeah.

618
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,900
There might be a slight change, like a

619
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,980
deviation, maybe five percent more or whatever.

620
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,280
But it's not like suddenly everyone's getting a

621
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,220
home foreclosed.

622
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,220
There's nothing like that's going to happen because

623
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,120
you're you're living on credit as it is.

624
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,420
Well, in 2008, there was a big shift,

625
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,600
though, because they turned around and they dropped

626
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,980
a whole bunch of, you know, supposed guarantees

627
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,680
were all gone.

628
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,340
So that's.

629
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,960
Yeah, well, that's all one sided, though.

630
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,040
It's all one sided.

631
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:10,920
You see, those guarantees are whenever there has

632
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,100
guarantees, they were just conditions that could be

633
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:13,500
modified.

634
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,360
But because no one reads, it doesn't matter.

635
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:16,700
Right.

636
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,920
For example, do you know that if you

637
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,620
have enough time, let's say you paid off

638
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,440
a car loan, you can go back and

639
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,000
say, you know, that's fraud and factum fraud

640
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,040
and factum.

641
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,000
That's fraud.

642
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,580
And in fact, I am.

643
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,460
F.A.C.T.U.M. Yeah.

644
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,480
Which basically means that they didn't have the

645
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,880
thing to lend you the money.

646
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:37,400
Yeah.

647
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,500
They asked you to do something because it

648
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:39,960
was this.

649
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,800
And it turns out what what this was

650
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,840
is not it at all.

651
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:43,240
Right.

652
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:47,000
You can go back with several ways.

653
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,980
The main way is with an affidavit and

654
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:54,540
recoup everything, everything you've paid them, plus the

655
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:54,860
original.

656
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,160
So then you can go for damages three

657
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:57,760
times the amount.

658
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,980
So it's a ten thousand dollar car.

659
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,120
You should get the car and thirty thousand

660
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:02,800
dollars.

661
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,080
Right.

662
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,440
Actually, forty thousand.

663
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,860
The ten thousand plus that, whatever.

664
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,500
But it takes a long time and there's

665
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,840
no court that'll that'll take that as a

666
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,740
legitimate case.

667
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,140
In other words, they don't want that in

668
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:15,580
the public.

669
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,180
So they're going to settle with you or

670
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,660
drag it on for a long time.

671
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,100
Right.

672
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,740
We notice something is being dragged.

673
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,420
There are ways to speed it up also,

674
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,760
but that will be more later on the

675
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,720
road or more private, let's say, discussion.

676
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,220
But I was going to ask you something

677
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,440
about the safety deposit boxes just real fast,

678
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,060
because it has something to do with something

679
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,020
legitimate that I've been trying to track down

680
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:35,940
for a few years.

681
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,220
You know, there was a case where something

682
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,780
of historical value was put into a safety

683
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,880
deposit box by somebody who was the alleged

684
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,580
head of a company.

685
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:43,920
Right.

686
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,940
And then that person died.

687
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,980
So nobody in the world seemed to know

688
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,660
where this person put it in the safety

689
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,460
deposit box, but that it was placed in

690
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,480
the safety deposit box and nobody could find

691
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:54,840
it again.

692
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,040
Now, that doesn't mean this thing doesn't exist

693
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,420
anymore.

694
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,560
But who can even access that now?

695
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,480
Well, it's a lost property, but it's it's

696
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,200
still if it's in a safety, we're presuming

697
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,680
it's still the safety deposit box, then you

698
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,580
have to find the bank who has the

699
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,640
safety deposit box.

700
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:11,940
Right.

701
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,280
OK.

702
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,380
Now, it's actually it's not that difficult to

703
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,380
do, by the way, because they're all listed.

704
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,340
And this person, you know, a good investigator

705
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,880
should be able to hunt that down in

706
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,260
a week.

707
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,280
Yeah.

708
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,500
Well, if somebody tried for about 10 years

709
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,240
and couldn't find it because what happened is

710
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,440
it was a good investigator.

711
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:29,320
Yeah.

712
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:29,720
Yeah.

713
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,200
But I've seen it done by people that

714
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,900
I thought were good investigators and they couldn't

715
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,280
find it.

716
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,680
But anyway, exactly.

717
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,240
So you don't have to be smart.

718
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,960
You just have to look smart or sound

719
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,300
smart.

720
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:39,600
Yeah.

721
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,340
Well, yeah.

722
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:40,860
There you go.

723
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,500
I get it.

724
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,560
It's not a put down, but I'm just

725
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,100
saying, you know.

726
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:43,800
I hear you.

727
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,440
Look, you don't know until you get the

728
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,420
results most times.

729
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,080
You know what I mean?

730
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,520
Quite frankly, you can try and judge character

731
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,400
all you want, but sometimes you get surprised.

732
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:52,860
No, I agree.

733
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,060
It's all perform.

734
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,060
I'm performing like my old mentor, Trevor James

735
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,140
Constable said, it's all the results count.

736
00:22:59,520 --> 00:22:59,980
Well, right.

737
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,740
So I don't care what your title is.

738
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,200
I don't care what your history is.

739
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,720
You know, how about what results you're going

740
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,120
to get me?

741
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,800
And if you get the right results, that's

742
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,260
what counts.

743
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:07,700
Yeah.

744
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,140
Well, you might care a little bit, but

745
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,080
it doesn't factor in if you're not performing.

746
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,420
There you go.

747
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,540
No performance.

748
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:13,900
No.

749
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,660
Doesn't matter.

750
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:15,540
Yeah.

751
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:15,760
So.

752
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:16,300
Okay.

753
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,060
Well, anyway, did you have any other stuff

754
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,520
from chat or anything else you want to

755
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:19,780
go over?

756
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,240
Because I'm out of questions over here.

757
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,000
No, so am I.

758
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,420
I think we'll keep this one short and

759
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,340
we'll compensate for a longer one on the

760
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:25,780
next one.

761
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:26,860
Fair enough.

762
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,980
Anyway, we'll keep we'll keep playing with Jitsi

763
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:29,840
and see how that goes.

764
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:30,940
Yeah.

765
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,400
I'll figure out how to keep the keep

766
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,920
it going when the screen blacks out.

767
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,660
By the way, if anyone hears this, if

768
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:40,080
you have a slab or a stupid rectangle

769
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,520
and you're on a Jitsi call, when the

770
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,120
screen goes black, how do you keep the

771
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:44,640
call going?

772
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,680
Just put it in the chatango.

773
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,160
Thank you.

774
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:47,540
Yeah.

775
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,260
Please do that.

776
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,680
Or, you know, send it to me on

777
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,400
on if you send it on the Patreon,

778
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,820
I'll pick it up and I'll bring it

779
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,580
to the Greek as well.

780
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,280
Either way, let us know if you know

781
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,500
how to do that, because I'm not using

782
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,240
a stupid rectangle.

783
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,780
I'm using a big old bulky computer.

784
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,160
So.

785
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,280
All right.

786
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,100
Thank you.
