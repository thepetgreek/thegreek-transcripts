1
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,740
Hey, Rated Y, Sonic Event 202, Greek, how

2
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:13,000
are you?

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,820
Yeah, it works either way.

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:16,680
I'm doing okay.

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,760
We were just trying to figure out, you

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,780
know, I'm trying to get the Jitsi to

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,560
work on a phone when the screen is

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:22,820
locked.

9
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,200
We have a solution on how to unlock

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,780
the screen, but the thing is I would

11
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,180
like to have it in a pocket, because

12
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,720
if you have an unlocked screen in a

13
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,060
purse or a pocket or whatever, it's like

14
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,040
a cat walking across a keyboard.

15
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:34,860
Yeah.

16
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,080
He was just telling you how to keep

17
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,280
it on so it doesn't black out from

18
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:40,980
the power thing.

19
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:41,640
No, yeah.

20
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:42,500
That's easy.

21
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,300
That's, yeah.

22
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,640
But it's, and I'm not using the Android.

23
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,900
I'm sticking with Apple, because it's just more

24
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,460
unintuitive shit to learn.

25
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,060
People don't know that I've always, when I

26
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,020
was handed a smartphone, I kind of like,

27
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:56,380
cool.

28
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,640
And then when I found out that all

29
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,760
the phones are going to be like that,

30
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,500
I said, very uncool.

31
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:02,960
Yes.

32
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:03,800
Very uncool.

33
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,160
Because it's so large.

34
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,240
You know, it's sort of like when they

35
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,160
started putting the cameras on the phones, I

36
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,000
thought it was great.

37
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,300
It was like, oh, this is cool.

38
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,180
I got a camera now.

39
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,200
And then everybody's phone is a camera.

40
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,700
So it's really a camera.

41
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,040
Well, now you're talking about, you're talking about

42
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,820
the interface.

43
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:17,740
See, um.

44
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,480
But that's the.

45
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,360
How do you carry it?

46
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,740
How do you carry a smartphone, right?

47
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:22,720
Yeah.

48
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,200
In your pocket.

49
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,360
And this is deliberate.

50
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,700
Well, yeah, I can't.

51
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,200
I won't.

52
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,060
I'd rather go.

53
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:27,760
And I do.

54
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,180
I've gone back.

55
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,040
I don't carry it.

56
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,680
But I have gone back.

57
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,120
I do not carry it.

58
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,640
I have gone back to how things were

59
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,280
when I was growing up, when the phone

60
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,620
rang, it was important.

61
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:40,440
Right.

62
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,040
Right.

63
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,720
And or you had a wrong number and

64
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,180
a wrong number was such a bummer.

65
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,580
And the phone was on a cord on

66
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,060
the wall.

67
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,980
Well, if you see where I work or

68
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,560
live or whatever, the phone is on a

69
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,000
cord on the wall.

70
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,040
The iPhone.

71
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:58,680
Right.

72
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,740
It's another reason they make it so uncomfortable.

73
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,640
First of all, most people are braindead.

74
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,960
If not, if I say all people with

75
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,340
few exception are braindead, it's a better statement.

76
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,260
What they do, they're making them so uncomfortable.

77
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,940
So now when it comes time to put

78
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,440
a chip in you to do it, it'll

79
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:15,900
be great.

80
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,320
We don't have to carry this big thing

81
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,180
instead of making it ergonomic or something.

82
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:19,520
Right.

83
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,120
It's very South Park.

84
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,460
What I see going on, which that's why

85
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,300
people like these parodies, you know, they never

86
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,380
tell you the truth.

87
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,940
So whatever they tell you is true is

88
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,740
actually fiction.

89
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,080
But the truth is cloaked in fiction.

90
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,220
If you want the truth, you're going to

91
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,500
have to go towards the fictional venues.

92
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,840
Just like I said, when I first came

93
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,140
here to Tucson, I went to the library

94
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,360
walking around.

95
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,160
I thought it was abandoned.

96
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,440
The librarian pops out and she's like, oh,

97
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,860
everything on this side is nonfiction.

98
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,060
Everything here is fiction.

99
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,720
I told her, hey, baby, everything in here

100
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,160
is fiction.

101
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,040
Because I looked at it, the books on

102
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,660
the shelves and they look like college, they

103
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,680
smell like college books.

104
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:53,180
Yeah.

105
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:53,900
But there's textbooks.

106
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,980
But there's a little bit of nonfiction sprinkled

107
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,340
in there.

108
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,680
South Park is great.

109
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,440
I mean, what they're telling.

110
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:58,840
Yeah.

111
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,940
So this is a ridiculous scenario.

112
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,460
Well, South Park is especially great.

113
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,100
You know what?

114
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,840
I was in the middle of an open

115
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,620
chat last night, you know, on my call

116
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,020
and show.

117
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,720
And it was funny because I went through

118
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,620
this whole thing about, did you see the

119
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,960
recent a with CRISPR technology, we figured out

120
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,980
how to put a pig kidney into a

121
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:17,720
person now.

122
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,160
A real transplant from a pig.

123
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,480
And I was going, they do this every

124
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,360
couple of years.

125
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,120
They're transplanting from a pig.

126
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,400
I haven't watched a South Park in over

127
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,140
20 years.

128
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,680
You know, I don't need to because I

129
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,140
know what they're doing and I'm glad that

130
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:30,580
they're doing it.

131
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,040
You know, they killed Kenny as Donald Marshall,

132
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,800
supposedly.

133
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,080
Donald Marshall, really, it's really around the stuff

134
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,480
discussed at cloning centers.

135
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,740
And what I mean by that is, you

136
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,740
know, because Donald Marshall's always killed at the

137
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,300
cloning centers.

138
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,060
You know, this is according to the annals

139
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:46,940
of Donald Marshall.

140
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,600
And, you know, a lot of people, by

141
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,620
the way, I turn them on to Donald

142
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,980
Marshall and whatever friend of mine, Daniel, does,

143
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,900
does a lot of compilations.

144
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,380
And he's interviewed Time Rider and all that.

145
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,840
People think it's too wild.

146
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,700
And I'm like, are you kidding?

147
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,300
That's mild.

148
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,740
That's mild.

149
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,480
It's really, you know, for example, if you

150
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,300
read the laws or real science, what's going

151
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,920
on, what, you know, all the exclusions that

152
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,420
they take out of experiments, that is way

153
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,040
freakier.

154
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,459
Like the laws and the way the money

155
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,760
system works is way freakier than any story

156
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,680
about underground cloning centers and consciousness transfer.

157
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:23,980
Right.

158
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,540
Oh, yeah.

159
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:29,160
And coincidence conspiracy is even more insane than

160
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,040
the most insane.

161
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,000
Because, like, if you look at a guy

162
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,160
like Jolly West, it's perfect example of both

163
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,720
of these things.

164
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,360
You know, Jolly West was right.

165
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,940
I heard of the name that Johnny, I

166
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,900
know Johnny West on Speed Racer or something

167
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,340
like that.

168
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,300
But Jolly West, no.

169
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,040
I think that was maybe Johnny Test.

170
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,480
But Jolly West was an MKUltra doctor.

171
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:46,920
Right.

172
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,780
And he just happened to get a session

173
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,980
with Jack Ruby right before he went insane.

174
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,120
Oh, yeah, that's right.

175
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,800
But he also, it turns out, Tom O

176
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,860
'Neill dug it up in his own personal

177
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,620
letters and everything.

178
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,040
And there go the dogs for some reason.

179
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:01,560
That's fine.

180
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,720
But we hardly hear it.

181
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:02,940
Yeah.

182
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,320
Cool.

183
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,780
But he also was there with Charles Manson

184
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,960
when he was in Haight-Ashbury.

185
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,820
And apparently one of his primary things was

186
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,840
trying to do mind control through LSD.

187
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,220
Also, he happened to get a private session

188
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,340
with Sirhan Sirhan.

189
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,740
You're starting to stack up the interesting coincidence

190
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,680
here with Jolly West and MKUltra.

191
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,060
Yeah.

192
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,040
Funny stuff.

193
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,980
It's kind of like whenever there's a public

194
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:29,100
incident, you see Wackenhut ascent to security.

195
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:29,760
Right.

196
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,780
Same thing.

197
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,440
Whenever it's a, what do you call it,

198
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,860
state sponsored, which is you have two states.

199
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,240
So anyway, it's funny.

200
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,880
But it's funny that you brought up the

201
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,460
dogs, because I was thinking about that, you

202
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,700
know, kind of like I try to focus

203
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,760
on when someone else is speaking.

204
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,740
But the thought came up.

205
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,240
I have someone in my contacts.

206
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,600
I think he's a sub and he's Greek.

207
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,620
And he thinks I'm very Greek.

208
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,420
And he always sends me very like stuff

209
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,040
kind of messages that it's like he eats

210
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,000
razor blades for breakfast or something like I

211
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,620
mispronounced a word or I had to look

212
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,420
something up.

213
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,140
It's shameful.

214
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,320
And he says he sent me some philosophical

215
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,120
stuff and I don't get it and all

216
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,300
that.

217
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,340
But he's very cryptic, can't communicate what his

218
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:08,800
point is.

219
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,520
See, the thing about.

220
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,520
Well, you should know better.

221
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,040
Greeks don't eat that kind of food.

222
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,020
Greek, you know.

223
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,980
What I'm saying, though, is I've had this

224
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,560
in the past.

225
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,560
And I bring it up because he's Greek.

226
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,120
First of all, the only reason I'm Greek

227
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,440
is because I have a really long name.

228
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,600
If you say it fast, you get a

229
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:22,920
hernia.

230
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,620
The reason I'm not interested.

231
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,300
Nobody can look good.

232
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,620
Because Greece is a Euro trash place, you

233
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:30,820
know.

234
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,740
And nobody can look good saying a Greek

235
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,480
name, by the way.

236
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,460
It's kind of Euro trashy, really.

237
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,220
I'm not.

238
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,540
It's I really would like to disconnect from.

239
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,180
But it's stuck and it's there.

240
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,160
And it's it allows me some people.

241
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,800
You know, when you meet when I meet

242
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,660
people and I said my nickname is the

243
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:49,800
Greeks.

244
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,740
Oh, I know Greeks.

245
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,620
I'm like, oh, I'm sorry.

246
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,580
I'm the only Greek I know.

247
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,740
I really I don't have a dislike for

248
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:56,960
him.

249
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,660
But it's it's I could say they're Euro

250
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,100
trash.

251
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,240
You know, that's fine.

252
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,460
You just don't have that.

253
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,760
You don't have that ancestral attachment.

254
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:05,980
No, no, they're gone.

255
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,680
No, my ancestors are gone.

256
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,860
I'm some kind of freak.

257
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,860
Well, like you shouldn't even be here.

258
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,780
Like when a guy is great.

259
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,800
Yeah, like the Rocky example.

260
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,160
Sorry.

261
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,060
But with the Rocky example, when people like

262
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,620
call themselves like the Italian style, it's usually

263
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,740
because they're proud of the fact that they're

264
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,160
Italian.

265
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,120
Oh, my God.

266
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,100
They're thinking that you are proud to be

267
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,740
a Greek is what the problem is here.

268
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,040
No, no, not at all.

269
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:29,800
It's not a problem.

270
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,600
It's a perception.

271
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,360
And the thing is about pronouncing words and

272
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,020
knowing the difference.

273
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,460
You know, I could train a dog to

274
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:35,960
speak Greek.

275
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,240
As a matter of fact, I had.

276
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,980
So I don't care about any of that.

277
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,820
So anyway, I'm reaching out to whoever I'm

278
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,660
not going to use his name.

279
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,500
You know who you are.

280
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,520
There's a couple of them, actually.

281
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,480
Come on.

282
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,280
Come on.

283
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,060
We'll invite you on.

284
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,980
Let me know when it's convenient for you.

285
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,560
You probably in that slum known as Athens

286
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,860
or not, wherever you are.

287
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,900
We'll make a time and enlighten us with

288
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,500
your philosophy.

289
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,560
I mean, it's like Greek stuff to read.

290
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,520
And it's like I'm reading.

291
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,280
I'm like, I don't get it.

292
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,160
This is just like airy, fairy crap.

293
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,460
So if you can, here's the thing.

294
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,780
Like I tell people, I try to study

295
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,020
stuff.

296
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,980
If you can't communicate it, guess what?

297
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:12,920
You don't know it.

298
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,120
And if you're not a good communicator, that

299
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,000
means you have very little.

300
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,000
You have no input.

301
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,000
So either way you the way you know

302
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,920
if someone is.

303
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,020
And this is not about the specific person.

304
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,980
I'm just saying specifically people who can't communicate.

305
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,340
Also, it's a two way street.

306
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,380
Have very little input.

307
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,660
There's exceptions.

308
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,299
You know where people really can't speak or

309
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:33,679
whatever.

310
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,500
But they're keen.

311
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,799
But it's two way street.

312
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,620
So someone who can take in can also

313
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,200
put out.

314
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,419
Oh, that sounds like a good day there.

315
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,640
It does sound a little lascivious.

316
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,640
Yeah, she put out.

317
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,420
So here's the thing.

318
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,940
When people tell me you're not getting it.

319
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,580
Getting what?

320
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,460
Give it to me in 30 seconds.

321
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,880
Oh, that's too fast.

322
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,060
Man, you're going crazy.

323
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,720
Give it to me.

324
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,160
What's the second half that counts?

325
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,300
You're a little sexually frustrated there, Greek.

326
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,140
Is that what you term?

327
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,880
I would say, well, yeah, I don't do

328
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,420
that anymore.

329
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,520
But I wouldn't say frustration.

330
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,920
It's a new part of my life, you

331
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,060
know.

332
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,580
I'm trying to eliminate other than like quality

333
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,040
food.

334
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,140
Because food is really your fuel.

335
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,480
Like putting the wrong gasoline.

336
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,660
But you're not burning anything.

337
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,360
But I've eliminated all platters like any kind

338
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:17,880
of celebration.

339
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,320
Go ahead.

340
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,960
I have no interest in that.

341
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,100
People think like, but I'm not a downer.

342
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,820
Hopefully I'm not perceived as a downer.

343
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,820
But if it's a celebration or whatever, I'll

344
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,220
join.

345
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,780
But I'm not interested in any of those

346
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,260
emotional pastimes and all that.

347
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,840
My stuff is just a.

348
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,400
Because I know too much.

349
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,800
I don't know everything.

350
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,720
I don't even know a lot.

351
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,440
But I know too much to participate in

352
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,060
what other people consider to be a well

353
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,120
-structured whatever.

354
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:44,500
Right.

355
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,960
But the going back to communication and all

356
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,500
this and how to live and all that

357
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,700
is really where it's at.

358
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,320
Because the part that I get frustrated about

359
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:56,880
is.

360
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,100
And I can objectify this.

361
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,720
It sounds very subjective and opinion based.

362
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,200
But I see people don't know how to

363
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:01,460
live.

364
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,100
They don't know how to live.

365
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:03,900
They don't know how to eat.

366
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,540
They don't know how to clean.

367
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,060
I mean, like just general, whether it's hygiene

368
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:08,680
or their homes.

369
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,260
They don't know how the body works.

370
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,400
They don't know how to keep time.

371
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,480
They cannot coalesce anything that's real.

372
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,940
And keeping time is important.

373
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,340
You know, like, for example, the oleander here

374
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,480
in Tucson always starts blooming on the second

375
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,560
week of the second month.

376
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,320
And on the Pope's work schedule, it could

377
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,320
be three weeks off, two weeks off, right?

378
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,500
Sometimes more.

379
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,300
So but it's always on time.

380
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,640
So what I mean is, you know, someone

381
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,960
said, oh, you should go, you know, someone,

382
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,180
a doctor that I know.

383
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,580
She read a book about another doctor saying

384
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,480
that, yeah, you know, diabetes is this.

385
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,540
I said, he needs to join.

386
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,300
If he if he really wants to learn,

387
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,400
he needs to come on to my sonic

388
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,940
or I'll do a webinar on that.

389
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,920
And she got like she couldn't understand that

390
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,860
because I'm not a doctor.

391
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:55,660
I don't write books.

392
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,480
How would you know more?

393
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,920
Because she was telling me, would you get

394
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,400
out of that book?

395
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,440
I'm like, this guy's an amateur.

396
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,000
He doesn't know what's going on.

397
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,460
He's beating around the bush for 30 seconds.

398
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,000
But you don't have the piece of paper,

399
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:05,400
Greek.

400
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,720
So what do you know?

401
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,100
Oh, my gosh, they're all idiots.

402
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,380
Yeah, all of them.

403
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,240
What's a little exception?

404
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,120
Here's the thing with the doctors and lawyers.

405
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,080
They are moronic.

406
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,900
And now they're the exceptions.

407
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,720
I have to repeat this.

408
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,640
The exceptions are the people that are well

409
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,540
intended to go into those fields and they

410
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,660
find out what's going on, really.

411
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:25,620
Right.

412
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,380
And now they need an exit strategy.

413
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,420
Well, first, typically, when you find out what's

414
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,960
going on, the first even emotional thing is,

415
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,820
can I change it?

416
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,080
Can I do something better?

417
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,320
And if they go down that route, they're

418
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,240
going to find that the superiors right away,

419
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,120
they stick out and they're like, you have.

420
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,560
We don't want anything better.

421
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,020
We want you to do it standard.

422
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,620
And there's a kitty cat.

423
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,340
We want you to do it the regular

424
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,600
way that's accepted.

425
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,820
So so the exceptions are the people that

426
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:52,580
want to make it better.

427
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,860
They don't last ever.

428
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,680
And then they look for an exit strategy.

429
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,580
Now, an exit strategy could be anywhere between

430
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,520
two weeks and two years, even five years,

431
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,140
I've seen.

432
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,920
So those are the exceptions.

433
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,240
But the ones that stay in there are

434
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:04,580
happy.

435
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,340
I have to say it that way.

436
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,660
And there's no.

437
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,940
And that's and in that case, there is

438
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,600
no exception.

439
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,780
And unfortunately, like I know a woman from

440
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,040
Chile and she goes, oh, I don't like

441
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,840
American doctors.

442
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,420
I say, well, what does American have to

443
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:20,920
do with it?

444
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,920
And she goes on to Chile to have

445
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,400
herself examined and all that.

446
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,260
And they do this.

447
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,940
I said, do they today when you walked

448
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,940
in, did they strap a cuff on your

449
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,200
arm, inflate it and tell you had blood

450
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:32,520
pressure?

451
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,680
Yeah, they did a blood test, right?

452
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,100
Yeah.

453
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,380
They did a blood sugar test.

454
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,480
Yeah, I said they're idiots.

455
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,460
Well, they're speaking the same thing.

456
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,680
Yeah, I don't want to know.

457
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,540
She's I want to show you what.

458
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,720
No, I'm not interested.

459
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,540
They're speaking the same medical language regardless of

460
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,760
the conversation.

461
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:49,660
That's right.

462
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,620
Same with attorneys.

463
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:51,600
They're minors.

464
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,400
What they are there.

465
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,840
This is how if you want to get

466
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,440
legal about it or in law, they would

467
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,500
be called as wards or minors in custody.

468
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,260
In other words, they have a custodianship over

469
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,220
them and they're considered minors.

470
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,800
I think I've read several.

471
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,900
Maybe she wants a code, a state code

472
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,060
that said that you'll be even you'll be

473
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:10,940
considered a minor.

474
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,300
I was about money banking.

475
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,860
You'll be considered.

476
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,780
You can be considered a minor even though

477
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,360
you are of legal age.

478
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,140
Right.

479
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:18,860
Yeah.

480
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,660
By the way, anyone who deals with the

481
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,720
Social Security Administration is considered a minor.

482
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,600
That's called a minor accounts in the palms

483
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:24,960
manual.

484
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,080
The primary account is the Treasury account.

485
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,340
So that's why they treat you like a

486
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:30,840
little baby.

487
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,180
We're only going to give you this much

488
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:32,500
or whatever.

489
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,540
They're easy to turn inside.

490
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,880
By the way, anyone who wants to get

491
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,720
the quote unquote minor benefits from the Social

492
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,480
Security Administration.

493
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,740
Oh, you have to go to a hearing.

494
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,380
They'll never really because this all this stuff.

495
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,400
Attorneys also.

496
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,080
What's his name?

497
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,900
Brandon Joe Williams put out some stuff lately.

498
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,420
Just randomly bookmark some stuff like just to

499
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,360
see the latest videos.

500
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,700
And he had a pretty good interview, which

501
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,160
is interesting.

502
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,840
30 subscribers or two subscribers, no views.

503
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,020
And it's been a week, which is not

504
00:13:59,020 --> 00:13:59,280
true.

505
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,680
There's over 2000 views.

506
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,880
And they have a funky little channel.

507
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,220
But anyway, he talks about how bar cards.

508
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,500
He's starting to realize that there are a

509
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,920
bunch of retard stuff that I've been saying

510
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,600
for decades.

511
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,680
And they're all about threats and intimidation.

512
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,620
Same with doctors.

513
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,500
Now, all of this is like saying, you

514
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,480
know, an idiot would say, Greek, are you

515
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,760
saying we shouldn't have medicine?

516
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,700
Shouldn't have law?

517
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,800
This is the idiot level, which is they

518
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,000
are.

519
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,500
This is the response that I usually get.

520
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,260
It's like a minor, like a child, a

521
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,340
nine year old reaction.

522
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,660
We're talking about 60 year old attorneys.

523
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,840
And 50 year old doctors react this way.

524
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,960
Greek, you're saying we shouldn't have any medicine.

525
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:35,980
We shouldn't have any laws.

526
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,980
I can never said that.

527
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,020
We need to have competent medicine and competent

528
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:39,300
law.

529
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,940
And the reason why it's like this, it's

530
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,760
totally in reverse, is proof.

531
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,360
And it's a testament to the robustness of

532
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,240
the human condition.

533
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,820
You can have a human society set up.

534
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,200
The people think there's government.

535
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,240
And there is no government.

536
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,380
In other words, if you denominate how the

537
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,520
government is set up, you're not in a

538
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,220
government at all.

539
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,860
It's corporate completely, even though the real government's

540
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,020
there.

541
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,320
You have no law.

542
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,900
You have no medicine.

543
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,020
If you think you have any law or

544
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,980
medicine, you are actually pretty normal.

545
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,540
You would have no problem with proper law

546
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,400
or proper medicine.

547
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,960
That's right.

548
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,060
Here's the interesting thing about it.

549
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:26,080
In law, it's actually harsher because there's no

550
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,400
negotiation.

551
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,880
There's no plea deal in law.

552
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,980
But there's so few laws that you have

553
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,800
to abide by.

554
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,540
And the golden rule, right?

555
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,340
Don't harm.

556
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,900
Cause no harm.

557
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,300
Actually, I'm going to be working with a

558
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,820
case of business that I'm interested in.

559
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,140
And they said, oh, you can't come in

560
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:42,500
anymore.

561
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,460
We have to do this.

562
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:43,940
And I said, why?

563
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,340
So somebody slipped and fell outside.

564
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,600
Did you do want him to slip and

565
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:46,840
fall?

566
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,460
He says, no, we actually helped him, called

567
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,800
an ambulance, and we're being sued.

568
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,260
And we got it.

569
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,860
Oh, you got put an injunction, right?

570
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,420
On you.

571
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:53,760
Yeah.

572
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,280
How do you know?

573
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,340
I said, unless the guy has a properly

574
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,300
sworn affidavit, you have to have the case.

575
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,580
I said, you have an attorney, right?

576
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,080
Yes, we do.

577
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,080
You probably got him flat $10,000 return.

578
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:04,900
He says, yeah.

579
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,860
I'm like, you know, get rid of him.

580
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,660
The guy's an idiot.

581
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,960
He's going to, the two attorneys, the one

582
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,200
suing you and the one that you hire

583
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,240
talk all the time about how much they're

584
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,240
going to get out of you and how

585
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,620
much percentage they're going to get out of

586
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,000
the other guy, billable hours.

587
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,580
I bet there's no sworn affidavit that he's

588
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,060
been injured.

589
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,360
He can't do it.

590
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,380
I don't know how to do it, by

591
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:24,680
the way.

592
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,140
They do affidavits, but they're not sworn properly

593
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,060
according to the code.

594
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:28,960
And I could give the codes.

595
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,800
Just look up United States codes, unsworn affidavits.

596
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,940
There's two ways to do it.

597
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,420
One is with the United States.

598
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,540
The other one is without the United States.

599
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,000
And you want to do it without the

600
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,860
United States, right?

601
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,540
Because this 14th Amendment citizen is not entitled

602
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,800
to anything when they say with the United

603
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:44,920
States.

604
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,480
You want to do it as a national,

605
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,020
right?

606
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,260
So they even tell you there's a distinction.

607
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,800
They're just like on the passport application.

608
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,240
So anyway, I said, I'll give you an

609
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,300
hour of my time.

610
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,920
And it's going to be very simple.

611
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,080
A very simple laundry list.

612
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,660
And it'll get you out.

613
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,500
And if they don't listen to you and

614
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,339
they pursue, then you counter sue for disturbing

615
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:03,819
commerce.

616
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:06,040
And the penalties of that can be up

617
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,839
to $100 million.

618
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,319
Right?

619
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,700
And you get them off your back.

620
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:11,280
And then you do an injunction.

621
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,220
And I said, how could they put an

622
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:13,780
injunction on you?

623
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,619
You see, it's very hard to do an

624
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,660
injunction out of the blue.

625
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,599
But if you have a repeat offense, like,

626
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,339
you know, there's someone else slipped and fell,

627
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,579
then they can do.

628
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,060
There's more right for an injunction.

629
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:25,500
Right.

630
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,700
But on the first time like that, no,

631
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,440
get the injunction.

632
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,460
Get out, get your business.

633
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,660
And they're like, oh, my gosh.

634
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,100
They're like, are you a lawyer?

635
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,820
So as a matter of fact, it's kind

636
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,360
of a disgrace to say no.

637
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,720
But yes, an attorney.

638
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,440
In fact, not an attorney at law.

639
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,500
Anyone can do that.

640
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,900
For example, a trustee is an attorney.

641
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,860
In fact, you know, anyone who has power

642
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,120
of attorney, you can give me power of

643
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:46,460
attorney.

644
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,120
Right.

645
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,560
And I can give you power of attorney.

646
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,160
You go sign anything for me.

647
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,460
The only thing is in these fake courts,

648
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,700
you can't go and represent me in a

649
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,740
real court, which is a superior court or

650
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,380
the Supreme Court, which is where you're supposed

651
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,820
to be as a as a national.

652
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,600
And this is all in the Constitution.

653
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,640
You can speak.

654
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,160
You can.

655
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,380
I wouldn't represent you, but I would be

656
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,960
brought in as an amicus, whatever.

657
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:11,900
It's a friend of the court.

658
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,020
And I would testify.

659
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:13,520
Yeah.

660
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,540
You give an amicus whatever you give an

661
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:15,900
amicus.

662
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:16,420
Yeah.

663
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:16,840
Yeah.

664
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,040
So it's very simple.

665
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:19,920
This is law.

666
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:23,460
But and what's going on is so heinous

667
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,100
and heinous, meaning on criminal level with the

668
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,500
medical and the legal.

669
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,920
And you'll find it everywhere.

670
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,340
There's no.

671
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:31,660
Let's see.

672
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,880
I remember when I was growing up, when

673
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,780
you had a lung disorder or respiratory, oh,

674
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,100
you got to go to Denver or you

675
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,760
got to go to Tucson, you know, and

676
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,340
you'll recover.

677
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:38,700
Right.

678
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,440
Know that that you don't hear stuff like

679
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:41,880
that anymore.

680
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,600
At this point, you know, there's a medical

681
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:44,940
community.

682
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,620
Say, go here and you live here for

683
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,680
a few weeks and you'll recover.

684
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:47,980
Never.

685
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,940
So what I'm trying to say here is

686
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,140
even small town doctors.

687
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:52,440
Yeah.

688
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,720
The only place you see evidence of that

689
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,380
is when they sent Doc Holliday to the

690
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,520
sanitariums in order to recover from or to

691
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,300
try to recover from the tuberculosis.

692
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:02,660
TB.

693
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,000
Yeah.

694
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,120
This is in the movies, though.

695
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:04,340
Yeah.

696
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,900
But that's in a movie about recently.

697
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,660
So what I'm trying to say is these

698
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:11,100
small town doctors are total morons also because

699
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,280
they've been indoctrinated.

700
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:16,940
If you're considered, quote unquote, professional to work

701
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,380
under that privilege, you have to completely swallow

702
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,900
and vomit out all the indoctrinated bullshit.

703
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,760
And it's getting worse and worse.

704
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,840
In other words, the education.

705
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,280
So what does this mean?

706
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:26,780
OK, yeah.

707
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,300
People that have been around have heard me

708
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,680
say this over and over and over.

709
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,660
You better learn who you are.

710
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,820
I used to say what you are and

711
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,880
where you are and when you are.

712
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,140
Right.

713
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,360
Which is lawful timekeeping.

714
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,180
You don't think, you know, that's that's like

715
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,140
an optional thing.

716
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,780
But it's kind of good to know, have

717
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,020
a feeling for real time.

718
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,780
You know, that's why, like, you know, the

719
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,100
day ends at solar noon.

720
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,900
That's why you kind of like before lunch,

721
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,380
you want to have lunch and take a

722
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:51,920
nap, you know.

723
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:56,940
But anyway, the whole thing is to really

724
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:01,500
know the way I said all these professions

725
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,180
are so screwed up as a testament to

726
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,140
the robustness of the human or the man

727
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,600
and the woman and the body and biology.

728
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,180
And generally in biology in general is very

729
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:10,660
robust.

730
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,460
Learn how to take advantage of that.

731
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:16,340
See people that have been following.

732
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,420
I've done this with several people like medical

733
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,620
protocols and for years and they're getting worse.

734
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,080
Everyone gets worse, by the way.

735
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,600
No one gets better with the medical protocols.

736
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,080
No one.

737
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,620
And if you're on it for many, many

738
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,580
years, they could drag you out and you're

739
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,560
going to just die of cancer.

740
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,580
It's very simple.

741
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,080
And most people that they say die of

742
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,320
cancer don't even have cancer, but they get

743
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:38,760
the treatments.

744
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:43,240
Anyway, what I'm trying to say here is,

745
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:48,020
if you know, well, okay, when I get

746
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,500
them off the protocols, they usually within a

747
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,320
month, they're fine.

748
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,820
And stuff that's gone away completely, you know,

749
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,500
so just do nothing.

750
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:54,900
What do you do?

751
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,060
First of all, this is the basic thing

752
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,620
to take advantage of the protocols, right?

753
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,060
Not the protocols, but take advantage of the

754
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,560
how robust we really are to make sure

755
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,020
you have a good quality water availability.

756
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,760
And that's not a marketing propaganda thing.

757
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,860
Learn how to prepare water yourself.

758
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,180
One thing that's really easy.

759
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:16,960
Anyone can do.

760
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,300
They sell these picture filters.

761
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,040
They call them bread of filters like Walmart

762
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,740
has them for less than 10 bucks or

763
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,460
whatever, right?

764
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,680
And prepare your own water instead of buying

765
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,520
it bottled or having it delivered or whatever

766
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,160
like that.

767
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:29,440
Right.

768
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,160
And but here's the thing.

769
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,100
This is what takes the quality up to

770
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:33,820
the next level.

771
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,160
That bread of filters considered junk.

772
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:36,420
Right.

773
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,000
But if you study absorption for, you know,

774
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,200
for filtering, like carbon, mostly carbon and some

775
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,640
ion resin in there, you'll notice that as

776
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,720
the temperature of the water goes down, the

777
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,180
efficiency goes up to 99%.

778
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:54,780
So if I said someone, I want you

779
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,480
to have good water.

780
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,440
All you need to do is get one

781
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,340
of these picture filters.

782
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:57,720
Right.

783
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,780
Now, you don't want to just do what

784
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,320
all the morons do is they go to

785
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,360
the sink, fill it up.

786
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,760
And the Greek says is great water.

787
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,020
Is he getting sponsored by these guys?

788
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,180
No, no, no.

789
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,340
If you really want to make it great

790
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,000
water, what you do is instead of being

791
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,980
like a regular moron and going to the

792
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,800
sink and pouring the water in there, get

793
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,180
a similar size volume jug and fill that

794
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,540
with the water from the tap and chill

795
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,020
it overnight or at least eight hours in

796
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:25,600
the fridge.

797
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:26,580
Right.

798
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,840
And then run it through the filter.

799
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:29,800
Right.

800
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,700
And you don't I'm not talking about having

801
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,040
it drinking it cold or anything.

802
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,460
You should be cool.

803
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,320
But filtering the water at 39 degrees, which

804
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,700
is basically almost all refrigerators in the world

805
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,080
are set at four degrees Celsius or 39

806
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,600
right now.

807
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,080
Even if you're not a refrigerator buff like

808
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,280
you don't know what's going on.

809
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,180
It's just set by your landlord or the

810
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,920
previous tenant or you bought it and that's

811
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,100
it.

812
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,060
I bet if you put a thermometer in

813
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,000
there, it'll be anywhere between 38 and 41

814
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,180
degrees, which is the average is 39.

815
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:00,360
And if you're in Europe, it'll be around

816
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,160
for 3.9 to 4.2 Celsius.

817
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,880
I assure you, this is how it works.

818
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,700
So it's almost like we are set up

819
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,360
already for it.

820
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,540
So when you run the water through the

821
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,840
Brita filter, have it be chilled.

822
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,000
And also when you have it slightly open

823
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,300
or vented, you don't have to put a

824
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,220
lid on it on a big jar or

825
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,920
another vase in the fridge.

826
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,280
You want the you want it to outgas

827
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,600
a little bit as it's cooling.

828
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,780
You don't have to put a tight lid

829
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,620
on it while in that initial stage.

830
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:30,320
Now you have increased the quality of your

831
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:30,620
water.

832
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,800
Number two, food.

833
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,580
First thing, learn how to eat seasonally.

834
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,440
OK.

835
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,700
If you want to look on a macro

836
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,760
level in the West, not until there was

837
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,580
major interchange and groceries and produce from the

838
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,220
tropics.

839
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:48,680
Right.

840
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,120
All these refrigerated shipping and all that stuff.

841
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,300
You didn't have the diseases and the ailments

842
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,080
and the liver problems that you do now.

843
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:55,360
Right.

844
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,440
So, yeah.

845
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,760
So I'm not saying avoid food foods from

846
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,440
the tropics.

847
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,100
You don't live in the tropics, but you

848
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,280
can use tropical food to cool you down

849
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,320
when it's hot outside.

850
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:07,640
Right.

851
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,460
Now, the exception would be if you live

852
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,060
in a tropical area like Florida.

853
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:11,740
Right.

854
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,240
Because that is more tropical.

855
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:13,940
Yeah.

856
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,140
It's less it would be considered more temperate,

857
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:16,560
I guess.

858
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,060
Or, yeah.

859
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:17,720
Yeah.

860
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,720
But then but then here's the benefit.

861
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:19,940
Yeah.

862
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,880
You'd be closer, but you're not quite there

863
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,180
yet.

864
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,920
You know, you'll have your citrus in the

865
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,400
winter because it's citrus winter season.

866
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,300
But I don't think you'll have bananas.

867
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,640
You could have bananas in California.

868
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,160
You won't have coffee in Florida.

869
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,680
No, you know, coffee doesn't.

870
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:33,940
Yeah.

871
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,380
So so cross latitude is the best.

872
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,520
And usually you'll find the most for.

873
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,600
So let's say you're in Rhode Island.

874
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,180
You're going to have apples, pears, apricots, blueberries,

875
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,720
raspberries, cherries.

876
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,100
Right.

877
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,160
Right.

878
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,820
You shouldn't have bananas or whatever fruit, kiwi

879
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,000
or whatever.

880
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,380
You know, even though actually New Zealand would

881
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,660
be almost on your same thing.

882
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,300
But avoid.

883
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:56,180
Right.

884
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,560
So in the summer you don't eat salmon.

885
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,820
I remember when this in the early 2000s

886
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,400
was a big salmon craze and then they

887
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,480
busted it by saying that it's artificial color.

888
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,520
Remember all that crap 20 years ago, 15

889
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:05,940
years ago.

890
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,800
I remember going into people's homes in the

891
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,720
summer and they said they couldn't cool down

892
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,100
enough.

893
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,620
They had the thermostat all the way down.

894
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,560
So I walk in.

895
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,500
You know, like a two thousand dollar a

896
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,380
month electric bill.

897
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,460
And I'm like, I'm like, are you eating

898
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:19,800
salmon?

899
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,740
She goes, yeah, I love it.

900
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,780
I said, stop eating salmon because it's adjusting

901
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,180
your body to the Arctic.

902
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,100
Right.

903
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:25,640
Right.

904
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,480
So that's what I mean by cross latitude

905
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,360
and seasonal.

906
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:32,760
Now, if you understand this trick, you can

907
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,060
actually manipulate it.

908
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:34,680
Right.

909
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,900
So let's see the winter seasons coming around

910
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,800
wherever you live, even in Florida, because it

911
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,340
gets cold in Florida for a few weeks.

912
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,240
It gets cold for many years also.

913
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,040
And you're not used to it.

914
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,220
What you do is you go get yourself

915
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,680
a piece of salmon, poach it, cook it.

916
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,280
However, eat salmon for two or three days.

917
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,340
Then you'll say, wow, I'm not feeling cold

918
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:56,640
anymore.

919
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,060
Right.

920
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,060
But you have to do the reverse so

921
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,020
you can actually engineer your diet.

922
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,680
Now, the other thing about your diet is

923
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,060
this.

924
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,240
No one talks about this.

925
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,060
I'm not talking about protein, carbohydrates or anything

926
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:08,620
like that.

927
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:08,920
Right.

928
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,800
You know, at all.

929
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,340
The way that I would talk about diet

930
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,080
would be animal and non-animal.

931
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:14,380
Right.

932
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,300
And you have to know how to do

933
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:15,820
combining.

934
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,360
Another thing about diet is this.

935
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,800
People say, well, what do you what would

936
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,380
you like to eat for breakfast?

937
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:21,960
Have you heard that?

938
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,620
What would you like to eat for lunch?

939
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,160
Well, I don't know.

940
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,180
What would you like to eat for dinner?

941
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,120
Oh, I don't know.

942
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,140
Or I like to eat this for dinner.

943
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:31,340
OK.

944
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,800
People are thinking of these these meals that

945
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,340
they eat.

946
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,980
You shouldn't really eat more than two meals

947
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,240
a day, by the way.

948
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,840
You know, the three meal a day.

949
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,100
That's the food industry.

950
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:42,400
Right.

951
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,780
They want you to eat five meals a

952
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,400
day if they would.

953
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,100
The meals work very much like this.

954
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,140
They stack.

955
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:55,460
Because when you have your lunch, that'll be

956
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,120
in you till tomorrow.

957
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:57,720
Right.

958
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,960
But you're going to have your dinner in

959
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,280
between.

960
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,060
So you're actually doing food combining.

961
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,600
There's a there's an opening between the mouth

962
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,240
and the anus.

963
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,420
That's the only opening in the body to

964
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,660
the inside of the body, like a tunnel

965
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,480
going through the mountain.

966
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,660
So you got a choo-choo train that's

967
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,900
way down the tunnel and a new a

968
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,440
new choo-choo train is coming in right

969
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:16,740
now.

970
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,180
You got two trains in the tunnel.

971
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,120
And if they meet and there's and there's,

972
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,720
let's say, from a chemical point of view

973
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,240
or a seasonal point of view or across

974
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,740
latitude point of view, not compatible, you're going

975
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,260
to have problems.

976
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,000
I'll give you an example.

977
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:36,840
When you have flatulence gas, that's a signal

978
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,680
to your body saying don't eat that again,

979
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,660
please, because that's what that's as far as

980
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,660
we can go with it.

981
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,260
The idiot, the morons, the scientific morons will

982
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,460
tell you, well, you should add stress.

983
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:49,760
No, what's going on in the body is

984
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,760
when you start masticating and you start chewing,

985
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,640
the digestion begins with your first bite, literally,

986
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,180
and your first bite determined on how much

987
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,900
you bit off is how much chewing you

988
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,020
should do, how much saliva is going to

989
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:02,560
mix with it.

990
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:06,620
As you're swallowing, there's more saliva being put

991
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:06,860
out.

992
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,940
And then there's a gel substance like saliva

993
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,640
and other things that form in the stomach

994
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,480
to continue that process or slight movement.

995
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,140
So what it's doing is it's changing the

996
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,540
food to be compatible to be turned into

997
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,500
energy that the inside of the body can

998
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,880
see, right?

999
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,860
And this happens all through the intestine and

1000
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:27,540
each part of the intestine specializes in a

1001
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,660
different extraction or conversion method.

1002
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,300
So the way it goes is once the

1003
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:36,220
food is ready, it goes from the solid

1004
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,040
or liquid, then it goes to gas and

1005
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,540
that gas becomes energetic and then it goes,

1006
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,340
this is all happening in the lumen of

1007
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,500
the intestine or the lumen of the stomach.

1008
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,920
And once it goes from gas, it goes

1009
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,460
to energy and then it passes into the

1010
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,280
body and then the blood vessels on the

1011
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,140
inside of the organs, you know, you'll see

1012
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,460
blood vessels around the stomach, blood vessels around

1013
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,700
the intestines and so on.

1014
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,120
The duodenum, you can get into the anatomy

1015
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,780
and figure it out yourself and you could

1016
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,400
actually as an engineer would, you could see

1017
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,180
the types of the sizes and the amount

1018
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,920
of blood vessels in nature and get into

1019
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,440
forming a real science on how the body

1020
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,480
gets energy from food.

1021
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:16,720
But that's a way other long discussion or

1022
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,560
it could be introduced.

1023
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,700
I just introduced it.

1024
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,680
So when you have flatulence, it's if you

1025
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,760
have the body's having a hard time from

1026
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,580
the nutrition to go from gas, remember it's

1027
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,940
solid, liquid, gas to energy and it just

1028
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,700
bounces back and it remains a gas.

1029
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,700
That gas quantity should have been converted to

1030
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,080
energy.

1031
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,460
Now, when I say energy, I don't know

1032
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,640
what kind is part of the biological vacuum.

1033
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,200
Does it have an electrical component to it?

1034
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,440
Yes, it does, but it's not electricity.

1035
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,940
It's not electricity as we know it because

1036
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,660
as we know, electricity is pressure.

1037
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,020
These are chemical source from a battery or

1038
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,620
it's pressurized magnetically pressurized.

1039
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,120
This is not magnetically pressurized and not a

1040
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,820
chemical battery.

1041
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,240
It's a different type of electricity that emerges

1042
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,640
from a biological vacuum.

1043
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,600
And if you want an extreme example, there's

1044
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,800
something called a mora ray or stingray and

1045
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,200
or a I'm sorry, what is that?

1046
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:11,920
Eel.

1047
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,240
Eel.

1048
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:12,720
That's right.

1049
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:13,580
Yeah.

1050
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,320
And that's a very real thing.

1051
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,260
There's actually some pretty cool videos about them

1052
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,980
in tanks what they can do and measured.

1053
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,180
You could say that is also a product

1054
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,080
of the biological that they need to be

1055
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,100
investigated and then dialed down, just like the

1056
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,840
early electrical experiments.

1057
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,000
Guess what was investigated first?

1058
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:34,940
Lightning.

1059
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,140
Right.

1060
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,980
And then it was dialed down right into

1061
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,940
what we understand is electricity today.

1062
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,860
So basically the gas in the body is

1063
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,340
the body is telling you, right, don't do

1064
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:44,440
this.

1065
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,800
And that's typically from bad food combining.

1066
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,760
An example of bad food combining is if

1067
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,660
you just had a glass of milk and

1068
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:54,020
notice it and say yogurt or cheese milk.

1069
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,100
And now you take some lemonade or lemon

1070
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,420
juice that turns into a poison in the

1071
00:30:59,420 --> 00:30:59,680
body.

1072
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,580
Don't I'm not going to get into details

1073
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:07,160
of something that completely paralyzes your body's ability

1074
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,580
to digest anything else other than this, which

1075
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,100
is melon.

1076
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,940
Eat it alone or leave it alone.

1077
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,760
So if you're going to eat melon, you

1078
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,260
should have at least one to two hours

1079
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,700
that you haven't eaten or one and two

1080
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,140
hours after you eat melon to eat something

1081
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,860
else because it requires such a specific process

1082
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:26,540
and chemical structure to digest it properly that

1083
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:29,560
if you include melon, whatever melon.

1084
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,560
And by the way, cucumber in some degree

1085
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,360
is like melon.

1086
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,440
If you ever cut a cantaloupe, look at

1087
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,800
the seeds and the smell of the whole

1088
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,520
room smells like it or watermelon.

1089
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,800
Cucumbers are very similar in that they're almost

1090
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,360
like a melon.

1091
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,060
I consider them in the melon family, but

1092
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,100
cucumbers tend to be a transition point where

1093
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,540
they are well combined with other things to

1094
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,060
a degree.

1095
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,920
They actually slow down digestion enough.

1096
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,240
So, yeah, that's another discussion.

1097
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,820
So that's why I sell people.

1098
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,100
Do you remember the cafe craze with a

1099
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:00,340
garnish?

1100
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,960
They put a you get a lunch or

1101
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,500
dinner and they have a slice of melon

1102
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,140
as a garnish or wrapped with prosciutto.

1103
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,200
Oh, my gosh.

1104
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,500
Listen, everything that I'm saying now, I've been

1105
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,940
saying since the 80s.

1106
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,040
This is nothing new.

1107
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,920
And this is I've been watching all the

1108
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,620
food trends also.

1109
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,480
Oh, my gosh.

1110
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,800
OK, very quickly.

1111
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,800
And people who saw the wisdom in it,

1112
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,880
like a lot of people say you want

1113
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,540
to learn information.

1114
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:21,760
Yeah.

1115
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,960
But if you don't have the wisdom to

1116
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,660
sort it out, it doesn't mean anything.

1117
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,960
Actually, a lot of these doctors and lawyers

1118
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,540
are actually, quote unquote, smart and get a

1119
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,680
lot of information, but they don't have the

1120
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,920
wisdom to see what they're doing.

1121
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,300
Right.

1122
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,380
Well, a lot of these.

1123
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:33,680
Right.

1124
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,600
There's no wisdom in the wisdom is to

1125
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,060
be able to, you know, there's a lot

1126
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,740
of sayings and cliches about wisdom, but really

1127
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:44,720
wisdom and intuition, authentic intuition, individual intuition allows

1128
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,640
you to get a new piece of information.

1129
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,660
And then, like, it's not a leap of

1130
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,020
faith.

1131
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,360
You have this instinctive feeling.

1132
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,660
It's an evil, not a feeling that people

1133
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:56,500
say, but it's an emote very deep where,

1134
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,400
you know, this has to be handled very

1135
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,140
carefully because sometimes the information has direction in

1136
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:01,300
it.

1137
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:01,620
Right.

1138
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:02,680
And people fall.

1139
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,140
And that's a misleading thing.

1140
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,740
So you need the wisdom to understand these

1141
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,300
things when you get the knowledge.

1142
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,780
You know, it's all about knowledge and wisdom.

1143
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,020
No one ever gets into that, but it's

1144
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:14,720
mostly intuitive and you have to trust it.

1145
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,620
But it's a skill.

1146
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,180
Just like, for example, when I mentioned whenever

1147
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,920
you meet someone new, do a quick snap

1148
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,980
judgment, a strong judgment on them, like within

1149
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,380
30 seconds or less.

1150
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,440
And then as you get to know them,

1151
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,700
refer back to your initial judgment and see,

1152
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:31,060
was I correct on that initial judgment after

1153
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,160
a week, a month or a year?

1154
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,940
And if you weren't correct, start dialing in

1155
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:35,360
your judgment.

1156
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,840
I was being, don't say you were being

1157
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,620
too judgmental.

1158
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,420
I've heard that too many times.

1159
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,600
That doesn't mean anything.

1160
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,080
Right.

1161
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:40,680
Right.

1162
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,120
It's like I was walking too fast.

1163
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,080
I don't know if I was walking.

1164
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,240
You know, what are you talking about?

1165
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:44,440
No.

1166
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:44,720
Okay.

1167
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,540
When you, when you, okay, let's say it

1168
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,540
was too judgmental.

1169
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,120
Okay.

1170
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,000
About what specific?

1171
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,320
What judgment call did you make along?

1172
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,280
What parameters?

1173
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,960
See, not because they're trying to get the

1174
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,380
obvious things.

1175
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,900
Oh, you're too judgmental about what?

1176
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,480
No, you have to be too negatively judgmental

1177
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,320
if there were anything.

1178
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:01,660
Right.

1179
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,860
Or you'd have to be too positively judgmental.

1180
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,640
But what specific thing are you judging?

1181
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,020
There's a component.

1182
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:06,300
Yeah.

1183
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,760
If you don't even give it a direction,

1184
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,040
even a vague one, then there's no point

1185
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,360
to it.

1186
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,440
Judgment about what?

1187
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:11,880
Judgment.

1188
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:14,260
A harsh judgment is appropriate.

1189
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:17,000
Physical appearance and hygiene.

1190
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,639
The other one would be the way they

1191
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,080
carry themselves, the way they sound.

1192
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:21,400
Okay.

1193
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:25,260
What they're there for, their behavior, their etiquette.

1194
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,880
Those are the, that's what you would judge

1195
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,300
them on.

1196
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:27,600
Right.

1197
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,080
Okay.

1198
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,460
So not just being too judgmental.

1199
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:29,639
Right.

1200
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,500
See, everything that you hear, all these cliches,

1201
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,300
by the way, are all false.

1202
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,739
Like, what came first, chicken or the egg?

1203
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,420
That's a real dumb question.

1204
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:39,440
Obviously, the chicken because that you could have

1205
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,400
been an alligator egg.

1206
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:40,659
Right.

1207
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,540
You have all these, these, these things that,

1208
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,980
that the paradox no one knows.

1209
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,719
I'm like, oh my gosh, you know, you

1210
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:48,900
only use 5% of your brain.

1211
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,239
You're probably using less than 1%.

1212
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,580
You know, of that, you know, kind of

1213
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:53,739
thing.

1214
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,340
If you believe all this stuff that they

1215
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,320
tell you, no one is thinking with very

1216
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,080
little exception.

1217
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:58,860
Okay.

1218
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,500
So the back to the robustness of the

1219
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,100
human body, you have the water treatment.

1220
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:05,360
Then you very, very, very basic.

1221
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,820
Now, if you don't filter your own water,

1222
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,160
just to recap, just put it in the

1223
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,820
dark, put it in the dark.

1224
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,360
And if you can chill it for overnight,

1225
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,720
you don't have to drink it cold.

1226
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,940
Bring it down because that's like setting, you

1227
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,320
know, cookie dough should be baked.

1228
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:17,580
Right.

1229
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,080
And then you have it at room temperature.

1230
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:19,340
Right.

1231
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,760
Water should, after it's been bottled or processed,

1232
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,760
reach that 39 degrees for a little while

1233
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,680
and absolutely keep it in the dark.

1234
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,460
With my water experimentations now, I've noticed that

1235
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,420
the most harmful thing to water is light.

1236
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,300
And of course, heat, you know, you put

1237
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,060
water on a boiling on fire, you add

1238
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:35,880
something else now.

1239
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,540
But exposing it to light degrades it very

1240
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:38,960
quickly.

1241
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:42,200
And I mean, degrades its carrying capacity and

1242
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,440
its qualities and all that.

1243
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,940
So that's why spring water is better than

1244
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,540
drinking lake or river water.

1245
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,360
It's not exposed to light and air.

1246
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,780
And then there's air that's exposed to air

1247
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:51,880
exposure.

1248
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,280
The food, learn about food combining.

1249
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,920
And I gave a little bit more than

1250
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,660
I usually do on these kinds of talks

1251
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,360
on those things.

1252
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,020
But when I say food combining, please, the

1253
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,360
things that I've always been mentioning.

1254
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:08,120
But when you have lunch, think about what

1255
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,120
you had for breakfast or dinner last night.

1256
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,280
And does it combine well?

1257
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:13,360
Right.

1258
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,340
So if you had a hamburger for dinner,

1259
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,180
don't have pizza for lunch the next day.

1260
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,780
What does that look like?

1261
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,760
Looks that looks like a conveyor belt junk

1262
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,020
food.

1263
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:21,500
Doesn't it?

1264
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:22,940
Think about it.

1265
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:23,260
Yeah.

1266
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:26,000
Think about everything you eat as being on

1267
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,680
a conveyor belt.

1268
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,540
And you're looking down the conveyor belt, which

1269
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,200
is what you ate.

1270
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,080
And the other way you're looking up the

1271
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,580
conveyor belt to what you're going to eat.

1272
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,040
And how does that look to you?

1273
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,580
Does it look well balanced?

1274
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,400
Does it look like too much processed food?

1275
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:39,060
Right.

1276
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,720
Doesn't this get a little strange when people

1277
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,260
do what they call dessert, though?

1278
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,340
Because, you know, I will.

1279
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,720
Yeah, that's that's a marketing.

1280
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,240
OK, let me just say it.

1281
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,060
This is like steak and steak and ice

1282
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:49,540
cream.

1283
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,140
They're two pretty common things.

1284
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:51,660
Yeah.

1285
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,400
Not good.

1286
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,000
If you combine them at the same.

1287
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,220
Like, if you think about it, I'm not

1288
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,820
going to put a steak and an ice

1289
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:00,000
cream on the same plate and eat them

1290
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,740
at the same time.

1291
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,760
It's it's almost it's if you have it

1292
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,620
where a short order after the steak, it's

1293
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,060
almost as bad as doing that.

1294
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:06,880
But here's the other thing.

1295
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,500
The temperature.

1296
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:07,900
You ever.

1297
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,540
What happens to fat when it's in the

1298
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:09,820
fridge?

1299
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:10,960
Well, right.

1300
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:11,660
It stays.

1301
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,100
It's hard.

1302
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:12,820
It stays.

1303
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,980
You know, it's hard and it stays in

1304
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,220
its shape and all that.

1305
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:16,720
But you take.

1306
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:16,920
Yeah.

1307
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:17,240
Right.

1308
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,480
So how many.

1309
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,740
So, you know, if you know those fruit

1310
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,260
presses, you put half an orange, the old

1311
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,180
school ones, you press the fruit, the citrus

1312
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:24,480
press.

1313
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,920
I used to take French fries and stuff

1314
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,220
like that, put it in the press and

1315
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:28,880
squeeze it and all that.

1316
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,320
You see like a half a teaspoon of

1317
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:30,800
fry oil.

1318
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,420
And the person's like, oh, and I'm like,

1319
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,180
go ahead, drink it.

1320
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:33,480
Eat it.

1321
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,820
You were going to eat those fries, right?

1322
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,120
You can still eat them.

1323
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:36,680
They're a little mashed.

1324
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,640
But drink the oil here.

1325
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,060
Eat it.

1326
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:38,400
Eat it.

1327
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:38,720
Eat it.

1328
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,320
I was just I used to talk people

1329
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:40,800
like that.

1330
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,040
You know, someone was addicted to doughnuts.

1331
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,720
And is how many doughnuts do I could

1332
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,080
eat like half a dozen in the morning?

1333
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,300
And I'm like, give me three of them.

1334
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,040
And I compressed them.

1335
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,660
There was like almost a teaspoon of fry

1336
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:49,780
oil.

1337
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,320
I said, drink it.

1338
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:50,680
Drink it.

1339
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,760
Like, oh, that's gross.

1340
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,840
I'm like, yeah.

1341
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,180
It really tastes like doughnuts made with lard

1342
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:55,640
anyway.

1343
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,360
So you're.

1344
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,680
Well, actually, good doughnuts wouldn't be made with

1345
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,840
lard unless there were Mexican doughnuts or something.

1346
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,400
But really, because they like.

1347
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:06,000
Yeah, I can't eat the real authentic northern

1348
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,040
Mexican food because they fry everything in lard.

1349
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:08,860
I don't like the flavor.

1350
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:09,220
It's on.

1351
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:09,960
It's unlawful.

1352
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:10,460
It's unclean.

1353
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,420
I never liked the flavor.

1354
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,460
What do you do?

1355
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,500
How do they do that?

1356
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:15,700
Well, animal fat.

1357
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:16,740
Well, here's beef.

1358
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,140
Animal fat has a higher flashpoint.

1359
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:19,740
It doesn't go.

1360
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,900
OK, so but let's go back to to

1361
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,720
the point which which I kind of lost.

1362
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,660
But maybe you could drag me back in.

1363
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,460
I was talking about food combining.

1364
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,140
And I had mentioned the state ice cream

1365
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,140
thing, which is ridiculous.

1366
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,600
And yeah, don't put it together again.

1367
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,940
OK, now here's the thing that I've seen

1368
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,820
when people go to a banquet, a feast,

1369
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,840
a holiday.

1370
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,820
OK, you could see how vacuous their minds

1371
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,060
are.

1372
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,120
Oh, if I eat this, I'm going to

1373
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:44,680
be fat.

1374
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,320
I'm like, you idiot.

1375
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,060
You don't eat like this every day.

1376
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,480
It's Thanksgiving or it's your birthday or it's

1377
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,580
your anniversary or you're at a restaurant that

1378
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,100
you go to once every two years.

1379
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:54,640
Moron.

1380
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,960
Go ahead and feast.

1381
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,560
Go ahead and have the fatty foods and

1382
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,100
the sweet foods because you don't eat like

1383
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,080
this every day.

1384
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,000
Moron.

1385
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,560
Yeah, I've done this.

1386
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,060
I've seen this.

1387
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:05,700
Someone has this one.

1388
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,080
I don't like going out restaurants.

1389
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:07,840
If I'm going to go to a restaurant,

1390
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,820
it's going to have to be the upper

1391
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,620
crusty ones.

1392
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,280
And I still say I'd like to go

1393
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,340
to a high-end restaurant, but I don't

1394
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,240
know who I'd bring with me.

1395
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:16,020
But anyway, that's another story.

1396
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,020
How many times have you seen people say,

1397
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,360
oh, it's a special event.

1398
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,400
I'm going to get fat.

1399
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,380
No, you're not going to.

1400
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,160
You get fat by eating like this consistently

1401
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,220
and constantly.

1402
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,200
So shut up.

1403
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,200
Because what that means is they don't know

1404
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,580
how to appreciate and they don't recognize what's

1405
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,640
going on at all.

1406
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:34,900
And I've seen this.

1407
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,880
I've stopped going out to restaurants.

1408
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:37,940
I hear this all the time.

1409
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,040
Oh, no, I don't want to get fat.

1410
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,540
I'm like, you dumb, you know, whatever.

1411
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,740
You're not going to eat this every day.

1412
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,020
Go ahead and live it up.

1413
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,100
Live it up.

1414
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,440
You're not going to eat like this again

1415
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,980
maybe in six months or two months.

1416
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:48,620
It's fine.

1417
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,780
See, so there's a mixture that people don't

1418
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,180
understand.

1419
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:54,260
When you eat your daily stuff every day,

1420
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:57,580
day in, day out, keep it light, right?

1421
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,860
Light is a big thing here.

1422
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,380
You know, what's light is relative, based on

1423
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:02,800
culture.

1424
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:05,260
But every culture, you can eat light when

1425
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,300
you think about it, right?

1426
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,140
So, like, you know, for example, when people

1427
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:08,960
go to Italy and they're eating pasta in

1428
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,200
Sicily, they didn't like the food because when

1429
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,280
they get a pasta, the gravy looks like

1430
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:12,720
a broth.

1431
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,660
It's not this thick ragu sitting on top.

1432
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,240
Very rarely.

1433
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,120
So you go to the northern climate, right?

1434
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,120
In Sicily, it's like I couldn't get a

1435
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,380
good bowl of pasta.

1436
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,420
Everything was in soup.

1437
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,340
I was like, well, yeah, the gravy, the

1438
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,660
sauce is very, very light.

1439
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,920
It's more like a tomato juice instead of

1440
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,760
the thing you used to have.

1441
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,880
Yeah, it's at the bottom of your bowl.

1442
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,760
You grate a little bit.

1443
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,880
You have a little cheese on a bowl.

1444
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,100
You put a little cheese on it, you

1445
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,660
know, like Americans or white people.

1446
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,780
Oh, it's got melted cheese.

1447
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:36,200
It's great.

1448
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:36,740
Anyway.

1449
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,620
So the thing is, they eat light.

1450
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,060
So learn how to eat light.

1451
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:43,960
Eat slowly.

1452
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,180
There's a thing about chewing your liquids and

1453
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,220
drinking your solids.

1454
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:48,920
What does that mean?

1455
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:49,980
Don't guzzle.

1456
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,600
Anybody who was on the football team, the

1457
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,500
coach is yelling, don't guzzle too much water,

1458
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:53,700
right?

1459
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,380
Drink it slowly, even when you're really thirsty.

1460
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,560
Let it mix with saliva.

1461
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,780
Yes, it does require to mix with saliva

1462
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,720
to be recognized.

1463
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:02,220
And drink.

1464
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:04,940
That's chewing your liquids and drinking your solids

1465
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,280
is you're not thoroughly.

1466
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,240
Yeah.

1467
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,140
Thoroughly until it's liquefied.

1468
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,200
I've seen people on television do taste us.

1469
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,220
You know, a guy takes a bite of

1470
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:12,520
a burger.

1471
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,040
One, two.

1472
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:13,940
And he's swallowing.

1473
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,820
I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1474
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,540
You got to chew that bad boy.

1475
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:21,240
Now, the macroneurotics, I mean, macrobiotics, there's a

1476
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:21,920
true 30 times.

1477
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,380
There's no number of how much you're going

1478
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:24,860
to chew.

1479
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,240
It's just make, just get it at least

1480
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,660
to a liquid, a semi-liquid state.

1481
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,080
You know, what would you call a mash?

1482
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,540
Like the wet mash potato state, you know?

1483
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,040
Like a mush.

1484
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,300
A mush.

1485
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,560
Definitely a wet mush.

1486
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:36,860
Yeah.

1487
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:37,500
Not a dry.

1488
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,700
I've seen people try to, sorry, I can't

1489
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,500
be around people.

1490
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,600
I mean, when they swallow and eat, they're

1491
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,000
like, oh, I need something to wash this

1492
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,340
down.

1493
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,000
You ever hear that?

1494
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:46,300
You know?

1495
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,060
You should have chewed it a little bit

1496
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:49,160
more, idiot.

1497
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,360
So, and this is typical.

1498
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,520
I mean, oh my gosh, it's so bad.

1499
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,200
And it's been, and I'm just, I've been

1500
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,340
thinking exactly what I'm saying now since the

1501
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:58,780
80s.

1502
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,120
Could you imagine 40 years of this?

1503
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:00,740
I've had enough.

1504
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,780
And it's really mostly in the culture, the

1505
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,100
Western culture I'm talking about.

1506
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,720
And I'm talking about East Coast, you know,

1507
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,320
some Midwest, mostly Southwest.

1508
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:08,920
It's all the same.

1509
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,160
Actually, I got it.

1510
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,940
You know, Canadians are a little more refined.

1511
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:15,400
Why?

1512
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,780
Because when you go to a Canadian pizza

1513
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,620
parlor, they always give you a fork and

1514
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:19,840
knife.

1515
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:20,800
Pretty much.

1516
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:21,360
Right?

1517
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:25,140
So anyway, that's just a sideways humor.

1518
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,420
I don't think it was even funny.

1519
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,280
But, you know, when I heard the Canadians

1520
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,640
eat their pizza with a fork and knife,

1521
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,300
I was like, hmm, that's more refinement.

1522
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:32,620
Yeah.

1523
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,960
You know, instead of chomping on it.

1524
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,260
How about the Philly cheeseburger?

1525
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:35,640
Yeah.

1526
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:36,620
You know, you're supposed to eat that.

1527
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,800
You spread your legs about two feet apart

1528
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,920
and lean over a little bit.

1529
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:40,100
Right?

1530
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,440
You know, there's a whole stance that a

1531
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,180
professional cheese steak eater eats.

1532
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:43,820
Right?

1533
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:44,320
Yeah.

1534
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,880
Also, if you go out to the clubbing

1535
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,140
in New York and they go get a

1536
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,340
pizza at two in the morning, do the

1537
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:49,780
same stance.

1538
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,780
You spread about two feet apart, you know,

1539
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,640
about two foot distance and you lean over

1540
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,620
while you're biting the slice.

1541
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:54,900
Right?

1542
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:55,300
Yep.

1543
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,380
You know what I'm talking about, right?

1544
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:56,680
Yep.

1545
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,160
Yep.

1546
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,340
Yeah, so there's all these things you, I

1547
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,880
watch, I've been watching all, it's kind of

1548
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,820
like, you know, when a dog's going to

1549
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,440
take a poop, you know, the stance, right?

1550
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:03,940
Oh, yeah.

1551
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:04,500
Versus pee.

1552
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,940
Or you see the leg goes up, you're

1553
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:08,760
like, oh, that's, that's going to be urine.

1554
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,700
For humans, I know, this dog is going

1555
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:11,260
to eat the business.

1556
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,920
It's like, oh my gosh.

1557
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:15,860
They're very, once you, well, you have to

1558
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,020
be sharp on these things.

1559
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,560
You have to be really concerned.

1560
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,740
Now, I might sound like a real inconsiderate

1561
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:38,280
motherfucker, but actually you haven't gotten any anywhere,

1562
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,580
anywhere, anywhere from anyone ever before.

1563
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:41,380
And why?

1564
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:43,540
Well, I think I've answered that in the

1565
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:44,380
beginning of the thing.

1566
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:48,520
So, this is, this kind of shotgun, steamroller

1567
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,820
information needs to be given this way.

1568
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:54,280
It's kind of like a coach, you know,

1569
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,920
uh, you know, you know, coach has to

1570
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,000
be rough to the players that he's supporting

1571
00:43:59,000 --> 00:43:59,740
and coaching.

1572
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:01,180
As a matter of fact, he has to

1573
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:01,940
be so rough.

1574
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,820
He has to be rougher, should be rougher

1575
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,760
than the opposing team would be on this

1576
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,100
team.

1577
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:07,680
Right?

1578
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,720
Otherwise there's so, so if you have a

1579
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,580
coach that's rougher on you than the, than

1580
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:14,480
actual playing the game, if the game will,

1581
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:16,060
what that will not intimidate you.

1582
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:16,440
Will it?

1583
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,760
You're going to be, I'd rather be intimidated

1584
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,920
by someone trying to teach me something than

1585
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:22,660
the actual act of playing the game.

1586
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:24,660
But then vice versa.

1587
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,200
It's like you're not prepared, right?

1588
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,260
You're worried about the opponent.

1589
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:29,780
You're worried about failing on the coach.

1590
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:30,320
About your own coach.

1591
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:31,340
Yeah.

1592
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:32,680
And I found that's the best way to

1593
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,040
convey information that sticks.

1594
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,260
Now, of course, nine out of ten people

1595
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:38,560
won't get it, but it, you know, again,

1596
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,920
if you can help one person, that's fine.

1597
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,240
So, that's basically the, the idea of if

1598
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,460
you, and then there's hygiene, of course, and

1599
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:47,700
which is your whole surroundings.

1600
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,080
The idea of a testament to the robust,

1601
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:52,060
robustness of the human body.

1602
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,700
There's a, there's a there's food combining.

1603
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:57,860
The medical part, by the way, by the

1604
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:02,000
way, nowhere in the Bible is it plants,

1605
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:02,720
pee, or medicine.

1606
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,100
Excuse me, I have a cough there.

1607
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:07,400
I should have a little drink.

1608
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:08,700
No, no, no problem.

1609
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,440
Look, why don't you take a moment and

1610
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,340
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

1611
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,440
I'm just going to break this in half

1612
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,540
because we've done a fairly long one here

1613
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,760
and create another.

1614
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:18,920
We'll create another.

1615
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:21,520
The human condition.
