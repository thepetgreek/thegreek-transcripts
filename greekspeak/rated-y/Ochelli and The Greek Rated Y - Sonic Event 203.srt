1
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,059
I'll probably listen to this 203 really quickly

2
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:17,520
before I get the Greek back into the

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,220
role he was on before and answer some

4
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:20,720
questions.

5
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,560
Want to let all you guys know something,

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,440
a recent ruling against Apple in an antitrust

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,760
court might make it so you guys who

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,320
are using Apple to receive the rated Y

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,760
through Patreon, you guys were getting charged extra.

10
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,480
Now that had nothing to do with us.

11
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,600
I opted out of it having to do

12
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,220
with us because guess what?

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,640
Some creators are getting refund problems right now,

14
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:47,900
right?

15
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,240
You guys can ask Patreon for a little

16
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,000
bit of a refund, but we didn't pile

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,780
on with that because I opted out.

18
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,960
So some of you might be able to

19
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,220
get just about enough money back to get

20
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,900
a free month or more.

21
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,780
Well, what I would suggest is make a

22
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,440
short version of the class, probably class action,

23
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:08,680
right?

24
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,340
Yeah, just copy the court case and sue

25
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:12,500
them.

26
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,620
Yeah, it was an antitrust ruling is what

27
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,080
happened, I think, as a result of a

28
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,660
class action.

29
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,780
I'd have to look it up again.

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,340
Oh, okay.

31
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,320
But I just have to go to...

32
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,300
Whenever there's a class action, don't join it.

33
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,160
No, no, no, no, no.

34
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,040
Make yourself a summary of the court and

35
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,300
then sue them independently for a lot more

36
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,260
than the people, the $50 or $200 check

37
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,560
they got, you sue them in six figures,

38
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:32,580
seven figures, right?

39
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,240
So they settled with six figures, right?

40
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,600
If you guys want to go through lawsuits

41
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,460
and everything, great.

42
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,780
If you want to do a short thing,

43
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,640
though, you could just probably request it at

44
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:39,840
this...

45
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,020
I've been told that you can request and

46
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,740
wind up with a few bucks back that

47
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,940
you were being overcharged for.

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,380
That's all.

49
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,680
By the way, another conversation I was having

50
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,580
with someone recently, I was also a sob,

51
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,160
I was saying, I'm looking at corporate acquisition

52
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:59,280
memorandum and notes from their meetings, and they're

53
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,040
really boring.

54
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,060
I mean, we're looking at...

55
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,360
But if you know what you're looking for,

56
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,400
at one part of the transaction, they said,

57
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,340
we've got received the bills of exchange.

58
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,420
So when one company does a thing with

59
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,500
another, they just send them a bill and

60
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,720
they endorse it back and forth.

61
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,420
There's no money.

62
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,800
When Bill Gates wants to buy a house,

63
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,300
let's say he has a hundred million in

64
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,040
his bank account.

65
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,380
He buys a $50 million house.

66
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,060
What do you think his bank account is

67
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:25,260
at?

68
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,600
It's still at a hundred million.

69
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,240
Does he have a mortgage?

70
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:27,740
No.

71
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,040
Because he uses bills of exchange.

72
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,940
And these corporations, it's going to get worse,

73
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,160
people, in other words, because they know there's

74
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,100
a little bit of time left.

75
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,220
I was just going to ask you a

76
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,480
question about that, because in context, Bill Gates

77
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,920
just went on and did a little media

78
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,940
tour about how he's going to give away

79
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,960
the half of his fortune that he still

80
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,280
has, because he got divorced and gave half

81
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,000
to Linda.

82
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,420
Yeah, it's all talk for the...

83
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,100
It's unbelievable how stupid the society is when

84
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,280
it comes to financial stuff.

85
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,780
They're just as stupid as they are about

86
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,020
the medical and the legal.

87
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,580
They don't know anything.

88
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,580
And I'm talking about the people, the professionals

89
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,040
in the field are just as bad.

90
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:08,620
Okay.

91
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,600
What did we say?

92
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,580
What did we say?

93
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,360
All right, children, what did we say?

94
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,560
If you're going to be, quote unquote, a

95
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,060
famous or important person, right, and you're going

96
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,940
to be dealing with the public, you know

97
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,420
nothing.

98
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,720
You're not allowed to know anything.

99
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,260
Of course.

100
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,100
So do doctors and lawyers and whatever and

101
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,720
professors deal with the public?

102
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:30,540
Yes.

103
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,080
That means they know nothing.

104
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,760
And if they did know something, and they

105
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,000
spoke to the public who knows nothing...

106
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,240
They wouldn't understand what language they were speaking.

107
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,120
That's why...

108
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,060
That's a guarantee.

109
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,280
That's a guarantee.

110
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,160
Like decades ago.

111
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,340
That's why you can't have education.

112
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,280
People would shut up and say, I don't

113
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,300
know what the hell's going on here.

114
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,620
Well, that's why I find it funny every

115
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,080
once in a while when I'm like, that's

116
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,620
a legitimate piece of information and nobody cares.

117
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,860
They're focusing on everything else, but it's just

118
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,120
hilarious to me because Bill Gates just did

119
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,740
this thing, I just want to tell you,

120
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,640
where he's announcing that he's going to liquidate

121
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,740
his whole fortune to other people before he

122
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,840
dies, basically.

123
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,780
That's what he said.

124
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,560
And I'm like, wow, that's interesting.

125
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,880
Yeah, it's well, because he needs to compensate,

126
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,680
you know, he's not a doctor, but he

127
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,760
was the number one medical advisors from 2020

128
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,240
into 2022, right?

129
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,280
Yeah, well, I mean, half the continent of

130
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:25,880
Africa...

131
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,280
Who's not a doctor either.

132
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,680
He doesn't even know what an aspirin is.

133
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,560
Well, at least doctors know the drugs, you

134
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:31,680
know.

135
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,660
Right, half of the continent of Africa got

136
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,120
medicine through the Gates Foundation.

137
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,640
I mean, I'm just saying.

138
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,520
Yeah, they didn't have diabetes or AIDS until

139
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,540
he showed up, right?

140
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,080
That's the other part.

141
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,100
Remember, diabetes and AIDS is caused by the

142
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:42,760
treatment, right?

143
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,040
It's a fictional diagnosis.

144
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:44,620
Yeah.

145
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:45,660
Yeah.

146
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,440
It's pretty sad.

147
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,880
And you'll never, if you get treatment for

148
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,860
any of those, it's just going to get

149
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,540
worse and worse.

150
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,140
So, and we've had some people in the

151
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,600
chat say, oh my gosh, Greek, I fell

152
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:52,920
for that.

153
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,740
How do I get off of it?

154
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,380
I said, well, I can't, I don't have

155
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,260
direct experience.

156
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,760
I only give information on mostly direct experience,

157
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,320
you know.

158
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,180
So, and I'm not the only one saying

159
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,080
this, that most of the diseases people are

160
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,660
diagnosed with are fictional diagnosis.

161
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,280
And you could tell it's fictional by when

162
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,460
they give you the report.

163
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,440
It doesn't say anything.

164
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,020
Speaking of direct experiences, you and I both

165
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,540
discussed on, I think it was the last

166
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:20,600
Sonic, these mop-shaped type beings.

167
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,320
Oh yeah, yeah, the attackers.

168
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,500
Yeah, and it caused a couple of comments

169
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,120
to come up.

170
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,200
And I think, you know, they're sort of

171
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,700
right, but they're also sort of wrong.

172
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,220
So the best one, I don't have access

173
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:32,980
to the Patreon.

174
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,380
I don't do, you know, by the way,

175
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,740
just a little footnote, guys, we meet twice

176
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,240
a week and I just hit say, okay,

177
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:40,880
hit record.

178
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,100
And that's it.

179
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,940
I don't, I go to the Chitango or

180
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,140
Chilling Creek Chitango because I feel like that's

181
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,780
like a stepchild and a, but I do

182
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,420
go see what activity, but that's it.

183
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,720
I don't know what else is going on.

184
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,520
I don't have a single Sonic downloaded.

185
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,460
I've never heard a single Sonic ever from

186
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:57,780
this.

187
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,560
I don't even know.

188
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,700
I can't even access them if I wanted

189
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,300
to, I have to get somebody's password or

190
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:02,900
join myself.

191
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,620
So, but anyway, go ahead.

192
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,360
That's the footnote.

193
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,820
I, I gather all the questions just for,

194
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,940
you know, I gather the questions you're supposed

195
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,280
to do.

196
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:10,520
Yeah.

197
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,680
And I have Kim administering the, you know,

198
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,000
the, the, the pointless stuff and then I

199
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
get the material.

200
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,760
So anyway, Tom wrote this and it's kind

201
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,120
of represents a whole bunch of them.

202
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,460
Okay.

203
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,260
Just letting you know.

204
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,080
The moppings described in dreams are reminiscent of

205
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,800
the ones in Fantasia, according to Tom.

206
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,600
And I'm saying, well, kind of, yeah, but

207
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,640
also no, they're not the same, but the

208
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,980
idea is similar, right?

209
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,140
I mean, I'm checking with you because you

210
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:42,300
and I both things look like mop things,

211
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,440
but they're as light as dandelions when they

212
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,220
go to seed, right?

213
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,540
It's almost ethereal, ethereal.

214
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,140
It's similar to those things in Fantasia though.

215
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:52,540
Right.

216
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,660
But it's, it, there's something else different about

217
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,800
them and they are vicious.

218
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,700
I'll tell you that, uh, you know, the,

219
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,060
those, those things on Fantasia, they're dancing, they're

220
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,420
kind of, you know, interesting, hypnotic, but these

221
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,180
are not hypnotically dancing.

222
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,720
These are some vicious creatures, whatever they are.

223
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,100
Yeah.

224
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,680
Like a Star Trek, you know, were you

225
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,640
touched by that thing?

226
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:12,980
You know?

227
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:13,800
Oh yeah.

228
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,360
It's that bad.

229
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,500
You don't want it touching you.

230
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,680
I had one land on my arm and

231
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,780
then I had to wake up.

232
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,260
Right.

233
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,660
So, uh, yeah, but, okay, uh, let's do

234
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,020
another question and then we'll jump back to

235
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,640
the robustness of the human condition.

236
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,360
Well, fair enough.

237
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,080
This has to do with the human condition.

238
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:27,880
Uh, let's see.

239
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,520
I would like to hear some thoughts on

240
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,700
receding gums.

241
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,360
What is the best treatment and what's really

242
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,680
the cause behind it?

243
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,120
Many people seem to have this condition.

244
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:39,820
Young.

245
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,160
Okay.

246
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,680
Well, the gums are supposed to be soft

247
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,780
and expansive, right?

248
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,780
Because when they're expensive, they'd go to the

249
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,840
base, the gingival edge and all that.

250
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,440
So when you, and you have flexible, as

251
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,260
well, because right.

252
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,240
Well, that's more of the PDL, the periodontal

253
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,020
ligament, but, uh, receding gums is that a

254
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,240
young, uh, contraction for, you know, yin and

255
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,600
yang, you know, the universal principle, it's contracting,

256
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,600
they're contracting, receding, um, and the pulling away.

257
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,880
So you want those to expand.

258
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,640
And, um, one of the ways, uh, I've

259
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,340
done it for a little while with, with

260
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,980
some success and some people really have good

261
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,760
testimonials with what's called oil pulling in the

262
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,020
morning.

263
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,500
You just gargle with don't swallow gargle with

264
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,520
some sesame oil or, um, olive oil or

265
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,500
something like that.

266
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,460
Yeah.

267
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,640
I was very acidic.

268
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,700
Um, look up oil pulling techniques.

269
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,360
The other thing that I know works well

270
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,960
when I was having problems, let's say 10

271
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,260
years ago with that and, uh, citrus, uh,

272
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:38,659
not juices, uh, industrial, you know, uh, citrus,

273
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,220
if it's a citrus, um, you know, just

274
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,460
cut a slice of orange, put it in

275
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,800
your mouth, chew it and swallow it.

276
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:44,280
Right.

277
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,900
Uh, citrus is very helpful.

278
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,440
The other thing is like cornbread, cornbread, tortillas,

279
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,780
good cornbread, uh, did I say cornbread?

280
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,280
You did.

281
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:52,620
Yeah.

282
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,200
Yeah.

283
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,180
The good stuff.

284
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,860
Um, not the GMO.

285
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,660
Um, that's very good for the gums as

286
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,000
well.

287
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,120
And actually when you think of corn, if

288
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,780
you just had a little section of corn,

289
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,900
it looks like teeth, doesn't it?

290
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,520
Going across.

291
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:04,960
Doesn't it?

292
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,320
It does.

293
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:05,860
Very interesting.

294
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:06,680
Yeah.

295
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,620
And the citrus is not the vitamin C

296
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:08,960
by the way.

297
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,460
No one knows what's in, you know how

298
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,320
they say it's vitamin C then Greek, because

299
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,620
I know nine, nine or 10 people are

300
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,180
going to say that no one knows what's

301
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,000
in an orange dude.

302
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,360
No one knows.

303
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,000
And you're like, that sounds ridiculous on its

304
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,480
face, right?

305
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,100
If you have the indoctrination, how do they

306
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,660
tell you there's these minerals or these acids

307
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,660
or these things are in food?

308
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,500
Do you know what they do?

309
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,620
They take the fruit and they smash it

310
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,520
and then they burn it, heat it into

311
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,680
a powder and then combine other chemicals with

312
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:35,980
it.

313
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:36,920
Right.

314
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,440
It sounds like a blood glucose test, right?

315
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:38,880
Anyway.

316
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,080
Yeah.

317
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,160
And so it's no longer the same thing.

318
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,760
It's no longer, we don't know what's in

319
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,040
an orange, right?

320
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,100
So this is where like someone asked a

321
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,380
question about the nine star key.

322
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,960
It's actually almost 4,000 years of, of

323
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,480
gathering data and compiling it and saying, well,

324
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,200
statistically people who have a left mole on

325
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,160
their left cheek between the side of their

326
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,940
nose and their mouth are not good managers.

327
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,060
They can't manage people.

328
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,620
So it sounds ridiculous, right?

329
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,140
But that's scientifically information gathered, right?

330
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,040
Or the people born around this time, you

331
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,200
know, these things, you know, this is all

332
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,760
information that we've gathered.

333
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,600
We're not, you know, divining anything.

334
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,140
We're dividing.

335
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,840
There's a difference between dividing and divining.

336
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,800
So that would be the receding gum thing.

337
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,260
The other thing is avoid animal and avoid

338
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,980
salts, but salts, there are salts that are

339
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,560
healing and salts that are not, and are

340
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:33,940
damaging.

341
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,900
The commercial salts are damaging typically.

342
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,380
The healing salts are the natural salts.

343
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,100
And I wouldn't do, there's a big thing

344
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,080
about Himalayan salt that comes from land.

345
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,760
Sea salt is much more beneficial than that

346
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,020
pink.

347
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,680
There's a big craze about the pink.

348
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:50,520
Red and pink.

349
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,120
Right, right.

350
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,020
Yeah, that I find to be harsh and

351
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,640
I don't find it to have healing properties.

352
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,780
It might have healing properties if it's combined

353
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:00,020
with something to turn it around because it's

354
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:00,720
very powerful.

355
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:05,440
But the quality sea salt would help.

356
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,360
And by the way, years ago, even now,

357
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,620
if you have a tooth pulled or whatever,

358
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,280
the dentist gives you, it says rinse with

359
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,460
warm salt water, right?

360
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,640
Yeah, I've always done that.

361
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,860
Yeah, yeah.

362
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,900
And that would actually help.

363
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,380
But ingesting it in your food will contract

364
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,400
the gums.

365
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,280
And it's also, being in the gums, the

366
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,420
upper part of the body, that's where all

367
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,460
the yin, the expansive things rush to.

368
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,860
So if you're having a contractive stuff happening

369
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,340
on the upper body, it's usually an irritation.

370
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,620
So it's good to find in your diet

371
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,540
what's irritating you, right?

372
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,460
In other words, if you know you're sensitive

373
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,540
to something, remove that from your diet and

374
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,600
that would probably help.

375
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,580
But fewer animal products also help, I've noticed.

376
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,760
But the oil pulling, just look up online

377
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,560
what oil pulling is for dental health, let's

378
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,020
say dental fitness, right?

379
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:00,240
And citrus also helps, and corn also helps,

380
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:00,940
eating corn.

381
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,220
Not necessarily, it could be corn flour, however

382
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,340
you take it, cornbread.

383
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,320
Just do a little regimen of that and

384
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,640
you should have a stabilization.

385
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,500
Very rarely do they grow back, but you'll

386
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,460
slow it down.

387
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:14,800
Right.

388
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,720
I had a neurosurgeon talk to me about

389
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,920
the use of hot and cold for different

390
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,040
effects for this as well.

391
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:22,920
Sure.

392
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,600
So what are your thoughts on that?

393
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,860
Well, avoid hot and cold.

394
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,780
You want to have moderate temperature in the

395
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:26,960
mouth.

396
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,720
There's a reason why, oh, that's too cold

397
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,000
on my teeth, or that's too hot in

398
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,400
my mouth.

399
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,140
There's a reason for that.

400
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,060
Well, doing healing, you definitely want me to

401
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,800
be moderate about it, but sometimes if there

402
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,820
was an issue, like if you end up

403
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,500
with a dry socket or whatever, right?

404
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,020
Oh, dry, oh, that's horrible, yeah.

405
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,880
Most people do if they don't, yeah.

406
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,220
So the use of hot and cold, I

407
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,860
forget how it went, because I was always

408
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,720
careful not to get the damn dry socket,

409
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,420
because I didn't want to go through that.

410
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,440
Yeah, dry socket also comes if they don't

411
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,580
clean out the PDL, or the best way

412
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,940
to lose a tooth is a tooth that's

413
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,360
just rotten and has high mobility and comes

414
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,600
out easily because the PDL's been dissolved by

415
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,400
the body, but yeah, it's the PDL mostly.

416
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,220
Most dentists don't even clean the socket.

417
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,700
They just pull the tooth and send you

418
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,200
on your way.

419
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,080
There are some that do, some that do,

420
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,740
but yeah.

421
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,240
I advise people, I say, my so-and

422
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,500
-so's going to the dentist, what should I

423
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:25,680
say?

424
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,740
They say, well, what are they going for?

425
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,720
Make sure, and then when they bring this

426
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,800
up, like what I mentioned, they should advise

427
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,560
the dentist is usually very surprised and pretty

428
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,920
happy about it, usually, that you know this

429
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,000
stuff, and you say, yeah, I'll do my

430
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,520
best, right?

431
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,080
So you've got to watch these guys.

432
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,440
When you're dealing with people in law, oh,

433
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,620
that's the worst, or medical stuff, you better

434
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,420
know exactly what you want, I mean, down

435
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,060
to the T, and then have the reason

436
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,300
you're going to them is because you can't

437
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,560
do it yourself for some reason, right?

438
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,640
Just like when you get a haircut, right?

439
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,380
Don't you tell them exactly what you want,

440
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:57,760
typically?

441
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,620
Oh, yeah.

442
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,000
You know?

443
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,080
Yeah, I mean, so it's very much, think

444
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,980
of it, you know, the typical thing, take

445
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,320
a little off the top, more off the

446
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,660
sides, whatever, you know, it's the same thing

447
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,540
when you go to a legal or, heaven

448
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,800
forbid, oh, my gosh, I almost, my legs

449
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,900
got shaky, if you ever, don't, ugh, if

450
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,140
you ever have to go to an attorney

451
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:17,760
for anything, I mean, oh, my gosh, that's

452
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,580
like, ugh, that's like really gross, but anyway,

453
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,420
I understand the doctor part, right?

454
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,060
Because you may not be able to pull

455
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,420
something out of your butt on your own,

456
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,000
but, you know, whatever, and don't look, because

457
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,200
there's a lot of people that go for

458
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,060
that kind of stuff, like polyps and all

459
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,120
that, you don't even need, that's dietary change,

460
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,380
you can, those things disappear within days if

461
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,320
you change your diet properly, or you know

462
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,240
how to balance it out, those things usually

463
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:46,700
get worse.

464
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,060
You wouldn't believe, I know at least three

465
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,820
people whose mom was, you know, 60s, 70s,

466
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,300
and she had a small growth on her

467
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,520
foot, and then they removed the growth, it

468
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,740
got worse, and they had to remove her

469
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,960
foot, and then they had to remove it

470
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,700
to the knee, and then they had to

471
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,760
remove it to her thigh, then they had

472
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,560
to remove her lung, and then she died.

473
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,080
Right.

474
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,260
So some things need to be done internally,

475
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,040
they do too much use of surgery and

476
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,940
chemistry, because I know three people, over the

477
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,600
past three decades, that have given me a

478
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,360
story like that.

479
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:13,980
Right.

480
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,280
You know, I'm talking about a little tiny

481
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,060
growth or whatever, and you know, they end

482
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:22,200
up dying within a year, and anyway, and

483
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,260
I think I mentioned I had a doctor

484
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:26,180
client, and he parked his three-car garage,

485
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,180
all cars were always outside, not in the

486
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,900
garage, and one day, he invites me into

487
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,880
the house, and he couldn't park the cars

488
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,820
in the garage, because there were banker's boxes

489
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,900
full of documents, mostly lawsuits, filling the space

490
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,620
that three cars would fill.

491
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,880
So, just wanted to let you know.

492
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:44,720
No problem.

493
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,600
Listen, about water quality, somebody asked something, now,

494
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,180
they're kind of behind, because they could have

495
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:52,140
gotten in on the aqueous argentum thing earlier,

496
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,840
but anyway, I was listening to an older

497
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,560
podcast where Greek talks about what he calls

498
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,680
aqueous argentum.

499
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,740
Right, because it's not colloidal silver, right?

500
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,020
Yes.

501
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,620
How easy is it to learn how to

502
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:05,040
make it for someone who knows nothing about

503
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,220
it?

504
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,780
I would like to dive into it.

505
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,280
Well, it depends on your sensibilities.

506
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,660
The simplest way to explain it is everything

507
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,460
that's online about making colloidal silver is BS.

508
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,120
Don't do it.

509
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,680
It's toxic.

510
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,520
I have to side with the FDA on

511
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:17,820
that.

512
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,120
Regardless of the testimonials, it's toxic.

513
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,240
As a matter of fact, a lot of

514
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,640
the pharmaceuticals are known to be toxic, sometimes

515
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,860
do work, right?

516
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,260
So, the aqueous argentum is, you want to

517
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,800
use a biological form of electricity which would

518
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,560
be less than one and a half volts

519
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,200
across the two electrodes.

520
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,360
If you can't do that, you put a

521
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,980
neutral electrode, use three electrodes, the center electrode

522
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,020
is not attached to anything, it's spaced very

523
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,920
nicely, or very well, and just the outer

524
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,020
two electrodes are.

525
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,580
I personally make a unit that plugs into

526
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,620
a USB, I've posted the circuit on the

527
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,400
Chitango, I've posted what it looks like, and

528
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:56,900
all that.

529
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,980
I can't make them now.

530
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,040
I can, but I won't.

531
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,200
I think it was $200 for one, and

532
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,319
if you gave me $400, I wouldn't make

533
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:05,500
one.

534
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,180
It's just that much time.

535
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,040
But at least you got to see what

536
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,859
a well-crafted unit should look like.

537
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,240
We actually did a giveaway of one.

538
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,400
I don't know what I was thinking, but

539
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,040
yeah, we are benevolent.

540
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,420
We did a giveaway of one of these

541
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,380
units, by the way.

542
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,220
Right, and we had a lot of reports,

543
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:24,300
you wouldn't mind me using his name, Joe,

544
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,099
I don't know if he's around anymore, but

545
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:28,900
he was sharing it with his family in

546
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,520
his neighborhood, and they had a lot of

547
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,880
positive results.

548
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,880
But basically the idea is, go study how

549
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,980
to make colloidal silver, but don't use any

550
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,780
of the voltages that they suggest, it should

551
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,420
be less than one and a half volts.

552
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,220
Now a typical battery cell, single cell, whether

553
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,660
it's A, triple A, double A, C, D,

554
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,200
sounds like bra sizes, right?

555
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,700
Anyway, make sure when you're out of the

556
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,300
package, they're 1.7 volts.

557
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,880
Just use it a little bit until the

558
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,280
voltage gets down to 1.5 or 1

559
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,300
.3 is even better.

560
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,880
Closer to one is even better if you

561
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,440
have a high mineral content in your water,

562
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,280
and that's it, and just a few minutes,

563
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,760
if not less than a minute.

564
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,840
Joe was grateful enough that he told me,

565
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,020
and nobody has asked a question like this

566
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,800
in a long time, but he told me

567
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,700
a while ago, if this person who asked

568
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,800
the question wants to get in touch with

569
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,040
me, let me know on the chat on

570
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,660
the Patreon, and I will put you in

571
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,300
touch with Joe, because Joe was willing to

572
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:32,760
make some, and even explain stuff to somebody.

573
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:36,040
So we could pass this along, and he

574
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,360
said that he was grateful that he would

575
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,720
be willing to pass it along to somebody

576
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,460
else if they asked.

577
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,500
So this is the first time somebody asked,

578
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,100
there you go.

579
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,100
Let me know, and I will put you

580
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:44,720
in touch with Joe.

581
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:45,460
That's fine.

582
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:48,920
Joe has the unit that I built, so...

583
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,820
And also, he's mechanically inclined enough that I

584
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,880
bet you they could reproduce one if they

585
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,320
wanted to.

586
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,460
Well, the circuit is potted, so you need

587
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,620
the diagram for the circuit, which I've posted.

588
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,880
And if anyone sends me an email regarding

589
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,160
this, actually I shouldn't put my time out

590
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,120
like that, but I will, UncommonSenseRadio1 at gmail

591
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:10,800
.com.

592
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,460
If you want to, just send it to

593
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,940
me once, and I'll keep it.

594
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,540
Yeah, I'll send you the images and the

595
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,900
circuit, because the circuit is an interesting...

596
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,280
I call it proprietary, because I'm making a

597
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,960
very simple junction, also incorporating the LED.

598
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,240
The LED and the circuit lets you know

599
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,620
if it's working, because if it's not in

600
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,100
the water, the LED is off, and when

601
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,140
you put it in the water and you

602
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,660
have proper power, the LED comes on as

603
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,240
an indicator.

604
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,560
It's kind of a neat thing.

605
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,900
So what you do is just pass it

606
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,520
to me as your administrator, I'll know it.

607
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,420
I'll do that tonight.

608
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,780
I'll drop the blueprint for that.

609
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,620
There we go.

610
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,760
So I will have the blueprint.

611
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,560
If you are inclined enough to create it,

612
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,440
no problem.

613
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,200
Then you can.

614
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:46,480
Yeah.

615
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,300
All right.

616
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,440
Yeah, let's go back to the robustness of

617
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,000
the human before I run out of steam.

618
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,900
Well, just one last piece, then, and then

619
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,460
we'll be all cleared up, as far as

620
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,220
I'm concerned, I think.

621
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,560
Yes, I'd like to agree to comment, if

622
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,300
we can cast him out...

623
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,140
Oh, this is back to the mop creature

624
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:03,520
thing.

625
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,500
Okay, just let me...

626
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:04,880
Oh, okay.

627
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,360
If we can cast him out for good,

628
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,020
probably not for good, but does he do

629
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,940
any daily cleansing of entities to declutter?

630
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,440
This is a big part of shamanic culture

631
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:23,500
to psychopomp, psychopomp, I guess, yeah, that's the

632
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:23,660
word.

633
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,740
No, not daily.

634
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:25,740
Yeah, good.

635
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,000
No, it's constantly.

636
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,580
You have to train yourself to do it

637
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:28,880
constantly.

638
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,160
An example would be, people spend a lot

639
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,680
of time on a computer, you walk up

640
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,720
and look at the screen, you see they

641
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,800
have a lot of bookmarks, things open, tabs

642
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,160
open?

643
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:36,580
Yeah.

644
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,840
And they're always like that.

645
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,460
Okay, you open a tab on keeping these

646
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,100
things and being conscious of them, and it's

647
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,960
constantly on, just like when they talk about

648
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,300
prayer, you know, the Christian thing, you get

649
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,260
down and you're always in the constant state

650
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:48,700
of that.

651
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,320
It's a way to relate.

652
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,960
It's kind of like, imagine you've got to

653
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,720
change water pump in a car and watch

654
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,420
a National Geographic video on Alaska at the

655
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,180
same time.

656
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:02,980
Can you do that?

657
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,720
Can you put two videos on at the

658
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,160
same time and take in information from both?

659
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,760
So it's not easy, but it's simple, right?

660
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,120
I'm not talking about playing two songs at

661
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,700
the same time that kind of don't work.

662
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,840
I'm talking about two separate things.

663
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,560
So what happens in the beginning, you have

664
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,820
your normal you, usual self, but in the

665
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:27,780
background, you're constantly running this awareness scheme around

666
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,080
you.

667
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,240
And sometimes you highlight it, like if you're

668
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,800
going to do something important in a room,

669
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,400
this is a Walter Russell thing, you go

670
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,580
in the room, tell them to get out

671
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,140
and then slam the door, make a gesture,

672
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,580
or with your hand, make a gesture out,

673
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,980
you know, you know that sweeping hand where

674
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,420
your hand goes above your shoulders and you

675
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,960
sweep down towards the floor out, right?

676
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,840
Make these gestures and they will follow.

677
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,620
Remember, in most cases, they're envious of us

678
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,540
being in a three in this physical body,

679
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,920
even though they know we are limited.

680
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,820
It's kind of like people watching someone that's

681
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,780
sitting in a Formula One race car, you

682
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,620
know how limited you are sitting in a

683
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,360
Formula One race car, but people are envious

684
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,000
of it, right?

685
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:08,380
You see?

686
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:13,120
So you're in this incredible situation, condition, you're

687
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,380
so limited in comparison, and anyone who's in

688
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,180
this physical world who just wants to be,

689
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,680
I wish I was a spirit or whatever

690
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,980
is really missing out.

691
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,500
There's a difference, you know, the physical experience.

692
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,580
Now, a lot of times I say I've

693
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,680
had enough and I've had enough, just like

694
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,680
if I walk into someone takes me to

695
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,860
a movie, I'm famous for this, by the

696
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,880
way, because I worked in film and I

697
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,660
know what a good film is, within the

698
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,340
first minute or two minutes, if I see

699
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,120
this is going to be a piece of

700
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,680
shit movie, I say, I'll be back.

701
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:41,960
Enjoy the movie.

702
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,860
I walk out and usually movie theaters are

703
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,020
not in the middle of nowhere, right?

704
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,660
You can walk around the mall, you can

705
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,440
walk around for two hours or hour and

706
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,020
a half, right?

707
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:51,760
I do that.

708
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,500
So I'm like, if I go to a

709
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,640
party or I got to go, you know,

710
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,360
and I'll tell them why the food is

711
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,360
not as is not what I expected, you

712
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,860
know, and nothing to the host or whatever.

713
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,600
This is a way of saying things.

714
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,320
Everyone has their own way, you know, just

715
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,420
to excuse yourself.

716
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,020
It's fine to excuse yourself.

717
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,540
And it's okay to excuse yourself from this

718
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,520
reality, right?

719
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,100
But to want to be just a spirit,

720
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,100
I think you're missing out, missing the point

721
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,380
of being in a physical body.

722
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,960
But anyway, no, there's no way to, there's

723
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,820
no daily thing.

724
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,780
It's a constant thing.

725
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,400
That's the aorist tense is, is a tense

726
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,000
and aorist in, in literature and it means

727
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,540
it's a constant thing.

728
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,260
So that would be that.

729
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:33,540
Okay.

730
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,160
Okay.

731
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:34,660
Fair enough.

732
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,260
So I guess we should just get back

733
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,720
to the robustness and close out with that.

734
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,160
Definitely.

735
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,320
Because, oh yeah.

736
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,740
I think, yeah, this is just like a

737
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,860
coaching session because, you know, people, you know,

738
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:48,800
we're so, I include myself up until later

739
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,080
in life, well actually until the eighties, when

740
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,900
you needed a subject matter, always any subject

741
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,960
matter that had a quote unquote professional field

742
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,820
attached to it was where you should go.

743
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,380
If it was legal, you get a lawyer,

744
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,200
a doctor, you get this, right, whatever, right?

745
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,580
Spiritually go to a priest and you tell

746
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,900
him whatever you have marital problems, he says,

747
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,400
oh, just get her together and bake cookies.

748
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:07,700
Right.

749
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,900
Well, you know, stupid shit.

750
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,900
These people don't, you know, they're, they're lost.

751
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,000
Both people are lost.

752
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,140
Remember when you have these professionals, whatever professional

753
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,760
you want to pick, did they come from

754
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,220
Jupiter or Mars or a series or some

755
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,180
other planet or are they humans came from

756
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:24,660
here?

757
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,220
Yeah.

758
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:25,660
From here.

759
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,820
So it can't be good if you're paying

760
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,480
attention, you know, so it doesn't mean they're

761
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,680
bad, but they're definitely not good.

762
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,320
That's one thing that I always bring up,

763
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,800
you know, does it, does it make these

764
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,600
people at Catholics?

765
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,160
Are they bad people?

766
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:38,680
Well, no.

767
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,980
Here's the thing about being Catholic.

768
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,460
You're either totally ignorant of the Bible in

769
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:45,100
history, which makes you ignorant, or you know

770
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:45,840
what's going on.

771
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,180
You're just an evil son of a bitch

772
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,100
pushing the thing.

773
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:48,940
Right.

774
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,160
So does that mean they're bad people?

775
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,220
No, but they ain't good.

776
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,880
That's for sure.

777
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,140
So you, you can not be good and

778
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,100
not be bad.

779
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,720
It's just this gray mat.

780
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,220
It's called gray, gray water.

781
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,800
It's like this lesser lesser of two evils

782
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,340
concept.

783
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,360
They always throw at you.

784
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,320
It's a lesser of two evils, but it's

785
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,280
still an evil, right?

786
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:13,160
It's a lesser, but there are bad doctors

787
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,540
and there are bad attorneys that are, there

788
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,880
are some pretty good, you know, there are

789
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,640
attorneys that scour whatever to steal from people's

790
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,380
public records.

791
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,240
That's their thing.

792
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,280
You know, they won't admit it, but it's

793
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:22,940
pretty common.

794
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,620
And there are scumbags, but yeah, every, every

795
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:31,080
death camp in throughout history in the 20th

796
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,420
century was headed by a doctor, a doctor.

797
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,080
Yeah.

798
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:36,880
It's a fact.

799
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,320
Every death camp, you know, when you go

800
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,780
to a Walmart and they got a picture

801
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,080
of the manager on the wall, right?

802
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,680
Or the state department, they got a picture

803
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,580
of the president on the wall.

804
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,560
Every death camp had a picture.

805
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,740
I'm just saying the metaphor of the doctor

806
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,620
who runs the thing, right?

807
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:56,680
So anyway, we're so brainwashed to go to

808
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,820
these things, right?

809
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,540
You have to treat them.

810
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,060
If you're going to go to these things,

811
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,380
these professionals, the way they act and what

812
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,200
they purvey in society is almost as if

813
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,340
they are a predatory species and they are

814
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,980
predatory without them even knowing it most of

815
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:14,180
the time is the way you would go

816
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:14,920
to a hair cutter.

817
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,760
You tell them like they ask you, so

818
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,980
how would you, what would you like the

819
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,500
same as the last time, you know, or

820
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,180
how do you, or the first time going

821
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,620
to a hair cutter, this is how I'd

822
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,020
like you bring a picture, right?

823
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,860
You bring a picture of a magazine, right,

824
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,360
or whatever.

825
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,080
So if you're going to go to a

826
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,660
doctor lawyer, you bring the code, you got

827
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,020
to know the laws with the lawyer.

828
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,920
He won't know any of that, by the

829
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,500
way, I assure you.

830
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,840
And the doctor, he'll be shocked because I

831
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,460
haven't seen anything like that since college, even

832
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,640
though I've been practicing for 25 years, you

833
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:45,520
know, because they do give some things, you

834
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,540
know, some procedures in college and all that.

835
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,520
So you're going to have to do more

836
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:50,920
studying.

837
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,380
So that means no Netflix.

838
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,180
Well, you know, Oh no, no.

839
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,160
Greek says no Netflix.

840
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:55,420
No.

841
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:59,000
Well, less Netflix, less cop shows, less sitcoms,

842
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,220
but I don't do any of that.

843
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,260
Well, less of what you're doing.

844
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,680
That is not what I just mentioned that

845
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,600
you might need to know less of whatever

846
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,860
you have plenty of time.

847
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,720
You know, typically if you're going to have

848
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,960
a medical procedure done, it's not like tomorrow.

849
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,160
It's not, you know, if you're ambulatory or

850
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,800
whatever, it's usually a month or so.

851
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,260
So start researching it.

852
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:24,380
Don't trust these mother effers, right at all.

853
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,780
Trust no man is a, is a maximum,

854
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,320
isn't it?

855
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:27,820
Right.

856
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,760
So going back to the robustness to break

857
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,940
away and you, you're going to have to

858
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,820
be a DIY or in everything here, because

859
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:39,660
you know, you know how I give advice,

860
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,580
don't go live out off the grid.

861
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,300
We should be living in a city, a

862
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,240
harmonious city.

863
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,720
And most people that have lived off the

864
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,040
grid came back and said, yeah, man.

865
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,760
But the problem is you have to create

866
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,380
a harmonious.

867
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,240
So the city is a jungle in a

868
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,760
way, because the way it's set up, we

869
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,440
have predators at the top of the elite

870
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,100
social ladder.

871
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,820
We're predated on, we're basically treated like cattle,

872
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:03,780
you know, head count comes from cattle, only

873
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,260
cattle have had, and they do that in

874
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,320
schools, prisons, whatever.

875
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,040
So you're being treated as cattle.

876
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,280
And once you know that you're going to

877
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,380
have to be a little more of a

878
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:14,100
DIY or sort of like in between suburban

879
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,440
urban and living out in the country, like

880
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,460
grizzly Adams, I don't know if people are

881
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:18,860
old enough.

882
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,880
You don't even know grizzly.

883
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,780
Adam is looking up.

884
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:20,980
Right.

885
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:23,220
I remember those from the 70s, I think.

886
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:23,420
Right.

887
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,400
Yeah.

888
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,360
So you're going to have to you can't

889
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,160
be convenient, right?

890
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,500
No, nothing is convenient.

891
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,740
And you're going to find joy in it.

892
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,160
If you have hobbies, I feel sorry for

893
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:36,380
you.

894
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,780
That means you've fallen down the trap.

895
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,940
There's not enough time in the day, the

896
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:45,040
week, the month or the year to learn

897
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,580
what you should have learned when you were

898
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,100
a child.

899
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,580
So scrap your hobbies.

900
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,540
You know, whatever that might be.

901
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,060
Your hobby is a waste of time.

902
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,080
Everything is a waste of time.

903
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,960
But you're going to need to focus on

904
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,700
all the things that are necessary in life

905
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,520
for yourself, your family and the people around

906
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,960
you, which is learning law, learning medical stuff.

907
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:03,680
I'm sorry.

908
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,620
And such as both are such a distraction,

909
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,920
learning about how things really work and learning

910
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,140
how to do things, fix things, make things

911
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:12,860
right.

912
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,120
Your hobbies are a waste of time.

913
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,580
Does that mean that?

914
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,740
Well, like if you play golf, forget it.

915
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,320
You're an idiot.

916
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,920
It's such a waste of time.

917
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:22,720
That's a purely.

918
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:23,360
Yes.

919
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,500
If you play golf or whatever, because it's

920
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,180
in certain circles, that's where the meetings are

921
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:28,440
done.

922
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:28,800
Right.

923
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:32,020
And you get to know people for business

924
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:32,460
there.

925
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,120
Yeah.

926
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,000
But practicing that is stupid and it is

927
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
a very stupid thing, especially now the way

928
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,580
things are.

929
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,640
You should be more supportive of the people

930
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,180
around you.

931
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,120
And how are you going to support them

932
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,300
if you know nothing?

933
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,360
And if you think you have an education

934
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,900
on anything, you know nothing.

935
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:52,340
You're all a bunch of memes and what

936
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,660
do you call it, cliches and all this

937
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:54,900
stuff.

938
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,600
And trusting to these professional morons that there

939
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,620
is not enough time in the day, the

940
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,480
week, the month or the year to learn

941
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,280
what you should have learned by the age

942
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,900
of nine or ten, which is how the

943
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:10,460
body works, how the law of things work,

944
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,320
both natural and man's law.

945
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,660
Your spirituality has nothing to do with these

946
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,760
religions at all.

947
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,380
Spirituality is your mindset, having a clean, sharp

948
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:23,460
mind that you can apply wisdom, knowing what's

949
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,100
wrong or right.

950
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,340
There are wrongs and rights.

951
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,300
There's maxims of law you need to study.

952
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,140
So when I have run into people, I've

953
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,580
had years ago, have meetings like Skype and

954
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,820
call and say, oh, I'm playing golf tomorrow,

955
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,420
but, you know, practicing, you're an idiot.

956
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:38,420
Golf.

957
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:38,960
Are you kidding?

958
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,280
There's not enough time in the day, the

959
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,480
month, the year or the week to learn

960
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,480
about anything.

961
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,440
These hobbies need to go away.

962
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,680
Now it's different than if you're doing it

963
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,940
because you appreciate a certain level of fitness

964
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:52,060
like running or cycling or swimming.

965
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,920
I'm not saying don't do that, but don't

966
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,060
go to a freaking swimming camp with some

967
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,500
idiots over the whole weekend to go do

968
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:58,720
whatever.

969
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,120
It's a waste of time.

970
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:00,720
Right.

971
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,140
Now, does it sound like I have a

972
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,660
sense of urgency in my voice?

973
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,060
Yeah, because that's how things really are when

974
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:07,760
you wake up.

975
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,200
Now, even when you sleep, don't you want

976
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,160
to sleep comfortably?

977
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,140
And I'm telling you, most of the stuff

978
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,540
that people waste their time with will bring

979
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:19,600
you into very inconvenient situations because you'll be

980
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,700
more trusting of these people that know nothing.

981
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,040
No, they don't know more than you do.

982
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,620
They have the appearance of knowing a doctor

983
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,040
and a lawyer have the appearance of knowing

984
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,900
more than you do, but they don't.

985
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,380
And because they all operate in the same

986
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,520
thing, ask them whatever and they answer the

987
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:34,820
same.

988
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,620
They have to tell you what's on CNN.

989
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,660
That's all they're taught.

990
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,440
Now, the robustness of the human body.

991
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,800
Also, this is a segue that was more

992
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,680
like the mental part.

993
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,800
The more of a segue I'm going to

994
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,700
get into hygiene.

995
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:50,760
Hygiene means actually, yeah, you know, it actually

996
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,440
means health and well-being.

997
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,480
The means well-being generally.

998
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,720
And I notice there's a big problem with

999
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:04,120
that with people because of the chemical age,

1000
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,280
your cleaners and the way you live in

1001
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,900
your abode and all that stuff.

1002
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,200
There's something called outgassing.

1003
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,820
And I'm going to bounce around here.

1004
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,880
You ever walk down a supermarket aisle?

1005
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,660
And even if you were blindfolded, you know

1006
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,080
what aisle you're on by the smell.

1007
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,460
You ever walk down the cleaner aisle?

1008
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,660
It burns your eyes, right?

1009
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,780
Aren't all those bottles sealed in the supermarket?

1010
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:25,920
Well, they are.

1011
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,500
They're just about as sealed there as they're

1012
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,500
going to be when you bring them home.

1013
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,740
And they're actually going to be less sealed

1014
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,440
once you bring them home and start using

1015
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,560
them and close them up again.

1016
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,300
Right, right.

1017
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,320
That's what's happening in your house.

1018
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:40,440
You're being like homeopathically poisoned by these poisons,

1019
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,000
petrochemical stuff.

1020
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:42,320
Right.

1021
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,300
So what I suggest to people, besides the

1022
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,480
point, if you live in one of these

1023
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,780
what I call ticky tacky stick and mud

1024
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:52,040
houses that are built here in America since

1025
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:55,100
the 80s, all that material that they're sheathing

1026
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,720
the house with, you know, sticks and mud,

1027
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,560
they put up these sticks, two by fours,

1028
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,920
and they put plywood, the particle board on

1029
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,320
the outside.

1030
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,660
Then they put the, you know, the licum

1031
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,400
stick and bricks.

1032
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,420
Right, right.

1033
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,680
You know, peel and stick bricks or whatever

1034
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,220
they're doing.

1035
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,080
OK, that's 20 percent formaldehyde.

1036
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,640
What's formaldehyde?

1037
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,360
I'm not going to get into that.

1038
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,380
Go look at the particle board.

1039
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,780
It's 20 percent, 15 percent formaldehyde.

1040
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,640
You're living in an embalming chamber.

1041
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,540
So if you live in a modern house

1042
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:27,140
less than 40 years old, you must have

1043
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:30,400
windows open no matter how cold, not all

1044
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,660
the way open, just slightly open.

1045
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,760
Now, as a matter of fact, anyone who

1046
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,440
lives in one of these ticky tacky houses,

1047
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,740
subdivisions or whatever, will know that if you

1048
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,460
have more than one story on the top

1049
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,520
floor, this looks like a bathroom vent fan

1050
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,680
that's always running to create a negative pressure.

1051
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,300
So these chemicals go out and people don't

1052
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,920
start dropping dead because some people are more

1053
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,680
like a canary in the coal mine.

1054
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,000
Right.

1055
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:58,800
So, yeah, anybody who who hears this and

1056
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,280
has that will be like, oh, shit, what

1057
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:00,560
do I do?

1058
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:00,980
Move.

1059
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,140
Anyway, you're going to need to ventilate those

1060
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:05,480
spaces.

1061
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,800
That's part of hygiene.

1062
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,960
The other thing is washing.

1063
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,639
A lot of the soaps were much worse

1064
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,060
in the 70s and things like that.

1065
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,800
Soaps are getting a little milder with the

1066
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,940
chemicals that are in them.

1067
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,239
Minimal soap.

1068
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,620
Your focus on hygiene is your face, your

1069
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,760
armpits, your groin and your feet.

1070
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,380
Now, in terms of hygiene for your personal

1071
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,760
body, I'm going to jump back to your

1072
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,900
living space for your maybe I'll jump back

1073
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:30,980
to living space right now.

1074
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,960
So I remember when I was dictating these

1075
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:37,000
things back in the 80s, I walk into

1076
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,600
someone's kitchen.

1077
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:39,020
I could smell the chemical stuff.

1078
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,400
What you do is you put all the

1079
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,219
chemical cleaners you have, laundry detergents under the

1080
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:43,440
sink.

1081
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,400
Usually they go bathroom sink under the bathroom,

1082
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:47,760
under the kitchen sink or in a side

1083
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,159
closet.

1084
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,620
Put them all together in a box.

1085
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,120
If you have chlorine and ammonia, separate them

1086
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,239
because together they become mustard gas, by the

1087
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:55,520
way.

1088
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,860
They go into what I call the chemical

1089
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,060
closet chemical box.

1090
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,960
Keep it on the freaking fire escape if

1091
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,320
you have to keep it out of your

1092
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:04,820
environment.

1093
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,560
Find a space if you live in an

1094
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,600
apartment in someone else's apartment, right?

1095
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:09,240
Uh huh.

1096
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,380
So in the basement or a little storage

1097
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,320
room, keep all that shit out from where

1098
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,080
you live, not in the same living space

1099
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,060
or near a window, but a window that

1100
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,900
you're not relying on fresh air, a window

1101
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,180
that was more like sending the air out

1102
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,520
like a vented area.

1103
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:23,960
Yeah.

1104
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,200
So if you have a real like leaky

1105
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,700
house where it's kind of like, you know,

1106
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,900
you have, you know, you don't have gaskets

1107
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,080
in the window, keep these things near a

1108
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,920
place where they could be vented away from

1109
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,720
your living space.

1110
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,560
It's very important.

1111
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,080
And the hygiene also, what do you use

1112
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,440
for cleaning plain water?

1113
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,700
Basic soaps like Borax, the natural dishwashing liquid.

1114
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,360
Make sure you have hydrogen peroxide in a

1115
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:47,920
spray bottle.

1116
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,540
It has to be.

1117
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,260
You just use the same bottle that comes

1118
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:50,400
in.

1119
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,460
Hydrogen peroxide exposed to light is worthless within

1120
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,100
three days.

1121
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,980
It's as a lower pH.

1122
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,960
It's a very strong oxidizer.

1123
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,400
You know that oxy clean stuff.

1124
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,480
All it is is citric acid or on

1125
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,280
hydrogen peroxide and some reaction.

1126
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:03,620
Right.

1127
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,300
So hydrogen peroxide is an overall cleaner.

1128
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,000
If you have pets, things like that, you

1129
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,820
know, whatever pet pee, baby vomit, whatever oxidizes,

1130
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,840
cleans, make sure you use a plastic bag

1131
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,040
and paper towels to pick it up.

1132
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,080
Don't put your hands in it.

1133
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,460
You know, wrap the plastic bag around your

1134
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:20,840
hand.

1135
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,140
Right.

1136
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,460
And keep those things.

1137
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:27,000
So basically, your cleaning supplies should be minimized.

1138
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:30,500
And heaven forbid you're buying like Johnson and

1139
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,480
Johnson or Procter & Gamble cleaning products.

1140
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,360
Heaven forbid.

1141
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:34,440
Right.

1142
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,800
Make your own rubbing alcohol in a spray

1143
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,820
bottle is an amazing degreaser and cleaner.

1144
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:42,740
Amazing.

1145
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,180
It's actually an industry.

1146
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,360
Alcohol is a necessity as a degreaser for

1147
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,900
parts and things like that.

1148
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,820
So learn how to use that.

1149
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,120
I don't know if I've done a sonic.

1150
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,080
That's your basic hygiene, ventilating your space, keeping

1151
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,020
yourself clean.

1152
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:00,020
Now, going back to keeping yourself clean is

1153
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,800
the main thing about hygiene is face, armpits,

1154
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,320
groin.

1155
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,900
Now, this is like I don't know if

1156
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,620
anyone here is listening from a country where

1157
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,960
it's not popular to take showers.

1158
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,320
I live with these two French twins.

1159
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,140
She looked like Catherine Beta, Beta Jones.

1160
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,520
And when I saw Catherine Beta Jones in

1161
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,500
the early days in the 80s, I saw

1162
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,520
her on TV.

1163
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,760
I said, oh, they finally made it to

1164
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,020
Hollywood.

1165
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:19,880
And I was Catherine Beta Jones.

1166
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,340
Well, I knew these twins look just like

1167
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:21,440
her.

1168
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,160
Actually, they were fraternal.

1169
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,560
One was shorter than the other.

1170
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,740
And what's interesting is one time we're having

1171
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:29,340
dinner and one of them's like, it's Saturday,

1172
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:29,960
let's say.

1173
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:30,860
And she goes, I'm going to take a

1174
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:31,600
shower on Tuesday.

1175
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,680
Like it's big news.

1176
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:33,940
Right.

1177
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,680
And I'm like, that's weird because I take

1178
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,780
a shower in the morning and I take

1179
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:37,980
a shower at night every day.

1180
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:38,480
Right.

1181
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:38,960
Right.

1182
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,700
And they thought I was weird.

1183
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,040
Right.

1184
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,520
So anyway.

1185
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,420
There are places where people don't wash and

1186
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:49,080
but when they do wash, they're concerned about

1187
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,580
the areas that I mentioned, face, armpits, groin

1188
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,640
and then feet.

1189
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,020
Even in the Bible, washed his feet because

1190
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:56,740
they had sandals.

1191
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,860
They had boots also, but they're not mentioned.

1192
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,360
So those are the main concerns.

1193
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,440
So when you want to save water, you

1194
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,200
have minimal water.

1195
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,900
You live on a submarine or whatever.

1196
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,320
You got a 30 second shower.

1197
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:11,980
That's how you target yourself.

1198
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,400
Right.

1199
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:16,480
Face, you know, hands, of course, hands first,

1200
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,500
then face, then armpits, groin, feet.

1201
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,800
Now, one little thing here, because I've run

1202
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,480
into people that were in the military and

1203
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:23,720
various.

1204
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,340
So when you change environment, right.

1205
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,540
Like, for example, there was someone who was

1206
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,880
a colonel in the army and he stayed

1207
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,320
in Korea.

1208
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,920
When he came back, he had like a

1209
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:34,480
fungal infection on his fingernails between his fingers.

1210
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,580
And they blamed it on Americans coming back,

1211
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,760
you know, from Korea had that as like

1212
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,100
the fungus that's measured, by the way, is

1213
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,900
created by your own body.

1214
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:44,300
Right.

1215
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,960
Yeah, that's that's amazing because I think you

1216
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,660
have to catch everything from something else.

1217
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,680
When they pull blood from someone and they

1218
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,460
got TB in the blood, that TB did

1219
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,640
not come from someone else and entered your

1220
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,060
bloodstream.

1221
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:57,580
Your body created that just like the replicator

1222
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,740
on Star Trek creates whatever, you know, chocolate

1223
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,120
pudding.

1224
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:01,540
Yeah.

1225
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,340
So anyway, this is beyond that.

1226
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:06,260
But they found like erythromycin and various things

1227
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,760
like that to be effective on it.

1228
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,680
And he would put it on his hands

1229
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,740
and he says, I think I need to

1230
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,780
change the prescription to something stronger.

1231
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,700
And I said, well, are you putting it

1232
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,880
on your wrists also?

1233
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,360
I said, but it's not on my wrists.

1234
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,140
And I said, yes, I know that this

1235
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,100
is all about energy.

1236
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:23,080
When you treat your hands, rub a little

1237
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,360
bit on your wrist, which is one of

1238
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,380
the strongest energy points in the body, by

1239
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,300
the way, go around the entire wrist like

1240
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:28,860
a bracelet.

1241
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:29,760
Right.

1242
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:30,840
Guess what?

1243
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,460
A week later, as I've been doing this

1244
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,960
for six months and now I did a

1245
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,080
thing on the wrist and a week it's

1246
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:35,440
gone.

1247
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,040
But I'm going to keep going because I

1248
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:37,680
don't want to come back.

1249
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:38,080
So fine.

1250
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:38,960
But you notice when you do it on

1251
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,760
your OK, now people that have itchy feet,

1252
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,580
do they put medication on their feet for

1253
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:46,920
whatever they put it on their toe, on

1254
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,020
the nail or the heel, whatever is specific.

1255
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:49,460
Right.

1256
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,200
But it says it put topically on the

1257
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:51,900
area affected.

1258
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:52,240
Right.

1259
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:55,960
You should put it around your ankle as

1260
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,780
well, even though the ankle is not affected.

1261
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,180
The ankle is a very powerful energetic area.

1262
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,580
Remember, once you understand these things are emergence,

1263
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,600
they're created by your body, even though they're

1264
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,960
measurable as being foreign and someone else doesn't

1265
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,120
have.

1266
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,560
Yes, they're on your body because your body

1267
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,040
made them.

1268
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,700
Just like an example.

1269
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,940
You know, the microscopic view of people's skin,

1270
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,640
these little mites that look like sci fi

1271
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,220
monsters.

1272
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:16,540
Right.

1273
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,460
And some people freak out and keep taking

1274
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,480
showers to get rid of them.

1275
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,080
Actually, the heat and water makes them grow

1276
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:22,520
even more.

1277
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,560
They come from your body, produces them.

1278
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:27,080
They're not jumping off something like the idiot

1279
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,060
medical people.

1280
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:29,600
You know, they'll say, well, it must have

1281
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,380
come from this or that.

1282
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,360
They cannot fathom in their mind that your

1283
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,560
body nature is so incredible.

1284
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,040
Right.

1285
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:40,540
So again, the ankles and the wrists are

1286
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:43,700
very strong, energetic points, transfer of energy because

1287
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,520
they're always bent.

1288
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:45,480
Right.

1289
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:49,640
What I mean by that is in the

1290
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,700
human flow, the flow of the human body,

1291
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,740
when you lock out your arm and your

1292
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,760
fingers straight ahead, your energy slows down.

1293
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,000
It's not like plumbing.

1294
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:57,980
You know, you have a straight pipe.

1295
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:58,780
It runs through faster.

1296
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,080
No.

1297
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:03,080
When you bend your joints, the energy moves

1298
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,880
through much more freely, I should say, and

1299
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,940
more energy moves through.

1300
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,440
And that's why, like in the Matrix, when

1301
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,380
Neil puts his hands up and his palm

1302
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,260
backwards, oh, that's how you cut the energy

1303
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,200
off to your hand.

1304
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:14,200
Right.

1305
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,600
The way you bring energy to your hand

1306
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,820
is by limp wrist position forward fingers slightly.

1307
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,500
All the joints are slightly bent.

1308
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,300
That's you can even do that exercise.

1309
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,580
The wrists and the ankles are typically bent,

1310
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,740
constantly moving.

1311
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:29,100
And they're always in a non locked out

1312
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:29,480
position.

1313
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,360
That's why people with back problems, when you

1314
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,420
stand, let's say if you're standing, you know,

1315
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,500
cooking, washing dishes or at work, I bet

1316
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,620
your knees are locked out.

1317
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:38,560
I never thought of that.

1318
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,100
Unlock your knees.

1319
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,340
They're like, oh, no, now it feels like

1320
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,840
I have to support my weight with your

1321
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:44,020
muscles.

1322
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:44,400
Right.

1323
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:44,700
Yeah.

1324
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:45,520
It's kind of tiring.

1325
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,360
Yeah, exactly.

1326
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,100
Learn how to do that.

1327
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,540
And then when you do lock out your

1328
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,760
knees, it'll be in a more beneficial position.

1329
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:54,020
It could take up to a month to

1330
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,740
train yourself to stand with your knees not

1331
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:56,320
locked out.

1332
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:56,660
Right.

1333
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,440
It's amazing with the healing powers of just

1334
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,180
doing something like that, because, again, it's a

1335
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:04,640
it's an area where energy will flow better.

1336
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,600
So now I sound like one of these

1337
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,020
energy airy fairy types.

1338
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,760
No, these these things that I'm telling you

1339
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,960
are experienced facts that work in almost all

1340
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,780
or most cases, most or all cases.

1341
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:20,040
So with hygiene, when you're treating the hands

1342
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,460
and treating the feet, you have to do

1343
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,480
the ankles and the wrists.

1344
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:24,780
Why?

1345
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,740
Because the Greeks said so.

1346
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:26,000
Right.

1347
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,620
So do an experiment with that.

1348
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,260
When you wash your hands, wash your wrists.

1349
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,520
You know, surgeons, you know, they scrub to

1350
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:32,920
the elbow.

1351
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:33,220
Right.

1352
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,260
As a matter of fact, they're so afraid

1353
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,940
of bugs that the the valves are controlled

1354
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:38,840
below the waist.

1355
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,140
Right.

1356
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,560
You know, a hospital sink.

1357
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:40,800
Right.

1358
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,340
So a surgeon in surgery.

1359
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:48,660
So these things are integrated within the concept

1360
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:49,920
of why you're doing things.

1361
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,220
So let's say you run into someone who

1362
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:54,220
is putting topical ointment on their feet.

1363
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,400
Suggest that they also wrap it around, put

1364
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,880
it on their ankles all the way around

1365
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,900
like a bracelet, right where on the ankle,

1366
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:02,820
you know, where the joint is.

1367
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,260
I mean, you want to get anatomically just

1368
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,900
around where the leg meets the foot, where

1369
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:09,540
the hand meets the the forearm for the

1370
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:09,840
wrist.

1371
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:12,380
And you'll notice a massive improvement.

1372
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:14,180
That is also part of hygiene or well

1373
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:14,480
-being.

1374
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:15,320
Right.

1375
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:18,040
And by the way, no one is discussing

1376
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:18,300
this.

1377
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:19,520
And I've never heard it discussed.

1378
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,480
And it works so well.

1379
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,160
So the other thing with hygiene, of course,

1380
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:26,000
will ultimately is your food intake.

1381
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:27,460
And I don't know if I'm going to

1382
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:28,480
be doing a food seminar.

1383
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,400
I would like to.

1384
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,160
And if I don't, we'll just start hammering

1385
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,140
it here for the subs.

1386
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,000
Yeah, it'll be stuff that you've never heard

1387
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,560
of before.

1388
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,400
And it'd be easy.

1389
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:42,580
Again, the food intake is very important.

1390
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,880
The food seminar seminars when you're in person,

1391
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:46,660
it would be a webinar.

1392
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:49,580
Or a sonic, it would be actually I

1393
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:51,000
would reduce it to a sonic.

1394
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,860
Excuse me, because it wouldn't be that hardcore.

1395
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,280
People that were around for the financial stuff

1396
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,000
for the weather work webinar, they did notice

1397
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,460
I was pretty hardcore on that.

1398
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,220
It was three, three hour sessions just to

1399
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:04,620
get into the subject, just to get into

1400
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:07,820
the subject, a working knowledge, a basic working

1401
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:08,240
knowledge.

1402
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,960
I would have to do three nine hour

1403
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:14,140
sessions to get to the point.

1404
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:15,020
All right.

1405
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:17,600
We'll see 27 hours at least to become

1406
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,520
familiar.

1407
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,600
We're in the we're not talking Q&A

1408
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,880
now in the three hour thing.

1409
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,520
Very little Q&A.

1410
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:26,100
But this is what it takes to learn.

1411
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:28,440
You know, like everything they teach in school,

1412
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,060
even university, you could learn in two or

1413
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:31,440
three years, but they spread it out for

1414
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:31,820
12.

1415
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:32,980
Why?

1416
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,800
Because they have to waste your time.

1417
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:35,480
Right.

1418
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:36,300
They know it.

1419
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,960
So and you know it, too, and you

1420
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:38,760
don't mind it.

1421
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:39,120
Right.

1422
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:40,620
Because how do I know?

1423
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:41,460
Because you stayed there.

1424
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:41,680
Right.

1425
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,020
No one ran away and said, I can't

1426
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:44,640
take it anymore.

1427
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,260
I'm sure there are.

1428
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,900
Hopefully there are some people here that left

1429
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,600
after the eighth grade or before the eighth

1430
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:48,740
grade.

1431
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,200
Oh, my gosh, that's great.

1432
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,700
You know, you get a medal for that,

1433
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:53,020
right?

1434
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,700
Screw the GED.

1435
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,080
I saw people, by the way, you know,

1436
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,640
they can't get out of school till 14

1437
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,860
or whatever, and then they give them a

1438
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:00,440
hard time.

1439
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,600
Take the GED at 11.

1440
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,040
I can teach an 11 or 12 year

1441
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,380
old how to pass the GED with flying

1442
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:08,320
colors very quickly.

1443
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,240
As a matter of fact, they actually give

1444
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,360
you last year's test.

1445
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,160
This year's test is slightly modified.

1446
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:16,120
You're guaranteed an 85 by just doing the

1447
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,020
previous tests.

1448
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:17,400
Right.

1449
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,420
So if you're paying attention, you've seen that

1450
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,440
was last year's test.

1451
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:22,660
Well, what do you think this year's test

1452
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:23,400
is going to be like?

1453
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:23,660
Right.

1454
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:24,540
Yeah.

1455
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,320
So slightly modified version.

1456
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:27,180
Yeah.

1457
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,620
So you just play around.

1458
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:30,880
So the intellectual side is also part of

1459
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,680
the robustness.

1460
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:31,980
Right.

1461
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:34,280
Can you take a hint like one thing

1462
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:34,640
now?

1463
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,620
It's always been the same way, but it's

1464
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:38,120
coming at you faster as propaganda.

1465
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,360
How do you know you're being propaganda?

1466
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:44,000
You see all the media outlets repeating the

1467
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,060
same thing constantly.

1468
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,140
And it does it with no they tell

1469
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:47,860
you it's science.

1470
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,520
They tell you it's facts, but there are

1471
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,640
it's completely devoid of science and facts.

1472
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:54,880
And usually it sounds like it's breaking the,

1473
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,100
quote unquote, laws of nature or physical laws.

1474
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:58,980
It sounds like an impossibility.

1475
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,420
And you see this propaganda all over and

1476
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:01,600
over.

1477
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,260
And right now, you know what the propaganda

1478
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:03,880
is financial.

1479
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,880
We're going to have a financial crash.

1480
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,000
Things are going to go bad.

1481
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,160
Well, no, they're not.

1482
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,880
It's going to be quite the opposite.

1483
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,200
You're going to have a blip in the

1484
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,060
fall because that's when all financial hiccups happen.

1485
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:15,000
Right.

1486
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,560
But yeah, so I just brought that up

1487
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:18,120
as an example.

1488
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,500
So that's the robustness of the human condition.

1489
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:23,580
Imagine the amount of propaganda that's been put

1490
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,360
on people to make them do things.

1491
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:27,160
And they actually come through it.

1492
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:27,580
Right.

1493
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:30,140
And they look back at it, whether it's

1494
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:31,760
the world, what they call the World War

1495
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,760
conflicts or whatever.

1496
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:37,740
And the 9-11, COVID, whatever.

1497
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:40,840
Same, same stuff, same programming.

1498
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,400
By the way, what you saw, the propaganda

1499
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,340
that you saw for COVID and 9-11

1500
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,780
of the terror terrorism is exactly the same

1501
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:50,140
propaganda that they did for World War Two

1502
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:50,740
and World War One.

1503
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:52,820
Exactly the same, the same script.

1504
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:55,520
Well, different subject matter, obviously.

1505
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:59,060
But the reason people don't see it is

1506
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:00,760
because most of it's been washed away.

1507
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,540
Like, for example, if you try to research

1508
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:06,040
and do a documentary on the propaganda that

1509
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,280
was put out for COVID, you're going to

1510
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:07,920
have a hard time.

1511
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:09,580
Most of it's been washed away and not

1512
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:10,980
not stored.

1513
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,440
I mean, I'm sure like the CNN tapes

1514
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,960
are there somewhere, but you won't get access

1515
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:15,700
to them anymore.

1516
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:16,400
Right.

1517
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,800
All this, the propaganda and the BS they

1518
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:19,740
did for 9-11.

1519
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:21,660
You're going to have a hard time if

1520
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:23,800
you did a documentary on just the propaganda

1521
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:24,460
aspect.

1522
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:24,920
Right.

1523
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:25,960
What was put forward?

1524
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:26,760
You're going to have a hard time.

1525
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:28,440
They don't preserve it very well.

1526
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,720
Fortunately, I was able to actually hold in

1527
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:36,180
my hand newspapers, live newspapers from the period

1528
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:36,940
of World War Two.

1529
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:38,460
And I was like, what a bunch of

1530
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:38,660
bullshit.

1531
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:41,780
I was exposed to this in the 80s.

1532
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:44,440
And when I started seeing the propaganda, I

1533
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,580
was like, oh, this is like the stuff

1534
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:46,540
they did in World War Two.

1535
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,060
And people look at me like I was

1536
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:48,320
crazy.

1537
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:49,080
What are you talking about?

1538
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:49,560
World War Two?

1539
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:50,820
That was the greatest generation.

1540
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:51,860
No, shut up.

1541
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:52,620
Right.

1542
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,200
I'm like, oh, my gosh, you don't know

1543
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,300
the protests and all this stuff.

1544
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,260
That's all that's hidden.

1545
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:58,280
You don't get that.

1546
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:58,540
Right.

1547
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:58,880
Right.

1548
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,520
But the 9-11 and the COVID was

1549
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,460
so shameful that they're not going to say

1550
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:05,380
that's the greatest generation we came through because

1551
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:06,160
of the vaccine.

1552
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:06,500
Right.

1553
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:08,220
And by the way, I'll leave it off

1554
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:08,740
with this.

1555
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:14,000
According to stuff that's been studies have been

1556
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,820
done actually in the 20s and 30s about

1557
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:17,300
vaccines, and they were null and void.

1558
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:18,300
Right.

1559
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:20,220
But then they picked it up again in

1560
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:22,820
the 30s, 40s and 50s with the polio,

1561
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,320
which was the DDT spray, the bug spray.

1562
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:25,820
Right.

1563
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,940
People don't know that most mainstream towns in

1564
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:31,660
America, for some reason it happens and it

1565
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:32,360
comes in cycles.

1566
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,240
People would be out on Main Street shopping.

1567
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:38,300
And suddenly the sky gets dark with houseflies

1568
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:41,380
sweeping down on people, biting them.

1569
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:43,700
And the people start saying, why is this

1570
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:44,000
happening?

1571
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:44,580
We need some help.

1572
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:46,520
So the government had the smart idea or

1573
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,100
the municipalities, not the government.

1574
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:51,440
These tanks of DDT and various other mixtures

1575
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,320
like that and fumigating, they're called it the

1576
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:54,760
public.

1577
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:55,220
Right.

1578
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:55,980
And they didn't care.

1579
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:59,020
People and then suddenly young children, even old

1580
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:00,120
people couldn't walk.

1581
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,600
And they said it was a polio virus.

1582
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:03,040
Right.

1583
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:03,620
Soon.

1584
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:06,160
And there's actually a woman that wrote a

1585
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,060
book about this.

1586
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,880
It's called Spring Something.

1587
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:09,300
Right.

1588
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,840
About the DDT spraying.

1589
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:13,080
There was no less than 10 or 15

1590
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:16,380
doctors that testified in Congress about banning DDT

1591
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:17,700
because it's paralyzing people.

1592
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:19,760
And then the other side of the medical

1593
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,320
things, we have a vaccine for this thing

1594
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,120
called polio.

1595
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,060
So polio.

1596
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:24,300
Right.

1597
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:27,180
And this thing came up also recently in

1598
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:28,900
Brazil about 10 years ago.

1599
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,580
The Zika or something.

1600
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,580
Babies that couldn't walk because they had a

1601
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:33,460
mosquito problem.

1602
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:34,920
They were spraying DDT.

1603
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:36,720
There's no Zika virus.

1604
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:37,280
They were spraying.

1605
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:40,180
They were fumigating DDT at night and the

1606
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:41,020
children couldn't walk.

1607
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,620
And they said it was a Zika virus.

1608
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:43,520
Oh, my gosh.

1609
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,120
The same stupidity.

1610
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,220
This is like if you lived in a

1611
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:49,040
real world, the people pushing this would be

1612
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,440
hung and celebrated that they were hung, right?

1613
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:53,860
Or shot, you know, whatever.

1614
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:56,240
And it's it's called the what's it called?

1615
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,160
The one bullet thing.

1616
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,580
You know, they tell you deliberately miss.

1617
00:49:58,760 --> 00:49:59,980
You know, you go and get shoot at

1618
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:02,420
the firing squad.

1619
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:03,220
It's a one bullet.

1620
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:03,800
No reload.

1621
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:04,680
It's called a no reload.

1622
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:05,080
Yeah.

1623
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:05,320
Yeah.

1624
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:08,580
Everybody's you have a deniability.

1625
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,780
You know, that person suffers.

1626
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:11,140
Yeah.

1627
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:11,280
Yeah.

1628
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,540
You shoot him in the leg, the arm.

1629
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,000
So he's got to be tied to the

1630
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,420
stake for eight hours where he bleeds out.

1631
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,160
I mean, this is the stuff that we're

1632
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:19,040
done to get back at people like this.

1633
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,180
We you know, we don't have that kind

1634
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:22,780
of stuff anymore, but I'm sure it is

1635
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:23,280
in private.

1636
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:27,360
I mean, they did suffocate that Scalia judge

1637
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,140
with a pillow when he was at that

1638
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:31,260
sex ranch in Texas about a decade ago.

1639
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:36,000
But anyway, keep your thoughts, keep your opinions

1640
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:36,900
to yourself, Greek.

1641
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:37,160
Right.

1642
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:39,160
Yeah.

1643
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,340
So the vaccine thing I've been studying that

1644
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:43,000
and the idea with that is no confusion

1645
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,400
in order for it to be legitimate.

1646
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:48,320
You need a blood type to be considered

1647
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,880
your weight to be considered your gender, your

1648
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,460
race to be considered and your age.

1649
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:54,440
Mm hmm.

1650
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,340
Or you can go the rock and roll

1651
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:57,760
style.

1652
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,000
I said, did you get the rock and

1653
00:50:59,000 --> 00:50:59,540
roll shot?

1654
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,880
And they're like, what do you mean by

1655
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:01,720
rock and roll shot?

1656
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:02,500
I said, you know, when you go to

1657
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,620
a rock and roll concert and they sell

1658
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:06,620
shirts outside, one size fits all.

1659
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:07,180
Remember?

1660
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:08,240
Yeah.

1661
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,580
That's why I call it the rock and

1662
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:10,140
roll shot.

1663
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:13,940
OK, so I think they'll wrap it up

1664
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:14,040
for.
