1
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,240
Rated Y, Sonic Event 205 I think it

2
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:11,720
is now.

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,360
Anyway, here we are.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,080
Greek, how are you?

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,160
Cool.

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,100
I'm me, I guess.

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,180
Doing it.

8
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:18,920
You're you.

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:19,700
Yeah.

10
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,680
I got a lot of, this is gonna,

11
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,300
anyone who's been listening to me for a

12
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,200
while is gonna feel like I went back

13
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,700
like 15 years or 10 years after today,

14
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,360
back to the more of the, let's say,

15
00:00:31,479 --> 00:00:35,060
aggressive way I talked about certain things.

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,240
But yeah, got any questions for tonight or

17
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:37,420
anything?

18
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,680
I mean, there's tons of stuff going on

19
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,800
we could talk about, but go ahead.

20
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,620
Sure, I do.

21
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,580
We're going back to the dummy load tonight,

22
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:42,920
though.

23
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:43,980
Sort of.

24
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,840
You're gonna see, we'll get a feeling for

25
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,100
it, yeah.

26
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,860
If you don't know what the dummy load

27
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,840
is, then you did not obviously listen to

28
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,220
the ones that I have opened up for

29
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,380
free at ocelli.com.

30
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,540
The Ocelli in the Greek series is all

31
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,860
up there from the AFR days.

32
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,260
Anyways.

33
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,860
Getting dummy loaded.

34
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,080
Yeah, that's basically what you're gonna get here

35
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:02,860
on this planet.

36
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:03,819
Just saying.

37
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,340
I've got such a habit, when I talk,

38
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,640
I meet people, you know, when I'm out.

39
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,320
I'm actually more active than I've ever been

40
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,200
because of the lab project and stuff.

41
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,880
And I start talking to people and they

42
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,880
kind of, I can see they're in between.

43
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,040
And before I really lose them, I say,

44
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,240
have you been on this planet for more

45
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:20,680
than a month?

46
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,740
And they're like, what kind of question is

47
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:23,940
that?

48
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,340
I said, did you ever get to ask

49
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:25,940
that before?

50
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,900
Well, you were the first person to ask

51
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,280
me that, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything.

52
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,780
Yeah, so you got to know these things.

53
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,840
Why are you asking me that?

54
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,840
Because it seems like you don't know a

55
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,760
lot about being here.

56
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,360
Objectively.

57
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,620
Anyway, you know, related to that almost, and

58
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,900
I know we've covered this before, but it's

59
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,160
been so long, I don't remember.

60
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,480
Many people talk about childhood trauma, but what

61
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,260
are the Greeks' thoughts on that?

62
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,620
How to break a pattern that's been a

63
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,020
person with a person since the earliest days.

64
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,320
There had been a lot of talk about

65
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,480
the voices in the head.

66
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,620
Do trickster entities have a tendency to attach

67
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,540
themselves to a person during a moment of

68
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,860
intense shock?

69
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:10,920
Okay, so there's two good questions there.

70
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:11,400
You got it.

71
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:11,620
Okay.

72
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,480
I'm going to answer it indirectly, but it's

73
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,440
the same thing, right?

74
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:14,860
Okay.

75
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,080
It's like if I have a cut on

76
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,900
my hand from a kitchen knife or a

77
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,940
chain link fence or a plastic knife, it's

78
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,260
a cut.

79
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,600
So we deal with it the same way,

80
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:23,880
right?

81
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,860
So you're dealing with past something that might

82
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,700
have traumatized you.

83
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,320
So what I would say there is everything

84
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,460
is stored in a visual sense in our

85
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:32,840
brains.

86
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,520
So get a visual and an emotional feeling

87
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,460
of what was bothering you as a child

88
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:42,020
and then freeze frame it, stop it, make

89
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,340
a thumbnail of it, a picture that represents

90
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,340
it, and then expand that until it gets

91
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,920
bigger and bigger and bigger, literally fills the

92
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,340
room, bigger than a billboard, the biggest billboard

93
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,780
you've ever seen, bigger than that big sphere

94
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,620
they have in Las Vegas, so big that

95
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,140
it fills the entire sky, that image, that

96
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,660
same image I'm talking about still, so big

97
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,340
that it's bigger than the sky, that's bigger

98
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,700
than the earth, bigger than the universe, and

99
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,780
then stop it, and then shrink it, make

100
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,640
it smaller and smaller and smaller until it

101
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,960
comes down to billboard size, it's in your

102
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,340
room, now it's so small, it's in the

103
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,120
palm of your hand, that same image, so

104
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,920
small it becomes a grain of sand, keep

105
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,080
making it smaller and smaller and smaller to

106
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,080
infinity, and you're done.

107
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,200
And that's it, that's what your brain needs,

108
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:36,540
because what happens if you retain these photographic,

109
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,720
let's say, or images of trauma or memory,

110
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,120
all your memory is imagery, even people who

111
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,300
have never seen anything have images, but they're

112
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:50,000
colors and swirls, even people born blind, they

113
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,840
still have images and it's based on emotion,

114
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,740
just like a lot of savants, when they

115
00:03:54,740 --> 00:04:00,080
do these 56,433 divided by 22,160

116
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,620
and they give you the answer right away,

117
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,480
you're like, well, how'd you do that?

118
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,600
So all those numbers become colors, right?

119
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,060
So anyway, what I'm trying to say with

120
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,580
this is, you can play back what I

121
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,120
just said, there's a guy, John Mace, who

122
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,600
came up with that, and I've been talking

123
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,260
about something similar, when I heard his testimony

124
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,280
about how to handle these quote-unquote psychological

125
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,820
traumas, I was like, oh, that's basically what

126
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,600
I'm talking about, but he narrows it down

127
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,760
to everything being visual, which is mostly correct,

128
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,040
so I agree with him and give him

129
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,860
credit on that.

130
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,400
And here's the thing about the psychology, just

131
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,940
like the Catholic Church, by the way, years

132
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,280
ago they would have, 500 years ago in

133
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,580
Europe, there was this evolving medical industry for

134
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,580
surgery, so they needed people to practice on,

135
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,400
so the priests, they went out and collected

136
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,480
confessions, and then a week later the priests

137
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,600
became sheriffs and arrested the people for their

138
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,480
confessions and handed them over to the doctors

139
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,160
to experiment on in prison.

140
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,880
So this is what the psychologists are doing,

141
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,040
you ever hear them say, if you say

142
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,560
something, I have to report it, if it's

143
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,080
illegal, or whatever?

144
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,940
Scumbags, they're all scumbags, the psychologists, psychiatrists, stay

145
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,040
away, I just gave you the thing that

146
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,860
they will never know and never figure out,

147
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,880
not that I'm saying it's illegal, but I'm

148
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,860
just saying, what they make you do is

149
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,600
share, and it's idiots too, you hear idiots

150
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,740
probably in your family, or friends, or on

151
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,280
TV, they say, oh, you know, if you

152
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,940
share it, if you talk about it, then

153
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,720
you can work it through, no, with this

154
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,620
method, I could do therapy with someone, and

155
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,220
I don't want to know what the trauma

156
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,320
is, it doesn't matter if you were butt

157
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,220
-fucked 670 times in a day when you

158
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,220
were 4 years old, it doesn't matter, I

159
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,340
don't need to know, no one needs to

160
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,840
know, but you need to be able to

161
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,180
recall the feeling and the image, that's the

162
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,580
pitfall of modern psychology, and people say it,

163
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,620
they say, why don't you talk about it?

164
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,140
One thing about this, I got a question

165
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:04,360
from me now, about the blind people and

166
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,080
how it is you know that, because quite

167
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,920
honestly, the only reason why I know you're

168
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,620
correct, is because I spent a lot of

169
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,780
time talking to completely blind people, because I

170
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,080
was close to blind, and went to blind

171
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,800
camp, so I spent time with those kids,

172
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,880
and I used to ask them questions like,

173
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,140
how do you picture these things?

174
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,700
And it took a little while, but I

175
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,140
understood it, and you're essentially right, but it's

176
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,740
about a personal image, not necessarily the image

177
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,380
itself, that's why you don't have to share

178
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,700
it, because you could spend 100 years, or

179
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,420
let's say 10 hours trying to explain the

180
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,180
image to work it through, it doesn't matter,

181
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,440
it's what's already in your head, and here's

182
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,080
the thing, if you don't work out these

183
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,620
young personal traumas, or even recent traumas, what

184
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,920
happens is, when it's stored in the brain,

185
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,060
it's stored in where it's stored, not in

186
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:48,660
the brain, right?

187
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,300
In you, let's say, in your essence, you

188
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,760
start changing the way your identity is, your

189
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,400
personality, to accommodate that trauma, so most people's

190
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,960
persona is based on traumas that they haven't

191
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,760
dealt with, that they're accommodating through the changing

192
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,980
of their character, how many times have you

193
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,620
met someone, I haven't seen Jim in a

194
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,680
long time, how's Jim doing?

195
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:10,900
I haven't seen him in years, but I

196
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,720
ran into him the other day, he's changed,

197
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,440
how many times have you heard that, right?

198
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,380
Yeah, people run into me after 10 years,

199
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,820
man, you're saying the same stuff, you haven't

200
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,100
changed a bit, I'm like, well, thank you,

201
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:25,200
whatever, but you have to work these things

202
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,900
out, and they're personal, and here's, it's the

203
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,000
opposite of what everyone's been taught, you know,

204
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,500
that therapy, that Freudian, the couch, I call

205
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,700
it, just call it the couch, it means,

206
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,200
says everything, you sit down, you tell the

207
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,680
psychiatrist everything, or psychologist, right?

208
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,380
And it's so funny when you call a

209
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:41,080
psychologist a psychiatrist, and a psychiatrist a psychologist,

210
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,020
how they get insulted both ways, and that's

211
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,420
so funny, and they're both morons, they don't

212
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,200
even know it, right?

213
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,260
Right, one's got a prescription pen, the other

214
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,300
one doesn't, but outside of that, who cares,

215
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,560
you know, it's the same crap.

216
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,080
I want to get into the moronic medical,

217
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,680
it's getting to the point where there are

218
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,200
no exceptions in the medical industry, they're all

219
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,560
morons, I haven't, actually there are exceptions, but

220
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,220
they've run away, completely, I mean, like, they

221
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,820
quit and run away, and I've lost touch,

222
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,740
let's say, but before I do that, before

223
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,720
you go to another question, I brought up,

224
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:10,960
Brandon...

225
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,040
You're a psychologist or a psychiatrist, though, it's

226
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,140
absolutely based on bullshit, there's absolutely nothing to

227
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:17,240
it.

228
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,400
Neurosurgeons are based on bullshit, okay, brain surgeons

229
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,940
are based on bullshit, but...

230
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,640
But it's at least based on something, it's

231
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,180
psychology, psychiatrist, psychiatrist, garbage.

232
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,440
I want to bring up another article, too,

233
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,200
a woman who had sex with 500 men

234
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,460
in one day, and they said, what are

235
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,740
the physical things, it just popped up in

236
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,020
the, I look at what really happened, they

237
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,039
put that in there, and it's all, they

238
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,140
said, she has all these chemical imbalances in

239
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,440
the list of all these hormones and things,

240
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,700
and I'm like, bullshit, no one knows, how

241
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,480
did they know those hormones even exist in

242
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:47,860
the body?

243
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,060
They took a blood sample, they centrifuged the

244
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,900
blood sample, then they isolated what they centrifuged,

245
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,180
then they combined it with other chemicals to

246
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,540
see what reactions would take place, then they

247
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,020
go to a chart and say, because we

248
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,900
put hydrogen peroxide in there, and this much

249
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,960
carbon dioxide came off, that means that there's

250
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,460
this much of this, bullshit, no one knows

251
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,140
what's in your cells, chemically, because actually, to

252
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,060
find out what's in the cell, chemically, you're

253
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,440
actually changing it.

254
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,380
So that's all right, let them categorize, this

255
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,580
is the danger of it, so that you

256
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,620
have too much of this moronic fluid in

257
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,520
your cell, and the way we get rid

258
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,040
of it is by adding this other chemical

259
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,100
that will inhibit it, it's called an inhibitor,

260
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:27,420
right?

261
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,340
Bullshit, bullshit, and the side effects are far

262
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,820
worse than, it's all bullshit, and it's all

263
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,220
a prank.

264
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,700
There are very few people on this planet

265
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,760
that have ever known what's going on, and

266
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,240
it still is that way.

267
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,720
So, before I get in, I think I

268
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,980
harped enough on the medical people, but this

269
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,300
is, I have to commend, this is Brandon

270
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,980
Joe Williams, I'll play it through my speaker,

271
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,020
I should say, it's called the Sovereignist Citizen

272
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,940
of Land, it's a live Austin meeting, or

273
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,860
somewhere like that, on the end of April,

274
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,460
this is day one, and he gets up

275
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,020
in the middle, because everyone's talking about it,

276
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,460
I took this to an attorney, he told

277
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,420
me this, bullshit, I called a banker, he

278
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,060
said this, bullshit, right, and this is like,

279
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,720
after about maybe half a dozen people giving

280
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,060
testimony, Brandon Joe Williams stands up and starts

281
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,520
saying this, it's just about a minute or

282
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:14,740
two.

283
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,340
Things from all sorts of different people, there's

284
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:20,800
banks, there's banks that, it says pending, and

285
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,240
they're like, pending the loan, and it just

286
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,160
sits there, and they call in, nobody knows,

287
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,280
everyone's confused, nobody has a fucking clue, everybody's

288
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,820
running around with their heads chopped off, you

289
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,180
go on the DMV, none of them have

290
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,700
any fucking clue, everyone's lost their fucking mind,

291
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,580
we don't know, I have no idea, there's

292
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,420
so much craziness, and so many people, and

293
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,020
so many things, for all I know, they

294
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,900
just say fuck this, everyone says fuck this,

295
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,560
they jam it in a drawer, and that's

296
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,540
the end of it, and nobody ever sees

297
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,540
it again, I'm not even kidding, and you're

298
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,540
just driving around, and it's just never gonna

299
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:53,880
get processed, I mean, that's just, everyone sees

300
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,160
it, and they go, fuck, you gonna do

301
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,160
this, fuck, I don't even know what the

302
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,520
fuck this is, the guy says he's an

303
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,080
attorney, in fact, oh, don't call that guy,

304
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,880
you know what I mean, you don't know,

305
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,580
you know, so the thing is, is there's

306
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,920
just so much craziness with this, and these

307
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,260
guys have never ever seen anyone do this,

308
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:11,520
and they're all stupid as fuck, so I've

309
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,940
talked to bankers with like 30, 35 years

310
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,680
of experience, hey, I have a question for

311
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,640
you, what's a negotiable instrument?

312
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:22,980
Oh, yeah, I heard about that before, oh,

313
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,900
yeah, is that, that's like a security, that's

314
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,120
a security, right, it's like, motherfucker, you've been

315
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,780
working for the bank for 30 fucking years,

316
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,700
makes me wanna just take like a claw

317
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,360
hammer to the fucking face, you know what

318
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,080
I mean, so I don't wanna get too

319
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,680
many peppered different questions, where it's like, well,

320
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,040
this and that and this and that, yeah,

321
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,700
we're gonna keep seeing a lot of that,

322
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,400
there's gonna be a lot of fucking weirdness,

323
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,540
a lot of chaos, you're gonna see shit,

324
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,620
whether you just stick it in a drawer,

325
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,700
and nobody can ever find it again, well,

326
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,760
fuck it, drive the car around, till someone

327
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,840
cleans out the drawer in fucking seven years,

328
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,120
or something, I don't know, I mean, that's,

329
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,300
you know, that's basically it right there.

330
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,840
So my...

331
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,840
Yeah, so he's getting it, he's getting it

332
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,920
finally, in other words, when you start listening

333
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,060
to Brandon Joe Williams, he's like, yeah, just

334
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,140
tell him this, this negotiable instruments, this, this,

335
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,700
that, go to, yeah, they know what this,

336
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,620
and he finally, finally after a couple years

337
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,680
doing this, he says no one knows shit,

338
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:21,360
attorneys don't know anything, bankers don't know anything.

339
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,760
So what's going on with all these professionals,

340
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,920
doctors, lawyers, attorneys, is they show up at

341
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,780
a college, and they go work wherever they

342
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,960
do, and they give them this giant box

343
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,040
with square pegs, and they tell them, you

344
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,160
see all these square holes, all these square

345
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,920
pegs, go into all these square holes, and

346
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,060
this is what you're gonna be doing for

347
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,340
the rest of your life.

348
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,200
That's the mental challenge they have.

349
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,540
And then like, someday, a round peg shows

350
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:51,440
up, oh no, oh no, right, or they

351
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,480
get a round hole, oh no, oh no,

352
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,100
these are the professionals.

353
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,900
When I'm talking about the normies, the normies,

354
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,600
the non-professional people, don't even exist in

355
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,680
my book, they're the space eaters, they take

356
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,820
up space and give off heat.

357
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,040
When I say the people are dumb, I'm

358
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,600
talking about your priests, your rabbis, your doctors,

359
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,800
your lawyers, your accountants, your judges, your prime

360
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,300
ministers, you know, the professional classes, that's what

361
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,340
your society is made of.

362
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,800
In other words, when the alien saucer lands

363
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,140
on the front lawn and they come out

364
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,460
since the 50s, what do the aliens always

365
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:24,760
say?

366
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,580
Take me to your leader.

367
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,380
Yeah, so who are you?

368
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,100
You don't care.

369
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,300
Take me to your leader.

370
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,040
So that's what I'm talking about, I'm talking

371
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,580
about your leaders.

372
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,900
Your leaders are not necessarily the politicians.

373
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,740
It's what category, when you say leader, what

374
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,640
are you talking about?

375
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,960
Dentistry, that's your dentist.

376
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,780
You're talking about physical health and fitness, that

377
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,860
would be a medical doctor.

378
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,160
You're talking about law, your leader would be

379
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,680
your attorney or lawyer.

380
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,080
For spirituality, it would be your priest.

381
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,420
You see, I'm kind of spreading it out,

382
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,200
right?

383
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,820
Because even if you went to the quote

384
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,660
-unquote president, any questions regarding spirituality, he would

385
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,340
go where?

386
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,000
He would go to the priest.

387
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,680
Any medical question from the alien, where does

388
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,360
the president go?

389
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,100
Bring in a doctor.

390
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,480
Yeah, see, so when I say leaders, it's

391
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,860
subject sensitive.

392
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,720
So I've been saying, anyone who's been listening

393
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,840
for a while, I've been very adamant about

394
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,960
how moronic people are.

395
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,920
I think when you and I got together,

396
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,240
it's been over 10 years now, I haven't

397
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:24,740
changed a bit.

398
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,900
It's gotten not worse, it's the same, which

399
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,080
makes it worse, right?

400
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,560
Which makes it worse, but the newer, and

401
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,960
I see the newer people come on the

402
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,580
scene on the Internet.

403
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,900
So here's another way to put it.

404
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,520
You can go to YouTube University and research

405
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,180
like bills of exchange to go what is

406
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,840
money, negotiable instruments, law, or even medicine.

407
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,160
And some young podcaster who's been doing this

408
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,260
for six months knows more about that field

409
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:51,020
than any attorney or any accountant or any

410
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,780
doctor on anything, right?

411
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:56,040
You wouldn't believe how many times I've been

412
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:00,400
brought into a Skype call, podcast, whatever, private

413
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,160
call actually, not a podcast, with an alternative

414
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,180
medicine doctor.

415
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,740
And the person was like, you've got to

416
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,320
speak to the Greek.

417
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,860
And I get on, they introduce themselves.

418
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,720
And they say, yeah, tell them about that

419
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,480
thing you have that you said reduces blood

420
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,340
pressure naturally.

421
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,600
And I let them talk and talk, and

422
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,340
I said, okay, I explained how blood pressure

423
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,700
is a fiction, and they get it.

424
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,860
And the first thing they say, but I've

425
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,920
been practicing medicine for 35 years.

426
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:23,760
What?

427
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,420
I don't care if you've been practicing for

428
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,720
3,500 years.

429
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,340
You're a moron, right?

430
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,060
And this always, whenever I'm brought to a

431
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,020
medical person, it always works that way.

432
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,060
I've met with medical people here in Tucson.

433
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,180
And after a while, it's like, do I

434
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,720
really want to, like, nail them and floor

435
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,900
them, or I just want to, like, be

436
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,720
cordial and change the subject and, you know,

437
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,760
but let them know they don't know, but

438
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,840
it's unspoken, right, the unspoken stuff.

439
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,940
And that's what I prefer to do lately

440
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:55,600
because if you traumatize them, then any bullshit

441
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,780
care they're giving their patients, this is all

442
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:00,380
bullshit, the best care you're going to get

443
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,860
from a medical person is when they tell

444
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,360
you what?

445
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,080
Go home and rest, right?

446
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,240
So why don't you just do that anyway,

447
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,160
right?

448
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:08,960
So anyway.

449
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,760
The only exception there that I've always said

450
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,960
is that it's like the battlefield medic sort

451
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,520
of stuff.

452
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,120
Absolutely.

453
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,080
You got an iron bar sticking out of

454
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,680
your neck.

455
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,160
Yeah.

456
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:18,560
Right?

457
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,460
They have the tools and some knowledge, some

458
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,880
knowledge to get it out, right?

459
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,600
Anyone in ER, they sit there with a

460
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,740
wound for hours and hours.

461
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,240
That needs to be treated within the first

462
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,660
three to five minutes for it to heal

463
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,580
immediately, right?

464
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,720
Three to five hours, you're talking weeks and

465
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,820
months for it to heal, right?

466
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,400
Because now the body's facilitated.

467
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,360
It is possible.

468
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,640
It is possible to, like, you know how

469
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,140
fast they can scoop someone off, a paramedic

470
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,060
can scoop someone off the street.

471
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,140
They can apply all of the treatment necessary

472
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:53,460
right in transport or immediately.

473
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,860
And if you know any paramedics, they hate

474
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,340
the doctors, and the paramedics call the paramedics,

475
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,420
the doctors call the paramedics taxi drivers, right?

476
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,760
They don't like each other, by the way.

477
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,460
Paramedics and hospital people don't like each other.

478
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,220
Conflict, because I'll tell you why.

479
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,619
A lot of times paramedics bring someone, and

480
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:12,700
they're almost ambulatory, they're fine, and then they

481
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,060
find out the person died when they went

482
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:14,540
to the hospital.

483
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,260
Like, how could he have died?

484
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,099
Right.

485
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,819
I mean, he was doing fine, right?

486
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,819
And then you have other things where the

487
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:24,740
person is barely alive, and the paramedics do

488
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,160
the right thing, and then they're fine when

489
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,280
they get to the doctors, and everyone credits

490
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,140
the doctors, but it was really the paramedics

491
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:33,060
that saved his life or her life.

492
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:33,520
You see?

493
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,120
So there's confusion.

494
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,940
There's no one knows what's going on.

495
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,100
And this is, we went over the last

496
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:39,240
slide.

497
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,120
It's a testament to the robustness of the

498
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:41,880
human condition.

499
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,320
I'm using that word however you want to

500
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:43,680
take it.

501
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,540
You know, the man's condition.

502
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,560
We are very, very robust creatures.

503
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,800
And to hearken back to what Charles Fort

504
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,860
said, we are owned.

505
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,080
We are on a farm.

506
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,480
Somebody owns us.

507
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,920
We don't have real, let's say, politics.

508
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,360
We don't have real governments.

509
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,760
We don't have real medicine.

510
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,840
We don't have real religion, let's say.

511
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,320
We don't have real science.

512
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,220
It's all fake.

513
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,340
And it's all fake for the same reason

514
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,480
that, let's say, you want an aquarium in

515
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,100
your living room.

516
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,520
You go out.

517
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,220
You buy the tank, and you put the

518
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:14,740
water in there.

519
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,860
Let it sit for a few days.

520
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,560
Check the pH.

521
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,460
Check the ammonia level.

522
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,580
Then you put the fish in.

523
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,240
And then you put like this fake rocks

524
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,860
and fake scenery on the back of the

525
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,180
aquarium.

526
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,740
And then you're like, hmm, I think I

527
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,780
want to change the scenery now.

528
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,800
We're going to go from medieval to pre

529
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,340
-industrial.

530
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:28,820
How's that?

531
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,760
And boom, you put the fake rock, the

532
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,440
fake thing, right?

533
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,900
It's all fake.

534
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:33,940
All fake.

535
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,480
There's no continuation of anything.

536
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,540
It's all fake because we're owned.

537
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,480
And what happens when you're tired of those

538
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,360
fish and you can't take them where you're

539
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,200
going to next year?

540
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,880
Flush them down the toilet, right?

541
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,240
That was the thing to do, right?

542
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,580
So, yeah.

543
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,560
So that's why you're getting flushed down the

544
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,520
toilet one at a time here.

545
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,880
However, that's how you're treated.

546
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,380
Oh, my gosh.

547
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:53,580
Yeah.

548
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,640
So I'm not going to get into a

549
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,520
rant, but I could substantiate anyone who's listening

550
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,940
that's got two brain cells to rub together

551
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,780
and a third brain cell as a spare

552
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,700
gets what I'm saying, hopefully.

553
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,220
And if you've been on this planet for

554
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,500
more than 30 days, you should know what

555
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:07,900
I'm saying.

556
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,140
So the thing about this, I brought it

557
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,680
up again because there's a lot of seriousness

558
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:16,520
about people talking, oh, the medical industry is

559
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:16,820
a scam.

560
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,480
You hear that more now than ever before.

561
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,400
Like people from all walks of life, right?

562
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,780
Not just the disadvantaged or disprivileged, like insurance.

563
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,060
We're talking about everyone.

564
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,840
Everyone's saying the government's a scam.

565
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,200
Everyone's saying the money system's a scam.

566
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,040
Everyone's saying, ah, okay.

567
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,580
So where have you been for the last

568
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,380
4,500 years or the last 90 years?

569
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,960
Because we have a new form of country

570
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,280
here.

571
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:41,020
People don't know that in 1933, there was

572
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,960
a major revolution on paper and the republic

573
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,160
became a democracy.

574
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,200
But anyway, which is no different.

575
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,280
It would have been better if like the

576
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,120
Red Army came over here and took over

577
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,100
because then it would be, you don't have

578
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,980
to read to know that, right?

579
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,560
But to know that you lost your country

580
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,260
and you volunteered into it means you have

581
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:03,640
to read.

582
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,580
So people will never find out that happened.

583
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,340
But if the Red Army came over here

584
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,560
and took over, you would know that because

585
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,520
it would be, you don't have to read

586
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,920
to know that because it's in your street,

587
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,900
it's in your face, right?

588
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,960
So why does it have to be in

589
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,780
your face like that for it to happen?

590
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,340
It doesn't.

591
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,400
It can happen on paper.

592
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,440
It can happen in all of your codes,

593
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,440
laws and regulations and behaviors, right?

594
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,360
All the banking that's being done, all the

595
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,380
police, the medical, all that stuff is what

596
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,460
an enemy occupier does.

597
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,300
Everything the doctors are doing, the police are

598
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,500
doing, the government is doing, the banks are

599
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,140
doing, the accountants are doing is what an

600
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,460
enemy occupying force would do to your people.

601
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,020
And you love it.

602
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,680
You actually tell your children to go and

603
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,480
join those professions.

604
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,240
With an enemy occupying force, though, you don't

605
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,420
have the same consent, right?

606
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,380
You have the possibility of resistance.

607
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,200
You have the resistance, and the resistance here

608
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,280
is called the alternative movement, which is not.

609
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,280
It's not alternative at all.

610
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,880
When you go to alternative movement, they don't

611
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,820
know how the body works.

612
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,060
So what the hell are you talking about?

613
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,220
It's not an alternative, but that's the thing.

614
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,460
They have zero knowledge of how the body

615
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:12,780
works.

616
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,820
All they know is that, guess what?

617
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,360
You get a cut, you better stop the

618
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:16,700
bleeding.

619
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,740
And how do we do that?

620
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,640
We sit on the motherfucker's arm, right?

621
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,020
Yeah, put pressure on it.

622
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:22,860
Wrap it up.

623
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,940
But they don't know how to do that.

624
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,440
They can't optimize it.

625
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,040
There are some optimizations going on, and I'm

626
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,220
not going to take credit for it because

627
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,320
I've been talking about this for a long

628
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:31,640
time.

629
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,820
But the more I look on optimizing wounds,

630
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,120
and so I start seeing methods, things that

631
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,440
I've talked about that rely on the biological

632
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,420
vacuum in the body.

633
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,960
But they will never say that we're under

634
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,420
a vacuum.

635
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,260
They can't.

636
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,580
And they don't know it either.

637
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,600
And they will never say the heart is

638
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,180
not a pump.

639
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,220
There's more and more people, but they're still

640
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:51,920
bullshit.

641
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,040
They don't know what moves.

642
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,800
So it would be quite interesting.

643
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,860
In the financial one, there's a lot of

644
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,280
people coming out saying, this is how it

645
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:03,520
works.

646
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,880
These are negotiable instruments.

647
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:05,900
This is how you signature.

648
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,640
This is how it goes to the Federal

649
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,620
Reserve, the application.

650
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,600
They get the full amount.

651
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,180
Then you sign a promissory note.

652
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,020
They get paid again.

653
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,720
And you might have signed a contract.

654
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,060
They get paid again.

655
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,480
And then you make payments, and you pay

656
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:17,840
again.

657
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,480
And then those interest payments make it as

658
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,880
if you paid twice, and then you pay

659
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,100
again.

660
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,520
So now you've paid five times for the

661
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,980
car over on paper.

662
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:25,280
Right.

663
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,300
And five times you've paid for it already.

664
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,460
We're not talking about the car's been paid

665
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:30,560
for.

666
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,160
We're not talking about through your income through

667
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:32,600
labor.

668
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,740
We're talking about on the books.

669
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,040
So when you apply for a car loan,

670
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,720
the car is fully paid for.

671
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,440
And then you do a contract.

672
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,460
The car is fully paid for again.

673
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,080
Right.

674
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,620
And then you get the car.

675
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,960
You make payments with interest.

676
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,460
The car is paid for again with the

677
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:52,020
principal, and the interest sometimes doubles.

678
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,280
Paid for again.

679
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,200
So four or five times you've paid for

680
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:55,740
it on paper.

681
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,240
And I'm not talking about going working and

682
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,340
taking part of your check.

683
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,780
I'm talking about on paper the car has

684
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,120
been paid.

685
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,440
The house has been paid.

686
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,640
So people who say I paid off my

687
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,680
car, I paid off my house, have paid

688
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,780
for it four times at least already.

689
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:07,780
Maybe five.

690
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,320
In some cases, it could be as much

691
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,060
as ten times.

692
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,740
Because they'll tell you you apply, and they

693
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,040
deny you it's been paid for.

694
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:16,920
And then a month later, they say, why

695
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,920
don't you come in and apply again?

696
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,280
They deny you again.

697
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,000
They call you a month later.

698
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,820
Come in and apply again.

699
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,640
Every application pays for the entire amount.

700
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:22,920
Right.

701
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,000
Yeah.

702
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,240
This is what's going on.

703
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,560
So there's plenty of stuff on that on

704
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:29,980
the Internet.

705
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,440
Actually, yeah, there is.

706
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,260
But there's nothing on the human body.

707
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:33,800
Nothing.

708
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,160
Zero.

709
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,520
Do we want to be the first ones

710
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:35,980
to do it?

711
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,320
Do we want to trailblaze that?

712
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,000
Anybody want to invest in that?

713
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,320
I don't want to do it alone.

714
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,380
No, I'd love to see it done, but

715
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,060
I don't.

716
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,160
It needs to be done.

717
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:46,980
You know, here's the thing.

718
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,020
I'm a cancer survivor, dickhead.

719
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,620
If you didn't get cancer, you would have

720
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,600
died in your sleep.

721
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,620
You ever heard that?

722
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,400
We've got to fight cancer, cure cancer.

723
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,020
Okay.

724
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,720
So if you cure cancer, people will be

725
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,080
dying in their sleep, and you won't even

726
00:23:59,080 --> 00:23:59,600
know why.

727
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:00,260
Right.

728
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,660
You'll be dying overnight.

729
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,820
You'll be dying of sepsis in three days

730
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,860
if you don't get cancer.

731
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:06,720
There you go.

732
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,480
Cancer is like, you know how when there's

733
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,660
a car accident and the traffic control comes

734
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,180
down, they put up a blockade and flares

735
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,140
and redirect traffic?

736
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:14,540
Yep.

737
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,260
That's what cancer is.

738
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:16,880
Right.

739
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,360
So imagine there's a, have you seen those

740
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,180
videos where there's a, it's really snowy, you

741
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,340
can't see, and there's a crash, and then

742
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,320
it just keeps coming because you don't see

743
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:26,960
through the snow.

744
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,340
You didn't know there was a crash in

745
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:28,820
front of you.

746
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,240
And then here comes another car.

747
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:30,560
Boom.

748
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,560
It's like these a hundred car pileups in

749
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:32,880
the snow.

750
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:33,180
Yeah.

751
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,420
They just keep hitting each other because they

752
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,500
can't see in front of themselves.

753
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,320
Yeah, exactly.

754
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,000
That's what's going on with the cancer thing.

755
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:38,740
Right.

756
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:39,580
Yeah.

757
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,440
There's nothing to cure.

758
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,080
There's nothing to, yeah.

759
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,000
So when you change your behavior, you change

760
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,580
your input and you change your environment and

761
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,980
your conditions, the cancer goes away.

762
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,540
But you sometimes, is it possible to do

763
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,060
a road?

764
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,000
What do you call it when the traffic

765
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,300
shows up to redirect traffic?

766
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,080
It's not really a road block, is it?

767
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,720
There's a term for it, an engineering term.

768
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,780
I forgot what it's called.

769
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,100
They say redirect, you know, you send police

770
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,940
out to redirect traffic and they- Yeah.

771
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,420
What is the staging called though?

772
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,800
You know, when they put the cones up

773
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,680
and the flares and they redirect, you know,

774
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,440
they do a bypass or whatever.

775
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:12,740
A diversion or a bypass.

776
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,420
Yeah, a diversion.

777
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:13,700
Yeah.

778
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,560
So imagine, can you have one that's so

779
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,260
intense that you can't clear it quickly?

780
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,220
Yeah, it's possible.

781
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,080
I've seen like around the White House when

782
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,400
they're going to do the big speeches, they

783
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,420
put these concrete piers in the road, right?

784
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,000
You can't just move those the next day.

785
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,540
They have to bring in special things, you

786
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,120
know, those concrete barriers.

787
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,900
Yeah, there's a machine that picks them up

788
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,300
and moves them.

789
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:34,880
Yeah, exactly.

790
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,960
So you can get real intense with some

791
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,940
cancers and stuff.

792
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,180
And if a cancer eats you up real

793
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,380
fast, fast acting, that just means the condition

794
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,700
that you had that caused the cancer to

795
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,700
keep you alive was so aggressive that the

796
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,660
cancer was aggressive.

797
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,540
Cancer is a countermeasure.

798
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:53,920
That's a way to put it.

799
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,140
Cancer is a countermeasure that the body puts

800
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:56,280
up.

801
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,200
It's incredible.

802
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,800
See, they can't talk about this.

803
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,220
There are people who know about this because

804
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,440
I've discussed it with some people and they're

805
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,520
like, yeah, that's exactly what it's doing.

806
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,280
So they wouldn't say, when you see their

807
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,000
eyes light up, it's like, finally, someone else

808
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,700
who can actually communicate what's going on because

809
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,740
I had a feeling, I just didn't know

810
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,720
how to communicate it, right?

811
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:16,860
When you view it that way, you can

812
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,160
actually treat the overall condition.

813
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,480
Anyway, so it's very – I shouldn't say

814
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,220
– I'm not frustrated.

815
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,500
I'm in the twilight zone, right?

816
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,960
Imagine you've seen the twilight zones, right?

817
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,840
And the victim, I called up the character

818
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,040
that the episode is focused on, the victim

819
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,860
typically, right?

820
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,000
Yeah, that's the one that's always confused or

821
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,120
going, where do I go, where do I

822
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:36,260
go?

823
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,860
Whether it's an astronaut or whatever.

824
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:44,040
It could be an entire neighborhood sometimes become

825
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,000
victim to something.

826
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,880
They don't know that they're in the twilight

827
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,960
zone, right?

828
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,400
So I know I'm in the twilight zone

829
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,900
and I'm experiencing the twilight zone, so how

830
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,900
can I be upset or frustrated about it?

831
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,500
I might sound like it because that's just

832
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,800
the way to convey the information.

833
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,960
I'm totally cool with it.

834
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:01,560
I get it.

835
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,220
The reason why that character is upset is

836
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,360
because they're looking for the normal behavior and

837
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,520
they're not getting it and they're going, why

838
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,520
is this character confused?

839
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,940
It's an episode called the twilight zone.

840
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,680
Yeah, they don't know that they're in the

841
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,480
twilight zone, right?

842
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,860
That's like a cartoon character doesn't know he's

843
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,300
just a bunch of ink drawings or pixels

844
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,420
or something, right?

845
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,180
They don't know that.

846
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,960
Supposedly, some of them do.

847
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,740
I like where the cartoon characters, where one

848
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,120
shows up with an eraser and he starts

849
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,700
erasing the other character, you know, kind of

850
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:28,900
thing.

851
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,120
Yeah, so that's what's going on.

852
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,940
Anyway, I wanted to just share that because

853
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,760
you notice a big change and Brandon Joe

854
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,820
Williams there, I don't know who I was

855
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:39,340
listening to, he's like, these motherfuckers don't know

856
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:39,720
anything.

857
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,340
They don't, and I've been saying this for

858
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,000
a long time.

859
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,060
They don't know anything.

860
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,740
Now, here's the thing for all you people

861
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,060
out there that are just trying to get

862
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:46,400
by.

863
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,900
In order to be an attorney or a

864
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,400
doctor, an accountant, a priest, you don't have

865
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,000
to know anything.

866
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,560
You just have to smell, look, and sound

867
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,560
like one of those people, right?

868
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,060
And people say, Greek, you're so smart.

869
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,860
Well, typically, my two answers to that are

870
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,080
this.

871
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,160
One is, no, I'm not smarter.

872
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,980
I'm just less dumb, maybe.

873
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,660
And the other one is, how do you

874
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,200
know I'm smart?

875
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,360
Now, I'm just not, like, sounding smart and

876
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,720
looking smart.

877
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,000
What's the difference between being smart and sounding

878
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,680
like I'm smart?

879
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,940
Well, I've never heard anybody answer that properly,

880
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:18,480
but go ahead.

881
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,080
Yeah, well, here's the thing.

882
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,760
Here's an example of someone who is totally

883
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,800
vacuous but sounds smart and appears to be

884
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,340
smart and is accepted as being smart.

885
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:30,000
You're eight college professors without exception.

886
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,220
They're all like that.

887
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,020
They're all vacuous.

888
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:35,040
Because if you actually knew the material, you

889
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,680
wouldn't be there.

890
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:38,140
You would have been fired, right?

891
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,280
Plus, I'll tell you what my experience with

892
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,260
those people is, is that they never know

893
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,420
anything outside of that material.

894
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,140
I mean, literally, they're incapable of knowing just

895
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:50,240
about anything else outside of knowing that material,

896
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:50,940
if you're lucky.

897
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,620
Well, here's the thing.

898
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,060
Let's just take a lighter approach, a more

899
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:55,840
conventional approach.

900
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,760
How many times have you heard about professors,

901
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,800
and they start doing podcasts about alternative stuff?

902
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,120
What does the university do to them?

903
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:04,780
Fires them.

904
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,580
We know one, the Arab guy.

905
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,820
The guy, he was on Veterans Today.

906
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,440
He was popular during the Arab Spring.

907
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,240
He worked for some university, and then he

908
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,340
started being pro or whatever.

909
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,160
Kevin, right?

910
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,720
Yeah, Kevin, whatever.

911
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,620
Yeah, and he speaks Arabic.

912
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:20,760
Yeah, exactly.

913
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:21,780
Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.

914
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,760
There's many professors that have been fired because

915
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,380
they said, oh, you're too political or whatever.

916
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,080
No, it's the opposite.

917
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,280
So they're all morons without exception.

918
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,220
Now, the exceptions, this is where the exceptions

919
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,540
with the doctors, dentists, all these.

920
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,560
Now, by the way, if you're going to

921
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,860
go with any of these morons, these professionals,

922
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,520
the one that is the most essential is

923
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,980
the dentist, and then, of course, anyone that's

924
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,780
going to treat an emergency, right?

925
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,100
Dentistry is very important to be close with,

926
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,720
and you have to know what you want

927
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,140
done with dentistry, by the way.

928
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,700
I've actually heard people go, had a problem

929
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,840
with a tooth, and go to a dentist

930
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,260
and ask the dentist what was wrong with

931
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:56,440
them.

932
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,360
And that was just like a comedy back

933
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:58,820
and forth.

934
00:29:59,040 --> 00:29:59,680
No, it's ridiculous.

935
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:00,800
There's no way.

936
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,540
I've got a bad tooth right now, and

937
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,600
I know what needs to be done with

938
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:03,720
it.

939
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,500
It's just that I can't see well enough

940
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,880
to do it, and therefore, I would just

941
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,240
tell them, look, you've got to clean this

942
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,960
out, and remove this, and then I'm fine,

943
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:13,580
you know?

944
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,360
Well, yeah, the extractions and all that.

945
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,680
Yeah, it's interesting how it could go.

946
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,980
But you go to one of these medical

947
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,500
morons.

948
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,300
You better know exactly what you want.

949
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,340
Pick a procedure from their manuals.

950
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,380
Pick which one you think you want, and

951
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:29,420
then tell him, review, review.

952
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,900
Because they don't know what's going on.

953
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:32,640
They really don't.

954
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,760
They appear like they do, all of them,

955
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,540
if they did know what's going on.

956
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,560
I've also had, by the way, I'll interject

957
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,920
this instead of saying if they did know

958
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,360
what's going on.

959
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,720
There are a few medical people out there,

960
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,800
and they look at the procedures and how

961
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,640
dumb the people are.

962
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,240
And they're like, this could be done better.

963
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,840
And they get reprimanded.

964
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,740
It says, we don't want you to do

965
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,140
it better.

966
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,500
We want you to do it the standard

967
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,960
accepted way is what they constantly get told.

968
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,360
That's why if you know anyone that's trying

969
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,900
to get a patent for a medical device,

970
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,620
it's like 12 years of reviewing.

971
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:04,120
Even though if it was just implemented right

972
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,560
now, it would help tons of people right

973
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:05,880
away.

974
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,460
But why do they delay it?

975
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,420
Because you're under an enemy occupation.

976
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,940
They control your medical, spiritual, accounting, blah, blah,

977
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:14,120
blah.

978
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,660
I've put up letters in the financial group

979
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:20,220
where the IRS commissioner in 1985 actually put

980
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:20,980
an internal memo.

981
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,120
He says, what we're doing is completely illegal.

982
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,240
And if anybody states so, we should comply

983
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,900
and give them back any money they paid

984
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:27,200
us.

985
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,780
I'm just paraphrasing.

986
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,200
It's two paragraphs long.

987
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:34,940
And he even says, if they do cite

988
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,900
the Constitution, what we're doing is completely illegal

989
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,780
and whatever, these are the forms they should

990
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,100
use.

991
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,320
And you should tell them to set up

992
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,440
a trust so we can send it to

993
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:41,800
the trust.

994
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,140
Because you can't send it to the same

995
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,420
entity that you've been fleecing.

996
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,820
Because what happened with the IRS and all

997
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:49,000
these other property tax and stuff, back in

998
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,960
the 50s after World War II, it was

999
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,600
1% voluntary tax.

1000
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,780
So most people said, oh, yeah, I want

1001
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,300
to help the government.

1002
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,600
I'll take 1%.

1003
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,320
You know, it's a penny.

1004
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,480
And then they started putting people in the

1005
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,340
news, like Max Schliemann, who was a boxer.

1006
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,000
They made him fight Joe Williams and he

1007
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,680
lost just to pay an IRS debt of

1008
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,220
like $10,000, which is like half a

1009
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,640
million now, right, or a quarter of a

1010
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,120
million now.

1011
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,000
And they started putting every 10 years a

1012
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,660
famous person, Willie Nelson, Helmsley, the owner of

1013
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,140
Helmsley.

1014
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,700
Then Wesley Snipes.

1015
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,760
They put them in the media.

1016
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,000
Oh, Schmeling.

1017
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,740
You're talking about Schmeling.

1018
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,280
Yeah, right, Max Schmeling.

1019
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,020
Right, right, right, right.

1020
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,680
Max Schmeling was the first one they did

1021
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,640
in the 50s, right?

1022
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,020
Right, right.

1023
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,360
Because back then it was just 1%

1024
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:28,700
tax.

1025
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,660
Oh, this IRS is no joke, man.

1026
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,900
You put all this stupid stuff.

1027
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,340
Because what happened, a whole bunch of bad

1028
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,440
actors, maybe Jewish lawyers and accountants, went in

1029
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,980
the offices and saw what they could get

1030
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:39,640
away with.

1031
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,320
And then that became a culture in the

1032
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,200
IRS or the franchise boards.

1033
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,780
You know, the United States Department of Fiscal

1034
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:51,040
Services and the Treasury are the only two

1035
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,700
people that can do anything legally.

1036
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,960
Everything else is by private contract.

1037
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,440
So what happened, a whole bunch of bad

1038
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:00,880
actors went into these agencies, your counties, your

1039
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,900
cities, your states, and started levying all these

1040
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,840
taxes and acting brutally against the people.

1041
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:05,640
And the people accepted.

1042
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:05,920
Why?

1043
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,700
Because they also controlled the media, just like

1044
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,880
an occupying force would.

1045
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,280
Another good thing is there's a couple of

1046
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:12,540
movies.

1047
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,240
I forgot something.

1048
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,100
I think State is in the title.

1049
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,700
These aliens landed on Earth and they took

1050
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,920
over all the governments and started taking, you

1051
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,660
know, they rarely show the aliens.

1052
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,180
They look like these porcupine creatures, very fast

1053
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:26,500
moving.

1054
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,020
And they still allowed, the aliens took over

1055
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,700
everything, and they still allowed like sport games

1056
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,020
and elections and all that.

1057
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,160
But when they took over, the aliens told

1058
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,640
the human media, every day in the news

1059
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,060
and the media you have to put that

1060
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:40,560
the politicians are negotiating with the aliens to

1061
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,660
make things better every day.

1062
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,560
That was in the news.

1063
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,240
But every day things got worse and worse

1064
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:45,540
and worse.

1065
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:46,860
And people are like, they're lying to us,

1066
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,260
aren't they?

1067
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,080
We got to get these fucking alien things,

1068
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:49,340
right?

1069
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,700
So that was perfect because that's exactly what's

1070
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,160
going on.

1071
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,060
They use the media.

1072
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,700
The media, by the way, is university.

1073
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,860
Here's the thing why university is bullshit, all

1074
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:57,120
of it.

1075
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,840
How can they tell you how the human

1076
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,860
body works, history or anything, in university and

1077
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,480
then counter it on the history channel on

1078
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:03,740
TV?

1079
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,980
They have to tell you what the history

1080
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:08,440
channel or the medical channel on TV is

1081
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:08,800
telling you.

1082
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,219
They all have to be synced up.

1083
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,540
So what you see, I say, why are

1084
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,980
you spending, why are you saving for college?

1085
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:14,699
Just watch TV.

1086
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:15,840
It's the same stuff.

1087
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:17,840
Oh, but you don't get a degree.

1088
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,440
Oh my gosh, you don't get it, do

1089
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:19,620
you?

1090
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:20,480
Right?

1091
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,840
So when have you gone and looked at

1092
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,320
university textbooks, any subject, and look at what

1093
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,040
they show about those subjects on TV and

1094
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,380
they differ?

1095
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:27,820
When?

1096
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:28,380
Never.

1097
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:29,280
It's the same.

1098
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,260
So skip the university, save the small fortune,

1099
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,420
and watch television.

1100
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,679
You'll be just as smart.

1101
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:37,600
I'm telling you.

1102
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,040
And there's nobody saying this.

1103
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,780
Anyway, I'm going to, I sound like I'm

1104
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,840
on a soapbox yelling at everyone, which I

1105
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,060
am.

1106
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,920
Any other questions?

1107
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:46,260
Oh, yeah, okay.

1108
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,860
I've got a couple of comments and things

1109
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:48,060
here.

1110
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:48,659
Let's see.

1111
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:49,840
All right.

1112
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,880
Greek mentioned in 204 about looking through, quote,

1113
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,280
notes when he couldn't find a missing part.

1114
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,920
I know of dream journals, but he's mentioned

1115
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,380
making sure he can see individuals' mouths moving.

1116
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:04,640
Being a dream walker and fixing his attention

1117
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,560
on items to verify that he's not in

1118
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,780
a dream state.

1119
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,140
Is note-taking part of that process to

1120
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:14,460
catch the system messing with you, or was

1121
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,920
that just a side commentary?

1122
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,960
No, I think note-taking, well, here's the

1123
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,140
thing.

1124
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:21,160
If you're really good, like the Terminator, if

1125
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,120
you see the Terminator movies, his point of

1126
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,640
view, he's taking notes because, you know, when

1127
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,700
they give you the Terminator's point of view,

1128
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:28,480
you see the red letters line up, and

1129
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,280
he's always choosing the targets as targeted.

1130
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,040
You know, the Terminator's point of view in

1131
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,560
the movie, the Terminator was Schwarzenegger and whatever.

1132
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,780
Yeah, if you're really good, you don't need

1133
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,800
to write it down, right?

1134
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,820
If you're really good with that.

1135
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,040
But I suggest writing things down to memorialize

1136
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,360
them for others, because let's say you can

1137
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,080
internalize all the notes and be a really

1138
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,980
good note-taker and have an indelible memory

1139
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:47,540
and all that.

1140
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,860
If you tell someone what you took notes

1141
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:53,060
on and still have those notes mentally from

1142
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,280
a year ago, they won't believe you.

1143
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,060
But if you have it on paper, you

1144
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,360
can share that with them, right?

1145
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,480
Mm-hmm.

1146
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,880
And you can date that and say, here's

1147
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,460
my...

1148
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,420
It's called memorialization.

1149
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,180
So for memorialization, write things down as much

1150
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:04,620
as you can.

1151
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,320
I've heard of people go through dream journals

1152
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,400
and stuff, and they wake up in the

1153
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,320
middle of the night, and they look, and

1154
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,400
they write right away, you know, before they

1155
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,820
forget it, you know, in their dream journal,

1156
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,740
right in the middle of the night.

1157
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,760
Yeah, you can have that.

1158
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,840
But you have to discern, you know, the

1159
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:21,140
dreams that we consider conventional dreams are done

1160
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:21,840
by tricksters.

1161
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,880
The travel, you know, the reason why we

1162
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,760
sleep, you know, the excuses for the physical

1163
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,540
body recovery.

1164
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,740
Yes, what is it, a week or ten

1165
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,900
days without sleep, you die.

1166
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:30,400
Right.

1167
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,680
But we're being used.

1168
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,040
It's a very efficient universe.

1169
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,680
We're being used while we sleep somewhere else.

1170
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,160
We're being plugged.

1171
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,260
Because our consciousness is not really in our

1172
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:42,640
body, but our consciousness in this realm relies

1173
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,600
a body, right?

1174
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,060
Because if you kill the body, stop the

1175
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,300
body, the consciousness goes off.

1176
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,360
It's like unplugging the TV or removing the

1177
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,500
screen from the TV.

1178
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,320
You know, maybe it's still playing, but no

1179
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,500
one can see it, right?

1180
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:58,200
So I would say journaling is very important,

1181
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,440
if that would be the crux of the

1182
00:36:59,440 --> 00:36:59,800
question.

1183
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,240
Absolutely.

1184
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,220
Taking notes and seeing what's real or not.

1185
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,420
But I don't think we're allowed to objectify

1186
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,140
too much here.

1187
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,940
That's why I go along with it.

1188
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,100
Make some, what do you call it, snap

1189
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,900
judgments in your life about everything, and then

1190
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,100
remember what those quick judgments were, and then

1191
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,280
follow through and see if that judgment was

1192
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,620
valid, because that will help you to make

1193
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,440
quick decisions and things like that.

1194
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,380
Because you're going to need that.

1195
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,180
If you wake up from a dream, it's

1196
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,040
very rare that you remember all the details

1197
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,520
much later, right?

1198
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,120
Right.

1199
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,300
So work on your memory and all that,

1200
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,140
and a quick judgment on what that was

1201
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:31,480
about.

1202
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,280
Absolutely.

1203
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,740
That's a good way to look at it.

1204
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,020
Okay.

1205
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,540
Interesting side note on the blockchain.

1206
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,600
Your, quote, signature, end quote, is used to

1207
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,880
validate the transaction.

1208
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:48,120
It's digital consent in this consent-based terrarium,

1209
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,900
is what this comment is.

1210
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,260
Yeah, but it's more than that.

1211
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,620
The signature is your gold.

1212
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,720
The signature, imagine, like, if there was lawful

1213
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,440
money, in order to create or complete a

1214
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,620
transaction, you drop a silver coin or some

1215
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,380
gold or a note for gold or silver.

1216
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,600
That's what your signature is.

1217
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,620
But you're not told that, right?

1218
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,820
That's the most incredible theft.

1219
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,740
I was in Walmart the other day, and

1220
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,280
people were talking about how prices are going

1221
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:11,420
up.

1222
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,960
No, the prices are going up because the

1223
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,140
money is worth less.

1224
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,180
So that means you have to work more

1225
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,960
to get the same stuff because you're working

1226
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,700
for that money.

1227
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,820
If you didn't work for that money, you

1228
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,920
wouldn't view the prices as going up, right?

1229
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,940
Because your labor is either getting shittier or

1230
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,040
the money is being devalued when the labor

1231
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:31,580
is still good.

1232
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,360
So that means you're being ripped off, right?

1233
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,780
So if your labor is just as good

1234
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,880
as it was a year ago and your

1235
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,580
paycheck hasn't changed and you have to spend

1236
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,040
more of it to get the same stuff,

1237
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:43,040
you're being stolen from, right?

1238
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,380
So it's all theft.

1239
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,660
And also you can't save money in a

1240
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:50,140
credit-based economy because let's say it was

1241
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:53,460
1950 and you had a time machine and

1242
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,980
you said, when I get to the year

1243
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:57,880
2004, let's say, I'm going to take this

1244
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,620
$2,000 so I could buy a brand

1245
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,360
new car.

1246
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:00,900
Yeah.

1247
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,680
But you show up in 2004 and you

1248
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,720
walk in with $2,000, you can't even

1249
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,800
buy the tires maybe.

1250
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,720
You'll put a down payment on it, they'll

1251
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,100
tell you.

1252
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,600
Yeah, you can put a down payment, right.

1253
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,660
Yeah, which is illegal anyway.

1254
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,300
It's either all cash or all credit.

1255
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,240
There's no down payments.

1256
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:14,960
But no one's arguing.

1257
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,720
The banks are paying off the politicians to

1258
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,360
never talk about the money system.

1259
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,660
That's what they're paying the politicians off for.

1260
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,280
So when Nancy Pelosi goes in on, what

1261
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,920
is it, $180,000, $280,000 a year

1262
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,420
for a senator and she comes out worth

1263
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:32,500
$80 million, it's because she's been paid by

1264
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,960
the bankers or enriched by the bankers not

1265
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,780
to talk about the money.

1266
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,200
And they don't.

1267
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,140
They never talk about the money.

1268
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,140
Remember the smart people?

1269
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:39,740
They sound smart.

1270
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,040
The government sounds like they're being fiscally responsible

1271
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,280
but they're not at all.

1272
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,160
That's what they're being paid and bribed and

1273
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,500
whatever not to talk about, right.

1274
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,620
And it's not up to them.

1275
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,060
That's why whenever you bring an argument up,

1276
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,640
like, for example, when someone sued Fox News

1277
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,980
for libel a long time ago and the

1278
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,420
court, they threw it out because the judge

1279
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,260
says they're an entertainment company, they can't libel

1280
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:00,600
you.

1281
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,780
Well, actually, the defense attorney said it and

1282
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,160
the judge accepted it.

1283
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:05,860
That's what happened.

1284
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,260
Oh, his own side did it.

1285
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,320
His own side did it, yeah.

1286
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,960
Or actually, the defense attorney.

1287
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,920
Okay, so not the plaintiff, the defendant did

1288
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,020
it.

1289
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,760
Yeah, so basically it got thrown out based

1290
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,700
on, yeah.

1291
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,420
Yeah, basically they said defend this and they

1292
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,020
said, well, we can't because we're an entertainment

1293
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:21,760
company anyway.

1294
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,460
And boom, the judge agreed.

1295
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,200
Yeah, they're an entertainment company, so what are

1296
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:25,560
you going to do?

1297
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,680
And that's what the university says.

1298
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,260
We don't have a duty to educate you.

1299
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:32,080
We provide a credit system and we find

1300
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,160
that you have appropriate credits.

1301
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,280
The trustees, if you look at diploma, the

1302
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,140
trustees believe that you have enough credits to

1303
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:37,700
get this degree.

1304
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,780
There's no education in there at all.

1305
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,480
Well, whatever, learning.

1306
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,500
Yeah, it's really sad.

1307
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,180
And the thing is, I've known this for

1308
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:48,220
decades, decades with a capital D.

1309
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:51,260
I've known this, but it's important to reiterate

1310
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:51,500
it.

1311
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,880
I've noticed a lot of the new subs

1312
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,640
and people that have been communicating lately are

1313
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,780
in their 20s and 30s.

1314
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,160
And they haven't been rubbed down with this

1315
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:58,640
kind of stuff.

1316
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,560
You know when you get a good rub

1317
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,740
down, you remember it, right?

1318
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:01,240
Yep.

1319
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,500
Whatever you want to call it, whatever body

1320
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,060
part, whatever.

1321
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,380
So they haven't been rubbed down with this

1322
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,680
and they're not going to get this anywhere

1323
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,140
else at all because it's a planet full

1324
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:11,540
of idiots.

1325
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,400
Anyway, what else you got?

1326
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,120
There you go.

1327
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,180
Okay, last thing is, as far as what

1328
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,840
came first, the chicken or the egg, unless

1329
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,960
the chicken was the first animal to lay

1330
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,280
an egg, the egg came first is what

1331
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,000
this person said.

1332
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,100
Well, you could say that, but it's not

1333
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:28,820
the same egg.

1334
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,600
It's a different type of egg because that

1335
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,540
egg requires a chicken to make it.

1336
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,940
So they come at the same time.

1337
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:37,760
Like, for example, they come at the same

1338
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,680
time or the chicken comes first and the

1339
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,680
intent of the chicken.

1340
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:42,560
That's why when they say, why did the

1341
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,460
chicken cross the road?

1342
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,920
I said, that's not, don't have to ask

1343
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,680
that because who can question the intent of

1344
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,080
a chicken?

1345
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,900
So it's all based on intent.

1346
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:52,060
So what I'm saying here is very simple.

1347
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,300
They came at the same time.

1348
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,880
It's just like when you buy a car

1349
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,140
and you open the trunk and you see

1350
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,940
a depression for a spare tire and in

1351
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:01,300
that depression of the sheet metal for the

1352
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,840
spare tire, there is a spare tire, which

1353
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,540
came first.

1354
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,440
And it was all made together.

1355
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:05,920
Right.

1356
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:07,020
Right?

1357
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,040
It was all made together.

1358
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,240
It was made to repopulate.

1359
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:10,780
Right?

1360
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,300
So that's where the creation aspect comes in

1361
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,760
and that creation vessel or whatever.

1362
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,100
Yeah.

1363
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,500
And then it goes into what an atom

1364
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:18,820
is.

1365
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,340
You know, it's all frequency and energy.

1366
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:22,200
It was all set up at the same

1367
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:22,520
time.

1368
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,680
Evolution is easy to bust because like a

1369
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,880
giraffe evolved a long neck.

1370
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,500
Well, you had to evolve a trachea, you

1371
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,040
had to evolve this, this, this, this, and

1372
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,140
that, and a heart all at the same

1373
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:32,600
time.

1374
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:33,000
Right.

1375
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:34,020
Right.

1376
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,700
And if those things weren't set up for

1377
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,980
a long neck, the neck wouldn't have gotten

1378
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:39,720
longer.

1379
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:40,500
Right?

1380
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:44,460
So anyway, so yeah, the trick is most

1381
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,440
of the cliches and paradoxes we put in

1382
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,600
front of us are idiot questions.

1383
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:49,200
In other words, they're so simple, but we're

1384
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,980
trained to see who's conditioned to say there's

1385
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:52,820
no answer for that.

1386
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,400
When they're all answerable, all of them.

1387
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:57,660
And a basic on human physiology is that

1388
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,240
women are born with all of the, you

1389
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,680
know, what they casually call an egg, but

1390
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,300
it's an ovum.

1391
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,620
They're born with all of them to begin

1392
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:04,180
with.

1393
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,260
Pretty much.

1394
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:05,500
Yeah.

1395
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:09,400
Most studies will show that you come fully,

1396
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,260
fully packed.

1397
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,080
Yeah.

1398
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:12,420
Yeah.

1399
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,280
The weird thing is that one of the

1400
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,480
pieces that ends up becoming you, one of

1401
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,140
the very little pieces that ends up becoming

1402
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:21,700
you was actually inside the body of your

1403
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:22,620
grandmother at one point.

1404
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:24,700
It's just so simple.

1405
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,280
You know?

1406
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:26,560
Yeah.

1407
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:29,560
I mean, it's, yeah, we're not, this is

1408
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:34,140
like what they call first principle stuff, pure

1409
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:34,660
objectification.

1410
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,980
You know, how do you tell cartoon characters

1411
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:41,660
that they're actually pixels on a screen and

1412
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,900
they're just code that's being projected through some

1413
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:46,760
chips that are animating, you know, the screen?

1414
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,900
It's really hard to objectify that.

1415
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,220
You know, they don't want to hear that.

1416
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,420
And even if you wanted to hear it,

1417
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,500
no one's going to say it.

1418
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,380
And even if someone, it's done in a

1419
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,280
way that we can't really talk about pure

1420
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,160
objectification.

1421
00:43:59,800 --> 00:43:59,900
Yeah.

1422
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:01,860
There you go.

1423
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,480
So that's the end of all my questions.

1424
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,440
Anything else you want to cover?

1425
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:08,480
No, I mean, I think today was kind

1426
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,600
of like a retrosonic going back to more

1427
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,900
of the stuff that I talked about a

1428
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,360
long time ago and reaffirming it.

1429
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,240
Fair enough.
