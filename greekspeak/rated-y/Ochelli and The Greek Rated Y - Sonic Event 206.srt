1
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,100
Why Sonic Event 206?

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,180
You know, I tried to shut off teams

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,800
and the damn thing won't shut off.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,760
But anyway, you don't care about that.

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,760
And the Greek doesn't care about that.

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,760
Anyway, Greek, how are you this evening?

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,520
I'm sorry I didn't make it last time.

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,960
We should have gotten together, but quite frankly,

9
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,960
I was sitting here with no power in

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,500
the area till like the morning.

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,480
So a little break.

12
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:30,620
Everyone got a break.

13
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:31,160
Yeah.

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,740
But anyway, sorry about that.

15
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,620
Here we are again.

16
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,880
I do have some questions and stuff.

17
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,180
But before we go there, I know I

18
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,780
already mentioned this to you, but let's go

19
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,140
into it.

20
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,700
This is weird.

21
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,340
Facebook.

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,680
There's apparently a Greek speak Facebook page.

23
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,420
And I asked the listener to please provide

24
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,280
me with a link, but I can't find

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,100
it because it's just, you know.

26
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,640
Yeah, I wanted to get away from Greek

27
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,240
speak because I want I get it.

28
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,280
It's probably Sam, but it's spelled double E,

29
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:04,060
double E, right?

30
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,100
Not EA, not EEA.

31
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,380
So well, I have to imagine it because

32
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,240
I can't find it.

33
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,160
And the A.I., of course, rearranges it.

34
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,140
So it's spelled properly.

35
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,120
And then what you get is Greek speaking

36
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,480
nurses.

37
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,840
Do you want to date a Greek speaking

38
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,220
woman?

39
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,180
Do you want to learn how to speak

40
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:18,520
Greek?

41
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,920
It's all about that.

42
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,180
Yeah, it's kind of.

43
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:21,420
Yeah.

44
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,280
Yeah.

45
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,040
But the thing is, the whole reason I

46
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,580
started speaking back in 2010 on talk show

47
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,420
and before that, but I remember I was

48
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,860
regular on that was to get it to

49
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,840
get other people.

50
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:35,780
Yeah.

51
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,400
To get other people down with this info

52
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,800
and have their own platform and do whatever

53
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,520
they wanted just to get it started.

54
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,400
And no one can carry the information that

55
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,020
I talk about.

56
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,800
No one, whether it's biblical stuff, medical stuff,

57
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:51,820
technical stuff.

58
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,640
It's crazy.

59
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:53,860
Yeah.

60
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,640
There's some people that go deeper and more

61
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,280
specialized, but the general stuff, I mean, oh,

62
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,840
my God, is it that bad here?

63
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,560
I think it is.

64
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,640
I was just talking to someone earlier about

65
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,200
traveling.

66
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,720
I was like, oh, man, I don't I

67
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,560
don't need to.

68
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,280
If I knew I could spend the rest

69
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,580
of my life within 500 feet from where

70
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,160
I am right now, I'm totally cool.

71
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,840
There is no reason I don't need to

72
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,140
see anything anymore.

73
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,780
I mean, I've seen it all in that

74
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,180
area.

75
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,860
And that area provides you with everything.

76
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,660
And that area provides you with everything of

77
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,620
quality that you want.

78
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,500
Yeah, absolutely.

79
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,000
Well, it doesn't matter where you go.

80
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,840
It's just slightly different.

81
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,460
Now, if I had really like the personal

82
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,520
preference, you know, when you go to a

83
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,700
bar and they don't have the liquor you

84
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:32,980
want.

85
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,300
Right.

86
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,540
This is not the liquor I want.

87
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,200
The liquor I want would be living on

88
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,280
the California coast, you know, like in the

89
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,620
Long Beach, Orange County area, where it's always

90
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,040
between 55 and 85 degrees.

91
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:45,820
You know, 70.

92
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,980
The mean temperature is 75 degrees.

93
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,100
California would be the best place because when

94
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,900
I had a place there 10 years ago

95
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:58,840
off of Santa Monica Boulevard on Romaine, it

96
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,000
was there in June and I was like,

97
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,100
when is it going to get summertime here?

98
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,300
It was like spring weather like this is

99
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,180
this is summer.

100
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,940
Then I was out there in December and

101
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,440
I was like, when is winter coming?

102
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,280
And they're like, this is winter.

103
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,300
I was like, holy shit.

104
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,480
See, I love the Northeast for the change.

105
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,700
I liked the change.

106
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,620
I like the fact that the summer was

107
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,240
special, you know, and and then in the

108
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,480
winter, everything slows down.

109
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,460
I like that.

110
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,080
I could see when I was younger, I

111
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,480
enjoyed the snow and all that.

112
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,580
I got into some snow sports and stuff

113
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,860
like when snowboarding first, first, first came out

114
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,040
like the first snowboard.

115
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,340
Right.

116
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,000
But no, I wasn't about the sports or

117
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,260
anything.

118
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,120
You enjoyed sports.

119
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,560
I enjoyed the flow of life changing because,

120
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,820
frankly, everything slows down, like I said.

121
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,060
Right.

122
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,560
And it gets dark at a different time

123
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,540
and people's attitudes change.

124
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,120
You know what I mean?

125
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,640
The flow of life literally changes, especially along

126
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,360
the like, say, the Jersey Shore, which is.

127
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,020
Yeah, it's nice.

128
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,380
I've gone on winter walks on boardwalks in

129
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:55,720
the winter.

130
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,660
It's kind of neat.

131
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,300
No one's there.

132
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,600
It's cold, chilly, crisp.

133
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,200
Exactly.

134
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,920
In the winter, you have places like that

135
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,660
to yourself.

136
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,220
Right.

137
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,180
And you don't have all these annoying people.

138
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,560
You know, we used to call them.

139
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,740
I'm sure you heard the term before.

140
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,240
Benny's in Jersey.

141
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:08,560
Right.

142
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,940
Because they came from Bayonne, Elizabeth.

143
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,620
We had bridge and tunnel people because I

144
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,260
was in New York.

145
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:13,660
Right.

146
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,899
That's that's the that's in the opposite direction.

147
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,740
People coming from Jersey to New York bridge

148
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,459
and tunnel crowd.

149
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:20,779
Right.

150
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,340
But but that's the thing.

151
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,320
I liked the flow that changed because it

152
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:25,780
changed.

153
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,600
But, you know, remember at one point when

154
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,080
life on Earth was ideal, there were no

155
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:31,480
seasons.

156
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:32,560
No.

157
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,200
So that's just a way to look at

158
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:34,300
it.

159
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:34,860
But that's fine.

160
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,340
Anyway, what do you got?

161
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,400
I know there was some stuff in the

162
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,060
chat, by the way.

163
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,180
I put in some comments.

164
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,040
Someone's freaking out about the voices.

165
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:41,460
Right.

166
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,400
And they are real.

167
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,100
It's just that when you notice it.

168
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,360
Right.

169
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,760
It's like it's I wouldn't call it hypersensitivity.

170
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,700
I think if everyone was sensitive to it,

171
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,580
we wouldn't be in the situation we are

172
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,760
right now with really anything.

173
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,980
Well, we're in a battle zone.

174
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,100
You got to be a warrior here.

175
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,280
This is not a good place.

176
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,100
This is a shithole and it's always been

177
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:00,600
a shithole.

178
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,940
And when it gets really good, they destroy

179
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,560
the whole thing.

180
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:03,860
Right.

181
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,920
So I don't know what's supposed to be

182
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,940
after this to positively like I could report

183
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,740
back like Woody Allen said of dying was

184
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,140
so bad.

185
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,620
How come no one's come back to complain?

186
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:14,560
Right.

187
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,860
I'm not saying that.

188
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,460
I don't know.

189
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,920
But this I know what I know for

190
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,260
sure.

191
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,340
It's a shithole here.

192
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,280
And man always does.

193
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,480
That's called the fecal touch.

194
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,380
You know, the Midas touch.

195
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,500
Well, there's a fecal touch.

196
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,000
Anything that's actually turned to shit.

197
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,900
That's just the way it's been.

198
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,440
Always.

199
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,220
Always.

200
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,080
Like, for example, the same people that are

201
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,320
running the Lincoln that ran the Lincoln assassination

202
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:34,560
ran.

203
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,100
So running stuff right now with the with

204
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,180
the covid and 9-11 and Kennedy, you

205
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,680
know, like here's an example.

206
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,940
When Kennedy was assassinated that night.

207
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:44,760
Right.

208
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,440
Seward.

209
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,680
You know, Seward's folly.

210
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,840
He was the secretary of state.

211
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,380
He there was an attempt made on his

212
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,000
life the same night in New York City.

213
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,100
And also an attempt on Johnson, who was

214
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,580
the vice president.

215
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,260
You said Kennedy and they called it off.

216
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,880
Kennedy or say Lincoln.

217
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,540
You said Kennedy, but you meant Lincoln.

218
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,220
And yeah, there was a massive plot not

219
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:08,420
only against Lincoln, but against Johnson, against Seward

220
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,260
and against other cabinet members and some of

221
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,060
the other cabinet members.

222
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,740
The guys just walked away and chickened out,

223
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,200
by the way.

224
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,520
And people found out about it later.

225
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,640
Yeah, that's right.

226
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,460
So that group that did it was like

227
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,240
the Knights of the Golden Dawn, some people

228
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,600
say.

229
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:20,840
Right.

230
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,720
Some others say it was this organization, Freemasonic.

231
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,820
Which is why which is why I keep

232
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,680
a photograph, by the way, of like five

233
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,000
co-conspirators that were hung over it, because

234
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,240
everybody says they're all patsies, I'm sure.

235
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,500
Well, yeah, but it is as an example

236
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,940
that, you know, the idea.

237
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,320
Because if you ask anybody that you know

238
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,740
who killed Lincoln, they go, well, John Wilkes

239
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:40,980
Booth.

240
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:41,640
That's it.

241
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,840
No, no.

242
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,000
But that's what they said.

243
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,560
Ralph Epperson did some research who's buried.

244
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,960
That's supposed to be John Wilkes Booth is

245
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,980
not John Wilkes Booth.

246
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,800
He lived to change his name and became

247
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,820
a senator, allegedly.

248
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,360
Yeah, that's one of Epperson's pieces of work

249
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,560
that I actually enjoy.

250
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:58,340
Yeah.

251
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,420
And Epperson, by the way, lives about, I

252
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,260
don't know, about six blocks away from me.

253
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,620
He's still alive.

254
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,880
He eats hamburgers and drinks milk every day.

255
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,320
That's what his diet is.

256
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,820
Which is wild to me, because, I mean,

257
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,260
this guy was around, like, you know, doing

258
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,580
shortwave radio with Phil Cooper, you know?

259
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,280
Yeah, yeah.

260
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,480
He was around in the 60s and 70s.

261
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,560
His first books were in way a long

262
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:18,920
time ago.

263
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,080
I think he's pushing 90 now.

264
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,480
90, yeah.

265
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,820
He's got to be.

266
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,860
He was filming.

267
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,680
I was speaking at the breakfast club here

268
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,440
in Tucson, and they would videotape it.

269
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,620
It was funny, once I was at the

270
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,380
Elkhorn Mall, and these teenagers run up to

271
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,100
me and say, Oh, wow, look, it's Stelios.

272
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,700
Oh, oh, I got to tell my dad.

273
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,560
I'm like, what the hell?

274
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,260
These teenagers know who I am and know

275
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,020
their name, and they got to tell their

276
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,960
dad, like, I'm being accused of something here

277
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,440
with children?

278
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,440
What the fuck?

279
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:51,280
Right?

280
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,040
So they go and get their dad.

281
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,520
He has a minivan similar to, like, the

282
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,320
one I'm driving, because I always like driving

283
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,880
minivans or using minivans.

284
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,920
And he says, I got to meet my

285
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,520
dad because he's a big fan of yours.

286
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,500
He stays up late to watch you on

287
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,380
TV because they would play Public Access.

288
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,720
Ralph Epperson's, he had, like, a little channel

289
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,700
on Public Access TV, and I did about

290
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,380
four or five episodes standing up and speaking

291
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,120
on various things.

292
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:17,960
And I had just gotten it.

293
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,620
We're talking 2002, 2003.

294
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,840
And, you know, we're a population of half

295
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,760
a million people here.

296
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,840
They watch Public Access.

297
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,360
I didn't know I was that popular.

298
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,080
You know, they recognized me, and it was

299
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,380
fun.

300
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,039
People were still actively using VHS to record

301
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:31,539
you, probably.

302
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,580
Yeah, it was VHS, and I have them

303
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:33,940
somewhere.

304
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,520
I have the stack of VHS tapes of

305
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:35,880
all that.

306
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,000
And I used to speak publicly before the

307
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,620
radio, you know, or the Internet.

308
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,420
Well, remember the American Freedom Radio days, he

309
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,200
always made a point, Danny, of saying it's

310
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,120
not a podcast, it's radio, right?

311
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,400
Because it was live and this and that,

312
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:49,620
right?

313
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:55,740
Yeah, so I'm very well acquainted with Ralph

314
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,960
Epperson and his ideas.

315
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,420
He's kind of stuck, though.

316
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:03,100
You know, he researches enough to uphold the

317
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,420
direction that he wants to go, but he

318
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,700
doesn't want to go outside of that.

319
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:06,780
Oh, right.

320
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,660
No, he probably hasn't done an original piece

321
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,100
of research in 25 years.

322
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,280
I mean, he stopped.

323
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,320
He definitely stopped.

324
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,100
I mean, I had conversations with him about

325
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,300
ten years ago, and people were amazed I

326
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,080
could even find him.

327
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,620
I think I might have gotten in touch

328
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,900
with him around then when we were doing

329
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,580
the ONG.

330
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,820
I asked him if he wanted to come

331
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,040
on.

332
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,040
He says, ah, get my books, get my

333
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,380
books.

334
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,020
Yeah, of course.

335
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:26,560
E.

336
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,720
Plouby is publishing.

337
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:28,280
Right.

338
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,220
Right?

339
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:29,780
E.

340
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,600
Plouby is publishing.

341
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,840
Yeah, and actually I lost my copy of,

342
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,780
what is it, The Hidden Hand?

343
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,000
That was the one that put him on

344
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,400
the map.

345
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:36,740
Yeah.

346
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,480
The sort of anti-Freemason.

347
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,100
Yeah, I wish I still had that, actually.

348
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,360
I don't have a copy anymore.

349
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,540
Anyway, so yeah, no, Epperson's a cool guy,

350
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,680
but it's interesting, he ends up in Arizona

351
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,400
anyway, you know, in that area.

352
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,200
Yeah, he was not originally from here, I

353
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,240
think, but he ends up here.

354
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,600
Yeah, I think he's a Midwest boy.

355
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,780
Right, and Jordan Maxwell spent a lot of

356
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,600
his life there, too.

357
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,900
I mean, I know you got your views

358
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,380
on Jordan or whatever, but you know he

359
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:00,480
meant well.

360
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,460
His manager, Ivy West, who I would cook

361
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,660
dinner for, she'd stay over here where I

362
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,840
live, in the house that I live in.

363
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,120
I remember where she came back from, Egypt

364
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,260
and all that, back in the day, talking

365
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,780
about all the underground cities that are near

366
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,540
the pyramid there.

367
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,020
You know, they're pumping the water out for

368
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,840
like 20 years, and they have another 10

369
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,520
years of pumping and ground radar.

370
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,300
So Ivy West was his manager and all

371
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:20,440
that.

372
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,100
Yeah, but when he split from everybody, he

373
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,040
was like living in, I think, what was

374
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,280
it, Flagstaff or whatever?

375
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,700
You're talking about Jordan Maxwell, his dying days

376
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,300
was with Jeff Rents, I think.

377
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,020
No, no, no, no, his dying days, no,

378
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,020
that's not correct.

379
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,260
He was staying with a guy, and I

380
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,700
knew the guy and everything, it was the

381
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,520
whole thing.

382
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,940
But he was living in Arizona previous to

383
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,880
that, just before he got really, really sick.

384
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,500
Oh, okay, okay, but I know that Jeff

385
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,720
Rents was his son, so I think he

386
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,540
had a heart surgery.

387
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,760
I think then Jeff Rents was, yeah, okay.

388
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,180
Yeah, no, back when he had the heart

389
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,920
surgery, right, but the last, like, you know,

390
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,260
the killing strokes and heart attacks and whatever

391
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:57,860
that took him.

392
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,280
Yeah, but I've had several conversations with him

393
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,100
going back and forth.

394
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,220
You can't say the Son of God is

395
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,620
the sun in the sky, that's not in

396
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,700
the Bible at all.

397
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,020
Right.

398
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,940
And it only works in English.

399
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,640
It doesn't work in the languages of preservation,

400
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:12,240
right?

401
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,440
That's like saying television is telling lies on

402
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:14,880
your vision.

403
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,440
Well, you could say that, but it's not

404
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,180
what it is.

405
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,880
Well, it is doing that, right, and it

406
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,480
is a solar deity that the Christians are

407
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:22,600
doing.

408
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,520
It's very confusing.

409
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,980
I always corner him on what he talked

410
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,420
about the Bible.

411
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,680
He always agreed with me, but he would

412
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,000
never come back and change what he talked

413
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,220
about.

414
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,380
He mixed the Bible with Christianity.

415
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,740
I said there's nothing biblical about Christianity, zero.

416
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,100
I haven't found anything biblical in Christianity at

417
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:40,540
all.

418
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,600
Other than the general time, you know, maybe

419
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,600
several millennia ago in the general area of

420
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,220
Southwest Asia, known as the Middle East.

421
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,280
That's about it.

422
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,240
See, the only way to make that transposition

423
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,560
of English defensible is in that he claims

424
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,020
that the English language was actually derived as

425
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,060
a designer language in order to be the

426
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,240
ultimate control mechanism.

427
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,400
So obviously they would build these things into

428
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,400
the language itself.

429
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,720
Of course.

430
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,820
Well, anyone who knows German and can learn

431
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,860
English very quickly.

432
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,280
If you know Greek, you can learn a

433
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,020
lot of technical.

434
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,800
If you know English, you know about a

435
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,780
hundred, if not more, less than common phrases,

436
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,060
suffixes, and prefixes in Greek, right?

437
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,440
Bottom line is if you know Spanish and

438
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,480
German, you can speak English, period.

439
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,680
Yeah, and technically it would be Greek.

440
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,760
But if you do something like, 안녕하세요.

441
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:31,620
반갑습니다.

442
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,400
좀밖에 한글을 합니다.

443
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,160
That doesn't transfer very well.

444
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,200
It's Korean, by the way.

445
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,980
Yeah, that's the missing element there.

446
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,180
The Asian languages don't fit at all.

447
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,980
Yeah, they don't like the Asians.

448
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,660
The Western power structure.

449
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,340
But it's the same power structure that's in

450
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,420
place right now that's behind calling the shots

451
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,800
mostly and implementing like on the ground level.

452
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,580
They're like the kapos.

453
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,900
They're not the boss.

454
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,980
They're kapos, you know, the kapos.

455
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,680
Because they can still get caught.

456
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,720
The boss will never get caught.

457
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,120
So they're the ones all the way from

458
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,120
the Lincoln assassination all the way to COVID.

459
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,720
It's the same people, the same like lineage.

460
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,660
Well, just like you see everything boiled down

461
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,180
to, like I tell you the five corporations

462
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,700
that control the media, the five corporations that

463
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,840
control your food, the five corporations that control

464
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,300
the medicine.

465
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,780
Well, quite honestly, there's five families that control

466
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:25,980
everything.

467
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,480
And, you know, that's it.

468
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,560
Well, you could say that.

469
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,240
If you can even say five families, they're

470
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:33,900
still kapos.

471
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:34,680
No, we don't.

472
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,580
I believe it goes up to a pyramid

473
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,480
structure, to a small council.

474
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,960
Probably a small council would be 50 to

475
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,760
100 that control the earth, and they vote,

476
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,560
and they have a chancellor.

477
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,440
Because you always have to have a fulcrum,

478
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,080
a pivot point.

479
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,400
You know, every council has to have a

480
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:52,940
head, right?

481
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,060
You know, the guy with the gavel.

482
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,280
When everybody starts getting rowdy, you know what

483
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:56,480
I mean?

484
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,080
Well, you always got the chairman, and then

485
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,940
you got the vice chairman.

486
00:13:59,160 --> 00:13:59,520
You know what I mean?

487
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,840
Take a look at what they do in

488
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,860
Congress, where you get screwed, obviously.

489
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,340
And I always like that about Jordan when

490
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:04,880
he brings that up.

491
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,040
No, no, no.

492
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,040
I kind of like Congress.

493
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:10,140
See, they create a – no, because if

494
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,420
you read the consumer protection laws, man, if

495
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,400
you – I mean, even the Federal Reserve

496
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,200
Act, you know.

497
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,960
I mean, I'm not against the Federal Reserve.

498
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:19,860
They spilled the beans.

499
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:20,480
They don't care.

500
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,700
It's up to you, they tell you.

501
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,320
If you know anyone that's high up in

502
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,840
the Federal Reserve, you know, it's up to

503
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,480
you guys, man.

504
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,020
We – you know, this is how it's

505
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,500
set up, and if you don't like it,

506
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,260
talk to Congress.

507
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,520
They're the ones that approved it.

508
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,020
You know, even though we threatened all their

509
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,420
families, you know, if they didn't, publicly.

510
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,500
I mean, not privately.

511
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,660
But, I mean, Federal Reserve Act, Section 16,

512
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,140
Part 2, around there, says that an application

513
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:46,440
for Federal Reserve notes requires a collateral security

514
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,440
like an application.

515
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,720
The application must have the amount requested for.

516
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,560
I'm just paraphrasing.

517
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,880
So that's why when you look at people

518
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,080
now being refused for loans, it doesn't matter.

519
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,420
Like 42 percent of all mortgages are denied,

520
00:14:59,500 --> 00:14:59,700
right?

521
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,580
Right now people are trying to get construction

522
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,300
loans and stuff.

523
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,720
Well, you know, the company who denied you,

524
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,420
the financier, actually got the full amount and

525
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,660
interest on it.

526
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,980
Go hold their feet.

527
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,300
That's why I tell people, like Manson says,

528
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,080
quit your job, man.

529
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:13,940
Just go apply.

530
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,880
I mean, I think even around 2015, I

531
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,620
was saying all you got to do is

532
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,880
fill out applications, man.

533
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,420
Be patient.

534
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,940
Live with your moms if you have to.

535
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,080
Fill out applications and then go collect.

536
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,460
It takes about a year, maybe two years.

537
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,380
But you can generate, I don't know, I

538
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,380
think if you're able-bodied, you could generate

539
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,800
anywhere between $50,000 to $100,000 a

540
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,780
week doing that, right?

541
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,520
Well, see, now, if you don't have moms,

542
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,700
then why not just get together a small

543
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,800
council of people, so to speak, and work

544
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,080
together?

545
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:41,840
I tried that.

546
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,700
It didn't work out.

547
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,880
So I have to go after certain individuals

548
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,140
maybe that might be capable.

549
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,900
I can't find capable people.

550
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,220
Well, who knows?

551
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:53,280
Maybe, you know, sometimes things take time.

552
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,720
I know you've found people that are more

553
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,320
capable than you thought about a few things.

554
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,400
I haven't found anyone for anything.

555
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,300
I'm doing this tall water lab on my

556
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:00,500
own.

557
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,720
Well, the water lab is- There are

558
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,360
actually five principles involved in this whole thing

559
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,340
that I'm doing, right?

560
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,600
And we have a seven-figure budget, right?

561
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:15,260
And I have access to six figures a

562
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,040
week if I want it, right?

563
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,220
And all that.

564
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,720
And I'm the only one that dictates, but

565
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,640
we know what's cool.

566
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,400
There's five principles.

567
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,900
There are four other that agree.

568
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,860
They all have their finger in the pot.

569
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
The medium-sized engineering company that thinks what

570
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,540
I'm doing is the most provocative advanced stuff

571
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,320
they've ever seen.

572
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,180
And they're correct.

573
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,160
And we give an example.

574
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,860
Two weeks ago, they dropped something on me

575
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,340
that was like, how are you going to

576
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:44,720
do that?

577
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,540
I hung up.

578
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,540
I said, I need a minute.

579
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,160
I got off the call.

580
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,060
In 15 minutes, I had the solution, and

581
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,140
we're prototyping it right now, and it works.

582
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,400
I love it.

583
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:53,920
I love it.

584
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,440
It's great.

585
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,000
But you've got to know how to do

586
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,300
that.

587
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,060
You have to clear, you know, the yin

588
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,280
and yang, universal principles.

589
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,500
If you've got all that shit in your

590
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,000
head, you know, someone was freaking out in

591
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,119
the chat about that, right?

592
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,380
Oh, because the voice thing.

593
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,640
The voice thing.

594
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,339
It's always there.

595
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,440
You've got to shut that off.

596
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,740
And remember, they're coming to you, right?

597
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,760
So you can deny them.

598
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,040
You're not going to them, right?

599
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,680
So what you do, it's kind of like

600
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,280
the John Mace thing, you know, when you

601
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,980
have someone has psychological trauma.

602
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,940
What I do, the computer shows it very

603
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:25,140
well.

604
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:25,960
It's kind of parallel.

605
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,000
You've got a page open on your browser,

606
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,960
and you hit minimize.

607
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:30,620
What happens?

608
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,060
Boom.

609
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,280
It goes down to your desktop, right?

610
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:33,940
Yeah.

611
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,440
And your desktop, let's say, is completely blank,

612
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,540
you know, or a screensaver that's blank.

613
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,640
That's what you do.

614
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,140
So when you hear these voices, I get

615
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:41,620
these thoughts.

616
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,920
So I needed, in other words, they dropped

617
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,260
an engineering thing on me.

618
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,340
And, like, the device that I make, you

619
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,720
have to bend the pipe and all that

620
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,940
around the magnetic reactor.

621
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,820
And it's only so big of a pipe

622
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,280
you can bend around so big of a

623
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:53,760
thing, right?

624
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,720
So I came up with another way to

625
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,580
do the same thing.

626
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,160
Now we could use any size pipe we

627
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,760
want, a pipe that's big enough for a

628
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,040
Ford truck to drive through, right?

629
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,320
And I came up with that in 15

630
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:03,640
minutes.

631
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:03,960
How?

632
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,280
I got off, and I was not in

633
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:06,680
a panic.

634
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,860
I was like, this is unreasonable.

635
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,120
I don't need this shit.

636
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,560
Why don't we just work on what we

637
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,060
have?

638
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,440
There's nothing like it anyway.

639
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,020
I said, wait a second.

640
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,380
So all those thoughts and any incoming stuff,

641
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,220
I minimized it.

642
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,000
I heard the thoughts.

643
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,340
I was conscious of the thoughts, and I

644
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,600
made them smaller and smaller and smaller and

645
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,780
smaller until they got so small they were

646
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,740
smaller than a pixel.

647
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,240
And then I just shut them down.

648
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,780
And then it was just really quiet.

649
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,460
And then something else tried to come in,

650
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,460
and I grabbed it before it developed, froze

651
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,100
it as it was coming in.

652
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,080
It made it smaller and smaller and smaller

653
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:40,820
and minimized.

654
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,080
Boom.

655
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,220
Actually, when you minimize, if you watch the

656
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,080
screen closely, it doesn't just shut it off.

657
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,560
It actually has a shrinking effect.

658
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,360
It's very fast.

659
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,220
It happens like a fifth of a second,

660
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:49,500
right?

661
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:49,860
Right.

662
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,680
I think it was, what, a sixteenth of

663
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,560
a second or faster.

664
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,880
You can't see it, but a tenth of

665
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,880
a second, you can see.

666
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,280
Almost a fifth of a second down.

667
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,880
A third of a second, you could see.

668
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,580
Most thoughts happen in 0.3 seconds.

669
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,720
That's why I tell people I would say

670
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,800
no in 0.3 seconds.

671
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,020
But that's how fast I make decisions, and

672
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,000
we do anyway.

673
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,820
We just don't voice or express them for

674
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,540
a lot longer.

675
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,180
So I kept minimizing.

676
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,200
More stuff started coming in, and I grabbed

677
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,300
it, minimized it.

678
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,140
Now, the entities that are aware of what

679
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,560
I'm doing are like, ah, let's leave him

680
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,960
alone because he's just going to make us

681
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,460
go away.

682
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,980
And then you have this other basic emotional

683
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:28,220
part, the emotional intelligence, the emo part, what

684
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,960
emotional state you're in and where you want

685
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,300
to go.

686
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,100
And you start minimizing that until you blank

687
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:32,880
yourself out.

688
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:33,440
Okay.

689
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,200
And I blank myself out.

690
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,680
And then suddenly I get this vision, boom,

691
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,660
with an emo.

692
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,060
This is how you're going to build it.

693
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:40,960
This is what it is.

694
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,060
This is how it's going to – this

695
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,980
is two possible ways to build it.

696
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,460
This is how it should function instantly, right?

697
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,380
So what happens, that's universal principle.

698
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,780
If you've got a lot of thoughts, that's

699
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,400
a lot of yang, contractive, focused things.

700
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,620
And to go outside of that, you're only

701
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,680
going to be left with expansive yin, wishy

702
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,140
-washy, airy-fairy shit if you're being bombarded

703
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,020
with sharp, focused messages.

704
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,100
The only thing you can come up with

705
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,740
– if you're being fed sharp, focused messages,

706
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,320
the only thing you'll come up with out

707
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,560
of that is unfocused, airy-fairy.

708
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,480
But if you put yourself in the unfocused,

709
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,120
airy-fairy and then eliminate that into nothingness,

710
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,620
you're going to get hit with very sharp

711
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,220
focus, very, very sharp.

712
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,820
You ever hear about inventors?

713
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,560
I was shaving.

714
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,340
I was in the shower.

715
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,940
And then suddenly – right?

716
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,340
Because when they're shaving or in the shower,

717
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,420
you kind of blank out.

718
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:33,120
Like if you're too stressed or getting hit

719
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,360
with voices, you're not going to say it's

720
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,600
time to shave, right?

721
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,920
You usually do that when you're relaxed or

722
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,200
you're in a hurry to get to work

723
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,620
or something.

724
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,940
I don't shave, by the way.

725
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,880
But either way, you're concentrating on that because

726
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,520
you don't want to cut yourself or whatever,

727
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:44,880
right?

728
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:45,560
Yeah, that's right.

729
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,460
You need to blank out.

730
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,740
So we're taking a shower or whatever.

731
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,360
The noise of the texture of the water

732
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:51,460
and all that.

733
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,460
But it's a great example because it provides

734
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:53,920
something.

735
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,480
OK, you have all the different interactions are

736
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:56,960
kind of covered.

737
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,260
You've got to visually deal with it.

738
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,680
You're listening to the sound of water running,

739
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,020
whatever.

740
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,160
It's a distraction.

741
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,520
It's going to overrule the voices and all

742
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:04,700
that.

743
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,720
So you've taken all your sensory inputs.

744
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,980
But my point is here.

745
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,640
You've taken all your sensory inputs and you

746
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,540
focus them on one thing that has nothing

747
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,500
to do with anything else.

748
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,960
Like I'll put on music even and totally

749
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,520
I'm lost.

750
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,920
Like the whole rest of the world pretty

751
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,700
much disappears.

752
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,760
If I put on some familiar music.

753
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,060
If you're getting your music online or from

754
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,060
a CD, it's tainted.

755
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,520
They already put shit in it.

756
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,840
They put the negative stuff is every TV

757
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,520
commercials.

758
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,560
You know, they put die like every I

759
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,960
think every 60th of a second or 30th

760
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,940
of a second randomly.

761
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,060
If you're no one's going to sit here

762
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,240
because you know how long it'll take to

763
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,180
watch a 10 second commercial at a 60th

764
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:41,660
of a second.

765
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,980
Just, you know, 600 frames you have to

766
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,680
study, right?

767
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,380
And more if they squeeze it in there,

768
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,540
they'll put the die.

769
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,820
There was a woman, by the way, a

770
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,300
while back.

771
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,340
She was doing a selfie and the TV

772
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,900
was on in the background and she caught

773
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,420
that moment.

774
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,640
The phone shutter speed got it.

775
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,380
If there is a shutter and it said

776
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,720
die on the TV and she freaked out

777
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,560
and I was like, duh.

778
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,960
When I worked at volunteering at a TV

779
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,720
station here more than 20 years ago.

780
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,020
It's amazing.

781
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,460
2003 Public Access TV Tucson.

782
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,500
22 years.

783
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,260
They're one of the head engineers.

784
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,940
There was like, yeah, they're putting some really

785
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,340
nasty shit and we're trying to avoid it.

786
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,580
There was someone that works for an undercover.

787
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,760
It was an army intelligence person that ran

788
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,120
was assistant manager.

789
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,340
They know when they put in someone into

790
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:30,160
control or corrupt an organization, they never make

791
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:30,740
him the manager.

792
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,480
Always assistant manager, right?

793
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,540
And all that.

794
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,080
So they're not the guy, the go to

795
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,960
person, but they're lurking in the background.

796
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,900
We found out this chick that was assistant

797
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,120
manager was army intelligence, you know, and it

798
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,440
was all you can't escape it.

799
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,760
In other words, you know, even a little

800
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,300
small town thing, whatever.

801
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,820
They've got their feelers.

802
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,540
That's why, you know, remember, it was during

803
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,860
the Obama years is over three.

804
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,920
They wanted to employ another million people in

805
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,040
secret intelligence stuff.

806
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:55,820
Right.

807
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,920
They started with the right.

808
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,120
Remember, they were they were pretty.

809
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:58,740
We need them.

810
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,120
We want to hire a million people to

811
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,500
work in intelligence in the US.

812
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:01,800
Right.

813
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,120
Right.

814
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,140
Because they were all spread out as infiltrators

815
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:04,800
into different.

816
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:05,280
Yeah.

817
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:05,400
Yeah.

818
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,880
First hand experience with that.

819
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,160
Seeing these guys.

820
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:13,060
And one of the special warfare centers is

821
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,600
actually not far from where you live.

822
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,060
Yeah.

823
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:16,800
Fort Huachuca.

824
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,900
But, you know, Fort Huachuca.

825
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,660
I shouldn't say.

826
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,020
Yes.

827
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,500
During the Bush administration.

828
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,720
Daddy Bush.

829
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,120
Pop.

830
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,300
Poppy Bush.

831
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:25,660
Right.

832
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,600
Early 90s.

833
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:26,780
Yeah.

834
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,780
They were doing some military stuff down here

835
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,960
to do because, you know, Yuma is a

836
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,620
testing grounds.

837
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:32,860
Right.

838
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,520
For artillery.

839
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,020
Right.

840
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,820
And it's the same latitude.

841
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,420
If you go all the way across, you

842
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,440
know, you all the way going east across

843
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,680
Arizona on I-10.

844
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,160
Well, even though they don't admit it, they

845
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,400
also manufacture tech there.

846
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,080
But yeah, go ahead.

847
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:44,520
Yeah.

848
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:44,700
Yeah.

849
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:44,860
Yeah.

850
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,060
Yeah.

851
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:45,340
Yeah.

852
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:45,740
You got it.

853
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:49,640
And helicopters are in in Texas.

854
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,100
Right.

855
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:50,420
Sure.

856
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:50,820
They're on the.

857
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,160
Yeah.

858
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,180
So I know someone who works on those

859
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,800
modern helicopters in Texas.

860
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,280
But anyway.

861
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,620
That's how you get to Green Lake and

862
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,080
everything else.

863
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:57,480
But go ahead.

864
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:57,740
Right.

865
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,200
Yeah.

866
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,900
So if you're if you're going across I

867
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,340
-10 East, you're going to hit that Fort

868
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,240
Huachuca area, which is an old fort and

869
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:04,660
all that.

870
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,320
Old fort.

871
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:07,540
Yeah.

872
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,320
And anyway, what made it the intelligence?

873
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,780
It's actually being the the head intelligence of

874
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,640
actually all of the military forces.

875
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,960
They say chime in there.

876
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,900
That's publicly known, just like Cheyenne Mountain supposedly

877
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,880
is for that.

878
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:20,200
Right.

879
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:20,480
Right.

880
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:20,820
Right.

881
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,840
For for air command and all that.

882
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,580
But air command and also nuclear.

883
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,500
They suppose.

884
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:25,820
Yeah.

885
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,740
That was the Dakotas, wasn't it?

886
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,140
Or that.

887
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:29,560
Yeah.

888
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,220
That was in.

889
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:30,880
Anyway.

890
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:31,440
Yeah.

891
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,340
One of the underground bunkers is the publicly

892
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,040
known underground bunkers is there.

893
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:36,380
Yeah.

894
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,480
So all this stuff is connected.

895
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,080
They're all fronts.

896
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,060
So what is Fort Huachuca a front for?

897
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,600
They ended up putting intelligence there because they

898
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,320
found what they call Montezuma's gold there.

899
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,420
It buried in the desert.

900
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,260
Spanish gold.

901
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,360
Like when the Spanish started absconding gold from

902
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,660
the the Mayans and the Aztecs.

903
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,480
Is that why these lunatics were telling me

904
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,720
that that stupid movie with Nicolas Cage was

905
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,040
like real because they found all that gold

906
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,300
in inside of a mountain?

907
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,840
And I don't know.

908
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,300
What's on the mountain was on the desert

909
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:04,760
floor.

910
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,300
It was literally literally.

911
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:07,440
Yeah.

912
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,820
But it's a mountain in the desert in

913
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,340
that movie.

914
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,180
I don't I never watched the whole movie,

915
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,680
but people showed me clips and told me

916
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,680
this is actually real.

917
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,820
You know, blah, blah, blah, blah.

918
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,180
Oh, yeah.

919
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:15,600
It's a story.

920
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,200
But I could tell you, I know someone

921
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,500
whose dad was around there when this happened.

922
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,240
Yeah.

923
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,200
And it was it's a cover.

924
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,320
But his car broke down as early.

925
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,500
I might have been early 60s or something.

926
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,820
And this is why they pumped all the

927
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,840
the resources into Fortu.

928
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,220
Car broke down.

929
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:32,940
He couldn't get help.

930
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,580
He decided to spend the night there.

931
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,700
And there was a windstorm.

932
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,120
And he went out and he figured there

933
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,740
was like a thing where he could move

934
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,480
the car to like a dip to break

935
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:41,860
the wind.

936
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,040
And he noticed a metal.

937
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:45,700
It was a brick.

938
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,100
And it was like, oh, probably an old

939
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,220
building or something.

940
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,920
But it was a brick.

941
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:50,760
It was a piece of Dory.

942
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,280
And the Spanish, when they did the Dory,

943
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,840
it looked like imagine taking a loaf of

944
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,780
Wonder Bread and driving over it with your

945
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,100
car.

946
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,240
It literally looks like that.

947
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,320
It's that long and it's really thin and

948
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,140
it's wide like that.

949
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:01,360
Right.

950
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,740
What is what a visual.

951
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,060
Right.

952
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,260
But anyway, actually, I might have seen that

953
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,300
in the parking lot in Bohac in New

954
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,380
York when I was growing up.

955
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,020
You remember what?

956
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,540
Well, bounds in Bohac and shop.

957
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:10,780
Right.

958
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,100
Right.

959
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:11,440
OK.

960
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:11,980
Make sense.

961
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,380
Yeah.

962
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,540
So it's placed.

963
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,660
I don't think they exist anymore.

964
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,400
But anyway, old supermarkets.

965
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,340
And so it looked like that.

966
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:24,200
And Bush, Poppy Bush was the one that

967
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,400
boosted, you know, no one was supposed to

968
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:26,640
know.

969
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,860
And he knew about it.

970
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,980
And he boosted a lot of the infrastructure

971
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:34,340
there because they're looking for this gold.

972
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,100
And that's all I'm going to say about

973
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:36,280
it.

974
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,580
I don't know what they know, but I

975
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,160
know what I know about it from people

976
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,360
that don't want to work with people like

977
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:41,620
that.

978
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,400
There's a lot of quote, unquote, patriots, people

979
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,900
that have been third, fourth generation here in

980
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,740
Arizona that don't want to work with the

981
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,420
feds that were around for all this stuff.

982
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:52,400
So.

983
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:53,360
All right.

984
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,980
Well, look, let's get you just a couple

985
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,800
of the questions, because you actually covered a

986
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,120
few things and made it superfluous for me

987
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,420
to even bother with a couple of things.

988
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,400
But let's hit a few before you hit

989
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:02,780
them all.

990
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:03,220
All right.

991
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,740
Oh, the echo went away, by the way.

992
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,480
For the first time.

993
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,640
This is the third time we're doing Jitsu.

994
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,800
And the echo finally went away.

995
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,920
Whatever happened, the echo went away.

996
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:11,540
Oh, neat.

997
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,020
OK.

998
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,000
Well, anyway.

999
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,120
No one else could hear it.

1000
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,740
So, you know, it's like the voices in

1001
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,620
my head bothering you.

1002
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:16,820
Right.

1003
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:17,340
Fair enough.

1004
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,900
Anyway, for some reason, they were doubling my

1005
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,480
voice for you.

1006
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,180
All right.

1007
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,380
So about the voices thing.

1008
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,740
Just a real quick aside.

1009
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:26,080
Somebody asked about if they use animals for

1010
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,520
positive or negative effect, do the same entities

1011
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,240
turn around and try and use animals to

1012
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,880
cause interference or to cause positive effects sometimes

1013
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,380
in your experience, you know, as part of

1014
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,020
the game, like between themselves.

1015
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,840
Like, in other words, does somebody maybe play

1016
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,100
like, look, I'm going to get this guy

1017
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:42,820
to destroy himself.

1018
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,500
Well, I'm going to stop him from destroying

1019
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:44,840
himself.

1020
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,200
Well, you want to make a bet, you

1021
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,760
know, like that Star Trek episode where they

1022
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,780
were betting quat lose against each other and

1023
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,000
it turns out they were just brains in

1024
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,320
a jar, you know, that kind of thing.

1025
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:53,720
Yeah, I think.

1026
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,420
Well, the animals.

1027
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,980
Let me just say this about animals.

1028
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:56,840
Animals are important.

1029
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,980
You know, the sacrifice of animals and it's

1030
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,860
still going on today.

1031
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,120
If you know anyone who's an old head

1032
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,620
that's in medical research, they do animal testing.

1033
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:04,940
Do you know?

1034
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,980
I think it's like 50 or 60 million

1035
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:10,320
animals die a year for medical testing.

1036
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:10,640
Right.

1037
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:10,940
Yeah.

1038
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,940
All monkeys, dogs, cats, rats, pigs.

1039
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,520
More than that might be more than that.

1040
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,920
Now, I'm getting statistics that were from the

1041
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,300
80s, by the way, when there was a

1042
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,240
big movement on that.

1043
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,260
And if you work in there like there's

1044
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,240
no reason to put acid in a rabbit's

1045
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:23,760
eye and all that.

1046
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,260
And they're like, don't worry when we kill

1047
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,780
these animals, they're not being wasted.

1048
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:29,060
In other words, they're sacrificing them to their

1049
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,880
deity, a demonic deity, the medical establishment.

1050
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:32,240
Right.

1051
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:32,640
Right.

1052
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,980
Now, another thing is there's a medical complex

1053
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,960
and I think it's Virginia, North Carolina.

1054
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:42,500
It's like these very fancy looking glass buildings,

1055
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,320
four or five stories tall with like a

1056
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,940
five thousand car parking lot.

1057
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:48,500
Well, the center where Fauci was working out

1058
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,400
of for the, you know, gain of function

1059
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,280
research and all that crap, that was at

1060
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,480
a university in North Carolina.

1061
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,260
I think it's in the same place.

1062
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:55,460
Yeah.

1063
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,320
It might have been something.

1064
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,620
It was a medical research there.

1065
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,380
And a guy was doing admin work and

1066
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,320
he was behind me.

1067
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,760
They made his office smaller and he wanted

1068
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,820
to make a good report.

1069
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,080
And so he gets there at four in

1070
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,020
the morning and he had, you know, security

1071
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:09,980
clearance to get up there.

1072
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,400
So he gets on the third floor offices

1073
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,820
early 2000s and he sees down these long

1074
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,640
hallways the doors open and the lights on

1075
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,740
and he's like, let me go check it

1076
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:18,920
out.

1077
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,000
And as he's approaching, he hears humming, moaning,

1078
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,980
groaning and chanting and he didn't even peek

1079
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,200
in.

1080
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,140
And a bunch of people sitting in there

1081
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,880
wearing black hoods, candles and chanting something.

1082
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,000
And it turns out he asked around, he

1083
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,420
says, if you want your job here, don't

1084
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,180
ask about that.

1085
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:34,440
Right.

1086
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:37,260
OK, so I was like, you know, this

1087
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,180
is all people, all the stuff you read

1088
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:39,560
about.

1089
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,680
It's very primitive.

1090
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:45,590
Like, you know, this is the thing, like

1091
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,150
with the engineering people, you know, oh, yeah,

1092
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:48,650
they always tell me this company's technologically is

1093
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:50,830
what technology you mean, like they're connected to

1094
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,150
the Internet.

1095
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,790
They have sensors, they have drones and robotics.

1096
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,530
That's not technology.

1097
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:55,470
That's all that's been around since the 30s.

1098
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:57,050
They don't have any innovation.

1099
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:57,410
Right.

1100
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:57,950
OK.

1101
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:58,290
Right.

1102
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,710
You know, you think the brand new cars

1103
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:01,830
are the same technology from the 30s and

1104
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:02,250
miniaturized.

1105
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:04,070
You know, it's just a bunch of sensors

1106
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:07,830
connecting to radio, microwave radio, let's say radar

1107
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:10,090
from the 40s on the Internet.

1108
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:10,410
Right.

1109
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:11,370
I mean, it's not technology.

1110
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:12,090
It's just old.

1111
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,370
It's not innovation.

1112
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,330
Nothing new is.

1113
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,670
It's coming around, right, as a matter of

1114
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:22,210
fact, and I don't mistake don't be impressed

1115
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:22,990
by technology.

1116
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:25,510
Now, here's the thing that I when I

1117
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:27,510
spoke to people years ago when I was

1118
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:29,430
researching a little bit more what was going

1119
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:32,110
on with the medical stuff, I told my

1120
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,830
advice to them was if you're doing medical

1121
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,110
research, you need to go.

1122
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,670
You're all being lied to.

1123
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:37,190
Right.

1124
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,810
You need to go and research what they

1125
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:41,510
were doing in the eighteen hundreds because it's

1126
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:45,150
all about induction, man, to make something contagious

1127
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:47,130
like it's going to fly through the air

1128
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:49,170
and it's going to get caught in your

1129
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:51,150
lung tissue and then go bore through your

1130
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,550
lung tissue because it can't go through your

1131
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:52,970
lung tissue.

1132
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,090
I'm making a hole in it.

1133
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:54,630
Right.

1134
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,830
And then get into your bloodstream and multiply

1135
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:59,710
is a fucking Walt Disney cartoon.

1136
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:00,530
Stupid.

1137
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:01,850
It doesn't work that way.

1138
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,090
It's by induction.

1139
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:05,450
If you go and study, you know, because

1140
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:08,070
you don't know how to make they don't

1141
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,030
know how to make diseases.

1142
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:11,130
They have to boost them with technology.

1143
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:11,470
Right.

1144
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:13,450
Let me ask you a question with technology

1145
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:16,350
there, because couldn't you make something now with

1146
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:18,810
these nanotech products that, you know, does literally

1147
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:19,910
do that?

1148
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:22,390
It's technology, but it's not innovative.

1149
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:24,650
Like, for example, there's nano graphene stuff.

1150
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,550
There's this thing called memory metal.

1151
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:27,390
Do you remember that stuff?

1152
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:28,030
You crumble it.

1153
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:28,830
It's a thin sheet metal.

1154
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:29,530
You crumble it up.

1155
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:29,870
Yeah.

1156
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:32,150
Hit it with a blow dryer or the

1157
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:34,650
alloy, depending on what temperature goes back to

1158
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:35,430
its original shape.

1159
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:35,630
Yeah.

1160
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:36,370
Yeah.

1161
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:37,730
So what they do is they make these

1162
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,010
little tiny nanowires.

1163
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:39,370
Right.

1164
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,950
The nanotechnology is not impressive either.

1165
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:44,790
It's just using pressure during the manufacturing process

1166
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:48,230
because they learned about pressures and making semiconductors

1167
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:48,770
and all that.

1168
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:50,810
None of this stuff is impresses me.

1169
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:51,210
But anyway.

1170
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:51,750
OK.

1171
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,830
They make these little tiny coils.

1172
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:55,770
So it looks like a round disk, but

1173
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:56,350
it's a coil.

1174
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:59,230
And at a certain temperature, it goes, bam,

1175
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:00,610
and it goes to its original shape, which

1176
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:01,370
is a long wire.

1177
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:02,850
So it cuts you on the inside like

1178
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:03,430
a razor blade.

1179
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:06,370
So that's why these athletes were dropping dead

1180
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:08,890
when the body temperature went up.

1181
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:09,230
Right.

1182
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:10,970
Remember, they were dropping dead on the field.

1183
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:11,210
Right.

1184
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:13,850
Oh, because the nanotech resumes its original shape.

1185
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:14,410
Push it.

1186
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:15,690
And actually creates a blade.

1187
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:15,790
Right.

1188
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:16,090
And then.

1189
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:16,290
OK.

1190
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:16,710
And then.

1191
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:17,510
But here's the thing.

1192
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:19,790
But when they die, they're a cold stiff.

1193
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:20,970
Right.

1194
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:22,850
It may go back to the round disk

1195
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:23,470
shape again.

1196
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:24,650
So they don't see it like that.

1197
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:24,930
Right.

1198
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:26,110
So this is like.

1199
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:27,310
Cut the hole.

1200
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:28,370
That's technology.

1201
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,070
It's not innovative.

1202
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,030
You want to be innovative.

1203
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:32,050
Make them make the bubonic plague.

1204
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,470
But they don't know how to do it.

1205
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:35,690
Well, Greek, do you know how to do

1206
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:35,850
it?

1207
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:37,610
I'm not going to confirm or deny that.

1208
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:39,070
I don't even think on a private podcast.

1209
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,850
I have spoken about it on Skype, how

1210
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:43,790
to create a plague and you can't do

1211
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:44,450
it in the lab.

1212
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:45,690
It's not done in the lab.

1213
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,290
It cannot be done in a lab.

1214
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,910
No, but from my understanding, it would not

1215
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:52,190
be that difficult to do, though, from what

1216
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:52,630
I've been told.

1217
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:52,870
No.

1218
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:56,110
The setting is is is the setting is

1219
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:58,270
is you have to create the setting and

1220
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:01,010
it has nothing to do with it with

1221
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:03,790
being contagious via viruses through the air or

1222
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:04,650
anything like that.

1223
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,150
It has to do with the organisms that

1224
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:08,590
you want to put the plague on and

1225
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:11,150
they have to create the conditions and the

1226
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:12,670
condition is done by induction.

1227
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:15,510
You know, and I think I think I

1228
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,830
might have hinted on that.

1229
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:20,950
It's not something that well, with certain people,

1230
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:22,410
it'd be very popular to talk about how

1231
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:23,130
to create a plague.

1232
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:23,390
Right.

1233
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:24,230
Would be very popular.

1234
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,510
But I don't think it should be discussed.

1235
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,390
But you can't put it this way.

1236
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:28,650
You can't do it in the lab.

1237
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:29,030
No way.

1238
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:29,550
No, however.

1239
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,270
And you can't do it at home in

1240
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,790
your kitchen like you can make gold in

1241
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:33,170
your kitchen.

1242
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:33,490
Right.

1243
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:36,070
And you can turn carbon into iron in

1244
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,630
your kitchen, but you can't make the plague

1245
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:38,130
in your kitchen.

1246
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:39,910
So this is what they're scaring people.

1247
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:41,650
Whenever I hear it got out of a

1248
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:42,910
lab, it's a lie.

1249
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:47,030
That's like saying that was like in the

1250
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:49,170
70s, we used to make jokes about the

1251
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:51,030
Cubans, you know, on the airplane and they

1252
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,530
go up to the pilot, take this plane

1253
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,050
to Cuba.

1254
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:53,430
Right.

1255
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:54,210
Yeah.

1256
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:54,910
Right.

1257
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,810
So it was stupid cliche.

1258
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:57,970
So whenever you hear it got out of

1259
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:58,990
a lab, it's total bullshit.

1260
00:33:59,650 --> 00:33:59,770
Yeah.

1261
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,590
That's like the terror, you know, 19 Arab

1262
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:04,750
hijackers vaporized the World Trade Center with box

1263
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:05,110
cutters.

1264
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,690
You know, I mean, that's how ridiculous it

1265
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:06,850
is.

1266
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:07,310
Right.

1267
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,270
So, OK.

1268
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:09,909
Well, you know what?

1269
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:11,210
Let's go to something that was related to

1270
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:12,770
a few things real fast and then we'll

1271
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:14,170
go to an unrelated question.

1272
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:16,230
And that'll be about it for this one.

1273
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:18,250
I don't know who is running the Greek

1274
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,310
speak Facebook page.

1275
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:21,210
Again, this is the second time this came

1276
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:21,690
up to me.

1277
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:22,770
It's probably Sam.

1278
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:23,270
OK.

1279
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:24,330
Or the Archon or whoever.

1280
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:24,870
All right.

1281
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:26,790
But I want you to dispel this or

1282
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:27,230
deal with this.

1283
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,010
I don't do YouTube.

1284
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:28,590
I don't do.

1285
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,010
Look, I have so many.

1286
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:30,929
We just interject.

1287
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:32,750
I have so many ideas every week.

1288
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:33,110
Yeah.

1289
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,630
Little hints, things to do around the house.

1290
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:36,590
Someone from the.

1291
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:38,730
I'll put up from the Paranormies.

1292
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:40,250
They interviewed Jason a while.

1293
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,389
I might be talking to them.

1294
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:41,949
Right.

1295
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:42,630
He sent me an email.

1296
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,489
He says, I just subscribed to Rated Y.

1297
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:46,110
Man, your stuff is like a thousand pound

1298
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,090
breadcrumbs.

1299
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:47,310
Right.

1300
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:48,330
You know, he listens to it.

1301
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,770
So I have little ideas.

1302
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:52,790
You like, for example, OK, stuff I give

1303
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:56,110
over here, like tired, you know, dishwasher soap

1304
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:56,590
out again.

1305
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:57,950
Yeah, we bought some two weeks ago.

1306
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:58,530
Go get some more.

1307
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,990
You know, if you dilute it in a

1308
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:02,370
spray bottle, that little bottle will last you

1309
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:02,850
six months.

1310
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:03,110
Right.

1311
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:03,970
And you'll lose.

1312
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:06,630
Use less water because you need less water

1313
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,150
to rinse.

1314
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:08,970
You're conserving on water.

1315
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:10,210
You're conserving on soap.

1316
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:10,590
Yes.

1317
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:10,910
Right.

1318
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:12,190
Less residue.

1319
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:12,770
Right.

1320
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:12,870
Right.

1321
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:14,070
What I especially put a little borax.

1322
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,290
You know that if I did a YouTube

1323
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:17,550
video on that alone, like the Greek fix

1324
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:21,030
Greek fixes it or something website channel, it

1325
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,150
would get three million hits.

1326
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:22,670
Yeah.

1327
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,810
I'd have a million subs in like a

1328
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:28,430
year organically, organically, not not, you know, buying

1329
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,830
subs and stuff like that.

1330
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:30,810
And it would millions.

1331
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:32,170
I mean, then YouTube.

1332
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:35,250
I know they pay for every million views.

1333
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:36,110
You get a thousand bucks.

1334
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:36,410
Right.

1335
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:37,370
Some other videos.

1336
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:39,710
And for every hundred thousand subs, you get

1337
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,090
like forty thousand a year.

1338
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:42,050
Right.

1339
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:44,990
So that's why I go watch people like

1340
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:46,170
Tom NYC.

1341
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,410
He's a tour guy.

1342
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:48,150
Starving guy.

1343
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:49,550
When I started watching me at five thousand

1344
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,910
subs, I was up to one hundred days.

1345
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:52,690
No longer complaining about paying rent.

1346
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:53,170
New York.

1347
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:53,710
Right.

1348
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:56,230
Well, that's a little get suppressed because remember,

1349
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:58,190
I sat at five thousand subs for like

1350
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:00,450
five years before they canceled my.

1351
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:00,850
Yeah.

1352
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,750
But it's not me or you or whatever.

1353
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,030
I'm saying the stuff that I could put

1354
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:06,410
out would be so popular because it will

1355
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:07,350
spread like wildfire.

1356
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:10,010
Organically, the cooking stuff, just a little.

1357
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,370
And it would be a little two minute

1358
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:11,770
video.

1359
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:12,170
Right.

1360
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:13,690
You know, the thing up to don't go

1361
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:14,530
more than 20 minutes.

1362
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:15,010
Screw that.

1363
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,190
Two and a half minutes like that one

1364
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:17,750
bite review.

1365
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,130
The guy who does the one bite pizza

1366
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:20,390
reviews, two minute videos.

1367
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:20,650
Right.

1368
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:23,110
He's he's so popular that even Joe Rogan

1369
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:23,830
interviewed him.

1370
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:24,010
Right.

1371
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:24,230
Yeah.

1372
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,230
Well, to be honest with you, if you

1373
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,930
can make something like that fly right now,

1374
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,930
TikTok is the perfect platform for it.

1375
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:30,730
And you can just transpose it over to

1376
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,930
YouTube and have both of those platforms running

1377
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:35,170
and actually make sure more than enough.

1378
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,430
Think on that.

1379
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:39,010
You know, you could make bank on that

1380
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:40,930
doing it.

1381
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:41,670
But I don't want to.

1382
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:42,430
Here's the thing.

1383
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:44,710
I found out what YouTube was about when

1384
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:45,210
it started.

1385
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:45,870
Right.

1386
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:46,370
Right.

1387
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,170
From people that like one of the people

1388
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,110
that started PayPal.

1389
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:51,870
PayPal wasn't started by one guy.

1390
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:52,170
Right.

1391
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:53,210
It was a group.

1392
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:55,470
And they were interested in some things that

1393
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:56,190
I was doing.

1394
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:00,270
And I knew some people that worked with

1395
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:01,190
Homeland Security.

1396
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:02,050
This that and the other.

1397
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,250
I was like, oh, this is a dirty

1398
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:03,890
organization.

1399
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,330
It's fucking dirty.

1400
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,610
It's kind of like.

1401
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,670
And I look, I've stayed true to my

1402
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:10,950
word.

1403
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:11,210
Right.

1404
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:12,570
I would not.

1405
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:13,950
And I've got the goods.

1406
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:15,990
It could go on there with with stuff

1407
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:18,350
that will just really, really help people.

1408
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:20,250
But I'm not you guys.

1409
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:21,870
This is what I tell people.

1410
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:25,450
Anyone listening, go start a YouTube channel, call

1411
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:25,730
it whatever.

1412
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:27,810
Take the stuff that I talk about here

1413
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:28,610
or O.

1414
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:28,910
And G.

1415
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:30,530
Little tips and tricks or whatever.

1416
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:31,850
And make it your own.

1417
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:32,070
Yeah.

1418
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:34,330
Say, yeah, motherfuckers, I came up with this,

1419
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:35,390
even though you didn't.

1420
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:36,610
I would not mind.

1421
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,910
I would never say, oh, that was my

1422
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:38,330
idea.

1423
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:39,270
He stole it.

1424
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,050
You know what I say about that?

1425
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:41,270
Right.

1426
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:43,410
Anytime you put something on the Internet, it's

1427
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:45,050
like when you wheel the bin to the

1428
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:46,770
curb for the British folks.

1429
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:48,930
You know, if you you know, you know

1430
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:49,290
how you.

1431
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:50,810
Well, if you live in an apartment, the

1432
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:51,590
super does it.

1433
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,590
The management does it.

1434
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:54,230
But you live in a house or whatever.

1435
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,710
You have garbage day.

1436
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:55,990
Right.

1437
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:56,370
Right.

1438
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:58,150
OK, so you're supposed to take the can

1439
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,170
out to the curb.

1440
00:37:59,430 --> 00:37:59,790
Right.

1441
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:03,030
And and that's what putting stuff on the

1442
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:03,550
Internet is.

1443
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:05,110
It's like putting the can out on the

1444
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:05,290
curb.

1445
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,570
Doesn't matter what you're doing.

1446
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:08,250
And it's on the Internet.

1447
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:09,150
It's putting the can of curb.

1448
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:11,570
Now, when people say, oh, I did this

1449
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:12,690
and they're stealing it because they put it

1450
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:13,090
on the Internet.

1451
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:15,490
That's like putting the can out on the

1452
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:15,810
curb.

1453
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:16,190
Right.

1454
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:18,970
And now someone's going through your garbage and

1455
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:20,450
you're telling them, hey, that's mine.

1456
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,190
Leave it alone.

1457
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:21,850
You steal it.

1458
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:24,850
You know what I mean?

1459
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:26,870
So what you're saying is you don't care

1460
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:28,270
if they take your garbage and sell it

1461
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:29,570
at the flea market is what you say.

1462
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:30,930
But the thing is, I'm not putting out

1463
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:31,550
garbage.

1464
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,290
But what I'm saying, it's like that when

1465
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:34,310
you put stuff on the Internet.

1466
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:35,790
It's no different than putting the can out

1467
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:37,090
on the curb and then getting mad at

1468
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:38,110
someone for going through it.

1469
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:38,330
Yeah.

1470
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,910
No, I was going with the metaphor here.

1471
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:41,030
You know, you put it out there.

1472
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:43,110
It's kind of idiotic.

1473
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:43,590
I got it.

1474
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:45,030
If you don't want if you don't want

1475
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,210
it, but don't put it on the Internet.

1476
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:48,250
And that's why I'm like, I don't want

1477
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:48,930
to do YouTube.

1478
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:51,290
I won't do social media or whatever.

1479
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:52,890
We do the Water Helix.

1480
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:54,470
We did do an Instagram and a bunch

1481
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:57,810
of other things for legal reasons, I should

1482
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:59,710
say, for publishing reasons.

1483
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:00,930
And it's going to be pulled and all

1484
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:01,350
that.

1485
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:02,630
And it's just people.

1486
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:04,290
It just needs to show a demo.

1487
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:05,530
It has to be published.

1488
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:06,690
It makes an establishment.

1489
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:08,690
It establishes a trademark.

1490
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:10,970
That's already been established and all that.

1491
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,170
But yeah, you'll never see me.

1492
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:13,370
Sam went ahead.

1493
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:15,190
And when they did the Archaic's interview, they

1494
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,050
plugged him in.

1495
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:18,270
He plugged himself in and he got all

1496
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:19,570
the attention, which is fine.

1497
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:21,930
And he was getting 10,000 views a

1498
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:24,790
week or in 10,000 subs immediately and

1499
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:25,050
all that.

1500
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:25,490
And I don't care.

1501
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:26,430
I said, I don't care if it goes

1502
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,050
to Mr. Beast mode.

1503
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:29,030
I don't care.

1504
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,810
I don't want I don't want anything to

1505
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:31,170
do with it.

1506
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:32,650
YouTube ever.

1507
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:33,110
Right.

1508
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:33,790
And I never will.

1509
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:35,210
So, OK, fair enough.

1510
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:36,450
But back to this question.

1511
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:38,470
But I saw the following book or feces

1512
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:39,710
book or whatever, you know.

1513
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:40,950
Oh, actually, I call it Fed book.

1514
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:51,670
It's about how to manage the machinations of

1515
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:54,190
the world in the way that's required.

1516
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:54,830
End quote.

1517
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:57,250
Could you explain this statement a bit more

1518
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:59,730
in the next in the next sonic and

1519
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,130
a second question?

1520
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:02,970
What does it really mean to be wealthy

1521
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:05,770
in the reality and system we live in?

1522
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:08,910
Well, look from it's about desire.

1523
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:12,530
If you have no desires, is it important

1524
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:14,450
if you're wealthy or poor, if you have

1525
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:15,130
no desires?

1526
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:15,570
No.

1527
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:20,330
In the Buddhist lore and culture, I don't

1528
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:22,430
know, it's called some sauna or something.

1529
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:24,430
I don't need to find the real.

1530
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,650
But if someone wants to find out what

1531
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:27,450
it is, it's to release desire.

1532
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:29,230
And one way to do it is by

1533
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,350
agreeing with yourself.

1534
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,750
I no longer want to do that.

1535
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:33,290
And you stick with it.

1536
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:35,470
The other way, you know, desire to want

1537
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:38,450
things right and experiences and money and anything

1538
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:39,170
you can experience.

1539
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:42,070
The other way to do the same thing

1540
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:45,250
is to gain everything, experience everything.

1541
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,090
Have all the wealth in the world and

1542
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:48,810
then say, hey, you know, I did it

1543
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:49,030
all.

1544
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:49,950
I don't want it now.

1545
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:50,910
Right.

1546
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:53,110
You see, there's two ways of doing that

1547
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:56,330
in that culture, in that philosophy, let's say.

1548
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:56,610
Right.

1549
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:57,110
Right.

1550
00:40:57,190 --> 00:41:00,250
So the the end of when you achieve

1551
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,250
that some sauna, whatever, when you no longer

1552
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:04,610
have desire, wealth or poverty is irrelevant.

1553
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:06,810
So when you say wealth, it means that

1554
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:09,770
you want to acquire everything to say you've

1555
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:10,990
had it and experience it.

1556
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:12,890
Because even what was it in?

1557
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:16,090
Orson Welles, Rosebud.

1558
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:17,610
Remember in the end when he was the

1559
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:19,030
wealthiest man in the world, he just wanted

1560
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:21,310
that slay that comforted him when he was

1561
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:23,450
a time of unsure in his life like

1562
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:23,870
he already.

1563
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:25,910
That was like what I'm talking about.

1564
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:27,510
He gave up everything and he just wanted

1565
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:28,030
Rosebud.

1566
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,550
What the hell is Rosebud, right?

1567
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:31,490
Throwing it in the fire.

1568
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:31,750
Right.

1569
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:33,070
It's like the guy who could have had

1570
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:35,430
the multimillion dollar contracts and entertainment, whatever.

1571
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:36,930
But no, he's got his little ranch.

1572
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:38,870
He's got his dogs and he's fine with

1573
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:39,510
just that.

1574
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,970
So let's go back to the analogy and

1575
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:43,130
stuff I mentioned earlier.

1576
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:43,950
Quit your job.

1577
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:44,730
Stop what you're doing.

1578
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:46,970
Go apply for things because the Federal Reserve,

1579
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:51,790
which runs everything, is telling you that when

1580
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:55,570
you apply for something, they will give the

1581
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:58,430
negotiable instruments or the notes or the quote

1582
00:41:58,430 --> 00:41:59,210
unquote credits.

1583
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:01,810
Whoever brings that application to them as an

1584
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,370
intermediary, the full amount.

1585
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:05,470
And, you know, when you go apply, for

1586
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:08,870
example, let's say for a mortgage loan for

1587
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:09,650
one hundred thousand.

1588
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:12,750
And it's a 30 year loan, let's say.

1589
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:15,090
Do you think they're going to bring the

1590
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:16,670
application to the Federal Reserve for one hundred

1591
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:16,990
thousand?

1592
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:18,050
No.

1593
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:19,730
A 30 year loan.

1594
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:20,910
You're going to that house is going to

1595
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:23,110
be one hundred eighty thousand two hundred thousand

1596
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:23,770
in interest.

1597
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:24,330
Right.

1598
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:27,370
Plus the one hundred thousand plus the closing

1599
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:30,470
fees, plus all the taxes, plus what they're

1600
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:31,350
going to put in escrow.

1601
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:33,010
So that they're going to put on that

1602
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:33,530
application.

1603
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:34,810
They're going to jack it up to over

1604
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:35,850
three hundred thousand.

1605
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:36,550
Right.

1606
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:38,290
Federal Reserve is going to give them that.

1607
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:39,850
And they're going to come to you and

1608
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:41,770
say, oh, your credit score is not high

1609
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:41,970
enough.

1610
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:43,650
Sorry, let's try again next month.

1611
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:44,610
We're denying you.

1612
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:47,990
But the finance company has the three hundred

1613
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:48,330
thousand.

1614
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:49,910
So you say, that's fine.

1615
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:52,970
I don't see anywhere in Tilo or consumer

1616
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:55,470
credit action, whatever that the current score can

1617
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:57,190
use as a basis that shows that the

1618
00:42:57,810 --> 00:42:59,670
application has not been monetized.

1619
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:01,270
Here's the Federal Reserve Act.

1620
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:04,350
As a matter of fact, I need more

1621
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:04,930
information.

1622
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:08,290
I need GAP, which is a general acceptance

1623
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:08,390
of credit.

1624
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:10,190
Accounting principles to see on your books.

1625
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:11,870
And if they're a public company, that's why

1626
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:12,970
you always want to apply with a public

1627
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:13,390
company.

1628
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,730
If you request it, they have to show

1629
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:15,290
it to you.

1630
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:16,790
Meaning their private books.

1631
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:19,070
Like, for example, when you get a mortgage,

1632
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:21,170
give a mortgage and you go to a

1633
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:22,630
title company when the house closes.

1634
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:24,750
You know that the title company's documents always

1635
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:27,390
show the house is completely paid for on

1636
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:28,670
a completely done deal.

1637
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:32,150
And then every mortgage payment is your gifting.

1638
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:32,870
It's a gift.

1639
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:34,950
But you still say that they could take

1640
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:36,410
the house when they want to.

1641
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:36,690
Right.

1642
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:39,450
That's why the go to a title company

1643
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,870
and say, according to GAP, if they're publicly

1644
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:45,170
listed, I want to see the initiating documents.

1645
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:47,890
The first page, like when this property was

1646
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:49,450
brought to you to clear it.

1647
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:51,570
Oops, oops, oops, oops.

1648
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:56,010
So what I'm saying is go apply for

1649
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:58,330
credit cards, go apply for loans or whatever,

1650
00:43:58,490 --> 00:43:59,490
and give them a letter.

1651
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:00,170
You got three days.

1652
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:03,570
Say, hey, listen, that application, I'm retaining security

1653
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:04,110
interests.

1654
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:09,250
And according to the codes, it's an unwritten

1655
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:10,650
code, but it's in the financial.

1656
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:12,490
You'll find it in the financial industry.

1657
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:14,870
You get 76 percent.

1658
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:16,210
They keep 24 percent.

1659
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:16,510
Right.

1660
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:17,910
When they run money for you.

1661
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:20,810
So this application I applied for this credit

1662
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:23,290
card or this house, 100 or whatever, plus

1663
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:24,650
interest, whatever, whatever.

1664
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:25,330
OK.

1665
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:26,230
I get 70.

1666
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,530
That doesn't matter if you deny me or

1667
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:29,350
accept me or whatever.

1668
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:33,590
76 percent of that, let's say, comes to

1669
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:33,750
me.

1670
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:36,110
You can keep 24 percent as an intermediary

1671
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:36,410
fee.

1672
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:36,690
Right.

1673
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:38,310
But here's the thing.

1674
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:40,830
What if you apply for a house or

1675
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:42,910
credit card or whatever and that you get

1676
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:43,370
accepted?

1677
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:47,370
They act as if the application was just

1678
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:48,730
you getting in the door and you got

1679
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:49,130
it right.

1680
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:50,490
Then they make you sign another piece of

1681
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:51,970
paper and another piece of paper.

1682
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:54,550
So even if you get accepted with the

1683
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:57,750
application, let's do something really simple.

1684
00:44:57,890 --> 00:45:00,270
Wells Fargo, five thousand dollar line of credit.

1685
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:00,870
OK.

1686
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:02,670
Let's say they accept you.

1687
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:05,490
Well, you say that application.

1688
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:06,690
I want that applied.

1689
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,670
I want to leverage that towards the account.

1690
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:11,470
So.

1691
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:13,690
So in other words, you just open the

1692
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:16,670
line of credit for five thousand dollars and

1693
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:19,370
you're telling Wells Fargo you want to take

1694
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:22,310
76 percent of that five thousand dollars because

1695
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:24,070
they should get 24 percent and put it

1696
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:24,890
towards the account.

1697
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:25,650
Right.

1698
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:28,710
So if you went and withdrew half of

1699
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:31,890
it, you'd have a credit of 24 percent

1700
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:33,730
of it sitting there after all this is

1701
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:33,830
over.

1702
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:34,730
Yeah.

1703
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:35,850
Right.

1704
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:37,650
But then but then when you go to

1705
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:39,850
draw on the line of credit, you sign

1706
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:40,550
another document.

1707
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:43,130
And that's really a full amount there anyway,

1708
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:44,630
which is a check to you again.

1709
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:47,510
So this is how this is how the

1710
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:48,070
business works.

1711
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:49,110
This is real business.

1712
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:52,270
And this is why when you hear this

1713
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:55,270
company is acquiring this other company for forty

1714
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:56,290
three billion dollars.

1715
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:58,650
I was listening to something recently, some business

1716
00:45:58,650 --> 00:45:59,590
channel on YouTube.

1717
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:02,210
So and so is trying to acquire them

1718
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:03,710
for forty three billion dollars in cash.

1719
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:07,250
And I like negotiable instrument bill of exchange.

1720
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:08,870
And then if you go read the case,

1721
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:10,670
because a lot of times they the cases

1722
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:11,150
are closed.

1723
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:13,190
Sometimes the transactions are open.

1724
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:14,190
Right.

1725
00:46:14,410 --> 00:46:16,630
Like if Coca-Cola does something, it's you

1726
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:17,850
can you can look around.

1727
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:19,650
If you know how to look and sign

1728
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:21,230
up for it, you'll see the documents, the

1729
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:21,650
contracts.

1730
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:24,530
And it tells you they provided us three

1731
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:25,450
bills of exchange.

1732
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:27,170
You know what that is, right?

1733
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:29,370
Bill of exchange is you write on the

1734
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:32,650
whatever you write down and somebody signs it

1735
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:33,150
with a number.

1736
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:33,690
It's good.

1737
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:35,230
Take it to the bank.

1738
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:37,990
Title 26 says you can do withholding and

1739
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:38,630
create credits.

1740
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:41,230
So this is how real business works.

1741
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:44,370
So when you hear Apple's worth almost a

1742
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:46,290
trillion dollars, that means that everybody on the

1743
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:48,310
planet spends a thousand dollars a year with

1744
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:48,670
Apple.

1745
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:51,830
That's not how they got a trillion dollars.

1746
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:54,290
They're selling little fucking stupid rectangles and computers.

1747
00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:54,850
Are you kidding?

1748
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:58,930
It's all bills of exchange, negotiable instruments, IRC

1749
00:46:58,930 --> 00:46:59,610
522.

1750
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:02,050
So that's the way of the world.

1751
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:03,290
That's what wealth is.

1752
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:04,810
That's how you want to gain stuff.

1753
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:06,850
But there's also a social order.

1754
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:07,730
Right.

1755
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:11,550
So you got some homie that lives somewhere

1756
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:13,710
in Chicago and he's got a two thousand

1757
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:16,030
dollar car with five thousand dollar wheels, finds

1758
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:16,710
out about this.

1759
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:17,930
He's going to go to the Rolls Royce

1760
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:19,170
dealership right now.

1761
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:21,870
You got an application, get denied and demand.

1762
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:26,190
They put the application, whether he gets denied

1763
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:28,050
or accepted towards the Rolls Royce and cause

1764
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:28,650
a lot of trouble.

1765
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:30,270
Right.

1766
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:31,730
And even if they gave him the Rolls

1767
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:34,050
Royce, I don't think he get jacked.

1768
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:34,850
He takes a neighborhood.

1769
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:35,730
You know, he'll be shot.

1770
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:35,970
Right.

1771
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:36,770
They'll kill him for it.

1772
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:36,970
Right.

1773
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:37,550
Probably.

1774
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:38,490
You see what I'm saying?

1775
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:40,310
So there's a cultural element here that has

1776
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:40,950
to be considered.

1777
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:42,990
So what they did is they kept the

1778
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:45,470
cultural element that was kept from the railroad

1779
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:45,730
days.

1780
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:47,150
But you know how we mentioned Seward in

1781
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:49,390
the beginning of the talk, Seward's folly for

1782
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:50,110
buying Alaska.

1783
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:50,550
Right.

1784
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:52,930
You know, the railroad companies were ruling the

1785
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:56,030
world then and they wanted Alaska to be

1786
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:58,030
under jurisdiction because they wanted to build a

1787
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:00,370
railroad from the bottom of South America all

1788
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:02,230
the way up to Alaska and then bridge

1789
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:04,350
across the Aleutian Islands into Russia with a

1790
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:08,270
railroad into Russia, down into India, across Europe.

1791
00:48:08,730 --> 00:48:10,030
So you could put him in Africa.

1792
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:13,490
So you can the railroad would be you

1793
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:15,270
can go take the railroad and connect the

1794
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:17,770
entire world except for Australia and New Zealand.

1795
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:18,430
Right.

1796
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:20,110
And maybe a couple of other island nations.

1797
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:20,790
Right.

1798
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:21,470
Right.

1799
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:24,330
You'd have to think about that from the

1800
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:26,970
southern tip of South America all the way

1801
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:29,090
up to Alaska across the Aleutian Islands railroad,

1802
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:31,590
you know, bridges across to Russia down into

1803
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:31,950
Europe.

1804
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:32,290
Right.

1805
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:33,150
Africa.

1806
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:35,810
All but two continents would be covered because

1807
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:39,070
you'd have the Australia wouldn't be Australia.

1808
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:40,110
And what do they call it?

1809
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:41,290
Antarctica or whatever.

1810
00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:42,250
Yeah.

1811
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:42,990
Yeah.

1812
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:46,390
Like I said, it's going on there anyway.

1813
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:46,790
Yeah.

1814
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:47,230
Yeah.

1815
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:47,850
Two continents.

1816
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:48,130
Yeah.

1817
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:50,350
So that was their scope and that was

1818
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:53,250
the power that was because it was about

1819
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:54,130
moving transport.

1820
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:54,590
Right.

1821
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:56,730
I mean, look how they punished everyone with

1822
00:48:56,730 --> 00:48:59,390
the covid stuff with what they call logistics

1823
00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:00,510
shipment delays.

1824
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:01,250
Yes.

1825
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:03,990
The supply chain issues is what it was.

1826
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:06,010
Yeah, that's that's so obvious.

1827
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:08,350
And in BlackRock, you know, you're saying five

1828
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:09,190
companies control.

1829
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:09,810
It's really two.

1830
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:11,170
It's Vanguard and BlackRock.

1831
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:15,690
Now, you know, together, they're worth 25 trillion

1832
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:16,930
or 30 trillion together.

1833
00:49:17,370 --> 00:49:19,610
And that's just public with private.

1834
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:20,570
They're much more.

1835
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:23,590
And they're the ones that put that woke

1836
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:25,430
policy, you know, that, you know, if you're

1837
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:26,610
a guy, chop your dick off.

1838
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:27,850
If you're a woman, try to be a

1839
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:28,230
man.

1840
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:29,990
The same stuff.

1841
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:33,330
Those are the same people that after World

1842
00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:35,050
War One went into Germany.

1843
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:37,130
We talked about what they did there, the

1844
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:37,670
woke thing.

1845
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:41,490
They're doing sex change operations, lots of drugs,

1846
00:49:42,570 --> 00:49:42,970
prostitution.

1847
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:48,730
And and the Third Reich National Socialist came

1848
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:49,370
and cleaned it up.

1849
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:52,270
All the book burnings were all those books

1850
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:56,590
about being a transvestite and sexual devancy and

1851
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:57,430
all that.

1852
00:49:57,510 --> 00:49:59,170
All the woke stuff, just like, you know,

1853
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:01,070
the porn books are putting in schools.

1854
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:01,430
Right.

1855
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:02,530
That's what they were burning.

1856
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:04,730
See, they tell you that the Nazis were

1857
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:06,190
book burning, but they didn't tell you what

1858
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:07,010
books they were burning.

1859
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:12,010
Coincidentally, 90 percent, if not 99 percent of

1860
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:14,690
all the authors and researchers from those books

1861
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:16,870
were Jewish coincidentally.

1862
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:18,710
Right.

1863
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:20,130
So there you go.

1864
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:20,490
Yeah.

1865
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,490
It's amazing when you look into these things.

1866
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:23,210
Exactly.

1867
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:25,150
So that leads into the very last thing

1868
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:27,890
that was that was put there as a

1869
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:30,230
comment and a question in rated Y 200.

1870
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:32,670
The Greek was talking about transgendered people in

1871
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:33,710
entertainment and sports.

1872
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:36,090
You made a comment that these people don't

1873
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:37,330
choose to be that way.

1874
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:38,870
That's how they are made.

1875
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:40,610
This really got.

1876
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:41,430
Well, go ahead.

1877
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:42,130
Go ahead with the question.

1878
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:43,970
Sorry, this really got my attention because a

1879
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:46,950
long time back, someone mentioned that all famous

1880
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:50,070
people are transgendered because the goddess deity they

1881
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:53,190
worship demand is it true enough.

1882
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:55,530
One can pick out any given celebrity.

1883
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:58,830
And if you analyze their physical attributes such

1884
00:50:58,830 --> 00:51:01,710
as jawline, shoulder width, hip width, et cetera,

1885
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:04,030
they seem to be of the opposite gender

1886
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:05,390
than what they portray.

1887
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:09,150
Is the usually able to elaborate more on

1888
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:11,470
what he meant when he stated that they

1889
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:13,110
are made that way.

1890
00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:17,210
Well, culturally, they're picked out, you know, groomed

1891
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:18,070
like what you said.

1892
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:19,070
Manchurian was it.

1893
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:20,790
I don't even know what a Manchurian candidate

1894
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:21,050
is.

1895
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:22,910
You have like a five second definition of

1896
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:23,090
that.

1897
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:25,730
A Manchurian candidate is someone who is put

1898
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:29,570
into a position who is unaware in there.

1899
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:30,190
Yes.

1900
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:33,130
In their consciousness upfront that they are programmed

1901
00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:35,590
to do something and then they're triggered to

1902
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:38,350
do something terrible that is not part of

1903
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:40,550
their daily psychology or their awareness.

1904
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:41,190
Yeah.

1905
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:43,410
That's some that's some M.K. ultra shit.

1906
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:44,370
Then it is.

1907
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:44,710
Yeah.

1908
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:45,950
No, I'd say change.

1909
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:47,610
Other stuff is a revival of the ancient

1910
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:49,370
goddess religion, the negative one.

1911
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:49,690
Right.

1912
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:51,510
And those people are pretty horrible.

1913
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:53,390
Like, why don't they form their own team?

1914
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:54,150
They never do.

1915
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:54,630
They have to.

1916
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:55,550
They're infiltrators.

1917
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:55,910
Right.

1918
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:57,190
You always have.

1919
00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:59,930
They always send one transgender into a team,

1920
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:01,190
a guy into a woman's team.

1921
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:03,670
They don't have a whole bunch of guys

1922
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:06,010
that want to say I'm transgender women as

1923
00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:06,550
a whole team.

1924
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:07,390
They can't do that.

1925
00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:07,650
Right.

1926
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:11,190
That's a notion that I picked up from.

1927
00:52:11,470 --> 00:52:12,730
Look out for Charlie.

1928
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:15,670
But if you look at this, some pretty

1929
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:16,650
famous people.

1930
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:19,270
I have a second cousin, which is no

1931
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:20,010
blood relation.

1932
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:21,770
And what the thing that was going around

1933
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:24,250
since I was young in the family when

1934
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:25,770
he was born, he had a penis and

1935
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:26,990
a vagina and they had to make a

1936
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:28,590
decision, you know, which way to go.

1937
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:28,850
Right.

1938
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:29,310
OK.

1939
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:30,130
I've heard about that.

1940
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:31,350
Yeah.

1941
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:33,110
And Trump was like that.

1942
00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:34,650
They made a decision for him to be

1943
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:35,070
a male.

1944
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:36,570
Also, what?

1945
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:37,330
Yeah.

1946
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:38,310
And so was.

1947
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:41,850
So was Jamie Lee Curtis.

1948
00:52:42,810 --> 00:52:43,170
Yeah.

1949
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:45,730
I decided for her to be a woman.

1950
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:46,350
Yeah.

1951
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:46,990
Yeah.

1952
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:49,390
Now, what a set of knockers on her

1953
00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:49,930
for.

1954
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:53,070
How would that have been if she they

1955
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:53,750
decided for.

1956
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:54,610
Yeah, I don't know.

1957
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:56,450
That's what I'm thinking of, because, you know,

1958
00:52:56,490 --> 00:52:58,230
the movie Trading Places, you get a good

1959
00:52:58,230 --> 00:52:59,350
look at that frontal.

1960
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:02,630
She's got she's almost soft digs.

1961
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:04,050
You know, soft dig is a term like

1962
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:05,110
large breasts.

1963
00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:05,510
Yeah.

1964
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:06,690
No, she's got some pretty.

1965
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:07,050
Yeah.

1966
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:07,590
Yeah.

1967
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:09,110
So how does that happen?

1968
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:10,410
You know, is that, you know, because it's

1969
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:12,910
pretty that can be done with synthetics, but

1970
00:53:12,910 --> 00:53:14,310
there's a spiritual component.

1971
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:14,910
Here's the thing.

1972
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:16,390
Those don't look synthetic, though.

1973
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:17,150
Bonus right there.

1974
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:17,590
I'll tell you.

1975
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:19,750
No, but there's a synthetic component, you know,

1976
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:21,570
with with estrogen and things like that.

1977
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:22,090
Yeah.

1978
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:22,790
Maybe.

1979
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:24,710
But I'm saying like you like that's definitely

1980
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:26,050
not breast implants on Jamie.

1981
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:27,690
No, those are very well formed.

1982
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,150
I should say it was statically and all

1983
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:30,430
that proportionately, too.

1984
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:33,170
But what I mean is I think that

1985
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:36,910
if you just did convincing and propaganda, you'd

1986
00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:37,270
have it.

1987
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:40,430
But how many mayors, even Giuliani has was

1988
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:42,250
a trans dress, you know, every Halloween, you

1989
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:43,610
know, he dressed up like a woman every

1990
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:44,050
Halloween.

1991
00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:44,410
Right.

1992
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:46,330
There's a famous clip of him doing it

1993
00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:47,950
with Trump, actually, which is pretty funny.

1994
00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:49,430
But yeah, they do that.

1995
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:51,930
So this is the Freemasons do that.

1996
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:53,770
I think Leo Zoghami talked about it here

1997
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:55,510
in Jerusalem.

1998
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:57,490
The rabbis have a thing where they all

1999
00:53:57,490 --> 00:53:58,550
rape a transvestite.

2000
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:00,530
It has to be a transvestite male posing

2001
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:01,010
as a woman.

2002
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:03,410
And they also have women posing as male.

2003
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:07,110
You also hear that from the who's the

2004
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:09,550
satanist, the satanic panic in the 80s.

2005
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:13,830
Which Akino, Akino, Akino children pointed him out

2006
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:15,990
that he would be wearing woman's clothing and

2007
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:16,730
his the wife.

2008
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:18,570
He was a woman who was wearing men's

2009
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:18,930
clothing.

2010
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:21,130
The mix up.

2011
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:23,990
So also in the Old Testament, if a

2012
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:25,570
man dresses like a woman, he's put to

2013
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:25,830
death.

2014
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:27,290
And if a woman dresses like a man,

2015
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:27,730
blah, blah, blah.

2016
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:28,070
Right.

2017
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:30,250
So they go against all that stuff.

2018
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:33,970
Now, you know, that's, you know, all that's

2019
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:34,890
contractual, too.

2020
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:36,910
When you look at like biblical stuff, that's

2021
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:37,610
contractual.

2022
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:38,430
Right.

2023
00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:40,090
Remember in Exodus, Moses says, if you want

2024
00:54:40,090 --> 00:54:41,250
to do this, let us let me know

2025
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:41,550
now.

2026
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:41,790
Right.

2027
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:43,230
If you don't want to do it, then

2028
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:43,930
this, that and the other.

2029
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:45,250
It's all contract.

2030
00:54:45,370 --> 00:54:46,510
All laws are contract.

2031
00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:49,510
So, you know, the spiritual side too.

2032
00:54:49,610 --> 00:54:51,410
So these are all contracts that are being

2033
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:52,970
performed on.

2034
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:54,770
When you see these transvestites, they don't know

2035
00:54:54,770 --> 00:54:54,910
it.

2036
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:56,390
They're totally it.

2037
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:59,550
It's no one knows what's going on.

2038
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:00,930
That's why I'm like, I've had it here.

2039
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:04,290
You know, like what I've always said, you

2040
00:55:04,290 --> 00:55:06,210
doctors don't know what's going on.

2041
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:07,030
Lawyers don't know.

2042
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:07,730
Accountants don't know.

2043
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:11,290
Because if they did and no university professor

2044
00:55:11,290 --> 00:55:13,790
knows anything about the subject they're teaching, because

2045
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:16,950
if they did, the people they were talking

2046
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:18,730
to you would not understand what the hell

2047
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:19,310
they were saying.

2048
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:20,630
It would be like a young as they'll.

2049
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:21,970
I got to meet that.

2050
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:22,630
John Buckett.

2051
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:22,950
Hungry.

2052
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:24,330
Let me die is what they would be

2053
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:24,530
saying.

2054
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:25,950
I don't know what you're talking about.

2055
00:55:26,170 --> 00:55:29,010
To me, that sounds like a nursery rhyme.

2056
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:29,750
I got no idea.

2057
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:30,330
You know?

2058
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:30,990
Yeah.

2059
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:33,110
So the doctors don't know what's going on.

2060
00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:34,490
I've even know people in the medical.

2061
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:36,190
I'm like, you know, I haven't met anyone

2062
00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:38,270
in the medical that knows how the human

2063
00:55:38,270 --> 00:55:39,930
body works to doctors.

2064
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:41,290
And they never message me back.

2065
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:41,490
Yeah.

2066
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:42,250
You know, whatever.

2067
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:44,750
So I need to get a group of

2068
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:47,750
them on where I'm going to show when

2069
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:50,010
things work for venue and all that.

2070
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:50,970
I might have the venue.

2071
00:55:51,230 --> 00:55:52,450
And I just have to fish out maybe

2072
00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:53,290
one or two more.

2073
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,130
Because if I have only one medical person,

2074
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:56,390
it doesn't look good.

2075
00:55:56,470 --> 00:55:57,530
I need to have at least two or

2076
00:55:57,530 --> 00:55:57,890
three.

2077
00:55:58,050 --> 00:55:58,710
Three makes a crowd.

2078
00:55:58,830 --> 00:55:58,970
Right?

2079
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:00,570
Well, three makes you in the audience.

2080
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:00,790
Right.

2081
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:01,930
Asking questions.

2082
00:56:01,930 --> 00:56:03,930
So I present an idea like vacuum.

2083
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:05,090
And they ask questions.

2084
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:06,830
And you don't get to.

2085
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:07,830
We talked about this.

2086
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:07,970
Right?

2087
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:09,090
You don't get to see their face.

2088
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:11,390
But it'll be more realistic because they're asking

2089
00:56:11,390 --> 00:56:13,750
questions from a perspective, a working perspective.

2090
00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:14,070
Right?

2091
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:14,410
Right.

2092
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:17,150
Versus layman's perspective and put out a video

2093
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:17,430
like that.

2094
00:56:17,530 --> 00:56:20,350
And no, it won't be on YouTube because

2095
00:56:20,350 --> 00:56:22,330
there's so much stuff to talk about.

2096
00:56:22,430 --> 00:56:23,410
Maybe the next one.

2097
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:24,130
Remind me.

2098
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:26,110
We're going to get a little deeper into

2099
00:56:26,110 --> 00:56:28,130
how the human body works because I'm going

2100
00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:29,710
to maybe put out some more stuff that

2101
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:30,570
I've never discussed.

2102
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:31,930
It's critical.

2103
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:32,630
It's important.
