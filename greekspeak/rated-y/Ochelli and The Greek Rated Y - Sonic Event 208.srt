1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:11,700
Hey, hey, Rated Y, and 208, anyway, Sonic

2
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,160
Event, and here it is, Greek, you know,

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,960
only feedback I got this week was about

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,940
dog food and organs and stuff, but, and

5
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,860
they wanted to talk about that, sometimes you

6
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,420
can get it for free at certain grocery

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,340
stores, other places they sell it to you,

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,380
good quality, etc.

9
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,320
But very important, that organ meat, why?

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,380
Because it makes the system work for that

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,940
kind of animal, and which kind of animal

12
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:34,640
are we talking about?

13
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:38,140
Generally, people have dogs and cats, and am

14
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,260
I wrong on any of this yet?

15
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,040
What's going on?

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,960
Well, they typically eat the organ meat first,

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,420
the muscle, just muscle meat is toxic.

18
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,640
Let me give you an example, when we

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,960
enjoy steak and stuff, you know, people, generally

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,560
enjoy steak.

21
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,100
People don't, let's say I'm going to get

22
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,960
beef or pork or chicken or lamb, they

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,720
don't understand that that's just muscle.

24
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,840
People don't think of it that way, right?

25
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,819
The organ meat is really where it's at,

26
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,160
all along.

27
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,800
That's another discussion, really, it's a big discussion,

28
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,580
why, but typically when zoos were first started

29
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:14,580
and they fed the animals muscle meat, they

30
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,340
got sick, and they needed the organ meat.

31
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,840
Also, if you study them in the wild,

32
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,420
you'll see how the pack of lions or

33
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,540
whatever always howls out the carcass first, right,

34
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,620
before they eat the legs and arms, right,

35
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:26,920
you notice?

36
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,300
So yeah, so yeah, I wanted to get

37
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,060
into the human body because it's very important,

38
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,220
and also I want to see if I

39
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:37,260
could eke out some support on it, because

40
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:37,880
it's very important.

41
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,000
In other words, the more I study, let's

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,580
just say the more I've been studying, I've

43
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,000
been studying the human body since the 1980s,

44
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,500
early 80s, so it might sound cocky, but

45
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,220
I know a lot more than any doctor

46
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,500
I've ever met, a lot more, it's scary,

47
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,340
it's just like I know a lot more

48
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,220
than any attorney I've ever met, a lot

49
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,840
more, not just a little, and it scares

50
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,760
me to the point where these industries, medical

51
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,900
and legal industries, let's just say medical and

52
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,020
legal, are thriving, and they're so busy, right?

53
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,320
The police, wait a minute, wait a minute,

54
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,760
the police state is thriving behind you, I'm

55
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,040
sorry.

56
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,280
Yeah, you hear it?

57
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,040
But anyway, I'm going to go on the

58
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,100
other side, there's a fire, but I can

59
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,680
smell it, there's a fire somewhere, you know

60
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:25,780
what I mean?

61
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,620
Oh, it's a fire, okay, no, no, no,

62
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,500
it's just because it was so loud, it

63
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,380
was drowning you out, right, I needed to

64
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:31,500
interrupt you.

65
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,220
Oh, it should have been, okay, but this

66
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,600
is what I was saying, the people are

67
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,840
going there, and what are they going for?

68
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,940
What are they getting?

69
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,540
Sorry.

70
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,500
It's unbelievable, no, it's fine, no, it's fine,

71
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,440
yeah, I'm sheltered right now.

72
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,720
Yeah, now it's way better.

73
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,380
You know that smell when a house is

74
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,720
burning, it's kind of like paint, have you

75
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,580
ever stripped paint or smelled burning paint?

76
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,140
Oh, absolutely.

77
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,820
That's the most, and a roofing material, when

78
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,300
you, yeah, I can always tell what's burning,

79
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,080
whether it's a car, or a house, or,

80
00:02:59,380 --> 00:02:59,480
you know.

81
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,620
There's certain kinds of plastics that I find

82
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,480
absolutely suffocating when people are burning them, you

83
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,620
know, like they throw them in one of

84
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,080
their fire pits or whatever, and it's like,

85
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,480
oh my God, what did you just throw

86
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:08,840
in there?

87
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,840
Yeah, well, they have a distinctive smell, it's

88
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,020
just like spectrography, you know, when they burn

89
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,480
things in a laboratory, the spectrum of light

90
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,900
that it gives off is an ID for

91
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,480
the element.

92
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,840
So anyway, these industries are busy, and people

93
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,060
are going to them and thanking them for

94
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,280
their profession, and they don't know anything at

95
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:27,660
all.

96
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,600
And they're functioning, the society's functioning like this,

97
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,280
it's kind of like, what a planet of

98
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,380
dumbasses, right?

99
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,800
It's just dumb-ass-ville all the way,

100
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,640
all the way, all the way.

101
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,280
So what it is possible to do is

102
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,240
form an elitist group that teaches a more

103
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,440
elite human, like better, elitist meaning elite, just

104
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,660
what the word means, to go and give

105
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,040
hints and bring it down to the DIY

106
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,620
level.

107
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,720
I've been, like, I was looking at surgery

108
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,420
procedures, thorax, stuff like that, for the past

109
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,380
month, and I'm like, you know, you only

110
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,800
need like 10 days of training to do

111
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,380
that, to become a surgeon.

112
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,680
There's not much to know, right?

113
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,320
You have to understand, you know, the dermis,

114
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,360
you have to understand, like, you know, you

115
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,120
got to get through the skin, let's just

116
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,519
be practical.

117
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,340
You got to go through, you got to

118
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,340
enter the body somehow, orthoscopy's great, you know,

119
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,720
you make a hole and you send a

120
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,920
probe in there, and then tools that are

121
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,580
accompanied the size of the probes, you don't

122
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,740
have to cut someone open, right?

123
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,080
But even in trauma, trauma's completely different, but

124
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,200
the surgery, I mean, I can teach someone,

125
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,980
train someone to do surgery in less than

126
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,340
a week.

127
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,740
The hardest part about the surgery is you

128
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,440
have to have lightning-fast reflexes, right, because

129
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,600
everyone's different, right?

130
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,560
You know, in other words, you can open

131
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,100
someone up and there's not a drop of

132
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,560
blood, and the same exact procedure, it's just

133
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,100
like gobs and gobs everywhere, right?

134
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,740
It's just like they're bleeding to death, right?

135
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,680
Oh, yeah, no, even the smallest tiny incision,

136
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,420
I've actually experienced it where I figure the

137
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,260
same type of incision, I would get that,

138
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,340
you know, okay, it's going to be a

139
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,760
simple leak, no problem, I should be able

140
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,060
to dab it real quick and get it

141
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,960
out of there, and they spring like a

142
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,560
freaking garden sprinkler on me.

143
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,700
Yeah, that's a release of yin, and what

144
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,460
I'm saying is, okay, everything has to be

145
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:19,860
combined.

146
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,500
So you know how they do prep before

147
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:21,940
surgery?

148
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,360
They give you a sheet of paper, don't

149
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,560
eat, don't drink, don't, right?

150
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:24,920
Yeah.

151
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,060
Well, we're going to have a list of

152
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,400
things to eat and condiments.

153
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,400
Mm-hmm.

154
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,180
We'll get into it.

155
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,480
I'm just going to bounce around a little

156
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,460
bit over here, okay?

157
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,580
So you know how the body, the food

158
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,200
goes through the intestinal, the GI tract, and

159
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,160
nothing gets absorbed?

160
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,860
It has to be broken down into the

161
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,280
right condition for the body to convert it

162
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,840
to energy, and then on the inside of

163
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,660
the body, it converts to gas, liquid, and

164
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,520
solids, right, carried by the cells.

165
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,060
Some of the energy is carried by the

166
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,840
cells and then converts it when it gets

167
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,580
to its destination.

168
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,100
Another example would be when you see blood

169
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,460
cells under a microscope.

170
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,060
There's a whole variety of stuff, and also

171
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:04,520
fungus.

172
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,680
You see every kind of living organism sometimes,

173
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,780
amoeba, you know, all that stuff in blood

174
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,220
samples.

175
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,800
What these people don't realize that I even

176
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,680
spoke to someone who has a live blood

177
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,080
test equipment.

178
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,560
I'm like, what good is that if you

179
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,060
don't know what you're looking at?

180
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,520
Yeah, but you don't.

181
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,980
No one does.

182
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:26,900
Very few people do.

183
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,560
Now here's where I have a question, right?

184
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,720
When it comes to induction, wouldn't it be

185
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,380
better to sort of label the general way

186
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,100
that induction occurs to give people an idea

187
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:36,720
of the process?

188
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,320
Because look, it doesn't just simply, okay, on

189
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,480
one side of the wall, it's this.

190
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,540
Next side of the wall, it's that.

191
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:42,820
Yeah, that's right.

192
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,540
It does, but there's a zone, an intermediary

193
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,520
zone where it's turned into biological energy.

194
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,100
But it's biological.

195
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,540
It's like a pseudo matter.

196
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,860
It's not really material, but the best, I

197
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,580
would try to explain it that it's like

198
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,460
that ectoplasm stuff, but it's transparent goo.

199
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,480
It's like a, not quite like mucus, but

200
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,020
it has less density than water.

201
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,280
And that's what's carried.

202
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,860
They call it plasma.

203
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,240
The plasma is not plasma.

204
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,340
There is plasma, yes, in the body, but

205
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:22,540
it's like a form of plasma that materializes

206
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,320
material.

207
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,360
Yeah, and that's the thing, is when it's

208
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,220
in that plasma state, it's energy, but it

209
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,520
has some of the characteristics.

210
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,480
No, no, I mean material plasma, not the

211
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,980
woo-woo plasma that they're calling electrical plasma.

212
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,540
When I say plasma, I mean like the

213
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,680
blood plasma, but it's in that category.

214
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,700
If you were to discern the material, the

215
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,600
nutritive energy as it goes into, as it

216
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,920
forms in the blood vessels around the intestine,

217
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,720
because if you look at a cross-section

218
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,360
of the intestine, especially the large intestine, either

219
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,680
one, inside of the, you know, look at

220
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,040
the lumen of the opening and then the

221
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,120
walls, it's completely saturated, just like the eyeball

222
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,560
is saturated with blood vessels, right, even more

223
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:01,840
so.

224
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:02,300
Right.

225
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,780
And it's completely sealed.

226
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,020
There's no absorption.

227
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,500
I assure you, nothing goes through.

228
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,680
If you study the older texts about absorption,

229
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,000
they know what I'm talking about.

230
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,820
They call it absorption.

231
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,600
They have all these other terms.

232
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,900
There's three categories of how the nutrition passes,

233
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,480
how you gain nutrition from food, and it

234
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,400
becomes cellular matter and all these other things,

235
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:22,620
right?

236
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,300
But it's confounding to really think about how

237
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,540
it works, because we're taught in such a

238
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:33,860
base physical reality that we tend to ignore

239
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,880
or exclude these things that we would consider

240
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,360
to be phenomenal now, right?

241
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:37,919
Right.

242
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:39,500
It's a phenomenon.

243
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,700
But one of the prerequisites is the quality

244
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,140
of the biological vacuum.

245
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,260
But let me just, I just want to

246
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,720
go back to, the body's made up of

247
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,440
solid, liquid, and gas, and what happens is

248
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,320
the quality of the energy being transferred from

249
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,080
the intestine, digestion also happens in the mouth,

250
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,400
right?

251
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,080
So we're talking all the way from the

252
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,860
mouth to the anus.

253
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,220
The entire process is taking effect.

254
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:12,060
But when the body requires gas, liquid, and

255
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,360
solid from the nutrition, it'll draw what it

256
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:14,740
needs.

257
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,120
But there's also a dictate that if the

258
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,280
food that you're eating is very active or

259
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,460
overly nutritious, it will send more, right?

260
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,320
And you'll get an overreaction, right, in the

261
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:25,660
body.

262
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,140
So what you're saying is the body's entirely

263
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,800
made of solid, liquid, and gas, but there's

264
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,900
also an energetic component, which is separate from

265
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,620
those things.

266
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,360
Well, that would be the biological vacuum, and

267
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,180
then the energetic component that converts what's in

268
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,340
the intestine or in the lungs, the air

269
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,000
in the lungs, let's say, into what the

270
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,680
body needs.

271
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,680
That's the second component.

272
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,400
The energetic components would be the biological vacuum.

273
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,500
What's inducing?

274
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,580
What's creating the vacuum?

275
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,520
Like think of it in a base mechanical

276
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:57,860
sense.

277
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,340
I need to draw a vacuum on something.

278
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,000
Well, you bring out this vacuum pump, and

279
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,600
it pulls a vacuum, right?

280
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,200
Okay, yeah.

281
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,000
Okay, so what's creating the vacuum?

282
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,020
What's inducing?

283
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,240
What is making the body make the vacuum?

284
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,200
That's the big confounding mystery.

285
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,740
But it's directly related to the body's ability

286
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:18,100
to draw nutrition through the intestinal wall.

287
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,600
Right.

288
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,560
You know, energetically.

289
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,560
Now, that's the other component that I've been

290
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,120
looking at.

291
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,700
Okay, because if you're creating an artificial vacuum,

292
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,040
right, it's based on conditions that are applied

293
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,020
to the container, which creates the vacuum inside

294
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:31,400
of it.

295
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,500
Now, but that's not the case with this

296
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:33,620
biological vacuum.

297
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,280
No, it's not artificial.

298
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,980
It actually, let's just, well, artificial means it's

299
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,360
made by design, and nature is made by

300
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:40,800
design.

301
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,680
So it's all artificial, or it's all natural,

302
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:42,880
right?

303
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,460
Yeah, but I'm saying if you were inducing

304
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,640
a vacuum in a container.

305
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,600
Synthesized would be a better choice of words,

306
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:47,880
right?

307
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,160
Synthesized, okay, fine, fine.

308
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,420
So if I was synthesizing a vacuum, it

309
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,580
would be based on conditions applied to the

310
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,380
container from an external force.

311
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,440
But in this case, this exists.

312
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,540
In all living things, plants have it.

313
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:01,780
Yeah.

314
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,780
All animals, cells, single cell, anything alive has

315
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:05,920
it.

316
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,220
And the way you kill something is by

317
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,060
arresting that biological vacuum.

318
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,880
Now, they don't say that when they want

319
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,320
to poison in toxicology or when something is

320
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,840
burned to death or whatever.

321
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,140
Or, you know, a human is killed many

322
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:20,960
different ways.

323
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,220
Why does the biological vacuum cease, right, when

324
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,240
there's a mass trauma, right, or mass toxicity,

325
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:29,460
right?

326
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,080
So these things need to be studied.

327
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,240
It's a very grim subject.

328
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,220
Maybe if we can learn more about the

329
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,180
biological vacuum and what it takes to turn

330
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,740
it off, right?

331
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,340
And it seems to be a switch, like

332
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,340
shock, for example.

333
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,620
Well, most people up until the 19th century

334
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,400
died of shock or infections of the mouth,

335
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:48,960
teeth.

336
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:49,420
Right.

337
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,320
Or poisoning because they, you know, is the

338
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,540
food, especially white people, is this food that

339
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,980
didn't season their food properly.

340
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,660
How is this food, Mary?

341
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,540
Oh, it's fine.

342
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,160
You know, I think this horse has turned.

343
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,200
You know, eat it anyway.

344
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,720
And then the next day they're all, you

345
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,880
know, a couple of days they're dead, right?

346
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:04,860
Right.

347
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,960
From food poisoning.

348
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,620
These were common ways of dying.

349
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,280
So these are things that stopped the biological

350
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:12,960
vacuum.

351
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,420
Toxicity and trauma.

352
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:16,620
Shock.

353
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,460
When, you know, shock is purely mental, right?

354
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,440
If you're, like, the best soldiers are, you

355
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,820
know, even in World War II were doped

356
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,560
up with meth and synthetic cocaine and things

357
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,220
like that, right?

358
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,940
You want to be, if you're going to

359
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:35,020
go fight in a battle to, you're willing

360
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:35,840
to give up your life.

361
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,080
Yeah.

362
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:36,540
Shit, man.

363
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,560
You want to take a serious, serious stimulants,

364
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:39,860
right?

365
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,240
Right.

366
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,180
This is very normal.

367
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,920
They gave them some.

368
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,920
It's not talked about.

369
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,160
Yeah.

370
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,180
Because they're illegal now.

371
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,400
A painkiller and a stimulant.

372
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:46,740
OK.

373
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,040
So that you've got plenty of excess energy.

374
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,440
You can, you know, fight.

375
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,480
You could psych yourself up.

376
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,580
But I'm telling you, the chemicals, the cocaine

377
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,320
is a hell of a drug.

378
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,560
But here's the thing.

379
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,700
Someone like that going to their battle and

380
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,820
have their arms shot off and keep going.

381
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,100
Right.

382
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,880
Blown off completely and keep going.

383
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,940
Where someone in a car accident, you know,

384
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,540
a guy works in a joint car and

385
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,640
sees his arm off, came off.

386
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,160
He goes into shock and dies in two

387
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,100
minutes from suffocation, basically.

388
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:17,080
Right.

389
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,460
You see what I mean?

390
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,500
So it's psychological.

391
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,000
So there's a psychological component that triggers shock.

392
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,500
They stopped using mask trousers, which was something

393
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,620
that prevented shock.

394
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,420
Or when someone was in shock, kept sustain

395
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:28,620
them.

396
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,560
So there's the trauma, toxicity and the mental

397
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,520
side that can arrest the biological vacuum.

398
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,220
So if we study, we don't know what

399
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:38,560
it is.

400
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,680
But if we study what things affect it,

401
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,220
maybe we can learn more about it.

402
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,160
It's kind of like we've heard of this

403
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,940
mythical creature known as a bear.

404
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:46,700
Right.

405
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,780
No one's really seen one, you know, like

406
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,180
Bigfoot.

407
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,580
But let's just say it's a bear.

408
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,280
But we've had glimpses of them going through

409
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,400
your garbage can if you live adjacent to

410
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:55,960
a forest.

411
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,220
So let's set up a lab.

412
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,180
Right.

413
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,780
With some garbage cans with varieties of food

414
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,300
and wait to see these bears come.

415
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,380
And then we'll photograph them, maybe capture one.

416
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:05,660
Right.

417
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,400
You see what I mean?

418
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,200
That's what I want to do with the

419
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,140
biological vacuum.

420
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,760
How do we induce it?

421
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:14,120
Because the whole thing is inducing it.

422
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,780
But again, remember, there's no free ride.

423
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,980
Just because you know how to create the

424
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,040
biological vacuum doesn't mean you'll live forever or

425
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,700
heal everything.

426
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:21,620
Right.

427
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:22,600
Either.

428
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,000
But we don't know enough about it.

429
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,280
But through my studies yet so far, I

430
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,260
know what stops it.

431
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:34,660
The toxicity, mental effect, mental trauma and physical

432
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,060
trauma stops it.

433
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,340
Bloodletting, tremendous bloodletting and all that.

434
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,360
So what induces it?

435
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,540
Well, what happens if you look at conception

436
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:48,260
or germination of a seed or conception in

437
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:48,660
animals?

438
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,560
The cells that are in that condition already

439
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,260
have a biological vacuum.

440
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:56,580
It's very important.

441
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,200
There are some seeds that the husk is

442
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:58,540
broken.

443
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,240
That's OK.

444
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,640
It's important.

445
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,380
If the seed is damaged, it won't germinate.

446
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,600
It's in a closed shell.

447
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,880
Some seeds do, though.

448
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,360
And if you look at the ovum and

449
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,000
the sperm for conception, they're already in a

450
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,880
biological vacuum.

451
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,780
They're living cells.

452
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,240
So how do we see where it starts?

453
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,080
You see, that's very, very difficult.

454
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,820
Also, how do we capture it from its

455
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,280
inception?

456
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,440
So I'm putting these things out.

457
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,340
And I'm not naive.

458
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,620
The chances of someone joining.

459
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,860
This might sound really.

460
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,320
Well, I don't care what people think.

461
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,920
The chances of someone emerging from a conversation

462
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,940
like this or a proposal or things that

463
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,580
I'm putting like this to work with me

464
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,680
on it is like I could go.

465
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,200
I better play the lottery on the Powerball

466
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,340
and win the Powerball before someone comes forward.

467
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:46,620
Right.

468
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,380
I mean, I'm not naive, but I'm putting

469
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,000
it out anyway.

470
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,000
Just like I say, go, you know, if

471
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,340
I had too many beers, go play the

472
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:53,840
Powerball.

473
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,980
OK, I play the Powerball.

474
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,280
Then I find out a month later because

475
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,200
I'm not going to look at the ticket

476
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,720
that I won.

477
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:58,900
That's possible.

478
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,240
Right.

479
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,020
Right.

480
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,940
Isn't it possible?

481
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:01,740
Yeah.

482
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,220
So same here.

483
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,060
I'm putting this out because there might be

484
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,000
someone out there listening or someone listening that

485
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,880
brings this up.

486
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,580
I hope they can communicate because you can't

487
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:10,900
communicate.

488
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,460
We will bring up anything I'm saying.

489
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,660
If you could have halfway decent communication skills

490
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,980
and bring it up to someone who brings

491
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,200
it up to someone who brings it up

492
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,640
to someone who knows someone who might be

493
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,340
interested would probably be more of the reality

494
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:22,840
of it.

495
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:23,220
Right.

496
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,000
All right.

497
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,000
So I'm being sarcastic because I'm not that

498
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,360
stupid.

499
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,160
I mean, I'm not that smart, but I'm

500
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,000
not that stupid.

501
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,200
And I'm not naive.

502
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,840
But if you can try to be naive.

503
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,100
Yeah.

504
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,440
But if you can multiply the number of

505
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,840
tickets bought, you do increase your chances.

506
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:38,420
That's right.

507
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,940
So the more I talk about it, the

508
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,040
chances do increase.

509
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,840
Now, what's important here is because like I

510
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,100
was stating earlier, these medical community and legal

511
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,220
community, let's say the medical community, they're morons.

512
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:48,900
Period.

513
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,920
That's just if you were to classify them

514
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,040
by law of averages, they're definitely morons.

515
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,220
Are there exceptions?

516
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:54,700
Yes.

517
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,620
The successes that they have with surgeries and

518
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,840
stuff like that, who I can train in

519
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,360
any type of surgery in less than a

520
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,780
week, anyone, is because they've gotten that from

521
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,079
the military development.

522
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,000
All of that surgery was developed by the

523
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,319
military.

524
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:07,900
Why?

525
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,260
Anyone that takes basic military, military, let's say

526
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,960
from an academic point of view, it's better

527
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,740
to injure an army than kill them because

528
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:21,339
an injured soldier takes two soldiers to maintain.

529
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,359
So when you literally injure even a small

530
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:27,240
portion of an army, you've basically disabled most

531
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,220
of the army.

532
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:28,920
Right.

533
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,540
To support them.

534
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,580
So the so the thing was because when

535
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,800
they're dead, you know, they're not going to

536
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,280
develop surgeries for the dead.

537
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,080
They're going to use the dead for practice,

538
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,900
which is wrong, by the way.

539
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,480
You're not going to learn much other than

540
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,340
basic anatomy.

541
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,100
And the anatomy does change when you die,

542
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,600
by the way, rapidly.

543
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:50,120
They wanted to minimize the field hospitals and

544
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,020
the wounded.

545
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:51,960
Right.

546
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,840
In reality, the bookkeepers, if you're wounded, they

547
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,000
just put a bullet in your head.

548
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,720
That would be the best reality.

549
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,160
And keep moving.

550
00:17:59,320 --> 00:17:59,620
Right.

551
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,120
So if you're injured, you take a suicide

552
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:02,780
pill.

553
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,580
So being injured is the same as a

554
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,640
fatality.

555
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,700
You get it.

556
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,300
Then you would have one hell of a

557
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,240
dominant army, just like with Alexander the Great

558
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,280
and other invasions.

559
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,740
What they did, they wanted to show that

560
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,640
they meant to take over a city or

561
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:19,980
a town.

562
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,560
So when they landed with their ships, they

563
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,080
set their own ships on fire.

564
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,060
Right.

565
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,780
So that means they you know, there's no

566
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,240
way back.

567
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,560
You know, so every man.

568
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,720
Well, like if I were to design a

569
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,580
military, if you're injured, you take a suicide

570
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,120
pill.

571
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,900
Well, see, that's why if you observe the

572
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,100
stuff like Alexander.

573
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,280
Yeah, if you observe Alexander and one of

574
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:38,480
those movements.

575
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,280
Yeah, if that was known, then we wouldn't

576
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,840
have 90% of the medical procedures that

577
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,580
exist today.

578
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:44,940
Right.

579
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,240
But I'm just saying, I'm giving that as

580
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:46,900
a hypothetical.

581
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:47,400
Okay.

582
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:47,960
Right.

583
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,960
That would be a perfect army.

584
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,760
Or you move to a robotic army.

585
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:52,900
Right.

586
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,740
Then there's none of this, oh, I lost

587
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,640
my brother or my father or my sister

588
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,200
or whatever.

589
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:58,740
None of that.

590
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,900
Go to pure robots.

591
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:00,380
Right.

592
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,100
So and drones, which is that seems to

593
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,980
be the case since the 80s, by the

594
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,180
way.

595
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,160
You remember the early robots in the 80s?

596
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,020
Military ones.

597
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:08,500
Matter of fact.

598
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:08,780
Yeah.

599
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,300
In the 80s, 40 years ago.

600
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:11,780
So anyway.

601
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,900
They had little they had little tank tracks

602
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,300
on their for feet.

603
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:15,900
Yeah.

604
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,380
Tracks to attract rent or skid steering.

605
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:18,760
Yeah.

606
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:19,560
So.

607
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,440
So the thing to do now is to

608
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,500
come up with an elitist way of treating

609
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,380
the human body for any kind of ill

610
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:31,220
or whatever injury, trauma, toxicity, but not bringing

611
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,100
it to the professional class, bringing it to

612
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,320
the DIY class.

613
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,680
You know, in other words, the people like

614
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,520
what I've always been saying, you go to

615
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,000
a neighborhood.

616
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,020
Hey, I just moved here.

617
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,780
Let's say it's friendly.

618
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,680
You know, let's just say, you know, one

619
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,320
out of 100 chance you live, you live

620
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,360
in a neighborhood where people want to know

621
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:46,780
each other.

622
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,020
Right.

623
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,580
That's not good, by the way.

624
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,920
By the way, that's for me.

625
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,220
I don't know any of the neighbors around

626
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:53,400
me.

627
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,720
I mean, I've used to I've been here

628
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,680
20 some odd years, same place.

629
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,060
But now I don't want to know who

630
00:19:59,060 --> 00:19:59,420
they are.

631
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,060
You know, I just wave hello and it's

632
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:01,820
like, yeah, whatever.

633
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,320
You tell me their name and I'm like,

634
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:03,620
anyway.

635
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,500
Then it's like a minute later, what's their

636
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:05,640
name?

637
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,180
I don't know.

638
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,820
I don't even bother recording it.

639
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,400
So but here's the thing.

640
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,840
Let's say you have a friendly neighborhood.

641
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:12,660
Oh, yeah.

642
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,240
That guy, Jimmy, three houses down.

643
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,480
He's really good with cars.

644
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,720
You know, I've been through this before.

645
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,520
And Amy up the street here, she makes

646
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,300
the best bread.

647
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,020
And any baked goods are really good.

648
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,040
This guy right here, he knows the guy

649
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,640
across the street.

650
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,560
He's an electrician.

651
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,080
He's good at general construction.

652
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,080
This guy here, he's a plumber.

653
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,800
He's he's a lawyer down the street.

654
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,080
You know, if you need anything, go to

655
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:32,220
him.

656
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:32,400
Right.

657
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,320
But you notice that they never say this

658
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,720
guy is a really good medic.

659
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,360
And if you need anything, go to him

660
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,360
for you.

661
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,200
You ever hear that?

662
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,320
Never, ever, ever.

663
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,300
Not even historically.

664
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,040
Historically, you would be called a doctor, a

665
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:49,160
physician, not a medical doctor, which, as the

666
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:54,000
name implies, physical, physicality, physiology, physician.

667
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:54,440
Right.

668
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,640
Not medical doctor.

669
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,100
Doctor doesn't mean anything.

670
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,700
Anyway, doctor just means teacher, a doctor of

671
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,680
what medicine, pharmaceuticals.

672
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,180
Right.

673
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,700
So, by the way, many people I've heard

674
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,400
I've been logging this now for 40 years.

675
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,000
When they go to these idiots and they

676
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,840
have an ailment and he just he's the

677
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,360
doctor is booked all day.

678
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,680
So he's not going to really do any

679
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,020
homework or study to find out how to

680
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,420
help you.

681
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,360
You know what they do?

682
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,140
They say here are painkillers or antibiotics.

683
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,640
Look, you probably have some unknown virus.

684
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,020
That's what they tell everyone.

685
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,720
You have an unknown virus.

686
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,560
I can't help you.

687
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,220
I can give you a painkiller.

688
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,660
You know, they give you this, whatever the

689
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,440
fashionable one is or this fashion.

690
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,560
By the way, the new antibiotics will kill

691
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:35,780
you.

692
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,000
Do not take any new.

693
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,660
If you believe you might need some antibiotics,

694
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,560
stick with the penicillin or amoxicillin.

695
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,500
Do not take any of the other stuff.

696
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,420
They almost they almost even are trying to

697
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:50,920
message and signal this to you by how

698
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,940
bright and like a toxic turquoise blue.

699
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:54,840
The pills come in.

700
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,460
They come in these toxic colors, you know,

701
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,260
like those are you ready?

702
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,020
Like those day glow colors almost.

703
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:00,580
Yeah.

704
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,060
But talk to pink looking stuff and all

705
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:03,260
that.

706
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:03,560
Yeah.

707
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,580
Because sometimes the medicines I do experiment with.

708
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,820
Let me take a little bit of that.

709
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,540
This is for this.

710
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,280
Let me just take it.

711
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:08,940
Oh, my gosh.

712
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,640
It doesn't do anything.

713
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,200
It'll kill you.

714
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,920
It'll just completely destroy your insides.

715
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,720
Right.

716
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,040
Right.

717
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,480
Yellow stuff like that.

718
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,040
Yeah.

719
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,340
But yeah, they're signaling, you know, because like

720
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:17,900
in the jungle.

721
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,260
Right.

722
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,280
We can't help it.

723
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,980
We live in a natural environment, no matter

724
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,840
how much we synthesize or make artificial.

725
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,060
What's interesting is, you know, we still follow

726
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,000
the rules of the jungle.

727
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,920
If you go into the jungle and you

728
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,160
see an extremely bright, colorful frog.

729
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,120
What is that signaling?

730
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,440
I'm poison.

731
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:36,380
Yeah.

732
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,760
So this is what they're doing.

733
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,240
They're following.

734
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,100
They can't avoid it.

735
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,360
Like the poison arrow frogs that a friend

736
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,280
of mine had for a while.

737
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:48,120
They had this bright orange like the cones

738
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,040
on the street color on their back.

739
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,360
With small black spots also, I think.

740
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:53,740
Exactly.

741
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:54,940
Yeah.

742
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:55,200
Yeah.

743
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:56,980
Yeah.

744
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,440
So this is where it's at.

745
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,300
And then make a little handbook on basic

746
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:01,660
surgery.

747
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,720
The problem with surgery is it's just squeamish.

748
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:08,240
But just go get a pig, a big

749
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,820
piece of pork or something.

750
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,480
Other animals don't.

751
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,060
The closest you're going to get to human

752
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:13,800
is pork, right?

753
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,080
Right.

754
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:14,420
Pig.

755
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:15,680
Yes.

756
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,340
Get everything.

757
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,420
Muscle tissue.

758
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,520
Cut everything down to.

759
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,900
It'll be bled out, though.

760
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,440
The pig when you get it.

761
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,220
If you get one that's not bled out,

762
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,280
you'll have pretty accurate depiction of what human

763
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,460
is like.

764
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,960
You don't need to do that, though.

765
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,160
I think on the DIY level, you could

766
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,000
even do orthoscopic.

767
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,660
Here's the other thing also.

768
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,180
With the archaic stuff and the timing with

769
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,660
the Phoenix and all that, I believe they're

770
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,200
going to cut back public services and the

771
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,040
grid way before 2040.

772
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:45,980
Right.

773
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,940
And you know how fast time goes.

774
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,900
I mean, we did the original O&G

775
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,720
in 2015, and that's ridiculously.

776
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,580
It seems ridiculously like recently.

777
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:56,280
Right.

778
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,120
But it's 10 years.

779
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,480
So 10 years is ridiculously short period of

780
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,200
time for me.

781
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,040
Very much so.

782
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:01,260
Right.

783
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,280
Yeah.

784
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,060
For other people, if you're really young, it

785
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:04,520
seems like.

786
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,700
Because when you're really young, you don't want

787
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,100
to be young.

788
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,040
You want to become older.

789
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,860
And when you're older, you keep wondering what's

790
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,160
next, what's next, what's next.

791
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,300
And before you know it, you look at

792
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,640
your watch.

793
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,800
Five years just went by.

794
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,080
Right.

795
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,100
That's a Pink Floyd song about that.

796
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:17,340
Right.

797
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,540
Every older person I ever talked to would

798
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,340
always tell me that.

799
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,860
You don't realize it, but time is going

800
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,040
to fly by real quick.

801
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,580
And when you're 15 or 20, you're going,

802
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,160
no, it's not.

803
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:26,660
It's slow.

804
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,100
It's exactly the opposite.

805
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,500
You get older, and then it starts flying

806
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:31,840
by.

807
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,440
It's like, oh, gee, that was already 20

808
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,020
years ago.

809
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:34,760
Yeah.

810
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,160
You start doing stuff like that.

811
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:40,660
Well, I have extremely well and good, fond

812
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,560
memories with high retention of spending time in

813
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,520
the New York Public Library on 42nd and

814
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,780
5th, back in 1984, 85, and reading.

815
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,980
It was like a year ago, right?

816
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,200
And that's, what, 40 years ago?

817
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,500
Man, get out of here.

818
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:55,980
Yeah.

819
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:56,400
Really?

820
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,320
And I do the same thing when it

821
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,360
comes to the 90s, because I'm like 10

822
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,200
years younger than you.

823
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,060
So exactly.

824
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,780
There you go.

825
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,840
So I reach the same age.

826
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:06,780
So I'm like, yeah.

827
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,940
I mean, I remember it like it was

828
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,040
maybe a year or two ago, and it's

829
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:10,960
40 years, right?

830
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,260
So holy crap.

831
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:12,800
Yeah.

832
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:12,960
Okay.

833
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,400
Maybe I have attributes that allow me to

834
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,200
do that, because I know people that, you

835
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,180
know, a goldfish, right?

836
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:18,720
Mm-hmm.

837
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,560
Don't know what happened yesterday.

838
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,780
And I could get that way, too.

839
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,520
But certain things that are important, you remember.

840
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,620
Now, enough about those statements that I made.

841
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,800
I'm not going to continue more on the

842
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,680
human body in general, but I got an

843
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,400
email from someone regarding the thyroid.

844
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,160
Okay.

845
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,540
And I get a lot of questions like

846
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,720
that regarding parts of the body in certain

847
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,220
conditions.

848
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,340
And the first thing I want to just

849
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,580
tell people, why don't we just, because we're

850
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,340
all going to follow this standard operating procedure,

851
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,240
right?

852
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:51,620
Because we have, because, all right, if you

853
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,860
ask any organ of the body, oh, that

854
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,980
is a medical question or a biological.

855
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,540
No one says a biological question.

856
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,940
Everyone says medical, right, always.

857
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:58,500
Well, why?

858
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,380
Don't call it medical.

859
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,920
It's a biological question, right?

860
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,980
And if it's biological, then why do we

861
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,420
have to always lean to this clinical way

862
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,060
of looking at it, academic way?

863
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,280
Stop it.

864
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:08,760
Right?

865
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,360
So let's do this.

866
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,460
The anatomy can be trusted, because like I

867
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:15,520
said, these morons through the decades, I didn't

868
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,480
notice, we've been looking at the human body

869
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,300
for thousands of years, but we only have

870
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,800
information from the past 75 to 100, best,

871
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:22,500
right?

872
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,160
Mm-hmm.

873
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:23,680
Why?

874
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,140
But anyway, I want to interject something.

875
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,680
You know, the Greeks, the ancient Greeks knew

876
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,840
the heart was not a pump.

877
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,880
They said that the blood moved like a

878
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,660
wave throughout the body.

879
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:33,760
Mm-hmm.

880
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,580
Think about it.

881
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,140
So if the heart is a brake, right,

882
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,720
anyway, okay, they were correct.

883
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,780
All right, so let's go back to this.

884
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,880
So we bring up something like the thyroid.

885
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,120
I said I'm going to discuss this on

886
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:46,520
a sonic.

887
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,020
Okay.

888
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,420
We can trust the anatomy, because these guys

889
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,800
are good ditch diggers, these medical academic people.

890
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,100
They're good at digging ditches.

891
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,140
Like if someone digs a really good ditch,

892
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,600
you build a foundation, you can't just say,

893
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,240
hey, look at this dummy.

894
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,420
All you could do is dig ditches.

895
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,340
Man, you dig a good ditch, you're important,

896
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:01,680
right?

897
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,400
It's important that you do that well, right?

898
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,500
No, it's very useful.

899
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:07,560
It's very useful to have properly measured and

900
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,480
directed ditches.

901
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,460
It absolutely is.

902
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,560
Yeah, or grunts.

903
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,520
These are all grunts.

904
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,360
So the grunt work is necessary.

905
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,660
So let's call them grunts.

906
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,660
And these grunts now, they've been able to

907
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:20,420
amass, unfortunately, most of the stuff depicts a

908
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:24,180
cadaver type anatomy, right?

909
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:24,560
Right.

910
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,760
So let's look at the thyroid.

911
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,040
When you look at the thyroid anatomy, you

912
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,060
notice how it wraps around the throat section,

913
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,540
the windpipe and all that area, you know,

914
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,700
voice box and all that, right?

915
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:33,340
Okay.

916
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,200
Now, it's slightly different when you're alive.

917
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,160
When you're dead, what happens is it expands.

918
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,020
So it's always going to seem, everything's going

919
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:42,460
to seem more conflated when you look at

920
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,160
their anatomy books.

921
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,400
You always have to keep that in mind.

922
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,380
That's from a cadaver, not a living being,

923
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:46,660
right?

924
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,820
So, and there's rapid change that takes place

925
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,240
within minutes.

926
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,260
Not extremely, like there's not a big difference,

927
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,220
but there is a difference.

928
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,060
So just keep that in mind.

929
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,300
First thing, remember, when you look at what

930
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,520
these grunts have put together in anatomy, it's

931
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,420
always a cadaver.

932
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,660
So this is what it looks like when

933
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:05,240
you're dead, but I'm not dead, right?

934
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:08,000
So we have to kind of go back

935
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,160
and say, okay, I'm not dead, but that's

936
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,420
what it looks like when you're dead, close

937
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,080
enough, but that's not it, right?

938
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:13,400
Okay.

939
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,680
So then we look at the location of

940
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,100
the thyroid.

941
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,260
It looks like you had built this system,

942
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,760
you know, that connects the head.

943
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,880
You know, you have the structure, the spine,

944
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,860
the muscles, you know, the spinal erectors, all

945
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,680
the neck muscles that come up from the

946
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,460
clavicle, you know, the collarbone, all that stuff.

947
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:32,820
You have a windpipe, you have glands, you

948
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,700
have lymphatics, you have blood vessels, you have

949
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,800
all covered in skin.

950
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:39,260
Then you have this thing, like a spongy

951
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:44,680
material that wraps around your throat, literally.

952
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,100
It almost looks like an alien.

953
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,720
You know in the alien movies when the

954
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,160
thing came out and stuck to your face?

955
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,420
Yeah, it kind of looks like something went

956
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,000
into your body and stuck to that part

957
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,140
of your body, right?

958
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,980
It doesn't look like it was grown there

959
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,900
naturally, right?

960
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:02,240
All the other elements that I described look

961
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,060
like they were naturally emerging, just like when

962
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,080
a tree grows, right?

963
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,980
You have the various, you know, the sinew,

964
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,920
all of the structure that you see between

965
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,340
like the upper thorax, the upper part of

966
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:16,380
your center body, everything in your neck.

967
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,140
It looks very naturally combined.

968
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,260
Then you have this thing, sorry, it just

969
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,100
wraps around like an alien creature.

970
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,520
What the hell?

971
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:24,640
What the hell?

972
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,960
Almost like it's a sensor.

973
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,180
You know, when you have like, imagine an

974
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,840
elaborate plumbing technology where you have all these

975
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,200
pipes and the plumber wants to know what's

976
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,020
going on, so he straps this sensor thing

977
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,660
around your pipe, right?

978
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,440
And it has an x-ray built into

979
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,620
it, sonic, like sonogram, it has temperature gate,

980
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,140
you know, you strap it around the pipe

981
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,760
and it gives you all this data, right?

982
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,280
Imagine something like that, like an alien creature

983
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,620
came and strapped around your neck.

984
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:50,940
Think of it like that.

985
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,640
Then you start to see clearly what's going

986
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,520
on with the thyroid.

987
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,480
First of all, what kind of activity happens

988
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,000
in the neck area there?

989
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,160
In the neck area, what you're going to

990
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:06,040
have is extreme, you have an interchangeability of

991
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,480
mobility.

992
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,100
In other words, your body could be facing

993
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,640
one way and your head could go another

994
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,880
way and it's a very robust structure, right?

995
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:13,980
Very robust.

996
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:14,180
Very robust.

997
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,540
And you have all the connectivity.

998
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,600
What's above your neck?

999
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,640
Some people that I've met, they actually have

1000
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,260
something called a brain up there, right?

1001
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,360
And that has connectivity.

1002
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:26,580
So massive connectivity has to go through that

1003
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:26,960
area.

1004
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,180
What else is happening in that area?

1005
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,640
It's one of the most critical junction points

1006
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,280
to connect the regulation of the intake of

1007
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,420
air to the lungs, the organs that process

1008
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,000
it, right?

1009
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,400
It would be much more efficient to have

1010
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,120
gills on your chest, wouldn't it?

1011
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,640
Think about it.

1012
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,900
It would, but all these key things come

1013
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,700
together at the head, though, because you have

1014
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,140
your ears, your eyes, all of these sensory

1015
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:51,240
inputs.

1016
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:51,900
Sure, all the venting.

1017
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,480
Yeah, but let's just stick with the neck.

1018
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,140
So with the breathing, when you design an

1019
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,760
engine, there's something called runner length.

1020
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,620
It's critical when you do airplanes, combustion engine

1021
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,200
airplanes.

1022
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,360
Runner length is, if you have a combustion

1023
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,860
engine airplane and you screw up the length

1024
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,880
of the exhaust pipe, you may not have

1025
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,760
enough power at certain altitudes.

1026
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,300
So runner length is the amount of distance

1027
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,300
that the air, either going into the engine

1028
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,940
or coming out of the engine, must maintain

1029
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,740
for the engine to be optimum, right?

1030
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,300
So the neck represents a runner length that's

1031
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:21,820
necessary.

1032
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,640
So there's a lot of things put together

1033
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,000
by design, engineering.

1034
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,080
It's very good engineering.

1035
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,040
The worst engineering, obviously, is the groin.

1036
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,480
Why do you have something like this next

1037
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,060
to something like that, you know?

1038
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,620
The sewer next to the, right?

1039
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:39,380
You have the sewer and the reproduction at

1040
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:39,680
the same.

1041
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,060
And that one I'll never understand.

1042
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,380
I'll just say that and leave it as

1043
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:42,560
that.

1044
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:43,900
I'll never understand why you have the reproductive

1045
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,980
area and the sewer so close together.

1046
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,920
Yeah, reproduction, a giant bundle of nerves, and

1047
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,120
also your waste disposal vent.

1048
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,380
Yeah, right there.

1049
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,500
It's like, oh my gosh, is that a

1050
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,400
joke or what?

1051
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,000
You know?

1052
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,600
I mean, that's why I was, you know,

1053
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,400
I'm all in favor for a detachable penis

1054
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,740
or a detachable vagina.

1055
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,280
I think you can get vaginas now.

1056
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,020
You don't even, anyway, need the rest of

1057
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:06,320
the body.

1058
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:06,720
But anyway.

1059
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,580
Yeah, so anyway.

1060
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,980
They have flesh lights, too.

1061
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:12,460
That's another.

1062
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,540
Yeah, so I don't mean to be serious,

1063
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,500
but that's something that I just chalk up

1064
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,340
as being like, don't, so let's not go

1065
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:18,580
there.

1066
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,460
But we just did.

1067
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:19,880
We did.

1068
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,580
Okay, so the thyroid, when you look at

1069
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,380
it, the main thing, you have all this

1070
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,180
circulation of lymphatic fluid.

1071
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,920
Remember, you have more lymphatic fluid than you

1072
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,120
do blood in your body running up and

1073
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:31,800
down, right?

1074
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,200
You have all this stuff draining and going,

1075
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,580
passing directions.

1076
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,840
You have the nerves, all of the nerves

1077
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,000
generally that connect to the body pass there.

1078
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,600
You also have the air passing through there.

1079
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:47,500
You also have what else is going on.

1080
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,460
You have all those things that I mentioned

1081
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,620
are dynamic functions, but they're like in a

1082
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,680
passive location.

1083
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:53,760
They have to go through there.

1084
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:57,860
One thing that is the most dynamic and

1085
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,740
doesn't have to be used is what?

1086
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,140
Your speech, your voice box is there also.

1087
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,940
You've heard of the monks that have an

1088
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,640
oath of silence for like a month or

1089
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,980
40 days or whatever, right?

1090
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,140
I believe that has something to do with

1091
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:12,600
the thyroid.

1092
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,920
It's not just you'll be better off not

1093
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,520
speaking, right?

1094
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,680
And you notice when certain people are in

1095
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,940
certain emotional conditions, I'm not speaking to you.

1096
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,720
That ties in with the thyroid.

1097
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,060
So let's take it a little further.

1098
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,000
If you speak too much, you can damage

1099
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,600
the thyroid, right?

1100
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,520
Over-stimulate, not damage.

1101
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,020
Over-stimulation, which leads to irritation.

1102
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,860
Lack of recovery then leads to persistent damage.

1103
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,700
That's the proper way to think of it,

1104
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:41,920
right?

1105
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,320
Yeah, that sounds right.

1106
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,100
Right?

1107
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:48,120
You have overuse, irritation, lack of recovery, then

1108
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:48,460
damage.

1109
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,700
Because you can overuse and if you recover,

1110
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,780
hey, you recovered, right?

1111
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:52,140
Right.

1112
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:58,000
Now, not speaking will under-stimulate.

1113
00:33:59,080 --> 00:33:59,920
Under-stimulate.

1114
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:03,120
And under-stimulation has to be recovered also.

1115
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,040
Think about someone who's in bed for a

1116
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:05,240
month.

1117
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,719
Under-stimulation, can they get up and walk

1118
00:34:07,719 --> 00:34:08,340
whenever they want?

1119
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,199
Very rarely.

1120
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:09,560
Right.

1121
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:12,260
What they always call atrophy because things are

1122
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,239
not being used.

1123
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,159
Under-stimulation.

1124
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,780
The old use it or lose it kind

1125
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,139
of thing.

1126
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:16,560
Yeah.

1127
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:19,420
So let's take these extreme points and then

1128
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,980
bring it to the Midland where most people

1129
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:21,460
are, right?

1130
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,780
Because most people are not always speaking all

1131
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,219
the time unless you're the Greek or whatever.

1132
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,679
And then you have most people that are

1133
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,580
not always silent all the time.

1134
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,420
Unless the husband and wife are locked in

1135
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,000
a room and they ate each other.

1136
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,139
So these are extreme situations.

1137
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,820
So most likely you're going to have a

1138
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,980
moderate amount of speaking.

1139
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,239
So if you have, here's the simple, this

1140
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,800
is like the cheapest way to go about

1141
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:45,960
it.

1142
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,360
If you have thyroid issues, other than the

1143
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,840
passive dynamic set up of the structure that

1144
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,219
I mentioned by looking at it, the only

1145
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:57,560
thing that is not mandatory and not happening,

1146
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:01,560
let's say involuntarily, that affects the thyroid directly

1147
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,380
is speech.

1148
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,240
All the other things you do, they're all

1149
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,220
involuntary, right?

1150
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,160
The structure of the spine, the nerves, the

1151
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,260
fluids running, all involuntary.

1152
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:13,260
But the only thing involuntary is speech.

1153
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,020
Right.

1154
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:14,560
Okay.

1155
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,060
So mind what you're doing.

1156
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,680
Are you the type of person that speaks

1157
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,980
too much, doesn't speak enough, let's say, underspoken,

1158
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,000
overspoken, right?

1159
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,120
And I would try both.

1160
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,280
Maybe not speaking for a little while, speaking

1161
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,640
less, or maybe speaking more.

1162
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,480
See how that affects the thyroid health.

1163
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:35,000
Also, there's this whole thing about hormone production,

1164
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:35,260
right?

1165
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:40,560
And we brought up the thyroid before this

1166
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,920
email even came in regarding radiation.

1167
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,120
I think it was with you, wasn't it?

1168
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:44,400
Yeah.

1169
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:48,220
So there wouldn't be much concern about taking

1170
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:50,520
iodine unless you have irradiated particles in your

1171
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:50,820
body.

1172
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,100
If you get irradiated, right, by x-rays

1173
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:57,580
or anything like that, taking iodine doesn't help

1174
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,360
because it's done.

1175
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:58,960
Right.

1176
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:02,300
But when you intake particles that are now

1177
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,240
irradiating you from the inside out, yes, the

1178
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,860
iodine will damp that out somewhat.

1179
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,200
Because remember, it's a halide.

1180
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,680
So anyway, the other thing with it is

1181
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,160
we're looking at the structure of the thyroid.

1182
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,340
It looks very spongy.

1183
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,220
It's not, actually.

1184
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,300
I mean, it's pretty robust, but, you know,

1185
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,820
it's a soft tissue.

1186
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,180
It's robust enough to hold the structure.

1187
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,780
What level of biological vacuum does it have

1188
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,400
to retain?

1189
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,280
What level of nutrition?

1190
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,080
You know, each organ takes on its different

1191
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:31,520
nutrition.

1192
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,780
You ever hear, like, this food's good for

1193
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,300
your kidneys, this food's good for your liver,

1194
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,140
this, right?

1195
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:38,680
Like, for example, what food is really good

1196
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,260
for your kidneys?

1197
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:40,500
Beans.

1198
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,260
Oh, my gosh.

1199
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,560
How'd you figure that out?

1200
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,200
Because they're shaped like a kidney.

1201
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,180
Exactly like a bean, yeah.

1202
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,440
But it is possible to overdo it, right?

1203
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,260
So all these other things are similar.

1204
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,420
Like, for example, it's an unclean food, but

1205
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,000
the little, what do they call it, baby

1206
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,860
rock, rock little clams?

1207
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,600
I forgot what they're called.

1208
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,740
Rock, you get it, right?

1209
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,860
Being in Jersey Shore, you should know your

1210
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:06,180
clams.

1211
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:06,700
Come on, man.

1212
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,820
Yeah, yeah, well, there's the Chesapeake Bay type,

1213
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,940
and then there's the- The little rock,

1214
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,280
the ones with the rock in the name,

1215
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,220
what is it?

1216
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:16,380
Anyway, those look exactly like your liver.

1217
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,980
Eating those can help rebuild your liver, by

1218
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:19,340
the way.

1219
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,420
Right, the internal part of a clam does

1220
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,120
look a lot like a liver if you

1221
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,540
look at the part.

1222
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:29,060
Exactly, and there's a Japanese medicine based on

1223
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:31,360
that, not based on it, but actually issues

1224
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,220
that people have damage to their liver.

1225
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:36,500
So anyway, lungs, lotus root.

1226
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,380
Look up lotus root and take a cross

1227
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,820
-section of lotus root and then look at

1228
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,900
the cross-section of the lungs.

1229
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,060
It's identical, right?

1230
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,740
There's a study of, this is not the

1231
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:52,140
fix for the organs, but it's a corresponding

1232
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,100
archetype that exists in nature.

1233
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,980
What would be corresponding to the thyroid, right?

1234
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:02,380
A sea urchin, sea urchin material?

1235
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,280
Is that what it is?

1236
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,860
I don't know, I haven't looked at it.

1237
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,140
It would be sea urchin probably, and that

1238
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:07,980
needs to be studied.

1239
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,320
So this is all I'm going to put

1240
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:10,760
out for now.

1241
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,700
I need to look into it a little

1242
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,200
bit, meditate on it a little bit more,

1243
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,820
but I wanted to put this out because

1244
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,300
this is a primer and a way to

1245
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:20,500
approach any part of the body.

1246
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,100
It's biology we're looking at.

1247
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:22,940
What is its function?

1248
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:25,260
What's involuntary?

1249
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,920
What's voluntary, right?

1250
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:32,320
What form of intake can we immediately adjust

1251
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,880
our diet to benefit that, right?

1252
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,960
Yeah, those questions.

1253
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:41,520
Now, by the way, from any perspective, and

1254
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,260
I know a lot of, there's been, I

1255
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,120
think most of the people listening to me

1256
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,500
have not fallen for the paleo diet or

1257
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,460
the, what's the other one where you eat

1258
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,680
the keto?

1259
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:51,580
Ketosis.

1260
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,280
Yeah, oh my gosh, what's next?

1261
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,100
You know, these people that do the keto

1262
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,100
and the paleo, I have a better diet

1263
00:38:59,100 --> 00:38:59,480
for them.

1264
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,580
Hold your breath diet.

1265
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,040
Hold your breath for like a day.

1266
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,420
How about that?

1267
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,020
We'll put that together with the suicide pill

1268
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:06,640
for the military.

1269
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,040
Anyway.

1270
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:08,700
Sounds good.

1271
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,420
By the way, a thyroid to me looks

1272
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,680
like two things, one, an old lady's bra,

1273
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:15,780
and two, kind of like a butterfly almost.

1274
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:16,760
Mm-hmm.

1275
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:17,320
Yeah.

1276
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,380
There's symmetry.

1277
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,000
Yeah.

1278
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:19,800
There's symmetry.

1279
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:22,560
So study that, and we'll revisit this again.

1280
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,860
I'll dig in.

1281
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:28,680
Unfortunately, the internet is, you know, what's it

1282
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:28,840
called?

1283
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,760
The dead internet theory that most of the

1284
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,220
stuff is.

1285
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:32,760
Yeah.

1286
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:33,640
Yeah.

1287
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,200
Not real.

1288
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:34,540
Okay.

1289
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,740
It's fabricated by machines.

1290
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,180
Right.

1291
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:37,720
All right.

1292
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:38,460
Yeah, or something.

1293
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:38,680
Yeah.

1294
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:43,020
So I'll see what's been archived.

1295
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,560
I might have some things to access thyroid

1296
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,640
study, but not from a medical clinical, because

1297
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,760
they don't know, those morons.

1298
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,480
The most you're going to get from the

1299
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,580
medical community is what they call chemical biopsies

1300
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,240
and anatomy.

1301
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,940
And remember, it's all from dead people.

1302
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:57,660
Right.

1303
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:58,400
Right.

1304
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,940
They don't know how to perceive the organ

1305
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,320
while it's still alive.

1306
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,440
Right.

1307
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,520
I'm sure they have done studies like that,

1308
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,080
you know, where they tear people up, you

1309
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,860
know, in death camps or prisons.

1310
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:10,540
Yeah.

1311
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,280
Or, you know, they just abduct people.

1312
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,200
Right.

1313
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,660
One does wonder why a see-through skin

1314
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,260
kind of study hasn't been done.

1315
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,100
You know what I mean?

1316
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,960
Where there must be a way to do

1317
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,280
that.

1318
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:20,980
Right.

1319
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:21,220
Yeah.

1320
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,760
There's many ways, but the best way to

1321
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,360
do it is to project intuitively.

1322
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:26,900
I'll give you an example.

1323
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,980
Like right now, what's interesting is I was

1324
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,940
like, oh, man, you know, I've been studying

1325
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:33,700
water for more than 20 years intensely and

1326
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,820
developing water technologies intensely.

1327
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,260
And now that we've got the lab funded

1328
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:42,080
and any resources we want, I realized what

1329
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:42,500
a joke.

1330
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,060
Didn't need the lab at all.

1331
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,540
I create everything in my head.

1332
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,000
Everything gets done in my head.

1333
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,160
I don't need the lab at all.

1334
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,180
The purpose of the lab is after I

1335
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,880
bring it up and bring it forward or

1336
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,660
manifest it down to the finest detail in

1337
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,760
my mind, then I can build it in

1338
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,220
the lab and blow it up or test

1339
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:00,860
it or whatever.

1340
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,020
Right.

1341
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,060
But most of the time when I manifest

1342
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,020
the idea, it works.

1343
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,560
So we can go right to production with

1344
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:07,940
it.

1345
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:08,460
Right.

1346
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,840
Because the principle is so strong.

1347
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,580
So that was a pretty good joke to

1348
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,320
be run on me.

1349
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,040
Right.

1350
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,080
I think I've mentioned it.

1351
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,980
Some things have been brought to me that

1352
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:22,120
according to devices that I was using or

1353
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,480
brought up like the scalarator, all small form

1354
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,600
factor, and now they needed something very large.

1355
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,240
And we can't make a scalarator that large.

1356
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,800
And in 15 minutes, I came up with

1357
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,320
a solution.

1358
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,360
And now there's another thing, and I came

1359
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,740
up with a solution for that based on

1360
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,340
the same principles.

1361
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,300
This is freaking amazing.

1362
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:35,800
It's great.

1363
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,320
And lab, I mean, they're still looking to

1364
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,120
set it up or whatever.

1365
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,600
When you have the funding, you know what

1366
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:41,960
they say.

1367
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,040
If you don't use it, you lose it.

1368
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:43,240
Right.

1369
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:43,960
Absolutely.

1370
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,580
So, yeah.

1371
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,320
So the same thing is there's an intuitive

1372
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,800
aspect to this.

1373
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,480
And, you know, these moronic medical people, academics,

1374
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,960
whatever, they say, oh, you can't do it.

1375
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,760
They'll tell you stuff like that.

1376
00:41:58,780 --> 00:41:58,960
Right.

1377
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,460
It's kind of like they'll make fun of

1378
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,200
you for saying that.

1379
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,800
It's kind of like Max Planck when there

1380
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,000
was some convention in Paris back in the

1381
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,200
20s or 30s before the war broke out

1382
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:10,820
in Europe.

1383
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:14,140
And they asked him about his scientific studies.

1384
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,620
There was someone who was interviewing him for

1385
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:16,160
a newspaper.

1386
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:22,560
And he says, what about your studies with

1387
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,560
science and nature?

1388
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,060
And he says, oh, science has nothing to

1389
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:25,680
do with nature.

1390
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,800
This is Max Planck saying this.

1391
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,260
Right.

1392
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,680
You know, he's like one of the great

1393
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,700
atomic theorists.

1394
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:32,020
Right.

1395
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:32,960
Supposedly.

1396
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:33,900
Moron.

1397
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:35,320
Yeah.

1398
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,400
So, yeah.

1399
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,460
I think we're on a good foot with

1400
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,760
understanding the basics.

1401
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,180
And, by the way, did I mention that

1402
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:45,200
I went to chat GPT and asked them,

1403
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,240
is there a biological vacuum that holds all

1404
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,080
living things together?

1405
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:48,740
It says no.

1406
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:49,520
Yeah.

1407
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,540
You mentioned it last time.

1408
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:50,840
Yeah.

1409
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,100
Yeah.

1410
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,120
Very emphatically.

1411
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:52,780
No.

1412
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:54,940
Very emphatically, too.

1413
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:57,140
So why are they saying that when obviously

1414
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:57,700
there is?

1415
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:58,320
Right.

1416
00:42:58,540 --> 00:42:58,980
Why?

1417
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,620
There's a big agenda here that we've hit

1418
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:02,940
into.

1419
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:05,660
But it also does that with, you know,

1420
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,020
it says show me the laws that state

1421
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:10,060
all debts belong to the United States.

1422
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,700
And it shows you, like, anywhere between three

1423
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,820
to 15 different places in all the codes

1424
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:14,180
and laws.

1425
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,380
Then if you ask it do all debts

1426
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,220
belong in the United States, it says no.

1427
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:19,780
Right.

1428
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,300
Even though it just showed you the laws.

1429
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,080
Well, you just ask.

1430
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:23,900
You don't ask it.

1431
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:26,280
You ask it show me which the verbiage

1432
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:26,880
in laws.

1433
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:27,080
Yeah.

1434
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,000
And it brings up the UCC here, the

1435
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,480
U.S. Code here, the Code of Federal

1436
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,300
Regulations here are laws that state all debts

1437
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,800
belong, you know, anyway.

1438
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:35,420
Yeah.

1439
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,720
So it's kind of I think I commented

1440
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,820
on the tritango that what all it is

1441
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:43,260
is, you know, the flight AI, all it

1442
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,420
is is, you know, flight simulator software.

1443
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,060
Yes.

1444
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:49,800
They took that logic train and converted it

1445
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,440
to looking up files and putting it together

1446
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:55,620
in a way that issues a human like

1447
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:56,160
response.

1448
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:56,900
That's all it is.

1449
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:57,740
There you go.

1450
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,800
It's flight simulator software.

1451
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,140
So, you know, you know how complicated flight

1452
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,840
simulated software can be in order to make

1453
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,200
conditions.

1454
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,020
But if they simplify it, then even, you

1455
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:10,360
know, a seven year old can fly a

1456
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:10,520
drone.

1457
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:10,960
So.

1458
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,000
Right.

1459
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:12,320
Yeah.

1460
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:13,780
And it looks very realistic.

1461
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,540
Subtle movements translate to subtle.

1462
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:16,520
Right.

1463
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:18,520
You program, you program wind speeds in the

1464
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,680
thing reacts like, you know, I was on

1465
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,080
one a long time ago and you put

1466
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,440
in a certain lateral wind speed.

1467
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,980
And no matter what you did, you couldn't

1468
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:26,460
fight it.

1469
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:27,480
And then someone who was a pilot is,

1470
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:29,400
yeah, it's exactly what it's like, you know,

1471
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,820
you couldn't get back on the runway, you

1472
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:32,200
know, no matter what you did.

1473
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:34,380
So it was pretty accurate.

1474
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,540
So, yeah, that's what they're doing.

1475
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,540
Don't be impressed by all this stupid shit.

1476
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:40,260
And one thing, you know, Trump and Musk,

1477
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,540
I think I should have said something about

1478
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:45,640
it when Trump, this is just total segue.

1479
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:48,880
When Musk was running everywhere with doge, you

1480
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,780
know, infiltrating, you know, and all that.

1481
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,420
So I said, this isn't going to last

1482
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:52,800
too long.

1483
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:54,060
I have a feeling they're going to have

1484
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:54,960
a falling out.

1485
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,860
I should have said something, but now it's

1486
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:57,180
too late.

1487
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:57,540
Let's see.

1488
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,120
Let's just not say, but I was saying,

1489
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:01,220
I think I did tell someone these two

1490
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:02,180
are going to have a falling out.

1491
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,760
This is what be everyone's being set up

1492
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,980
for publicity stunt here.

1493
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:05,760
And what happened?

1494
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,620
Yeah, but it's, you know, it's fake anyway.

1495
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,020
Oh, that's right.

1496
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:10,620
It's a public.

1497
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:11,800
In other words.

1498
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:12,380
Yeah.

1499
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:15,340
What Musk was doing was a publicity stunt.

1500
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,140
And the only way to accentuate it, you

1501
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:20,320
know, and as it's all distraction, by the

1502
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,440
way, this is all right.

1503
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,100
All of this belongs to the United States.

1504
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:27,800
And, you know, it's every government and major

1505
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,360
corporate employee is funding their own salaries, right?

1506
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,060
Everyone.

1507
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,260
And every single thing is meant to keep

1508
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:35,500
you distracted from getting to anything real.

1509
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:36,960
That's just the bottom line.

1510
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:37,680
Exactly.

1511
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:39,800
But, you know, it's funny to look at

1512
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,180
the play and all this is just going

1513
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:42,480
to go away because there's going to be

1514
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,140
something coming up in the news and the

1515
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:46,100
next, how long were they playing the dog

1516
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:46,360
thing?

1517
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,860
Doge thing thing for about a month, maybe

1518
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:49,220
a month.

1519
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:51,740
They were leaving in and out of stuff.

1520
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:52,720
And then I call it a move.

1521
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:53,200
Yeah.

1522
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:55,000
So this will play for another month and

1523
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,640
then watch what happens in about a month

1524
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,620
or before the fall.

1525
00:45:58,780 --> 00:45:59,900
We're going to have some kind of quote

1526
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:02,340
unquote event, you know, because remember you don't

1527
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:06,140
have any events in the summer, unless they're

1528
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:07,040
military events.

1529
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,040
Like the, when did the, the USS Liberty

1530
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,500
get shot up by the Israeli fighters that

1531
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:13,180
was in the summer.

1532
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:13,520
Wasn't it?

1533
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,920
I think that was in the summer and

1534
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,360
actually right now they're actually having these weird

1535
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:20,100
clashes in the streets in LA over the,

1536
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:23,060
you know, people are allegedly attacking federal agents

1537
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:23,720
who are doing ice.

1538
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:24,500
Yeah.

1539
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:25,140
Yeah.

1540
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,860
That started, that was, I saw that popped

1541
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:27,520
up today.

1542
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:27,860
Right.

1543
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,160
Yeah.

1544
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:29,240
Yeah.

1545
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:29,560
Yeah.

1546
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:30,400
Something like that.

1547
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,680
So that's yeah.

1548
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:32,240
Whatever.

1549
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:34,520
Yeah.

1550
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:37,420
And it'll justify the next thing as per

1551
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:37,680
usual.

1552
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,780
So there you go.

1553
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:39,360
Yeah.

1554
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,260
It's just a show because the people have

1555
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:41,960
to have it that way.

1556
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:46,600
Yeah.

1557
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:47,220
Yeah.

1558
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:49,580
Yeah.

1559
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:50,540
Yeah.
