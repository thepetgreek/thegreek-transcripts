1
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,520
Rated Y, Sonic Event 209.

2
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,780
Anyhow, Greek, how are you?

3
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,960
Hey, just you.

4
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,400
Yeah, just doing, man.

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,300
You brought up the Facebook someone posted or

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:21,560
whatever.

7
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,120
That's Sam or Archon.

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,400
It's five more power to him.

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,940
I stick with my stuff about the reason

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,380
for doing this from the beginning was to

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,540
find people a jam with.

12
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,660
I don't mind if someone completely blags.

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,480
That means steals everything I'm doing and says

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,820
that it's theirs and cusses me out at

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,100
the end in the process.

16
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,900
I don't mind as long as it gets

17
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,680
out there, because I see the human condition

18
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,580
as being so piss poor that when you're

19
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,960
really, really piss poor, every penny helps.

20
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,160
Right.

21
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,460
Imagine you're completely piss poor, just living out

22
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,920
in the gutter and someone gives you a

23
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,140
penny.

24
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,160
Isn't that great?

25
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,460
I mean, because it's not, you know, you're

26
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,100
on your way up.

27
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:01,340
Right.

28
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,940
Look, it's why people will steal the garbage

29
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:04,420
bags.

30
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:05,820
When I used to work at a store

31
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,880
and you go, why did somebody have to

32
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,540
steal three garbage bags while I'm doing my

33
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:10,880
job?

34
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,640
It annoyed the hell out of me because

35
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,820
I got to change the garbage.

36
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,220
It's if you do the math garbage bags,

37
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,000
about 10 cents, maybe more.

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,920
But that person doesn't have it.

39
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,080
So just to clarify, Sam's not stealing.

40
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,100
Greek speaks, not sinkers.

41
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,340
That was a project like you want to

42
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:26,640
do that.

43
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,980
I'm like, I don't know what I want

44
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,200
to do, but, yeah, I'll show up or

45
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,400
whatever.

46
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:29,840
So it's fine.

47
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:30,880
More power to him.

48
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,920
But then there's a Jamaican in me and

49
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,160
say, well, I say, start now.

50
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,420
I mean, you don't care about no down

51
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,720
Facebook month, you know, so I don't really,

52
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:40,920
you know, none of that.

53
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,580
And stick to it, because, look, even now

54
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,260
I got things moving with the water.

55
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,560
I've got things moving, sort of moving with

56
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,200
the audio, a whole bunch of other stuff

57
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,640
going to go back into some mechanical modification

58
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,160
of combustion engines.

59
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,040
This, that and the other.

60
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,700
And it's all being done just to get

61
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,380
it in the field.

62
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,440
Here's the thing.

63
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,340
One of the things that brought me the

64
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,900
most joy in the past two years was

65
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,759
when you get the water device into someone's

66
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,620
hands and they're like, oh, my gosh, this

67
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,800
is the best water ever.

68
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,080
And they're completely unrelated with the last person.

69
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,160
They don't know anything about the last person

70
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,820
who got one who said exactly the same

71
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,160
thing.

72
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,480
So, you know, moving that along, just getting

73
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,880
things out there that just make everything better,

74
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,240
whatever you apply yourself to is really what

75
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,620
I want to do and get other people

76
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,740
on it.

77
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,880
So it is possible for the Greek to

78
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,740
get some satisfaction out of things and not

79
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,480
just look at the entire shit show and

80
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,220
say to hell with it.

81
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:38,860
It's all garbage.

82
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:39,480
I don't care.

83
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,720
You actually get satisfaction out of something when

84
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,280
it goes right.

85
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,040
All the time.

86
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,200
It's a joke.

87
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,400
Anyway, forget the jokes.

88
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,020
And Facebook, the only reason why I bring

89
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,880
it up is because people were like, hey,

90
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,140
he said he won't do Facebook.

91
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,180
Why is he on Facebook?

92
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,780
And I just wanted to address it.

93
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,280
That's all.

94
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,560
But it's let's look at, for example, if

95
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,340
you look up Jason Brashear's archaic, I think

96
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,440
there's like 10 accounts on Facebook.

97
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,500
And he's said many times he's been banned

98
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,220
off of Facebook.

99
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,340
So how can it be banned off Facebook

100
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,280
and have 10 accounts?

101
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,540
Well, some people, some people lie and say

102
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,020
that and simultaneously have a Facebook page.

103
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,440
And really nobody ever calls them out.

104
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,160
Some people do that intentionally.

105
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,820
And other people just go and run with

106
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,520
their stuff.

107
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,940
And somehow they get away with it.

108
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,360
So this those platforms, YouTube, sorry, I mean,

109
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,920
however people say I personally view it, our

110
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,360
bottom feeder, the social media, YouTube is all

111
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,240
bottom feeder stuff.

112
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,280
And you like you'll never see a Lamborghini

113
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,400
ad in The New York Times.

114
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,720
Right.

115
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,740
Like think of a bottom feeder newspaper.

116
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,200
You'll never see an ad for Ferrari.

117
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,720
You never see an ad for a really

118
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,060
top notch stuff.

119
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,920
No, you don't have to advertise Porsche.

120
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,280
You don't have to.

121
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,700
Everybody knows what it is.

122
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,380
Everybody knows what a Corvette is.

123
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,180
Everybody knows what a Lamborghini is.

124
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,780
It's not even necessary.

125
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,180
It's vanity at that.

126
00:03:59,440 --> 00:03:59,700
Yeah.

127
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,300
You just want to stay away from that

128
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,300
bottom feeder stuff.

129
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:02,920
And I've always.

130
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,120
But, you know, I had the advantage of

131
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,180
back in the early 2000s, like before 2010.

132
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,740
This one guy, he's an investment capital investment.

133
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,580
He had a portfolio.

134
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,959
He had like Bunker Trump and that guy,

135
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,300
that late night talk show guy, Larry King,

136
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,680
and always doing their personal finances.

137
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,060
Yeah.

138
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,620
You got to be careful with Larry King.

139
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,200
But go ahead.

140
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,180
Yeah.

141
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:25,640
But anyway.

142
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,020
Yeah.

143
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,940
He's and his portfolio took a tank around.

144
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,520
This is around 2007, 2008.

145
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,580
He's going through the airport.

146
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:31,900
Yeah.

147
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,840
Karma's kind of real with Larry, though, because,

148
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,840
you know, he's a bit of a petty

149
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,260
thief.

150
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:36,920
But go ahead.

151
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,400
Yeah.

152
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,700
But he's this guy was going.

153
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,480
His name is Jim.

154
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,840
And his dad was part of the Filipinos.

155
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,160
CIA guy was part of the Filipino overthrow

156
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,840
of Marcos.

157
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,120
Right.

158
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:45,900
They did that.

159
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,360
Oh, yeah.

160
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:46,640
OK.

161
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,520
And, you know, anyway.

162
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,380
So he told me that there's this thing,

163
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,300
YouTube, that Google is going to get in

164
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,420
this thing to stay away from that stuff

165
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:59,220
because it's all it wasn't even really.

166
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,240
I think Facebook was just coming out around

167
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,860
that time.

168
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,760
Facebook existed right after he did that hot

169
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,620
or not website.

170
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,720
You ever see hot or not?

171
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,520
No.

172
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,220
But anyway, that history of that.

173
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,960
And he got into all the ins and

174
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,320
outs.

175
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,060
And also he was down with the people

176
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,080
who started PayPal and all that.

177
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,940
And I knew someone that was into something

178
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,380
like holistic healing.

179
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,000
And the guy, Peter Thiel.

180
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:27,380
Yeah.

181
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,400
I very flew in.

182
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,320
He had a foot problem and didn't really

183
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,020
hang out with him.

184
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,080
But so I've been around these people and

185
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,240
the way they casually speak on how negative

186
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,800
these platforms are casually.

187
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,820
It's kind of like here.

188
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,260
Give me a thing.

189
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,840
There's an article that's been on the Web

190
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,340
a while back.

191
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,320
Why do all these famous people have tape

192
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,720
over their cell phone camera?

193
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,040
Have you seen that article?

194
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:48,520
Yeah.

195
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,020
A hundred different ways.

196
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,220
They reword it and everything.

197
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,100
It's been put out.

198
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,120
I don't know how many.

199
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,320
Yeah.

200
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,460
And all these like they show Bezos.

201
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,020
We know the cell phone's got tape over

202
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:57,580
the cell phone.

203
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,260
They show who's the Facebook boy.

204
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,460
That boy was Zuckerberg.

205
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,160
Yeah.

206
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,520
He's got camera with tape on it.

207
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,460
And they show this other person who's tape

208
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,260
on their camera on the phone.

209
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:09,980
And I said, what is it?

210
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,540
What's the deal?

211
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,040
What are they?

212
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,500
Why are they not saying?

213
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,720
Why don't they do it?

214
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,400
Why are they doing that?

215
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:15,580
Right.

216
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,140
The older version, they used to show you

217
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,900
the laptop with the piece of duct tape

218
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,400
on it, too.

219
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:19,880
Yeah.

220
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,140
Well, the Lenovo that I have has a

221
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:22,820
slide switch.

222
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,560
And as you slide it over, you see

223
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,940
a red dot where the camera is supposed

224
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,640
to be like that.

225
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,380
Like they don't have another camera.

226
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,380
You can put a camera right where the

227
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,660
pixels are on the screen and have it

228
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,180
not look like a dead pixel.

229
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,260
You can put a camera in between the

230
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,500
crack of the keys on a keyboard, actually,

231
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,420
if you want to.

232
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,120
And there's a couple of good spots.

233
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:43,580
Yeah.

234
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,620
Because remember, it's not optical.

235
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,920
We don't do optical, very rare optical photography.

236
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,540
It's all numeric.

237
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,200
If you saw what a cell phone or

238
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,800
a smartphone camera actually sees, the lens, it's

239
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,480
all fisheye.

240
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,880
It's totally distorted.

241
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,320
So they have to numerically.

242
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,240
They know they've mapped out.

243
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,940
It's very simple to do numerically.

244
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,840
You just take a photograph of the grid

245
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,800
and you see how the lines bend in

246
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,760
that fisheye fashion.

247
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,300
And then you do a numeric field adjustment.

248
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:18,080
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

249
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,060
Greek, Greek, Greek.

250
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,160
It's already been referenced, right?

251
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,120
So it's all an interpretation.

252
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,460
You might have something in the peripheral part

253
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:28,900
of the photo.

254
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,840
Stop a minute.

255
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,480
And the photo, you know, the numeric photo

256
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,540
correction takes place.

257
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,140
Greek, Greek, stop.

258
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:34,860
Can you hear me?

259
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,120
Can you hear me?

260
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:36,660
Yeah.

261
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,220
I can hear you.

262
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,920
I can hear you stop a minute because

263
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,100
whatever you're doing is causing you to jump

264
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,060
around like you're a chewed-up cassette Tape

265
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,900
sound you're all over the place like you're

266
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,320
being okay.

267
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,240
That's the whirly gig.

268
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,420
I'm doing some weather work It always works.

269
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,000
I try to make some phone calls.

270
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,940
I set it up yesterday Okay, while I

271
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,700
was doing my setup and the phone would

272
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,600
just not work until I walked really far

273
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,600
away But it just sounded like you walked

274
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,700
near something that was really disrupting you.

275
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,540
So It's the world have you ever seen

276
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,680
a video short video the whirly gig Into

277
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,260
the weather.

278
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,380
No, I've looked at the weather stuff, but

279
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,460
I don't remember the whirly gig.

280
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,880
Yeah, it's a rotating device and It's so

281
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,680
funny because it you'd say it's passive You

282
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,640
can't say it's completely passive because it rotates

283
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,280
with a 30 rpm motor But it really

284
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,920
messes up the whatever the these phones work

285
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,200
on Yes, it's amazing it's a disruption in

286
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,179
many fields which of The ether the ether

287
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:35,179
which also affects, you know, the the signal

288
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:36,580
that you get from the Wi-Fi.

289
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,460
Anyway, I'm sorry It was just it was

290
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,700
absolutely useless there for a second No, it

291
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,659
was a good demonstration because if anyone else

292
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,620
can it has the device built because I

293
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,000
always explain how to me Yeah, this is

294
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,460
why I do it like for example here

295
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,060
The weather has been getting warm and it

296
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,300
you know, it's beautiful.

297
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,220
You come out at night in Tucson It's

298
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:53,820
like a chill.

299
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,200
I'm just want to put a jacket on

300
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,200
but in the day, it'll go up to

301
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,620
hundred three hundred four hundred and Five and

302
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,600
I was tired of that So, you know

303
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,740
the temperature around eleven twelve o'clock is

304
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,780
already at a hundred and then you know

305
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,720
It keeps heating up till about three thirty

306
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,140
four and then it stabilizes at your max

307
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,020
temperature Then it starts to drop again after

308
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,060
five o'clock, right?

309
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,620
Okay, so we had a high of a

310
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,040
hundred and four the other day and I

311
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,760
put the whirly gig on At noon it

312
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,980
was already over a hundred it was a

313
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,540
hundred and four or something And I put

314
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,780
the whirligig on and by one thirty or

315
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,500
two o'clock it dropped it below a

316
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,140
hundred degrees Remember, it's supposed to be getting

317
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,040
hotter and hotter and hotter It dropped at

318
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,940
four or five degrees consistently during the hottest

319
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,360
time of day What when the you know,

320
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,240
the graph the curve is getting going up

321
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,360
not if you say you put it on

322
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,480
when it you know It's big, you know,

323
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,100
if me reached its peak now, it's going

324
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,720
to be going down.

325
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,600
What's coincidental?

326
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,180
No, it actually cooled it on its way

327
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:47,560
up.

328
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,540
So it's very very effective and I just

329
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,320
want to bring That that's another thing by

330
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,040
the way dabbling with the weather work for

331
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,480
so long.

332
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,920
It's so provable the other thing yesterday I

333
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,820
was doing the weather work and like once

334
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,000
I was trying to make a phone call

335
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,780
and it wouldn't go through It was in

336
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,940
Tucson, Arizona, we had a hundred and three

337
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:13,920
one thousand and three millibar A Barometric pressure

338
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,240
it was the lowest barometric pressure in the

339
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,140
entire states except for Calgary, but that's Canada.

340
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,720
They don't count Calgary was at one thousand

341
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,520
and two But nowhere in the country was

342
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,420
it below a thousand and eight a thousand

343
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,320
and ten?

344
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,900
Millibar we because of the weather work.

345
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,140
I was doing a drop down to a

346
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,780
thousand three thousand and two millibar They give

347
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,600
me an example anything below a thousand and

348
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,940
ten you can have rain Giving an example

349
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:47,540
998 millibar is a thunderstorm Anything below 980

350
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,040
is most likely a hurricane.

351
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,700
So in other words, it's 4% humidity

352
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,200
here, right?

353
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,120
30% humidity is pretty normal and toy

354
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,580
you need at least 20% for your

355
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,860
skin to be in good shape It was

356
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,780
4% humidity with one thousand two millibar

357
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,580
and only in Tucson So what I'm trying

358
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,740
to say these are not like does it

359
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,900
work Does it not work, you know, like

360
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,920
when I was working with Jonathan Butts a

361
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,480
natural action tech not to mention They make

362
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,340
these devices like golf balls in the pipe

363
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,740
You know as this structures the water and

364
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,160
you can hardly tell when you use the

365
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,480
device or not anything This stuff is like

366
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,420
in your face.

367
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,380
It just slams you it's like my gosh

368
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,760
Like an example would be in physics if

369
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,840
you make a you give a water device

370
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,360
to a physicist And when you run the

371
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,680
water through it drops it one-tenth of

372
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,240
one degree.

373
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,820
He's like wow that works.

374
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,660
That's amazing one Cuz you know, they measure

375
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,900
things It doesn't matter how much it drops.

376
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,180
It's just that it's dropping it right one

377
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,080
-tenth of one degree.

378
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,040
Wow, that's great Well, the scalarator drops it

379
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,640
one to two degrees Every time consistently what?

380
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,560
That would make a physicist.

381
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,880
I mean to a normal the normie that

382
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,920
doesn't mean much even one two degrees out

383
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,960
any much, right?

384
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,780
So but to a physicist someone who's used

385
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:06,880
to measuring things critically Because that's what they

386
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,400
do But would be amazed astonished with one

387
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,580
-tenth of one degree imagine and then you

388
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,300
bring in a device that drops it one

389
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,160
or two degrees That's ten to a fold,

390
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,880
you know ten or twenty times more than

391
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,720
that And so in other words the stuff

392
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,900
that I'm dabbling in it's not whether it

393
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,260
works or not or what is it?

394
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:27,460
It's massive, you know massive influence on the

395
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:31,340
environment and materials and things like that This

396
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,700
way when someone learns how to make these

397
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,560
things or get involved with it You think

398
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,040
they could really see a change like it

399
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,380
really works, you know I decided to put

400
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,320
that out because when you tell people you

401
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,960
do, you know If you just introduce yourself

402
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,780
and then you introduce you do weather work,

403
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,860
you know the eyes roll and oh You

404
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,780
mean you do weather forecasting or you know

405
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:51,380
weather measurement?

406
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,860
No, no weather work They can't right now

407
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,980
If I tell ten people in public that

408
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,600
I do weather work weather engineering and then

409
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,980
like five minutes Later ask him what I

410
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,680
said nine out of ten will say yeah,

411
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,300
he's just measuring the weather.

412
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,740
They don't understand You know, it's that you

413
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,240
can actually manipulate it, right?

414
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,620
Well, look anyway another thing since you brought

415
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,700
up Brandon Joe Williams.

416
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,160
I was contacted Let me just get that

417
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,320
name back up in front of me.

418
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,380
I was contacted by Matthew and He was

419
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,720
wondering if Brent, you know Brandon's interested in

420
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,200
either being on rated Y with us or

421
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,520
of course alternatively if you don't want to

422
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,040
do that He could we could do we

423
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,760
have radically.

424
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,480
Well, we're in the same topic but radically

425
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,180
different He kind of brings up the law

426
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,860
side, which is fine And it's kind of

427
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,240
good when people just stand on on their

428
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,420
corner of their square.

429
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,520
I like to say that all four corners

430
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,000
You know look at all aspects, but yeah,

431
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,920
go ahead what about him Matthew?

432
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,220
Yeah, I know Matthew Yeah, it's rather unique

433
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,240
for somebody to want to be a guest.

434
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,320
So do you want to say?

435
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,600
Yes, let's do that Okay I just wanted

436
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,840
to know about that because I have that

437
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,760
message in front of me so I will

438
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,880
concur with him and tell me Let's just

439
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,460
let's just preempt the concept of him as

440
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,280
a guest where he'll have a recording and

441
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,760
he could put it on his channel So

442
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,040
let's just you know that day, you'll find

443
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,300
your cleanest dirty shirt brush your teeth comb

444
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,320
your hair We're gonna be on YouTube.

445
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,040
Yeah, it doesn't matter if I have an

446
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,900
image up or you do.

447
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,440
I don't care.

448
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,100
Whatever.

449
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,360
We'll do it I'm just saying image.

450
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,960
I just said brush your teeth comb your

451
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,700
hair I'm getting to the point where I

452
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,900
just need a toothbrush.

453
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,020
Okay, but it should be it should be

454
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,300
a teeth brush Are you concerned?

455
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,400
I was just gonna say you beat me

456
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:36,800
to it.

457
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,580
I was just gonna say are you really

458
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,240
that concerned?

459
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,620
I use my teeth brush and after I

460
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,320
mean, I don't have too many left, but

461
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,600
I Actually, I the dentist acquaintance that I

462
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,420
work with, you know, the relationship I would

463
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,980
the dentist is like, yeah, you know I'll

464
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,120
play basketball and after a basketball meet you

465
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,600
at the office.

466
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,860
Tell me what you want to do That's

467
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,860
the relationship I have or you know, I

468
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,660
I sit in the chair and he's like,

469
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,560
all right So what do you want me

470
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,300
to do?

471
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,440
You know, I'm like I just saw him

472
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,260
exactly what you want.

473
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,480
This is how it should be with all

474
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,580
these idiots I'm not it is.

475
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,880
Yeah Mostly idiots and you described this before

476
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,760
you need to know you need to do

477
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,760
your own study and know what it is

478
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,540
You need to ask Attorney a doctor a

479
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,260
dentist even a hair we think about the

480
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,540
hairdresser meme Why don't you sit in the

481
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,820
chair and say what would you like me

482
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,060
to do?

483
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,400
Right?

484
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,080
I'm a little off the top this that

485
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,380
Whatever.

486
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,260
It's the same thing.

487
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,320
You know, you can't trust these people implicitly

488
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,840
on everything because What is it now like

489
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,580
40%?

490
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:36,740
It's really high Surgeries are either unnecessary or

491
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,040
malpractice as it's like 30 or 2 or

492
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,280
40 percent There's a number thing where it's

493
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,120
either a mistake or something goes wrong or

494
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,340
yeah Yeah, absolutely necessary is like way up

495
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,280
there or they leave 70% Yeah, this

496
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,160
is what they're reporting.

497
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,780
So that means it's much worse, right the

498
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,120
neglect of leaving three sponges inside of you

499
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,300
I don't worry about it.

500
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,380
It won't bother you too much.

501
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,060
You know is where they accidentally leave their

502
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:03,200
tools in there, you know Yeah studying that

503
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,740
because that might that would be the next

504
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,540
if he into dentistry the next thing would

505
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,380
be surgery and by the way When you

506
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,740
ask a dentist, what is DDS stand for?

507
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,820
That's the most of them forgot and DDS

508
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,580
stands for a doctor of dental Surgery.

509
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,520
Oh, okay.

510
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,080
Yeah.

511
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,020
Yeah, you can you see the DDS right

512
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:20,620
after their name?

513
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,340
It's not MD.

514
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,640
I got you Is not a physician by

515
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,480
the way, it's also a computer term.

516
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:26,840
But good.

517
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,080
Yeah.

518
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,300
No, it's a man Intermix they intermix all

519
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,240
these things but I was studying surgery and

520
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,100
I'm pretty sure that let's say we had

521
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,340
a field hospital I can train anyone in

522
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:41,280
less than a week on many techniques on

523
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,960
surgery any kind of sir, you know, the

524
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,680
thing is not evasive surgery, but you know

525
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,620
necessary trauma Most surgery should be just implemented

526
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,220
for trauma.

527
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:53,480
Like for example People that have what they're

528
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,480
diagnosed with cancer.

529
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,260
No one has cancer, but it's diagnosed as

530
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:56,500
such.

531
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,520
It's a label, right?

532
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,080
And they have a tumor removed.

533
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,720
You never want to have that kind of

534
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,619
thing removed when it's inflammatory or on its

535
00:17:03,619 --> 00:17:06,480
way up You you need to start Quelling

536
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,960
it and making it go away with diet

537
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,380
and other things before you have it removed

538
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,680
because if you remove it when it's growing

539
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:17,839
and Expanding it's always going to come back

540
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,900
because remember the it's a roadblock, right?

541
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:23,380
It's to stop energy certain energy Movement in

542
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,760
the body, so you don't want to remove

543
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,380
it when it's in on its way up

544
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,680
you want to remove it on its way

545
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,540
out just like Traffic problem and somebody comes

546
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,340
along and steals your orange Oh, yeah in

547
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,940
the middle You'll just be making more Crashes

548
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,000
and a good example of that is look

549
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,280
at highway crashes during a snowstorm, right?

550
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,940
You don't see the car right there's usually

551
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,800
a hundred car pile up with semi trucks,

552
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,300
you know It's like they don't even know

553
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,720
that there's a pile up in front of

554
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,100
them And it's too late to hit the

555
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,160
brakes when they find out right exactly.

556
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,200
They they wind up running over three cars

557
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,480
that are already crashed Yeah, exactly.

558
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,940
Yeah, and it keeps going on and on

559
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,300
and on.

560
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,760
Yeah, so Yeah, so that's interesting on that

561
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,780
aspect because I'm telling you and I've been

562
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,300
saying for a while We need more people

563
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,780
to understand the physical body and to help

564
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,000
other people with it as we progress in

565
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,960
the shit show known as You know, whatever

566
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,680
society you live in, you know, so anyway

567
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,180
What else you got?

568
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,000
What do you got?

569
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,360
I mean, I think I've just been all

570
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,120
over the place Go ahead you have but

571
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,140
I still have more.

572
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:30,180
Okay, so kudos to OMG for finally applying

573
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,580
their sonic to the biological vacuum Okay, I'm

574
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,580
gonna shorten this one up Let's see He

575
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,500
said he's had success though with taking a

576
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,120
lot of your medical stuff over the past

577
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,120
10 years and applying it and he wants

578
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,860
you to know that but He also would

579
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,000
like let's see someone who spent those finally

580
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,880
Yeah, mechanical back pain.

581
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,600
Okay, he would like, you know a bit

582
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,480
of a refresher on that stuff because he's

583
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,860
had success on that With issues, you know

584
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:02,300
with repetition kind of injuries to the back

585
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,520
and if you would generally address that he'd

586
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,260
be appreciative but he's I'll do this and

587
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:12,080
it's not personal but it is for me

588
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,020
I used to be bedridden for a week

589
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,760
every for several reasons because I've had back

590
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,640
compressions on that but the mental side of

591
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,900
the back pain is when you have a

592
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,420
concept of doom and gloom in your mind,

593
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,740
and it doesn't have to be Forward in

594
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,460
your mind that you discuss it or anything

595
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,680
that just that there's a concept of doom

596
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,680
and gloom One of these psychologists, you know

597
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,120
practicing morons does half-ass get the get

598
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,060
the clue when they start talking to you

599
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,560
About the reason why your back hurts is

600
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,140
because you're carrying around things and it's psychological,

601
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,200
you know Yeah, that kind of it's in

602
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,140
the form of imagery actually So one way

603
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,560
to help mentally back pain is bring up

604
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,720
Catastrophic because you're gonna bring up an image

605
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,280
even if I say bring up an image

606
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,920
of a destroyed city with ten people is

607
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,940
going To be ten different images Even though

608
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,020
they'll be similar bring up an image of

609
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,500
what you consider to be your personal familial

610
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,600
Friendly whatever doom and gloom in your relationships

611
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,900
financial whatever bring up an image of a

612
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:17,360
destroyed environment And do the the reductionist, you

613
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,820
know The the mace concept on that make

614
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,480
the picture bigger and bigger in your mind

615
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,380
and stop it when it stops getting bigger

616
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,640
You can't make it any bigger I mean

617
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,280
bigger than what you imagine Let's say the

618
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,780
solar system or the universe's then shrink it

619
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,320
down to one pixel and then boom Disappear

620
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,100
it and practice that and that will change

621
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:40,660
the The the mental feedback and with that

622
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,160
I want to touch on the thyroid but

623
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,140
mechanical I've tried it all I went to

624
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,300
a chiropractor not to mention his name Errol

625
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,640
Turan in New York City He's a he's

626
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,800
a chiropractor for athletes And I think I've

627
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,120
mentioned before when I was in the pro

628
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,920
cycling sort of pro cycling field and other,

629
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,360
you know triathletes runners, whatever Didn't you also

630
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,580
run into Sorenson while you were in New

631
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,020
York to the same guy who wound up

632
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,420
treating Howard Stern with his Back pain and

633
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:08,660
stuff.

634
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,440
No, I might I went to a bunch

635
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,640
of them and okay No, not only call

636
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,480
sorts and but but here's the thing I

637
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,820
thought I used to always tell people if

638
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,360
you're athletic You can't go to a regular

639
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,500
MD because he's used to seeing old people

640
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,060
people that are really out of shape or

641
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,180
whatever He's gonna look at you and say

642
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,980
you're fine No matter what you have right

643
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,260
because you're an athlete, right?

644
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,160
You have to go to a sports doctor

645
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,960
who's used to seeing people who have a

646
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,840
high level of fitness But anyway, he would

647
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,060
do all this stuff and none of it

648
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:37,040
really helped And even decompression all this stuff.

649
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,620
So the bone crackers, you know, it's just

650
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,240
another field I'm not saying they're there to

651
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,160
be discounted.

652
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,920
They they they do more mental.

653
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,960
See people think I'm going for a chiropractor

654
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,580
I feel better.

655
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,560
I hear my bones cracking.

656
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,420
So I'm gonna get better.

657
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,600
That's fine But they still don't understand how

658
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,280
the body works.

659
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,300
I mean, I've tried decompression all that stuff

660
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:59,160
It does What they do does change the

661
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:03,640
pressure and the distribution temporarily As you said,

662
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:07,020
it's actually more valuable that you think it's

663
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:07,660
straightened out.

664
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:10,500
That's right Then it is that's right, but

665
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,760
it is partially physically valid to change.

666
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,040
Yeah, it is it is temporary It's very

667
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,300
very temporary and you're and you you've already

668
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,300
if you have something that a chiropractor will

669
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:23,180
relieve You've already facilitated that and that facility

670
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,200
meaning the signal going back and forth It's

671
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,760
like, you know when you go into a

672
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,360
mall, they're playing the same music over and

673
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,920
over That's what I mean by facilitated.

674
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,940
Yeah, you might have some relief But until

675
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,260
you get rid of that background that tells

676
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,300
the body to do that It's always going

677
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,300
to be there and cancer is the same

678
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,160
way All these things are the same way

679
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,620
You have to start with the mental aspect

680
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,100
and if you've got the mental aspect really

681
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,280
strong You could literally be bitten by poisonous

682
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,220
snakes and may and not be Fall fall

683
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,200
victim to it, right?

684
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,940
I mean, that's how powerful the mind is

685
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,520
believe it or not in that crazy group

686
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,500
of chiropractors in New York That was sticking

687
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,720
the you know, the liquid cocaine on a

688
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,340
on a cotton swab up people's nose There

689
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,960
is something to the methodology they were using

690
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,800
even though people were like, you know Outrage

691
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,720
that they were giving people, you know medical

692
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,760
grade cocaine, but there's a hell of a

693
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,980
drug It sure is and from what I

694
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:19,420
understand the liquid is amazing anyway So speaking

695
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,120
of healthy things and amazing, you know We

696
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,700
did talk about the pet food real quick

697
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,080
and I'll just throw this in and if

698
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,880
you want to continue on the chiropractor Go

699
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,120
ahead Here's a quick throwaway actually shortening it

700
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,200
up again, but he addressed how we brought

701
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,540
up the dog food and the organ meat

702
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,800
and all that stuff and His overall comment.

703
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,800
It wasn't a question He just wanted to

704
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,120
make the observation that it's amazing all the

705
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,140
problems that dogs don't have When you don't

706
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,960
feed them the processed garbage in a bag

707
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,100
And all that smell yeah Like all those

708
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:55,380
problems from the dog's smell to the dog's

709
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,620
skin issues to the dog's attitude all change

710
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,480
With absolutely better food.

711
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,240
So I just wanted to point that out

712
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,240
that that was something that if people don't

713
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,720
have pets Maybe they think it's a waste

714
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,180
of time.

715
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,200
But believe it or not philosophically.

716
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,500
It's got its uses and it is Truly

717
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,580
a holistic approach dealing with the food solves

718
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,620
a lot of issues for your animals Oh

719
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,980
clearly, it's all the thing is we are

720
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,760
molded from our environment.

721
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,000
You know the material That's formed in the

722
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,880
mother's womb from conception is based on whatever

723
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,760
she inputs into her body, right?

724
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,080
That's obvious, right?

725
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,560
the the blueprint and all that is not

726
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:36,200
physical but the The right so so that

727
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,680
process by the way continues When you're born

728
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,880
you're constant whatever you're eating like for example

729
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,540
If you know anyone in the military when

730
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,680
they go into the into Korea the bases

731
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,560
there When they get there, they they're like,

732
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,620
oh man, it was okay But everybody smelled

733
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,080
like fish and garlic, right?

734
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,060
Mm-hmm, and then you get used to

735
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,220
it and then they come over here Everybody

736
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,600
there your family and friends.

737
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,040
Here's his man.

738
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,880
You smell like fish and garlic, you know

739
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,600
You're right.

740
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,660
So it's it's inevitable.

741
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,420
You're going to process right?

742
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,420
So once you understand What's going on and

743
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,120
the human body for many reasons and one

744
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,900
of them is when we're the only creature

745
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,320
That's not prepared when it's born.

746
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,840
Maybe a hermit crab or whatever.

747
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,400
We have no fur, you know, we can't

748
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,580
walk around we you know You know like

749
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,940
some way if you know You watch a

750
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,620
horse drop.

751
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,800
Okay, like people like to watch Minutes, it's

752
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,180
up there.

753
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,200
Yeah in a few minutes.

754
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,560
This thing's trotting around like its mother who's

755
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,080
a thoroughbred It's trotting around behind it and

756
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,680
you know, it's fine So yeah, but it's

757
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,040
the same thing.

758
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:39,980
I was gonna say, you know one who

759
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:42,400
has a Cattle, you know, they bring the

760
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,740
kid that they bring them in and then

761
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,440
one refuses to come in He goes over

762
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,040
the hill and he sees the cow standing

763
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,440
by a calf Pretty quick just like when

764
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,940
you you know Look when you when you

765
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,360
wake up and you've been in a weird

766
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,040
position You got to like give your body

767
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,780
time like, you know, you say, oh, yeah,

768
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,680
but they're ready to go See, we're not

769
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,540
so we're so dependent on many things That's

770
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,040
the only reason why it takes 30 minutes

771
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,600
though because they were squeezed into the womb.

772
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,800
They were kind of But that's one aspect

773
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,580
you see that we're not prepared here.

774
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,720
So that makes us more sensitive to input

775
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,460
Well, that was my point is that you

776
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,000
know, but but when it comes to human

777
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,900
babies, look we got to carry them around

778
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,800
They can't walk.

779
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,600
They can't talk.

780
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,600
We got to feed them, you know, they

781
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,560
can't chew on anything I mean, they're not

782
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,480
ready for nothing and when they come out,

783
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,100
you know, no, of course for a lot

784
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,040
for quite a while It's called exposure.

785
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,240
All you had to do is leave the

786
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,860
baby naked out in the in the open

787
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:33,240
and it would die very soon so the

788
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,880
because of that we are extremely extremely sensitive

789
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:40,120
to our input and food and drink and

790
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,420
when you get along those lines If you're

791
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,260
limited to a diet or you're used to

792
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,640
eating things changing The condiments is the easiest

793
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,880
thing to change and then I haven't gotten

794
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,660
into condiments so, you know, you should always

795
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,720
have time for condiments right to talk about

796
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:58,000
condiments and That is that changes the energy

797
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,300
Give an example.

798
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,280
I had a burger whenever I get a

799
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,640
McDonald's burger or whatever, which is like very

800
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,100
seldom I say no mustard and they're like,

801
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,540
oh you don't like mustard No, the reason

802
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,080
I want no mustard is because I like

803
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:09,500
mustard.

804
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,900
Mmm, right because your mustard so crappy It

805
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,800
gives mustard a bad name So but this

806
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,340
time they did no mustard and ketchup and

807
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,420
I took a bite out of it I

808
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,040
was like what the hell, you know, you

809
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,700
need the ketchup and I got some ketchup.

810
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:22,040
I was like finally nothing now Edible, right

811
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,200
Certain things are necessary.

812
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,880
And you know Greek you keep saying condiments.

813
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,440
I got to tell you what if I

814
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,820
want to have a baby Just saying, you

815
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:37,100
know Qualified as a joke, but I know

816
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,500
That's okay, but I get you so but

817
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,600
here's the thing the So, what do you

818
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,720
do with condiments, you know?

819
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:51,340
basically food that's oily fatty Greasy needs acid

820
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:55,920
and you can what's in horseradish, right?

821
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:03,760
That that root peppery this ginger Is the

822
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,260
thing that goes in and you can put

823
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:08,320
that into they put ketchup and mayonnaise together

824
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,440
Yeah, now if you have salt you also

825
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,340
need acid and some sweet, right?

826
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,220
So that's what so that's what I'm saying

827
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:17,000
that the problem is though Well, don't forget

828
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,660
tomatoes are botanically classified as a berry and

829
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,920
they contain sugar So there are fruit and

830
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,260
a pumpkin is also a fruit.

831
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,180
It has a fruit bearing seed structure There's

832
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,700
many things that are called, you know certain

833
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,880
things It's because tomatoes are in the vegetable

834
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,240
aisle because of food combining they taste they

835
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,360
combine better With other vegetables that combine with

836
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:34,980
savory foods.

837
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,320
They don't put them in the fruit because

838
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,960
it would be a weird combination, right?

839
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,620
And that's why I always put some direct

840
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,900
sugar into anything I'm working with tomatoes if

841
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,580
I can just to cut down on the

842
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,320
acidity.

843
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,180
Yeah, that's another So your balance of the

844
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,580
thing though by saying condiments, it's the quality

845
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,420
of the condiments is so piss poor now

846
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,840
Even if you go to a Walmart, they

847
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,320
have like the imported foods and stuff You

848
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,020
like I like Santa Cruz peanut butter and

849
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,940
it's the priciest peanut butter You can get

850
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,620
and I go to Walmart and get it

851
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,080
because it's about half price what it is

852
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,880
at the natural grocer Let's say right.

853
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,980
They do give you a break Walmart.

854
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:08,380
Yeah.

855
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:11,260
Yeah occasionally So and I've got good at

856
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,260
the organic stuff from there like instead of

857
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:16,860
spending six bucks for Pomodoro, you know, it's

858
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:21,660
the whole tomatoes canned You know, it's the

859
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,920
organic stuff is like less than three bucks

860
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,620
and it's actually better than the stuff that

861
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:28,680
comes from Italy You know the New Yorkers

862
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,940
a ton of call Italy, right?

863
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,120
So well, that's if you're from not quite

864
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,920
in the city if you're from just outside

865
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,520
of the city Italy, you know, you're Italian

866
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,620
anyway, um salt and pepper.

867
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,000
Yeah.

868
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:44,040
So anyway Quick quick question on the organic

869
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:44,340
though.

870
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:47,120
Do you mean the like a great value

871
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:47,880
organic stuff?

872
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,120
Yeah, great I've actually been getting just on

873
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,520
a side note I've been getting into their

874
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,720
cordless power tools of 30 bucks.

875
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,320
You get a brush with the battery and

876
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,420
charger a Brushless motor drill where if you

877
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,720
got a D wall, you know the yellow

878
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,960
tools or the orange ones There's a hundred

879
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,520
and fifty plus and they work just as

880
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,620
well And I've been addicted to getting their

881
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:13,040
cordless power tools and just because it's If

882
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,800
the quality is reasonable, it's so cheap I

883
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,720
mean I got a cordless circular saw and

884
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,680
it's like for 50 bucks and the comparable

885
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,680
one of another brand would be three times

886
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,940
four times That and it works just as

887
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,960
well the YouTube reviews on it For example,

888
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,740
everybody's laughing you look I got a Walmart's

889
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,820
cordless circular saw and he starts testing and

890
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:34,220
he's like I'm surprised They cut this whole

891
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,100
sheet of plywood and did this and that

892
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,660
well guys, you know I don't know what

893
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,780
to say, but it's a pretty good tool,

894
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,440
you know Well, it's like I was shocked

895
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,520
at many you saw that mini saw the

896
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,660
thing that looks almost like an oversized electric

897
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,620
shaver That can actually cut wood Well the

898
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,440
oscillating so I've got a couple of those

899
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:53,900
as well.

900
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,220
They make a reasonable quality one of those

901
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,240
Over there.

902
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,020
Yeah, they do.

903
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,020
Yeah, that's very very very impressive.

904
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,120
I have fun with that stuff Just like

905
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,060
for example, I drive a 97 I use

906
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:08,600
a 97 Dodge minivan with faded paint It's

907
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,220
kind of like the ultimate fuck you Right

908
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,460
when you show up somewhere, you know, it's

909
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,140
like why are you driving?

910
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,820
I click you won't see anything that old

911
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,120
anymore.

912
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,100
I go to a parking lot I got

913
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,660
the oldest car, you know other than an

914
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,340
antique car.

915
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,540
That's you know, baby.

916
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,880
No, I got the oldest ugliest That's not

917
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,300
ugly the job at the lines are very

918
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,740
good But it's kind of like saying that

919
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,940
the rest of y'all fuck you, you

920
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,820
know, like your big like middle finger What

921
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,060
the hell are you guys doing trying to

922
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,240
be better than the Joneses?

923
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,600
Running better than a new car.

924
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,860
It's definitely out of place.

925
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,360
But you know, here's the thing aesthetically who

926
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,820
cares functionality and also The the mechanical nature

927
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:44,220
of the thing when it's functioning properly It's

928
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,640
better on gas than almost any vehicle you

929
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,920
could get that'll carry stuff.

930
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,260
Oh, yeah I've got a put a washer

931
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,700
and dryer in there and you can't do

932
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,720
that with a Ford I mean a big

933
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,500
Ford whatever or a Escalade you can't put

934
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,460
a washer and full-size washer and dryer

935
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:04,100
in an Escalade Yeah, new SUVs don't have

936
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:08,260
comparable cargo space Which is weird because you

937
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,700
know, you're gonna pay five times, you know

938
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,540
Even if they produced a brand new one

939
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:15,180
today, you'd pay five times for your Escalade

940
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,900
or your you know Whatever your rate Land

941
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,320
Rover, whatever the hell but yeah I don't

942
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,100
have the cargo space unless you turn around

943
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,180
and take all the seats out Who wants

944
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,780
to do that when the seat costs more

945
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,020
than half the cars in the lot?

946
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,260
I mean you're taking this out and everything

947
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,180
but yet just some of the cargo space

948
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,440
anyway Yeah, but the idea is it's kind

949
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,900
of like an F you to what people

950
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,600
think they should have because they're not really

951
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,240
thinking Let's go back to condiments The quality

952
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,980
of the condiments should be the best you

953
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,460
can get So if you're gonna use a

954
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,240
mustard try to get a very high quality

955
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,740
one if you're gonna use a ketchup get

956
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:51,420
an organic one You can make your own

957
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:54,340
stuff ketchup is just vinegar tomato paste water

958
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,640
and some sweetener Right.

959
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,780
Did you try the Walmart organic?

960
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:58,980
Ketchup.

961
00:32:59,100 --> 00:32:59,560
Yeah, I do.

962
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,440
I do get that do anything organic.

963
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,560
I look at what Walmart has first Yeah,

964
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,180
I use and they don't make you know,

965
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,440
they don't make anything It's rebirth.

966
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,340
Someone else is making it for them that

967
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,520
qualifies as organic and they're just branding it,

968
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:10,740
right?

969
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:13,640
No, they just they just License the label

970
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,260
they tell them you're allowed to label it

971
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:15,920
for our store.

972
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,320
That's it Yeah, as a matter of fact

973
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,260
that there's a lemonade that I like that's

974
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,960
it's simply whatever It's the same exact one

975
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,580
and it's half almost half price when you

976
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,760
get the Walmart one, right?

977
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,620
Same ingredient same but shape of the bottle

978
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:30,320
say it tastes just the same actually maybe

979
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,260
a little better So what's interesting but you

980
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,080
know, they got a nice tea matter of

981
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,680
fact, they got a nice tea Walmart does

982
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,740
I don't know if you know because you

983
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,780
you like iced tea, right?

984
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,520
It's it's it's like a really good iced

985
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,580
tea But they dump the same okay the

986
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,400
same stuff that you would pay $2 for

987
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,200
a small can They put it in a

988
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,480
gallon bottle and they charge you like a

989
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,060
buck fifty.

990
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,120
I mean, I'm telling you it's like yeah,

991
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,880
it's that's right It's but they're subsidized just

992
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,940
like the oil industry, you know, they're but

993
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,900
anyway, it's another Thing discussion.

994
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:03,820
Let's get back to the condiments Understanding the

995
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:07,040
value of having good condiments and that would

996
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,639
mean spicy stuff also at the appropriate time

997
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:12,800
If it's getting warm where you are Incorporate

998
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,480
things that grow in hot weather on your

999
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,360
latitude like yes spicy peppers and hot peppers

1000
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,360
and things like that But you know mild

1001
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,179
I wouldn't go too hot because it does

1002
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:24,800
have a counter effect on the body Get

1003
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,280
into citrus get into learning how to use

1004
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,320
lemon zest and orange zest, which is the

1005
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,780
dry grind ground, right?

1006
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,239
Which has the the signal and the energy

1007
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:37,600
learn how to use fermented foods What would

1008
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,679
be an example of an American Oh, the

1009
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,440
most easiest example for fermented food for the

1010
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,780
Westerners would be sauerkraut pickles pickles, right?

1011
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,520
Any kind of pickled material learn how to

1012
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,739
use those incorporate those like when you go

1013
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:53,620
to a lot of Middle Eastern a Lot

1014
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:56,560
of European especially Asian when they produce a

1015
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,000
meal that has a lot of quote-unquote

1016
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,540
animal or protein There's always pickles included, right?

1017
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,820
I know like this because you pee red,

1018
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,700
but you know, they pickle beets as well

1019
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,580
You like pickles?

1020
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,060
Yeah.

1021
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,760
Yeah anything pickling that pickled and canned are

1022
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,180
not the same No, no, I mean, but

1023
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,820
you can get pickled beets in a glass

1024
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:15,020
jar or you sure I love beets are

1025
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,300
wonderful It's there.

1026
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,140
Just think about you know, the what the

1027
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,680
beet looks like and it's a tonality of

1028
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,020
it, right?

1029
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,560
I mean That's how you know You got

1030
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,760
a good washing machine You get some pickle

1031
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,240
if some beet juice on you throw it

1032
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,720
in the load and it comes out clean

1033
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,240
It's a good washing machine, right?

1034
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,000
Yeah for sure Stains things but it also

1035
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,120
makes you pee red so don't panic It

1036
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,080
can asparagus makes you pee within minutes of

1037
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:38,540
eating it.

1038
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,400
It smells just like asparagus, right?

1039
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:44,480
Yeah Definitely like it's like Supposedly because they

1040
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,260
produce now.

1041
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:48,000
Here's the thing I was watching Jonah Bay

1042
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,620
recently and he's talking about detoxing and I

1043
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,060
give the guy a lot of respect I'm

1044
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:55,200
pretty close to endorsing him Mostly, but I

1045
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,920
can't really I don't know But anyway, he's

1046
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,540
talking people are still talking about detoxing first

1047
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:03,520
of all Anything in your body that you

1048
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,040
consider to be a toxin if it's in

1049
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,620
your bloodstream lymphatic in your organs your body

1050
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:10,820
created it Because it was in the GI

1051
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:15,140
the gastrointestinal tract Actually, it could be there's

1052
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:18,360
something called the patch various patches And if

1053
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,000
you find if you put a tobacco patch

1054
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,240
on your skin and you find there's there's

1055
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,560
you know Whatever's constituents are in that patch

1056
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,560
nicotine in your blood.

1057
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,840
Guess what your skin it was created By

1058
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,140
your body nothing permeates the skin, right?

1059
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:35,860
So all these so there's the detox People

1060
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,740
like I'm gonna detox.

1061
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,600
I'm gonna do fruit and berries and water

1062
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,720
for a few weeks to get all the

1063
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,300
toxins out.

1064
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,620
No It's not like something intruded into your

1065
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:46,040
body your body literally produced it So instead

1066
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,400
of detoxing trying to clean it out like

1067
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,100
they say If you counteract that with an

1068
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:58,400
energetically, let's say opposite opposing saying It will

1069
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,680
cancel out in your body and no longer

1070
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,340
be a toxin without waiting for it to

1071
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:05,200
go out Eliminate through the elimination pathway.

1072
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,300
You see what I mean?

1073
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,260
I almost think of it like an antidote

1074
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,240
Yeah, I have some related questions to this

1075
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,020
too that we can mix in So let's

1076
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,400
let's rock on the questions because this is

1077
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,000
I'm gonna just start peeling back and talking

1078
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,540
more about the biology But here's the thing.

1079
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,380
There is no such thing as a detox

1080
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,140
and there is a sloughing and cleaning of

1081
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,380
the intestines Just like you can clean your

1082
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,260
teeth from plaque.

1083
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,620
You literally have to scrape it off in

1084
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,720
both cases, right?

1085
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:28,360
Right.

1086
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:31,220
So like to clean the intestinal tract is

1087
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:31,620
kale.

1088
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:35,920
There's nothing beats kale Kale that that vegetable

1089
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,380
if you eat a little bit of kale

1090
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,840
every day It acts like a broom literally

1091
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,560
in your GI tract, right?

1092
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,800
Especially the large intestine where that's the final

1093
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,680
extraction of mostly water right, that's why when

1094
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,940
you see someone who has a crack on

1095
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:56,580
their lower lip, that means that the Large

1096
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:59,200
intestine is out of balance in the hydration

1097
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,500
mode, right?

1098
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,720
That's why you know someone goes out if

1099
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,560
you watch like Lords of Arabia the white

1100
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,460
of the British They always show them as

1101
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,780
having a crack on the lower lip, you

1102
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,100
know, they're out there fighting in the desert

1103
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,180
Not as balanced as the Arabs, right?

1104
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,080
Well, let's all look cracked all the way

1105
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,420
around right because yeah, well actually the main

1106
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,560
crack I'm discussing is a center crack on

1107
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,120
the lower lip.

1108
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,240
That's large intestine.

1109
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,560
You don't know what wait that split that

1110
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,640
shows up Yeah, and it stays there until

1111
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,920
you leave the change your diet radically or

1112
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,680
leave the environment That's it.

1113
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:32,320
That's where the large intestine is not In

1114
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,320
balance with removing getting creating taking the energy

1115
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:38,080
out of water in the final Digestion process

1116
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,060
large intestine is mostly to get the hydration

1117
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:41,960
out, right?

1118
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,480
The most of the hydration in the body

1119
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,940
comes from the mouth throat Part of this

1120
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:48,360
mostly the stomach and then the large intestine

1121
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,160
the small intestine is mostly for all of

1122
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,940
your real technical Nutrition's but anyway, that's we're

1123
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,280
gonna get into all this and I'll show

1124
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,460
why From a very basic perspective and I

1125
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,660
mentioned also, I think I did mention on

1126
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,040
last night You know They say all the

1127
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,820
ancients didn't know about the human body, which

1128
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:07,180
the ancient Greeks believe that the blood moved

1129
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,920
like a wave Through the body, which is

1130
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,800
exactly what it's doing and the heart is

1131
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,040
a break Just like you have waves at

1132
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,860
the ocean you put breakers to slow it

1133
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:16,440
down, right?

1134
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:18,480
It's the same concept and the wave is

1135
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,300
through all of the vessels Anyway, what have

1136
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,300
you got in terms of questions?

1137
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,900
Because like I said, we're gonna peel back

1138
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,700
and discuss more of the biology because look

1139
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,080
if you I've known people that were very

1140
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,900
wealthy When their health went down they were

1141
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,940
miserable They were so pathetic.

1142
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,520
So you got to be able to function

1143
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,440
So even rich people will tell you oh,

1144
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:38,560
you know all this doesn't really matter as

1145
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,260
long as you got your health Yeah, you

1146
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:43,740
know don't emphasize that and because it was

1147
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,340
one of the last things you can't just

1148
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,720
buy out of a you know Out of

1149
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,340
a box somewhere you actually have to do

1150
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:48,660
things.

1151
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,900
But anyhow, yeah.

1152
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:50,140
Yeah.

1153
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,060
So go ahead.

1154
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:51,480
What are you guys?

1155
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,340
So here we go.

1156
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,860
Could the idea of absorption of food through

1157
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:58,380
induction be proven by encoding key information?

1158
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,500
About a nutrient into an electromagnetic wave that

1159
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:06,160
cells could potentially detect and respond to question

1160
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,320
mark Absolutely.

1161
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,700
Yes, but not but not an electromagnetic wave

1162
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,980
that's commonly available.

1163
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:14,480
It's gonna have to be bio compatible, right?

1164
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:17,280
Because if it is all about reading information

1165
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,560
then an EM EM field would Just data

1166
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,040
would produce excuse me.

1167
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,360
It's too crude.

1168
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,160
Yeah, it's too crude the Like for example

1169
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,820
If you have a free energy machine that

1170
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,500
truly is free energy and you plugged your

1171
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,800
toaster in it You put your toast to

1172
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,440
come back and it's frosty the snowman.

1173
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,220
It's freezing your bread Right.

1174
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,080
So what do you know?

1175
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,460
What is the toaster supposed to do?

1176
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,100
You have to you have to rebuild it,

1177
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:41,320
right?

1178
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,180
No, I'm serious there.

1179
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,320
It's a negative based.

1180
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:43,640
Yeah.

1181
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,400
Yeah Imagine, you know got free energy plug

1182
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:46,880
your toaster.

1183
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,600
You come back five minutes later and it's

1184
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,200
ice-cold frozen hard.

1185
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:52,660
Well, that's great, right?

1186
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,600
No, because now everyone's gonna say your toasters

1187
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:00,300
broken So, yeah, you have to it's the

1188
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,400
same thing with electromagnetic waves you're gonna get

1189
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,100
Excitement and then a manifestation that it's ain't

1190
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,260
gonna be good That's why when people say

1191
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,840
they get these wife machines and stuff and

1192
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,740
they said does it have AC DC power

1193
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,080
supply?

1194
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,640
Yeah, it's no no, right.

1195
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,440
Okay real quick I just want to let

1196
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,320
you know that I did respond to the

1197
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,480
Brandon Brandon Joe Williams guy and we're probably

1198
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,200
gonna see if we can book for this

1199
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,980
coming Tuesday But I'll work that out.

1200
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:27,960
Okay, I'll handle it.

1201
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,680
Just just giving you the heads up Okay,

1202
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,860
so I had another piece here.

1203
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,420
Oh crap.

1204
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,240
I pressed the wrong button one second.

1205
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:38,700
I'll get it back but There was let's

1206
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:38,800
see.

1207
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:39,940
Was there a follow-up on that?

1208
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,600
I don't think so, but let's just double

1209
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,340
check and Let's see.

1210
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,000
Oh, okay.

1211
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:45,820
This is a different one.

1212
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,700
There was a discussion with a friend about

1213
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:51,260
the depopulation Could it just be an accurate

1214
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,360
accounting because people are talking about how the

1215
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,880
population is shrinking But he's saying, you know,

1216
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,000
because the Chinese are now sort of accounting

1217
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,520
for you know Is the fact that their

1218
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,660
population is not as big so real I've

1219
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,300
been saying that for 20 years Yeah, he

1220
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,840
said let's real talk goes into it But

1221
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,720
she's looking at it from a mass death

1222
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,500
issue along with lying about the real numbers

1223
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,060
as their birth rates were never above Yeah,

1224
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,960
let's okay Is that right, let me just

1225
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,360
say it this way there was a psychological

1226
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,560
study this is parallel to it's on a

1227
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:24,780
segue Psychological study which you know just again

1228
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:27,340
they do grunt work where they looked at

1229
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:30,680
sociology for People in college young people in

1230
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,460
college and they figured that if you go

1231
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:35,900
to a big College like Zuma sir, you

1232
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:39,120
know UMass University Matt or is Stony Brook

1233
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,280
or a big big college obviously you could

1234
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,880
have a lot of more friends than if

1235
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,100
you went to a College and they did

1236
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,600
a study and they found out and if

1237
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,860
you went to a big college or just

1238
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,320
a little small student body you still had

1239
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,240
Really acquainted with three or four or five

1240
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:56,260
people and it was the same people around

1241
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:58,300
you whether you were in a big group

1242
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,940
a big Institution or a small institution.

1243
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:02,620
You always had the same number of people

1244
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:05,220
that you associated with So that was interesting

1245
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,020
and I would say the same thing goes

1246
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,660
for population depopulation.

1247
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,960
What are you seeing?

1248
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,640
What are you seeing around the environment even

1249
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,320
if you're living rural and you don't see

1250
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,340
people you're going to go into this town

1251
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,520
for a Market, what do you see happening

1252
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,100
in your little town?

1253
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,840
And by the way, even if I say

1254
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,720
little town I'm not excluding places like big

1255
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,380
cities because when you live for a long

1256
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,860
time in a big city It does start

1257
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:32,960
to feel like a little town Yeah, I

1258
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,180
live in a moderately sized or medium-sized

1259
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:38,060
city for America and quite honestly You can

1260
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:41,140
observe that there are less children presence.

1261
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,140
That's the way I would do it Yeah,

1262
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:46,160
so for example, there are but you have

1263
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,600
to understand trendy, whatever when I lived in

1264
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,760
Park Slope, Brooklyn it was becoming yuppified and

1265
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,120
gentrified and they Moved in and started having

1266
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:55,520
babies.

1267
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,600
So the biggest one of the biggest businesses

1268
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,320
in the 90s Park Slope, Brooklyn was baby

1269
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,880
strollers Every time you like every other woman

1270
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,440
you saw she was pushing a baby stroller

1271
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,180
that didn't necessarily work If you were lived

1272
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:09,380
in Morristown, New Jersey that you didn't see

1273
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,460
that there, right?

1274
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:12,180
But what I did is they created a

1275
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,420
whole bunch of industries not just the strollers

1276
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,400
But there were whole sections of baby, you

1277
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,880
know, like there'd be a baby section at

1278
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,480
the Sears now You know that right in

1279
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,460
the 90s a big baby.

1280
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,160
This was the gentrification.

1281
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,260
So you have these micro trends, but generally

1282
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:27,820
no We're on the way down.

1283
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,920
You have to be because the food is

1284
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,480
is Toxified it's poisonous At this point not

1285
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,820
poisonous, let me just say no, it's not

1286
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:37,260
optimum.

1287
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:41,300
It's a combination of discouraging people from having

1288
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:44,540
children because of the conditions and the fact

1289
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:46,180
that I think we're also kind of being

1290
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,840
What you know, what do they call that?

1291
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:53,060
The way you discourage we've got over this

1292
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:55,080
many times people from having children as you

1293
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,320
sexualize the society like we've mentioned if you

1294
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,600
go A place that has a highly sexualized

1295
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,340
society and knock on people's door.

1296
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,660
How many children are here?

1297
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:07,080
Let's say none or one or two Maybe

1298
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,160
but if you go to a society that

1299
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:13,180
has sexually repressed repressed You knock on the

1300
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:15,320
door how many children you have seven eight

1301
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,680
five ten, right?

1302
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,760
It doesn't make any sense so the way

1303
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:23,480
you sexually repress a Repressed population is by

1304
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,820
when you go into a convenience store Right

1305
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:27,440
behind the cashier point-of-sale.

1306
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:30,320
You got condoms and porn, right?

1307
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,220
And all that stuff and then there'll be

1308
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:38,620
no babies but if you sexually repress They're

1309
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:39,880
gonna have a lot of babies, it's the

1310
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,300
opposite it's not like farming where you know

1311
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:45,160
In other words, it's the opposite of farming.

1312
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:48,320
If this sexual encouragement is like watering and

1313
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:52,400
fertilizing Nothing grows it's over Don't water.

1314
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,020
Yeah, it's over saturation.

1315
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:54,760
You know what I mean?

1316
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:56,840
If you flood the lawn, it's not gonna

1317
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,520
grow the grass real well Yeah, but it's

1318
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:01,660
actually the opposite of of what farming is

1319
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:04,220
in terms of energetically It's the opposite the

1320
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,380
more you give in that direction the less

1321
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,420
Output you're gonna have if you almost ignore

1322
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,440
It'll grow better.

1323
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,360
Yeah a flooded.

1324
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:13,680
Okay.

1325
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,180
In other words, you're not growing stuff in

1326
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:17,220
a swamp plenty of water there But you're

1327
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:18,720
not gonna grow stuff in the swamp You

1328
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,180
know what I'm saying?

1329
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:20,600
Because it's over saturation.

1330
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,000
That's how I'm looking at it Well, yeah,

1331
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:24,620
but the thing is also I'm looking at

1332
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:25,860
it from point of view like the ether

1333
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:28,300
it always goes backwards It's like it goes

1334
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,240
from low to high potential not high to

1335
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,380
low Right.

1336
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,200
We we live in a society where the

1337
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,880
science we're taught is something a high potential

1338
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,960
It's always gonna drain into something that's lower

1339
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,000
where the ether is the opposite the low

1340
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,840
potential feeds the high potential and most human

1341
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:45,600
Character in society functions that way you have

1342
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,640
the you have a charismatic Individual at the

1343
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,600
deus or the podium on stage and although

1344
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,020
less charismatic people are in the audience feeding

1345
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,340
energy to him, right?

1346
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,500
Right, so he always goes low to high

1347
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,340
in the ether also with you doing weather

1348
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:02,320
work Certain types of electrical work, you know,

1349
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:05,620
the dielectric works that way All these things

1350
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:07,980
so that's another way of thinking and both

1351
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:12,220
perspectives are true You know, but anyway, what

1352
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:13,600
else do you got we sound like this

1353
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,800
is like the Rambo version of Rated Y.

1354
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,320
Yeah, I don't want to ramble too much,

1355
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,520
but This is definitely a fun pattern breaker.

1356
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:24,160
Anyways any advice from the Greek on how

1357
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,540
to learn a language quickly, especially Yeah, Asian

1358
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:29,880
languages, which have very little in common with

1359
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:30,800
Western languages.

1360
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:33,340
Yes Yes.

1361
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,060
Well, why is it that people that live

1362
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,800
in a country or as a child grow

1363
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,540
up learn the language no matter what?

1364
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,060
It's what is it?

1365
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,240
Is it because this is how languages work?

1366
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:45,980
No, it's the desire to communicate and it's

1367
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:48,820
You got to be able to go to

1368
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:50,420
a store and talk to somebody in order

1369
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:52,360
to get food Yeah, you know, you got

1370
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:54,800
to be able to desire to communicate right

1371
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,320
in the someone who's not good at communicating

1372
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,200
is not gonna learn Languages, it's also a

1373
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,600
mathematical, you know mathematics is completely artificial It's

1374
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,940
a human construct where geometry is not because

1375
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:08,260
you can measure geometries, but you can't measure

1376
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:11,900
math it's a but Fortunately or unfortunately just

1377
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,480
like you might say language is a human

1378
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,580
construct People that are good at math are

1379
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:17,640
good at learning languages and vice versa So

1380
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:20,240
when you run into someone that's not good

1381
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,140
at math you ask them.

1382
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:22,360
How many languages do you know?

1383
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:27,220
One right typically not always but very typical

1384
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:29,700
or people that know many languages if you

1385
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,200
ask them if they're good at math They

1386
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,420
might say no, but they actually they could

1387
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:35,040
pick up they could learn principles and be

1388
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,060
very good at it very quickly But they

1389
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:39,320
don't just think about it because of a

1390
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,940
lack of train social Personal personal view of

1391
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:45,480
themselves also, right what they decided what they

1392
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,200
what decisions they made about how they're gonna

1393
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:52,920
function Languages There's a desire to communicate now

1394
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:55,100
The thing is when you're speaking another language

1395
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:57,860
and this is accentuated with the French if

1396
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:59,600
you don't put in Vietnamese If you don't

1397
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,500
pronounce it, right They just totally ignore you

1398
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,680
or if they see that you're trying to

1399
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,360
speak French because you're in Paris Anymore because

1400
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,620
they have pizza huts there, right?

1401
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:11,060
Yeah, but there's very snobby The Vietnamese will

1402
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:12,640
act like they don't understand what you're saying.

1403
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,600
If you just don't have the right intonations,

1404
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:15,000
right?

1405
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:17,240
So that the art is the first thing

1406
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:20,380
you should always learn is the accent like

1407
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:23,120
for example giving there's a you know, the

1408
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,500
Fallout video game they did a series on

1409
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:25,800
Amazon.

1410
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:27,820
I loved it By the way, the the

1411
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:30,100
main protagonist in there is a woman a

1412
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:33,040
young lady and she's very British But you

1413
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,600
would never get a sense of that she

1414
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:39,680
speaks like totally American born American raised American

1415
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:40,200
spoken.

1416
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:43,020
Yeah, she does the American accent really really

1417
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:44,960
really well and yes, there is an American

1418
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,240
accent, by the way, and So you must

1419
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,140
get the axe the feeling for the accent

1420
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:52,120
don't how are you gonna get the accent

1421
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,760
down if you don't know the Language, right?

1422
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:56,800
You can't so you get a feeling for

1423
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,040
the emo a feeling for what it's like

1424
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,260
The back of the mouth the top of

1425
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:03,380
the mouth, you know, whatever like for example

1426
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:08,060
Look you can pick up on the cadence

1427
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:10,440
and the intensity all the way words are

1428
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,100
spoken that way and that gives you a

1429
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:15,560
good precursor a pretext Yeah, you notice I

1430
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,320
haven't even gotten into the language yet because

1431
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,080
these things are just as important if not

1432
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:21,700
more important The other thing is whatever language

1433
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,480
you want to learn because of internet streaming

1434
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,840
go find out the country or whatever region

1435
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,180
That has that language and put it stream

1436
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:32,360
on the radio or your listening device The

1437
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,260
radio from that country or that nation that

1438
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:36,400
language that you want the talk radio, especially

1439
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:38,620
Yeah, I got a little bit of help

1440
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:40,820
with it with this one time and I

1441
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:43,120
used it for you know a temporary solution

1442
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,680
is I took a movie that I was

1443
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:48,560
very familiar with and Changed the language so

1444
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:51,240
that the spoken language was, you know That

1445
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,200
language and then put on the subtitles in

1446
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,800
English so that yeah, but it was also

1447
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,940
it was it Was it a voiceover not

1448
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:00,140
a machine doing it, right?

1449
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:00,360
No.

1450
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,100
No, it was a voiceover.

1451
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:03,080
So I think it was probably true to

1452
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:04,440
the Language.

1453
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,520
Yeah, they actually used to record and they

1454
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:09,200
still do like stuff like cartoons like the

1455
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:09,640
Simpsons.

1456
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:11,860
They record it in Spanish There's a separate

1457
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:15,220
Spanish speaker good example does Homer and whatever

1458
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:17,780
so you're familiar with that cartoon Maybe you

1459
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:19,560
know Simpsons been around for 30 years.

1460
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:21,840
Sure, you know, but this is exposed It's

1461
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:24,120
a matter of being exposed to it and

1462
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,400
then you have to learn it.

1463
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:25,820
Yeah, right.

1464
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:28,400
It's exposure in common stuff, though I'm not

1465
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,300
trying to you know, go to well, I

1466
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:31,640
want to be at the Louvre and no

1467
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,900
I'm not going to an unfamiliar surrounding I

1468
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,960
go to something I'm familiar with and then

1469
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:36,660
inject.

1470
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:38,800
How does that language work in my familiar

1471
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,220
setting?

1472
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,420
So, what do you think of that?

1473
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,140
No, of course.

1474
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:42,460
Okay.

1475
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:45,060
Yeah surround yourself with it, but see again

1476
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,960
It's the way your mind works the desire

1477
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:50,640
to communicate get the intonations and the accent

1478
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,760
down You still haven't learned any words right

1479
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,740
now the way you learn the language, especially

1480
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:57,500
It's going to be very difficult to avoid

1481
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:00,060
reading and writing If you want to learn

1482
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:02,540
a language truly So this is why I'm

1483
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:04,460
going to bring up this point forget about

1484
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:06,020
Rosetta Stone or a lot of other crap

1485
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:09,560
because that's done on the current psychology The

1486
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:12,120
true psychology or the spiritual side of how

1487
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:15,360
languages are learned is as a child, you

1488
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,160
know You can have a a child that

1489
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,460
hasn't gotten it gotten any schooling or you

1490
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:21,420
know academic training at all and they speak

1491
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:22,860
the language But once they get into like

1492
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:25,660
what they have nursery books Kindergarten first grade,

1493
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:27,440
you know primer grammatic primer.

1494
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:28,460
So what you do is you get a

1495
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:30,080
coloring book from the language you want to

1496
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:33,860
learn Right for the alphabet and basic words

1497
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:36,080
and you actually do the coloring book believe

1498
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,620
it or not because when you're coloring in

1499
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:39,800
Let's say the first letter of an alphabet

1500
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:42,540
You're going to be spending a little time

1501
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:44,340
on it right coloring it You're just not

1502
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:46,500
going to be flipping a page so that

1503
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,340
that has a another thing where it imprints

1504
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:52,260
again into you And within a few days

1505
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,560
Remember if you have the vocabulary of a

1506
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,720
five or eight year old in that language

1507
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:00,320
You're pretty okay, because if a five or

1508
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,960
eight year old is lost someone finds them

1509
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:03,320
and ask them.

1510
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:03,880
Where's your mommy?

1511
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:04,540
Where's your daddy?

1512
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:05,320
Where do you live?

1513
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,220
What's your name?

1514
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:07,520
How are you feeling?

1515
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:09,340
The child can answer all of that.

1516
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,380
You're pretty much Okay, right.

1517
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:13,680
So you want to start off forget about

1518
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,540
the meet-and-greet stuff, right?

1519
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,880
Stuck on you know a tourist stuff forget

1520
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,780
about that because that yes, you'll learn the

1521
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,420
language that way But you'll be stuck in

1522
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:24,720
that mode You have to do it organically,

1523
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:26,460
which is the way a child learns, right?

1524
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:27,840
Another thing I picked when I was a

1525
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:28,960
kid I wanted to be able to speak

1526
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,780
to some of the Spanish-speaking kids, right?

1527
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:32,040
So what did I do?

1528
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,580
I went to the library and I got

1529
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:34,020
the dr.

1530
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,540
Seuss book You know the cat in the

1531
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:37,820
hat very common It was in my in

1532
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:39,520
my generation the cat in the hat was

1533
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,500
a book every kid read it in kindergarten,

1534
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:41,840
right?

1535
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:44,700
So I got that but it was El

1536
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:47,700
Gato in sombrero And in fact, it had

1537
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:49,880
the English page and then the Spanish page

1538
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:53,240
copied every page you open did that No,

1539
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,840
yeah, that's that's fine But the thing is

1540
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,880
I'm saying is just dive into a primer

1541
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:00,820
which is for example, right people want to

1542
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:03,680
learn Hebrew There's a website in Jerusalem I

1543
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,780
mean you literally download the aleph tov a

1544
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:08,620
gobble and all the Hebrew letters on each

1545
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,640
page and it gives you a word it

1546
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,500
has a picture of what that word means

1547
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:15,200
and There's no English at all.

1548
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,440
It's just because it's out of Israel what

1549
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,900
they use in Israel for three and four

1550
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:20,480
year olds, right?

1551
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:21,220
That's what I'm saying.

1552
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:25,040
Don't the transfer for example having it in

1553
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:25,460
the language.

1554
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,780
You're familiar with the real bridging the language

1555
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:31,340
I don't recommend that I Don't say avoid

1556
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:34,000
it, but I don't I said Go right

1557
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,960
into the language without any help your curiosity

1558
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,540
will help you remember So when you see

1559
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:41,060
it in your language and then the language

1560
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:42,600
you want to learn that's not very helpful

1561
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,400
That's like it's not a form of cheating.

1562
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,440
Let's yeah, you know when you get the

1563
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:49,640
answers to a test, right?

1564
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:52,700
you don't want that you you want to

1565
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:55,240
stretch the mind a little bit because Then

1566
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,580
you when you stretch your mind and wondering

1567
00:54:57,580 --> 00:54:59,800
what the hell is this first letter Just

1568
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,620
learn it and then it'll pop up again

1569
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:03,340
later or for this word.

1570
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,320
I'm not saying keep it a mystery but

1571
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:09,620
avoid Directly always using the the English to

1572
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:12,440
whatever language you want to learn Again, the

1573
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:14,740
desire to learn the language is very important.

1574
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:17,720
For example, I was not So I was

1575
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:20,680
semi-fluent in Vietnamese because I help people

1576
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:24,060
develop a Vietnamese restaurant Semi-fluent in Korean

1577
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,760
Because I had a Korean mobster client and

1578
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,460
I wanted to make him show him respect,

1579
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,500
right?

1580
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:35,080
I Learned some Korean anything before that.

1581
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:37,120
Yeah, anytime you have somebody who has a

1582
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:41,720
cultural aspect a particular You know where it's

1583
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,280
a narrowed cultural group.

1584
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:45,000
You want to be it's a form of

1585
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,980
respect Yeah, and just like look at Americans

1586
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:50,800
when you see him in American Let's say

1587
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:53,000
setting when a tourist or someone comes and

1588
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:53,840
they don't speak English.

1589
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:56,680
What are the typical America speak English, man?

1590
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:57,920
You're an American now, right?

1591
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:00,020
You notice how you heard that right?

1592
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:02,840
Oh, yeah Yeah, so that's so you do

1593
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:05,020
the inverse of that when you approach someone

1594
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:08,500
who you want to show respect to They're

1595
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,620
like higher than you on the pecking order

1596
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:13,260
You learn their language and you express yourself

1597
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:13,840
in their language.

1598
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,000
It makes them feel They know you don't

1599
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,400
speak the language but it shows like wow

1600
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,060
this person really went to an effort to

1601
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:21,700
accommodate me So you also have to understand

1602
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,700
that what learning our language is an accommodation

1603
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:30,000
principle Right and also learning multiple languages will

1604
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,280
help you on your path so you might

1605
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:33,660
want to learn a language and it'd be

1606
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:35,420
difficult but I'm saying no matter how difficult

1607
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:37,120
is learn it because if you Learn it

1608
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,040
and I'm saying just be semi-fluent because

1609
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,680
your average Person uses a hundred two hundred

1610
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,540
fifty words a day if you need a

1611
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:45,360
transcript average words, right?

1612
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,680
Which is not talking technical stuff.

1613
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,640
So if you remember when we used to

1614
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,820
memorize phone numbers, you know, right a phone

1615
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:53,160
number is seven words Well, there's no Greek

1616
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:53,800
is seven numbers.

1617
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:56,340
Well write down the write down the numbers

1618
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:57,040
and often numerics.

1619
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:58,340
It's seven words, right?

1620
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,940
And so when you do that, you know,

1621
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:03,300
I would remember ten phone numbers easily I

1622
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:05,280
knew I knew my relatives all my relatives

1623
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,580
phone numbers friends phone numbers neighbors phone numbers

1624
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:09,900
I would say that any given moment in

1625
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:10,720
that in that era.

1626
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,780
I was probably carrying around about 50 numbers

1627
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:13,420
in my head.

1628
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:16,780
That's right Associations to remember them.

1629
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:20,560
So the same thing so They were based

1630
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,060
on patterns a lot of them like I

1631
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:23,380
knew how to lay it out on a

1632
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:24,560
key even if I didn't know the Numbers

1633
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,560
I knew what how to make the pattern

1634
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:28,100
on the board, you know, so you had

1635
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:30,160
it that was your association The thing is

1636
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,980
you can recommend associations, but people naturally have

1637
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:34,760
them where they've decided what they're gonna use

1638
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:36,820
as an association A lot of people already

1639
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:39,280
memorizing ten phone numbers, which is kind of

1640
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:43,000
redundant it's actually useless not redundant to say

1641
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
that now because You know when someone asks

1642
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,020
you for your spouse's phone number You have

1643
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:49,580
to really think about it right because we

1644
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:51,120
don't you just have a cute name for

1645
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,380
them on the contacts, right?

1646
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,700
I mean how somebody asked, you know for

1647
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:57,140
somebody, you know, can I get your number?

1648
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:59,220
You don't most Exactly.

1649
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,600
So this is made a good example for

1650
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:04,280
people under 30 anyone that's under 20 Give

1651
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,160
them a dial rotary dial phone.

1652
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,280
It's as funny as watching a monkey trying

1653
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:09,360
to fuck a football, right?

1654
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,600
That's a try to what is it?

1655
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,540
You know, have you that's true though I'd

1656
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:15,120
hope there's a YouTube video and I very

1657
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:17,260
young people and people under 20 trying to

1658
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:20,800
give him a rotary phone That would be

1659
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,920
that would be really something I mean they

1660
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:26,900
might get the The touchpad because they're still

1661
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:29,600
they're still familiar maybe with some touchpad stuff,

1662
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:31,860
but the rotary phone is really funny though

1663
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:33,520
I've seen it in real life, by the

1664
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:38,700
way So but here's the thing Back to

1665
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:41,440
the languages you must have a desire once

1666
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,100
you learn one language It's a gateway drug

1667
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:46,180
to other things and you're gonna learn other

1668
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:48,460
language much faster because you already know how

1669
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:52,580
to connect right, but the translation there's a

1670
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:56,020
big difference between Translating and learning a language.

1671
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:58,780
That's why I said earlier when you want

1672
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:00,840
to learn what say another language Don't really

1673
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:02,860
rely on the English right next to it.

1674
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:04,680
Try to get away from that and but

1675
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:05,800
I don't know How am I gonna get

1676
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:06,100
into it?

1677
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:07,340
Will you get into it the same a

1678
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:09,460
very young child or infant does in that

1679
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:10,820
country now?

1680
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:13,220
This is not this is what I'm saying

1681
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:15,920
is really top-notch way of learning a

1682
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,980
language for about 75% of the time

1683
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,140
25% of the time you might want

1684
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:23,000
to just cut to the chase and go

1685
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,700
to a YouTube that is if you're visiting

1686
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:26,040
this country as A tourist, what do you

1687
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:26,360
say?

1688
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:27,620
And they give you to you in English

1689
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:29,060
in that language and learn it that way

1690
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:31,720
just to get yourself primed Right.

1691
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:33,680
Sometimes you need to a primer.

1692
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:35,400
I mean a primer like an engine You

1693
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,120
got to dump a little extra fuel just

1694
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:39,380
to get it going and see if that

1695
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:40,660
works for you but if you really want

1696
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,280
to learn a language most people are not

1697
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:44,540
really learning they're learning how to translate because

1698
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:46,360
They'll give it to you in the language,

1699
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:47,900
you know, and then show you the comparable

1700
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:49,680
No, that is not learning a language that

1701
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:53,000
is translation learning translation, which is very different

1702
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:57,000
Right, so we should do I think I've

1703
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,660
given enough clues that about language that I

1704
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:03,240
was thinking of one day doing a mathematics

1705
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:06,720
language Webinar like just like I did the

1706
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:10,420
cooking webinar not yet And just showing what

1707
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:12,660
really works and learning stuff fast.

1708
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:14,520
But okay, what else you got a linguistics

1709
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:16,440
key could be fun How about this look

1710
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:18,320
since I was communicating with Matthew?

1711
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,080
He just threw me a question and then

1712
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,260
I'll be done with all my questions Okay

1713
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:23,700
regarding Brandon.

1714
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:23,960
Okay.

1715
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,780
No, this isn't regarding Brandon.

1716
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:26,180
Actually.

1717
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:27,260
He's asking a question.

1718
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:29,340
He just wanted to run in So we'll

1719
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:29,840
make him happy.

1720
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:30,420
He'll hear this.

1721
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,320
I guess he's a so tell him we're

1722
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:34,160
on this doing a sonic right now If

1723
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,980
you would to already did, okay, so super

1724
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:37,500
duper good.

1725
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:38,340
Okay, man.

1726
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:39,300
Can't wait to hear it.

1727
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:42,540
Okay Okay, I'd love to know his thoughts

1728
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:45,800
on quote the body attacking itself and quote

1729
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:51,320
if parasites or Microtoxins can cause those symptoms

1730
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:53,980
you can say Matthew asked you may already

1731
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:57,460
be familiar with my case Mm-hmm.

1732
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,440
So there it is sort of familiar with

1733
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:00,980
him who he's been going through but here's

1734
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:01,300
the thing.

1735
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:04,220
No, there was no attacking That's the Western

1736
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:07,520
stuff Where you know, I gotta kill the

1737
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:10,740
cancer kill the virus What do you what?

1738
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:11,920
Why are you gonna kill something that your

1739
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:12,960
own body created?

1740
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:13,300
Right?

1741
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:14,660
So what's happening?

1742
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:17,960
The attack is your body is actually Manifesting

1743
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:21,040
the energy from the materials that you've inputted

1744
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,980
in it and your environment give you an

1745
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:26,400
example One thing like we mentioned we've discussed

1746
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,840
with Matthew early back a few months ago

1747
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:30,300
was why don't you have some raw tuna?

1748
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:33,000
Very powerful, but if it's not working for

1749
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,320
you in three or four days, which it

1750
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:37,040
didn't That means that's not the energy that

1751
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,280
you need because think of a tuna It's

1752
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,140
a fish first of all forget that it's

1753
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:43,380
a tuna because tuna is very specific type

1754
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:46,400
of fish Think of a fish think of

1755
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,960
its skeletal structure where its spine is it's

1756
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:52,180
it's the bones are flat spread out The

1757
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:53,940
skin is nothing like yours.

1758
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:57,260
The environment is absolutely nothing like yours It's

1759
01:01:57,260 --> 01:01:58,760
a matter of fact The fish body is

1760
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:01,200
so radically different from the environment we are

1761
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,960
in that if it's not jiving with you

1762
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:06,180
You're not getting anything out of it right

1763
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:08,680
away like a boost It's actually working against

1764
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:11,300
you because now your body in this environment

1765
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:13,560
is going to try to mimic What the

1766
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:16,720
fishes environment is and that's not a financial

1767
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,420
joke, but who's gonna put you under water,

1768
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:20,940
which is gonna make you worse So it

1769
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:23,580
doesn't take very long The stuff that I'm

1770
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:25,740
discussing with the condiments the change of diet

1771
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:27,660
and all that three to seven days If

1772
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:30,020
you don't have a major improvement or change

1773
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:32,720
In three or seven days, that's not you're

1774
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:33,520
not in the right direction.

1775
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:35,440
That's how fast it is Sometimes it's overnight

1776
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:38,060
and give an example with the burdock root

1777
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:40,960
What years of the years ago well years

1778
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,420
ago, yes, but recently on these sonics I

1779
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:46,240
told people if you Understand what eating beef

1780
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:49,180
is or you know animal and it gives

1781
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:51,240
you a boost, you know that energy Yeah,

1782
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:54,060
try some burdock root and it'll give you

1783
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:56,020
the same boost and we got a pretty

1784
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:58,000
good response Like yeah, man, Greek said eat

1785
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:58,160
bird.

1786
01:02:58,180 --> 01:02:59,860
I got some burdock did it was just

1787
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:02,420
like eating a steak I felt right and

1788
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:03,600
that's a vegetable, right?

1789
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:06,500
Yes People went wild it was immediate.

1790
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:09,640
Yeah So if you so with Matthew if

1791
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:11,780
you're trying various foods and things it should

1792
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:15,720
be immediate improvement immediate Three days to a

1793
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:16,360
week max.

1794
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,040
So if you really the three days, he

1795
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:18,980
really 24 hours.

1796
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:24,580
You should feel a difference, but What I'm

1797
01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:26,240
trying to say here is many of it

1798
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:29,300
we have to think uncommonly Because yeah, you

1799
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:30,720
know you tuna's got a lot of put

1800
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,020
you know, you've you seen a slab of

1801
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:34,100
tuna meat It looks like filet mignon, right?

1802
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:36,540
Yeah, it's very much a strong animal But

1803
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:37,940
it's not as strong as you know animal

1804
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:40,640
that's on the earth You know land.

1805
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:44,540
So One of the easiest things to reset

1806
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:48,020
would be grains But the type of grains

1807
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:49,700
that are the most perky like a brown

1808
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:52,420
rice Sequence when fruit grows it's on its

1809
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:55,040
way down right after the blossom, right?

1810
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:56,040
It's on its way So when you eat

1811
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,500
fruit, it's it's going to give you a

1812
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,540
little bit You know of what energy you

1813
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:02,380
can get because of the being a fruit

1814
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:05,500
sustenance Ultimately it's going to hang and you're

1815
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,040
gonna be feeling like you're going down because

1816
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:08,780
she fruit wants to go down towards the

1817
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:10,540
ground It's gonna be a downer after a

1818
01:04:10,540 --> 01:04:10,820
while.

1819
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:14,180
That's it's energetic direction because that's right and

1820
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:16,260
off with a root or the Exactly.

1821
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:19,160
So when you look at grains that grow

1822
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:23,720
especially something that millet Barley wheat brown rice,

1823
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:25,840
they're growing up and up It's actually even

1824
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:27,080
when the fruit the end of the seed

1825
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,680
grows The reason it bends down is because

1826
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:30,200
it's so heavy, but it still wants to

1827
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,660
go upward, right?

1828
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:34,120
So it's going to be very constructive The

1829
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,500
same thing with that is legumes legumes balance

1830
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:38,160
that out because when you see beans grow

1831
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,780
they hang down But they're almost the same

1832
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:43,900
geometric pattern So they it's like a positive

1833
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:46,040
and a negative side a sign next to

1834
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:48,700
each other one crosses out the other so

1835
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:51,300
that my recommendation to him was a whole

1836
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:54,900
grains and Legumes which are beans the smaller

1837
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:59,320
the bean the better Even lentils but the

1838
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:04,140
and also a seaweed Seaweed being a plant

1839
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:10,820
Has a very very narrow nutritional value than

1840
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:14,680
Green things that grow on the surface of

1841
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:16,140
the earth, right?

1842
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:19,200
Like if you measure what's in seaweed chemically

1843
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,740
It's very basic compared to like something like

1844
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:23,800
Swiss chard or kale or spinach has all

1845
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:26,220
these you know, oxalic acids You know when

1846
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:27,660
you eat a spinach it gives you like

1847
01:05:27,660 --> 01:05:30,000
the strips your palate You know that that

1848
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,420
makes your teeth feel like they've been sanded

1849
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:33,020
down, right?

1850
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:35,140
That's the oxalic acid You have a lot

1851
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:37,820
of complex things going because it's mitigating, you

1852
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:40,260
know, the effect of sunlight So going for

1853
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:42,420
a root vegetable or a seaweed with the

1854
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:45,300
grain and legume you should have Very positive

1855
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:46,620
results within three days.

1856
01:05:46,620 --> 01:05:46,780
Now.

1857
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:48,760
Here's the thing about eating these whole foods

1858
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:52,900
And don't mistake this for processing process because

1859
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:55,100
you're doing it right processed food, but if

1860
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:57,660
you're not used to eating it You're gonna

1861
01:05:57,660 --> 01:06:01,660
feel miserable right and What I recommend is

1862
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:03,380
making it in the form of baby food.

1863
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:05,860
So if you're gonna have Legumes for a

1864
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:08,280
few days don't eat them and there's natural

1865
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:10,300
state make like oh you what's that texture?

1866
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:11,760
What do they call that refried beans?

1867
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:12,580
It's like a paste.

1868
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:13,380
Yeah, right.

1869
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:17,040
Yeah, I make a bean soup You know

1870
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:18,760
have a bean, you know, however, you're gonna

1871
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:20,760
have it also but do a variety the

1872
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:23,840
same with the brown rice Don't eat just

1873
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:24,540
the steam, right?

1874
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:27,080
Here's the thing recommending the whole grains for

1875
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:27,280
food.

1876
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:28,620
Most people don't know how to cook it

1877
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:31,400
There was a by the way a documentary

1878
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:34,560
Jira Uno the most prestigious sushi sushi Yeah,

1879
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:41,220
juicy sushi sushi Sushi in Japan and There

1880
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:42,860
was a rice vendor that came to them

1881
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:44,500
and he said the Hyatt Hotel wanted to

1882
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,020
buy his rice He had the most exclusive

1883
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:48,120
rice in Japan because I wouldn't sell it

1884
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,180
to them because they didn't know how to

1885
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:51,200
cook it Why would you sell rice to

1886
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:52,520
someone who doesn't know how to cook it,

1887
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:52,760
you know?

1888
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:54,060
Cuz then that gives the rice a bad

1889
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:54,580
name, right?

1890
01:06:55,020 --> 01:06:56,780
Why are you gonna sell somebody the best

1891
01:06:56,780 --> 01:06:58,260
piece of steak in the world if all

1892
01:06:58,260 --> 01:06:59,220
they're gonna do is throw it in a

1893
01:06:59,220 --> 01:06:59,500
toaster?

1894
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:01,920
Yeah, that's right I've been I worked in

1895
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:04,160
a restaurant for a short time when They

1896
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,920
order a rack of lamb well done and

1897
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,400
I threw down my thing and I said

1898
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:08,540
they need to go to Jack in the

1899
01:07:08,540 --> 01:07:11,620
Box You know if they want that, you

1900
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:13,360
know rack of lamb should be medium rare

1901
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:14,120
at the most.

1902
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:17,540
So anyway So you need to get the

1903
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:19,960
food most digestible so with their grains What

1904
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:21,640
I would do is make something called congee

1905
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:24,320
where you boil The rice down till it

1906
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:26,300
becomes like a paste and mash it up

1907
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:26,820
a little bit.

1908
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:30,300
That's what It's actually a congee soup.

1909
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:32,080
The Chinese soup is just boiled rice till

1910
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:35,180
dissolves into a thick Texture in the soup.

1911
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:36,200
It becomes a weird.

1912
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:38,160
Yeah, it becomes like a weird I guess

1913
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:45,700
almost feel like the Like watery mayonnaise Greasy

1914
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:46,220
no, I was sick.

1915
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:50,280
It's a watery starch What it looks like

1916
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:54,080
that's watery mayonnaise like if you took Mayonnaise

1917
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:54,740
is more grease.

1918
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:55,880
I could say wait.

1919
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:57,380
It's to me is like white axle grease.

1920
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,660
But yeah, I get your point Starch always

1921
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:02,080
lays down different than grease in my opinion.

1922
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:04,360
But but here's here's the thing.

1923
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:06,860
I'm bad eyesight, too That's fine.

1924
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:08,680
You I would make a lot of different

1925
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:11,760
varieties of these basic ingredients For example, I

1926
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:13,320
have an abundance of string beans, so I

1927
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:15,540
do a tie a tie string bean stir

1928
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:19,300
-fry then I do Finely chopped string beans

1929
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:21,200
stewed with tomato and onion, which is a

1930
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:23,220
very soft Mediterranean dish, right?

1931
01:08:23,779 --> 01:08:26,720
Then you do a steamed String beans in

1932
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:27,439
a peanut sauce.

1933
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:29,180
So I've got string beans three different ways

1934
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:30,479
And if you eat them three days in

1935
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:31,779
a row, you don't feel like you're eating

1936
01:08:31,779 --> 01:08:34,000
the same thing Even though it's the same

1937
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:34,479
ingredient.

1938
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:35,920
So you don't do the string beans with

1939
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:39,520
the cheese No, oh the French on you

1940
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,100
those who is it the white people do

1941
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:43,819
the mushroom it was an onion soup mushroom

1942
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,000
Me not the white people.

1943
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:48,600
There's a Mediterranean version where they put certain

1944
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:49,640
kind of cheese on it.

1945
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:53,479
It's like no, no Never even heard of

1946
01:08:53,479 --> 01:08:53,620
it.

1947
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:55,140
Maybe I'll look into it, but it doesn't

1948
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:58,560
sound It's like a cheese and olive oil

1949
01:08:58,560 --> 01:08:59,260
kind of comedy.

1950
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:02,080
It's really doesn't sound right, but it it's

1951
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,939
If you do a hard cheese, that's very

1952
01:09:04,939 --> 01:09:07,380
sharp that always it's all flavor enhancer It's

1953
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:09,080
a condiment by the way a hard good

1954
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:12,319
Parmesan Reggiano Which is not a regular Parmesan

1955
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:13,100
grated.

1956
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:15,560
It acts like a condiment It's a very

1957
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:18,520
sharp like if you have very sharp cheese

1958
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:21,100
a good quality sharp cheese even dare I

1959
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:23,880
say a blue cheese like Maytag or something

1960
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:26,939
That acts more like a condiment in the

1961
01:09:26,939 --> 01:09:29,620
body And it's a fermented as well So

1962
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:31,300
anyway, well the cheese go back to the

1963
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:33,840
food recommendation when the body is sort of

1964
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:36,880
attacking itself and atrophy another thing that could

1965
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,200
be happening with that is The body is

1966
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:42,840
sending out a signal that it's doing okay

1967
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:45,740
when it's not Let me say that again

1968
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:48,380
This is dramatic, but you know the AZT

1969
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:49,840
stuff and the stuff they you know, there's

1970
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,939
no such thing as AIDS No one died

1971
01:09:51,939 --> 01:09:54,660
or got sick because the medication is a

1972
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:58,080
hormone That when you take the AIDS medication

1973
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:00,340
It's the hormone that the cells give off

1974
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:02,680
after apoptosis when they're replaced that they have

1975
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:05,040
grown back If you take the hormone the

1976
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:06,580
cells are gonna fall off Anyway, if you

1977
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:07,920
take the hormone the body's gonna think the

1978
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,920
cells have grown back and they haven't and

1979
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:12,140
they won't So you start to atrophy?

1980
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:15,200
Right, so that would be if the body

1981
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:17,420
is producing something like that, which is possible

1982
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:21,280
Right almost as if he's taking, you know

1983
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:23,380
AZT and AZT I think was ruled out

1984
01:10:23,380 --> 01:10:25,180
They have like ten other drugs now replacement

1985
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:25,880
for it, right?

1986
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,480
They have all kinds of stuff now Now

1987
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:30,600
there's preparation to prevent and it makes oh

1988
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:31,100
my god.

1989
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,960
Yeah, they got like eight different.

1990
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:34,940
It's it's ridiculous Yeah, that's okay.

1991
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:36,380
I mean let them do what they got

1992
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:37,720
to do You know, if you confront them

1993
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:39,500
on this, you know what they say the

1994
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:41,240
medical people and how do I know this?

1995
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:43,180
No, if you confront them on what they're

1996
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:44,540
doing, they say we don't have a right

1997
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:46,260
to do that You're saying we don't have

1998
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:47,060
a right to exist.

1999
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:48,360
That's what that's sir.

2000
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,280
That's their answer to the to what they're

2001
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:53,460
doing, by the way Go they shift you.

2002
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:55,000
Well, yeah, it shifts over to the legal

2003
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:55,800
side, right?

2004
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:01,760
Yeah, there's a weird commercial out there actually

2005
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:04,280
Greek and and it says yeah, this is

2006
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:06,000
great This is you know, this helps prevent

2007
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,240
the spread of HIV and AIDS and blah

2008
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:10,280
blah They go through this whole thing and

2009
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:12,420
they show you males females having fun with

2010
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:14,320
each other This and that and you know

2011
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,960
laughing and playing drums and then at the

2012
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:18,120
end of it It says, you know all

2013
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:21,000
the warnings one of them says this this

2014
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,880
product has not been tested in people assigned

2015
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:26,460
female at birth Oh my gosh.

2016
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:27,360
Yeah.

2017
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:27,760
Okay.

2018
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:29,320
Well, let's get off but yeah, it's horrible

2019
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:31,060
But yeah, it's amazing what they're getting you

2020
01:11:31,060 --> 01:11:32,880
to volunteer to but anyway, this is the

2021
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:35,260
I'm using this as an analogy So if

2022
01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:36,940
the body is producing a certain thing when

2023
01:11:36,940 --> 01:11:39,100
I had the circus flu This was after

2024
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:41,520
this was like 2022 23 or something like

2025
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:44,380
that 23 Last year.

2026
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,860
Yeah, I was like, oh my gosh.

2027
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:49,080
I got hit with something because the niece

2028
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:50,820
who was living in a condition She was

2029
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:53,540
a carrier of this energy that I picked

2030
01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:55,840
up on and it was compatible because she's

2031
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:58,860
related a niece In other words, your sister's

2032
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:01,860
daughter or sister's son is very close to

2033
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:05,040
Maybe people said we even have similar mannerisms,

2034
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:06,800
you know, and we don't even I got

2035
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,400
cousins like that It's like you guys kind

2036
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:09,380
of do the same thing.

2037
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:11,000
Yeah, and we know it's been great.

2038
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:12,720
Yeah, it's in there So anyway, I got

2039
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:14,340
really sick and some things I mean you're

2040
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:15,960
gonna die from this or it's gonna get

2041
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:18,020
really bad So I said, well, I know

2042
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:18,800
what's going on.

2043
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:20,940
I need to change the pattern the code

2044
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:23,820
It's kind of like isolating a computer virus,

2045
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:25,820
you know, your computer is running shitty You

2046
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:28,980
got like super super spyware eliminator, wherever it

2047
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:32,040
finally isolates the code Right, and then suddenly

2048
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:34,100
the computer works better, right?

2049
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:36,220
So it's something like that So the body

2050
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:37,840
got into a mode where it was producing

2051
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:42,220
this very very unfit state of existence Where

2052
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:43,820
I was in the middle of the night,

2053
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,500
I stopped breathing and I knew it wasn't

2054
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:47,560
breathing It was stopped reading for so long

2055
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:48,680
that I put my hand on my chest.

2056
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,760
I'm not breathing I got to get this

2057
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:53,160
going again jumped in a cold shower with

2058
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:53,880
the window open.

2059
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:57,100
It was 35 degrees Outside as well and

2060
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:58,860
that got me back on I said, okay,

2061
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:01,340
this is really stupid So what I did

2062
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:03,000
was I got a really good piece of

2063
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,400
chocolate, but if you want to get into

2064
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:07,780
good chocolates Godiva Start off with that you

2065
01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:10,780
can get it at CVS Walgreens actually carries

2066
01:13:10,780 --> 01:13:12,820
it's like eight nine bucks for a five

2067
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:14,340
ounce bag or six cents worth it I

2068
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:16,960
think there's a little individually wrapped squares at

2069
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:19,860
Walmart even Godiva, I don't know.

2070
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:21,480
Maybe I hope so because then you get

2071
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:25,600
it just they are the chocolatier starting Springboard

2072
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:28,200
chocolatiers lint is not the Hershey's forget it

2073
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:30,560
that that you know, no, it's like saying

2074
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:32,420
Maxwell house is good coffee You know, it's

2075
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:34,000
you'll be happy if you're getting an oil

2076
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,540
change and they serve a Maxwell house You'll

2077
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:38,020
be happy waiting for your car.

2078
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,600
But no, it's not a good coffee.

2079
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:43,480
It's not even real Dollar General carries the

2080
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:46,300
short bars the small bars to now so

2081
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:47,380
Godiva for Godiva.

2082
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:47,640
Yep.

2083
01:13:47,860 --> 01:13:50,120
Oh, excellent Okay, that is your start on

2084
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:52,580
what fine chocolate tastes like there is a

2085
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:54,900
whole slew if you have a market of

2086
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:57,380
local Chocolatiers meaning like they come out of

2087
01:13:57,380 --> 01:13:59,340
like San Fran and I don't know about

2088
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:01,040
that You know with places like in the

2089
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:02,680
Northwest some I don't know.

2090
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:04,800
I think I never East Coast source $12

2091
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,860
chocolate bars We're talking about the size of

2092
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:09,080
like a regular Hershey's, you know dollar bar.

2093
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:11,540
So but that is a good chocolate There's

2094
01:14:11,540 --> 01:14:12,800
a whole bunch of I don't remember there.

2095
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:15,700
But if you want to get started on

2096
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:18,760
good chocolate Godiva, okay, that's your start I'm

2097
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:21,060
not saying just don't say it's got to

2098
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:21,480
be Godiva.

2099
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:23,180
No, but that's your start in quality.

2100
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:25,920
So you have a Whatever chocolate you get

2101
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:26,540
tasted good.

2102
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:27,240
I'd be like, oh wow.

2103
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:29,600
There's a really big difference qualitatively here So

2104
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:32,120
anyway, that Tony that Tony's is not bad

2105
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:34,340
too, by the way on that level sort

2106
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:37,620
of like Godiva Which one Tony's?

2107
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:40,440
Okay, I've never tried it.

2108
01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:42,740
Yeah, it's very expensive by the bar, but

2109
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:44,540
Very much worth it.

2110
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:46,920
Their main push is that they don't use

2111
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:49,180
the you know, like the abusive child labor

2112
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:51,340
and all that But oh my gosh, yeah

2113
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:52,960
the quality No, but I don't care about

2114
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:53,100
that.

2115
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:54,520
But the thing is if the quality is

2116
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:57,420
up to par research high quality chocolatiers Yeah,

2117
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,480
it doesn't have to be chocolate it could

2118
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:01,200
be cheese right but then what I did

2119
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:03,600
was my way my way of looking at

2120
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,400
Wines is I always like a montage a

2121
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:06,620
mix.

2122
01:15:06,740 --> 01:15:08,360
I don't get just one grape, you know

2123
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:10,580
in a cab or Merlot Whatever get a

2124
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:13,020
montage where that's several grapes mix.

2125
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:15,940
They tend to agree better There's they're less

2126
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:18,560
critical on adding sulfites or battery acid to

2127
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:21,140
them Even though it still contains some of

2128
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:21,300
it.

2129
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:23,340
So I took a swig of some wine

2130
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:24,920
and the chocolate Went back to sleep three

2131
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:25,340
hours later.

2132
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:27,240
I was fine as if nothing ever happened.

2133
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:31,600
Nothing at all So they just knocked it

2134
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:33,060
out and this is also worked with two

2135
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:35,320
other people That I've been in contact that

2136
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:37,420
thought they had the the kovat thing right

2137
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:39,800
knocked it out right away So it proves

2138
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,560
that when they do all killed all the

2139
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:42,700
viruses in the body.

2140
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:44,040
That's what I did, right?

2141
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:47,960
No has nothing to do with that Even

2142
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,500
on Wikipedia years ago.

2143
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:52,120
I read on a 2010 2011 I got

2144
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:54,880
interviewed by some very furry people on talk

2145
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:57,200
show And there was a lot of virus

2146
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:59,020
stuff going on in the news back then

2147
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:00,340
and I said, let's look up what it

2148
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:04,280
is even on Wikipedia Virology is a branch

2149
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:07,620
of toxicology and what is known as viruses

2150
01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:10,960
are produced in the liver and Expelled out

2151
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:12,220
of the liver into the bloodstream.

2152
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:12,580
Boom.

2153
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:16,080
That is the classic doesn't talk about airborne

2154
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:20,280
doesn't talk about contagion doesn't talk about Injections

2155
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:22,120
as a picking it up on the surface

2156
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:22,740
none of that.

2157
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:23,100
Yes.

2158
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:25,360
Yeah your body creates it again and the

2159
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:27,620
reason I'm saying these things is because for

2160
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:29,500
40 years, I've been reading stuff and the

2161
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:32,160
definitions of branches of the science of physio

2162
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:35,820
of being a physician of physiology and guess

2163
01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:38,000
what 99% of the time unless you

2164
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,180
get into contagions and Even they're called induced

2165
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:43,260
diseases as a book that I looked at

2166
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:45,980
about tropical fevers and stuff, which is another

2167
01:16:45,980 --> 01:16:49,020
thing But everything was produced by the body

2168
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:50,540
and we're looking at the old text, you

2169
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:52,200
know stuff where they really did some hardcore

2170
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:56,560
experimentation on people well, they still do But

2171
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:58,880
And they're putting it in print and I

2172
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:01,180
was like the body's producing everything Then when

2173
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:03,160
I started looking at anatomy cross sections of

2174
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,780
skin lung tissue intestines and say how does

2175
01:17:05,780 --> 01:17:06,680
anything go through there?

2176
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:08,060
Nothing goes through there.

2177
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:12,200
It's all these layers of water resistant water

2178
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:15,880
repellent actually layers and Closed off with blood

2179
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:16,500
vessels in it.

2180
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:18,340
Nothing is going through so it is induction

2181
01:17:18,340 --> 01:17:20,080
just like I read, right?

2182
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:22,360
So but anyway back to the Matthew thing,

2183
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:25,600
so I would break The spell of this

2184
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:27,520
with a good piece of chocolate piece of

2185
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:30,060
hard cheese and some wine if you should

2186
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:31,620
feel it in three or four hours a

2187
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:34,620
difference or an Onset of wellness or better

2188
01:17:34,620 --> 01:17:35,800
fitness or a few days.

2189
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:36,720
You don't have to do this.

2190
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:37,600
Don't do this.

2191
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:38,940
It's not a meal I'm not talking about

2192
01:17:38,940 --> 01:17:40,640
having a meal of chocolate and wine just

2193
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:43,880
a small amount Of both and wait a

2194
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:45,580
little bit three four hours just like when

2195
01:17:45,580 --> 01:17:48,280
you take ibuprofens You take a you take

2196
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:49,820
a fistful ibuprofens, right?

2197
01:17:49,860 --> 01:17:51,500
And then you wait three four or five

2198
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,320
hours an hour later If you're feeling like

2199
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:54,580
crap, you'll say let me take some more

2200
01:17:54,580 --> 01:17:55,140
right?

2201
01:17:55,180 --> 01:17:56,200
You don't do that, right?

2202
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:57,940
How is it a seat of my friend?

2203
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:00,060
What is it one works faster?

2204
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:02,000
I think the ibuprofen works faster than the

2205
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:02,880
acetomyophen, right?

2206
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:06,300
They're basically almost the same They are slightly

2207
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:09,040
different chemicals, but yeah, the thing is as

2208
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:10,980
far as their their activity and all that

2209
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:12,800
That's why they put caffeine on the outside

2210
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,840
of these things is The combination of the

2211
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:16,060
two.

2212
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:19,880
Yeah, you start I've seen that in a

2213
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:22,600
liquid right they combine a matter of fact

2214
01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:24,180
Excedrin itself.

2215
01:18:24,220 --> 01:18:28,740
It contains aspirin acetaminophen and Basically the components

2216
01:18:28,740 --> 01:18:29,780
of Advil all together.

2217
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:31,580
So it's so it's a cocktail.

2218
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:33,380
That's a definition of a cocktail, right?

2219
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,660
That's why it works Actually, okay.

2220
01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:36,340
Yeah, that's rapid.

2221
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:37,740
So this is a combination.

2222
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:41,980
So other things to try are Physical and

2223
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:44,800
mental things combination change your mentality change your

2224
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,360
physical You might want to get a massage

2225
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:49,340
if you don't get massages You might want

2226
01:18:49,340 --> 01:18:50,940
to get some kind of physical therapy if

2227
01:18:50,940 --> 01:18:53,400
you don't physical therapy could be a schwitz

2228
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:57,060
Which is you know a hot steam place,

2229
01:18:57,180 --> 01:19:01,000
you know Bath massage slash whatever.

2230
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:04,340
I mean use your imagination break break pattern

2231
01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:07,020
like Jason Brashear says change your Patterns in

2232
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:09,720
your life and see if that helps Again

2233
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:12,620
the whole grain and legume, you know being

2234
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:15,560
and seaweed would be or and root vegetable

2235
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:19,540
Start off with baby food Consistency not all

2236
01:19:19,540 --> 01:19:21,600
the time do like what baby food meal,

2237
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:25,200
you know paste very hydrated with a whole

2238
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:28,080
fruit and eat infrequently because when you eat

2239
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:30,780
a Tremendous amount of energy goes into breaking

2240
01:19:30,780 --> 01:19:32,060
these things down, right?

2241
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:33,820
Just like when you have a cold think

2242
01:19:33,820 --> 01:19:35,920
of the burning aspect of calories right how

2243
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:38,820
stupid that is If you know anyone especially

2244
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:40,920
I knew someone back in the old old

2245
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:43,020
school boiler coal boilers, they used to heat

2246
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:45,320
the schools They had to go in there

2247
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:47,660
like three four hours before class and they

2248
01:19:47,660 --> 01:19:49,880
busted their ass loading the boiler with coal

2249
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:51,440
because it takes A while to get the

2250
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:53,580
coal to burn and then once it gets

2251
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:54,020
burning.

2252
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:54,800
It's so hot.

2253
01:19:54,860 --> 01:19:56,640
You'd have to throttle it down, right?

2254
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:58,560
It's a lot of work, you know to

2255
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:01,040
get that going and get it to stabilize

2256
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:03,720
and the same thing with the human body,

2257
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:06,540
that's why When you take these things take

2258
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:08,460
them in small amounts give yourself some time

2259
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:11,200
And that would be that's all I could

2260
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:13,780
recommend The other thing is there's something about

2261
01:20:13,780 --> 01:20:16,200
seeing someone in person if you're very intuitive

2262
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:18,080
and you're good at this you almost need

2263
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:21,300
to see Physically see them or train someone

2264
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:23,100
who knows what to look for because there's

2265
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:25,860
very very fine things in someone's character and

2266
01:20:25,860 --> 01:20:28,800
their facial Features that features when you're born,

2267
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:30,860
but their condition, you know, like bags under

2268
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:32,120
your eyes as kidneys, right?

2269
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:33,620
This that and the other right?

2270
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:37,460
The bottom of your earlobe a very deep

2271
01:20:37,460 --> 01:20:40,440
crease is heart heart is being taxed too

2272
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:40,900
much, right?

2273
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:43,480
There's all these face reading and unfortunately, there's

2274
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:48,260
not much On this online I've picked up

2275
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:51,480
on that from studying Stuff written for years

2276
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:52,840
and years and I started putting and then

2277
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:55,440
speaking to people who did this And then

2278
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:57,780
putting my own version of it together and

2279
01:20:57,780 --> 01:20:59,320
you have to be intuitive You also have

2280
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:00,220
to be in good fitness.

2281
01:21:00,220 --> 01:21:03,040
If you're not feeling well, you cannot diagnose

2282
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:04,020
someone else, right?

2283
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:07,860
so So all these things, but anyway, it's

2284
01:21:07,860 --> 01:21:09,060
going to take a little bit of time

2285
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:11,480
not a lot of time Three days seven

2286
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:13,280
days ten days to see a major change

2287
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:15,860
when you make major changes, but you need

2288
01:21:15,860 --> 01:21:18,580
to go into these changes Abruptly because you

2289
01:21:18,580 --> 01:21:20,460
don't you want to break what you're what

2290
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:28,120
you're experiencing, but not Radio network
