1
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,060
Rated Y Sonic Event 2.10 and Greek,

2
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,100
how are you?

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,080
Good, 2.10, okay, we're still trucking along.

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,780
Yeah, I'm okay, yeah.

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,540
Yeah, just doing it, man.

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,880
Kind of goes with the synergy there, too.

7
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,040
Like, you know, when we go with the

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,880
numbers there, people are going back, and somebody

9
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,120
just hit 12 recently, and somebody else hit

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,520
120, and a lot of other people get

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,380
them as they come out.

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,260
So, you know, here we go.

13
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,420
Yeah, we've got some new people asking questions

14
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,660
via e-mail and all that.

15
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:40,840
Nice.

16
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,280
And I get some longer e-mails regarding

17
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,280
how thankful people are about, specifically, health, all

18
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,180
kinds of other stuff, even mechanical stuff.

19
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,120
So I figure for each one of those,

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,000
there's ten more that are benefiting extremely.

21
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,600
But I want to just state, like in

22
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,440
the news recently, you know, there's the Israel

23
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,580
bombing Iran and back and forth, or the

24
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,680
Ukraine conflict, you know, which is not really

25
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,080
a war.

26
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,640
Like, Vietnam was not a war, right?

27
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:08,160
Right.

28
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,760
Actually, this was question number one anyway, is

29
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,820
the Middle East.

30
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,700
Yeah, this has nothing to do with, for

31
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,420
example, it's about, okay, we live in a

32
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,000
place that has negative value.

33
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,340
In other words, it's fucked up.

34
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:26,160
If you're here, for whatever spiritual, whatever you

35
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,100
believe in or hold dear, you did something

36
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,880
really fucked up to be put here, number

37
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,240
one.

38
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,960
Or you're not supposed to be here, and

39
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,540
you're here in a fucked up place.

40
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,480
You came deliberately because you wanted to play

41
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,280
these video games that are really fucked up,

42
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,540
and they sent you here anyway.

43
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,040
This is a fucked up place.

44
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,300
If you are so insensitive that you think

45
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,380
that you actually enjoy walking on the seashore,

46
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,880
breathing the clean air, mountain air, beautiful sunset

47
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,560
and flowers, if you're that insensitive, stay in

48
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,880
your insensitivity and your lack of perception and

49
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,820
enjoy those things like a good meal, a

50
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,560
good conversation.

51
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,420
Generally, this is a very fucked up place,

52
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,200
like it or not.

53
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,520
Now, it's a physical place, and like I

54
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,080
was mentioning to someone, I think on a

55
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,820
podcast I did recently, we're on the paranormal.

56
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,560
When you're disembodied, it's very much like being

57
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,020
high or drunk, right?

58
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,840
So don't look forward to that either.

59
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,560
I don't know really what I'm saying in

60
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,020
terms of putting it all together, but what

61
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,580
I want to do is say this.

62
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,780
The Israeli-Iran attack was June 12th, 13th.

63
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,760
What is it roughly now?

64
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,960
Today is the 14th, right now.

65
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,660
Okay, the 14th, so it's like the third

66
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,140
day of the fourth month, which is very

67
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,060
rare you get a conflict starting around that

68
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:53,860
time and all that.

69
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,080
So that conflict or that exchange is really

70
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,620
more for not the Israelis or the Iranians,

71
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,160
but for everyone else, if that makes any

72
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,500
sense.

73
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,720
It's to signal to everyone else, look how

74
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,160
fucked up it is over here, right?

75
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,280
First of all, the state of political affairs

76
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,000
and people working in there, first of all,

77
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,720
go into a DMV office, Social Security office,

78
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,140
you can't tell me the people that work

79
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,180
there are fully human, right?

80
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,540
I don't know if you know what I

81
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:23,720
mean.

82
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,320
They're some kind of degenerate whatever.

83
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,620
Even State Department, executive stuff, I've seen people

84
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,400
work up in the Senate and all that.

85
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,700
There's something wrong.

86
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,380
Something seems to be missing.

87
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,920
I mean, you know, some people go with

88
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,180
the NPC deal.

89
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,380
There's something wrong with these people, right, in

90
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:41,800
the get-go.

91
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,380
And everyone has something wrong in their own

92
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:44,700
way.

93
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,660
It's not a general classification.

94
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,560
It's another species.

95
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,020
So this is the classification of what you

96
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:50,800
call authority.

97
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,180
The lizards that run this place, yes, I

98
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,680
haven't brought that up in a long time,

99
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,340
and that is about a 99.999%

100
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,800
sure the lizards run this place, lizard energy,

101
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:01,560
whatever.

102
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,440
Are orchestrating on a very low level.

103
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,760
Now, low-level stuff.

104
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,000
This is like, think of a real basic

105
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,680
video game like Space Invaders or Pac-Man,

106
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,000
level one.

107
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,220
That's what's going on.

108
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,060
The reality of Israel and Iran, I've been

109
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,060
saying this for 20 years, even archaics calls

110
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,520
it the exilarchy, the real heavy-duty Israeli

111
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,980
pawnbrokers of the world live in Iran, Persia.

112
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,160
They always have, still do.

113
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,800
I've always talked about how the Mossad and

114
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,040
the Persian mob are like hand in glove.

115
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,280
They're actually best friends.

116
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,700
Second of all, we're talking about the underworld,

117
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,000
right?

118
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,560
Second of all, the Persians, Iranians, are not

119
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:49,920
Muslim.

120
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,520
They put these scumbags, they call them fundamentalists,

121
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,100
which they're not.

122
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:55,700
They're radical.

123
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:01,140
Fundamental means being basic, and like a fundamental

124
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:04,360
biblical person follows the law, right?

125
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,600
Yeah, I've always found that.

126
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,380
You know what I mean?

127
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,700
They don't follow anything.

128
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,640
They're just radical.

129
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,340
There's nothing radical about Islam, by the way,

130
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,080
nothing at all.

131
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,120
Well, I've always found that.

132
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,920
See, it's not just about Islam, because they're

133
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,200
a Christian fundamentalist, this, that, third thing.

134
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,280
Well, fundamentally, it's been used wrong, just like

135
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,500
anarchy is used wrong.

136
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,000
Yeah, but I've always found the use of

137
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,100
that word really crazy, because it's like fundamental.

138
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,360
Yeah, like the word nice is used wrong.

139
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:27,560
Yeah.

140
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,300
But let me just continue on this.

141
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:29,980
Sure, sure.

142
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,900
So it was confirmed that during the first

143
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,840
Poppy Bush administration, up until Obama, there were

144
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,320
shipments of nuclear triggers to Iran, Persia, and

145
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,480
they didn't want it, so they have a

146
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,200
place on the border with Iraq that they

147
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:46,740
store these.

148
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,100
But either one can get them, right?

149
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:49,600
Okay.

150
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,340
Yeah, so all this stuff about nuclear, it's

151
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:52,860
total bullshit.

152
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,500
Okay, on the American side, I don't think

153
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,680
any of these people are real, right?

154
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,340
And what I mean by that, you could

155
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,440
use whatever.

156
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,860
They're not organic.

157
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,800
Look up, there was a lot of stuff

158
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,060
going on back in the 80s and 90s

159
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,360
about human robotoids, and it doesn't mean robot,

160
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,820
there's cloning, right?

161
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,540
Cloning was done in the 30s.

162
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,900
None of these people are real that you

163
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,000
see on TV or whatever.

164
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,240
I can assure you of that based on

165
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,680
my perception and opinion of what's going on.

166
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,500
So what I suggest is what I always

167
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,720
suggest, food, clothing, shelter, people are impressed.

168
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,760
Semi-intelligent to intelligent people are very impressed

169
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,820
when I give my defense on food, clothing,

170
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,600
shelter, right?

171
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,180
And this is what you have to proceed

172
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,560
on, because if there really was a conflict

173
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,980
between Ukraine and Russia, that would have lasted

174
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,760
72 hours, tops, with millions of people dead,

175
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:54,920
right?

176
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,420
Same with Israel and Persia, right?

177
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,280
I mean, if you can go look at

178
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,200
Iran, they showed about 200 miles of hardened

179
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,200
tunnels with thousands of ballistic and direct missiles,

180
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,880
guided missiles of every kind, right?

181
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,620
Now, ballistic just means they toss it up

182
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,280
in the air and it falls on a

183
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,660
trajectory where guided and, you know, cruise missiles

184
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,700
are guided and all that.

185
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,600
So this is all bullshit, and it's nothing

186
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,360
about attacking Persia.

187
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,900
It's about attacking everyone who is watching the

188
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,120
event, the same with Ukraine.

189
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,520
It has nothing to do with the people

190
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,320
of Ukraine or Russia.

191
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,100
It has to do with everyone who's watching

192
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:31,880
the conflict.

193
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,600
That's why there is an old adage.

194
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,220
You've seen, like, people, when they see a

195
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,880
gory scene, they're like, oh, I can't look

196
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,180
at that.

197
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,320
Have you ever heard that?

198
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,600
I can't look at that.

199
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:42,540
I can't look.

200
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:43,420
Yeah, yeah.

201
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,380
Yeah, so you don't take it in.

202
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,540
So my suggestion with all these conflicts, do

203
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,060
not take it in, just like their holidays,

204
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,420
their jack-off holidays.

205
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,920
Having holidays in December and January is like

206
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,700
taking a shower before you go jump into

207
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,380
a mud pit.

208
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,220
It's totally worthless, right?

209
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,440
So you're looking at what the medical society

210
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,740
is telling you the heart is a pump

211
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,600
and viruses and you absorb.

212
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,960
It's completely worthless.

213
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,140
There's nothing there to use.

214
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,660
The financial place, right, all the financials, the

215
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,900
lawyers that talk about, you know, like I

216
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,720
tell people, there's dumb.

217
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,220
There's dumb.

218
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,000
And then there's, right?

219
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,780
Three levels of dumb.

220
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,060
Attorneys, right?

221
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,520
Doctors.

222
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,059
I mean, you're talking about you are completely

223
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:40,159
surrounded in funhouse tactics here, funhouse strategy and

224
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,460
funhouse manipulation.

225
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,960
Nothing here is not even as it could

226
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,140
be.

227
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,340
You know how these are these idiots, environmentalists

228
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,120
and the people want to make the world

229
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,840
a better place.

230
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,620
Like, oh, one day, one day we'll make

231
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:53,760
it.

232
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,020
We just have to keep talking about jerk

233
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:56,260
off.

234
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,380
All you got to do is stop participating.

235
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,260
The thing falls apart and doing nothing.

236
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,320
Here's the thing.

237
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,480
Doing nothing is better than participating in any

238
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,440
of their stuff, especially with health.

239
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,640
Right.

240
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,540
Like if they diagnose you with 35 fictional

241
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,300
diseases that you think are real, if you

242
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,180
do absolutely nothing and do nothing to the

243
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,680
point where you retract, you'll get you'll be

244
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:19,940
fine.

245
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,180
So, yeah, the same with financial.

246
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,520
If you stop engaging in their tactics, the

247
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,720
value of the currency that you're using, the

248
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,940
value of the negotiable instruments will increase because

249
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,300
there's less of it being produced.

250
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,540
So actually doing nothing is actually the cure.

251
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,780
Not this activism.

252
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,620
The only thing you should have that's active

253
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,180
is yeast.

254
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,220
You know, I love it.

255
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,880
How they have a little thing.

256
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,840
Active yeast, you know, for bread making.

257
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,880
Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

258
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,060
So, yeah, there's that.

259
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,020
They say there's active bacteria and what?

260
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,000
Yogurt, too, right?

261
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,600
Yogurts.

262
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,360
Yeah.

263
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,080
Yogurt's different.

264
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,500
They call it culture.

265
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,920
The only culture they have here is in

266
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,380
their yogurt.

267
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,900
And not even then it's synthetic.

268
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,860
So I just want to put this out

269
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,300
because.

270
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,660
And here's the other thing.

271
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,400
If there were real protests, they wouldn't be

272
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:06,900
on TV.

273
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,400
How many times have you heard of in

274
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,780
the alternative media?

275
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,860
Thankfully, sometimes half a million people in Bucharest

276
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,920
and none of them made protesting whatever.

277
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,080
And there's no media coverage.

278
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:19,820
Right.

279
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:20,780
Right.

280
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:20,880
Right.

281
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,280
So if these protests and this thing going

282
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,060
on was real, it would not be on

283
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:25,300
TV.

284
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,880
If there was a real terror event, it

285
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,040
would not be on TV.

286
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,480
This is how bad it is right now.

287
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,800
Well, so today's today's no king's protest and

288
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,840
all that is what is completely synthetic.

289
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,420
You can trace it back financially back to

290
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,280
federal funding.

291
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,720
By the way, is what people don't know.

292
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,520
You know, the police, all the police, local

293
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,900
police, city police are federal.

294
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,760
How do you know?

295
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,040
When you get a traffic ticket or a

296
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,320
parking ticket and you go pay it, ask

297
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:53,960
for a receipt.

298
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,240
What does it say on the bottom?

299
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,920
U.S. dot gov.

300
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,860
U.S. dot gov is federal.

301
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:04,140
Washington, D.C. Anyway, all of the body

302
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,860
cams, all of the body cams are paid

303
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,080
for directly by federal.

304
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,000
Right.

305
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,720
Remember, there was a big I studied that

306
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,440
the federal wants to put body cams on

307
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:15,780
everyone.

308
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,480
All the body cams are federal federal property.

309
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,320
That's why it makes sense that they get

310
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,140
the tanks and everything from the Pentagon when

311
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,260
they're excess.

312
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,120
Yeah.

313
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:24,460
Yeah.

314
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,800
So the no king.

315
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,260
I just thought I saw like a guy

316
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,020
had a Tesla and it said Elon sucks

317
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:29,600
on the back.

318
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,160
No kings.

319
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,760
I don't even know what that was.

320
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,060
And then I saw I pulled into Lowe's

321
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,120
to get some furring strips.

322
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,800
I'm building these sunshades from cooling and all

323
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,080
that.

324
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,560
And then I saw no kings.

325
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,400
And then I saw this.

326
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,200
I saw that.

327
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,160
I was like, OK.

328
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,380
Then when I get on the computer, when

329
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,080
I got back, I saw no kings again.

330
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,060
OK, this is what they're calling the protest.

331
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,300
And then you just said it.

332
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:50,620
Yeah.

333
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,740
This is like three hours.

334
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,620
This is four hours of me being aware

335
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,340
of the no kings.

336
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,340
So ignore it.

337
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,280
Do not participate.

338
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,180
Just like it's a non participatory like their

339
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:02,560
holidays.

340
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,220
Don't participate.

341
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:03,640
Voting.

342
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,300
Do not participate.

343
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,720
Do not participate in anything political when they

344
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,220
do their wars, by the way.

345
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,080
They're not wars or conflicts where they kill

346
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,480
people.

347
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:10,880
Yeah.

348
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,800
It's about those watching, not those.

349
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,640
It's not Ukraine and Russia.

350
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,260
It's everyone who's watching that going on.

351
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,740
That's who it's for, because there's nothing to

352
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,580
be gained between Ukraine and Russia.

353
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,380
There's nothing to be gained what's going on

354
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,980
with the interchange between Israel and Iran right

355
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,080
now.

356
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:27,580
There's no gain.

357
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,080
There's nothing.

358
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,800
There's nothing to be gained.

359
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,140
So it's it's a show for those watching

360
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,280
it to get outraged.

361
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,920
That's what the lizards like.

362
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,080
So anyway, I'm just going to put this

363
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,380
out here because ignore it.

364
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,580
Even if they drop a freaking bomb on

365
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,740
your house and if you if it kills

366
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:45,980
you.

367
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,440
Well, then you won't have to think about

368
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,740
what I'm saying, what to do.

369
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,240
You don't have to worry about it.

370
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,340
Right.

371
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,560
So let's say someone in Persia or Israel

372
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,160
is listening to us in Tel Aviv and

373
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,520
they drop a bomb on your house and

374
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,000
it kills you.

375
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,840
What I just said doesn't matter anyway because

376
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,220
you're dead.

377
00:12:59,580 --> 00:12:59,960
It's irrelevant.

378
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:00,860
Yeah.

379
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,260
But if you survive, think about think about

380
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:04,420
it.

381
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,240
What was the purpose of what's to be

382
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:06,580
gained?

383
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,300
Nothing.

384
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,140
And then move on.

385
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,080
So anyway, with that said, I just wanted

386
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,120
to put this out because I look, I

387
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,620
have so little faith in humanity's being able

388
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,740
to people in general, anyone being able to

389
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,780
string thoughts together and come up with a

390
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,800
rational conclusion.

391
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,900
So I don't mind volunteering like everyone is

392
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,040
entitled to my opinion.

393
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,620
You feel me?

394
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:29,820
OK.

395
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:30,920
Right.

396
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,260
Everyone's entitled to my opinion.

397
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,600
So that's what I just put out.

398
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,320
And I hope it helps.

399
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,140
I think it will.

400
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,320
Ivan, not now.

401
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,500
You want to be a shoulder cat?

402
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,660
You got to stay down.

403
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,020
That's a T-shirt right there, though.

404
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,560
Everyone is entitled to my opinion.

405
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,180
I think that's perfect for a T-shirt,

406
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:44,600
don't you?

407
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,280
Well, I don't know.

408
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,660
I don't know if it's perfect, but it

409
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,520
is so because I said so.

410
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,380
And that's my story.

411
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,220
And I'm sticking to it.

412
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:51,400
Right.

413
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,160
Speaking of stories and sticking to it, what

414
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:53,500
do you got?

415
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:57,440
Well, a couple of comments, you know, because

416
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,840
I posted that Arkham's Razor podcast, the guy

417
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,160
from Paranormies you just mentioned.

418
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,520
Yeah.

419
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,060
Yeah.

420
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,960
So people commented about that, that they had

421
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,600
noted that they had run into some synchronicity

422
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,380
with listening to the a few.

423
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,140
Actually, there's like three of them altogether that

424
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,780
they had noticed synchronicity during the day.

425
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,980
One of them said they were listening to

426
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,020
a Sonic from 2011.

427
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,220
And he you the Greek mentioned self-driving

428
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,000
cars happened to glance at my left at

429
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,640
a stoplight.

430
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,880
And right there was a driverless car.

431
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,080
Another time I was in Airbnb in Austin

432
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,380
listening to a Sonic from 2017.

433
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,680
And the moment he started talking about scorpions,

434
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,240
a scorpion literally appeared in the room.

435
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,920
And, you know, that's the thing about manifestation,

436
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,960
which came up in a comment or a

437
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,120
question, I should say here.

438
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,460
I'm connecting things together.

439
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,560
A question about positive visualization and all that.

440
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,540
And you've touched on it before, kind of

441
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,380
scoffed at it.

442
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,720
But at the same time, you do believe

443
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,200
in it.

444
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,360
Well, I scoff at it because ever since

445
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,820
a few weeks now, I've been thinking about

446
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,460
a slightly athletic Latin call girl.

447
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,800
And she hasn't showed up.

448
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,720
And someone said that it's not call girls

449
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,080
anymore.

450
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:06,680
It's apps.

451
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,740
You have to get an app.

452
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:08,540
Right.

453
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,820
But anyway, it's just a bad lascivious joke.

454
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,300
Whether it's true or not, it's up to

455
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:13,520
you.

456
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,760
But I think about a few years ago,

457
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,600
they used Craigslist a little bit.

458
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,940
But I guess they've stepped up now.

459
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,860
You go straight to an app because it's

460
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,420
stepped on.

461
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,820
It stepped on the independent.

462
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,240
They didn't want independence.

463
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,480
They have to do pimping.

464
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:25,760
Right.

465
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:26,340
Yeah.

466
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,280
That's to be controlled, made independent.

467
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,100
So the hoe breaks free from her pimp.

468
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,000
And most pimps are women, by the way,

469
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:33,700
these days.

470
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,140
These days, it's let's just say split down

471
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:37,440
the middle.

472
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,260
Having the pimps be half women, half men

473
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,520
is like saying they're women now.

474
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:41,800
Right.

475
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,000
Because it's unheard of.

476
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,200
Right.

477
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,000
So anyway, it's kind of like 75 or

478
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,960
50 years ago, the woman was a CEO

479
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,660
of a Fortune 500 company.

480
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:49,880
Right.

481
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,960
Just doesn't happen.

482
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:51,520
Right.

483
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,680
So anyway.

484
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,140
Yeah.

485
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,340
Manifestation.

486
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,740
There's more to it, I think, the idea.

487
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,660
Who was it, Jung, who talked about synchronicities

488
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,840
and all that?

489
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,440
The program that we're in.

490
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,280
There's nothing.

491
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,720
OK, so that makes it a tragedy.

492
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,400
You know the difference between a tragedy and

493
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:11,780
an accident.

494
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,740
An accident is not foreseen, but a tragedy

495
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,120
is foreseen and you go through it.

496
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,260
A tragedy, you know it's coming, actually.

497
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,620
They tell you at the beginning, this is

498
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,320
going to be a mess.

499
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,380
This is going to go bad.

500
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,020
And you wait and watch it happen.

501
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,740
But an accident just occurs out of nowhere.

502
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,020
So where an accident is completely unseen.

503
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,820
So that would make being here a tragedy.

504
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:29,820
Yeah.

505
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,660
Well, that.

506
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,600
OK, so being here would be a tragedy.

507
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,700
In other words, let me just finish the

508
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,700
thought, because, you know, there's synchronicities.

509
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,380
So in the back of your mind, once

510
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,620
you're aware of the concept, you're like, Oh,

511
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,200
if I hear of a driverless car, what

512
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,380
are the chances of me seeing it?

513
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,680
That's running in your back conscious, not in

514
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,020
your inner perception that's forward.

515
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,500
You know, you have forward thought and backward

516
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,140
thought, right?

517
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,540
Backward, you know, like people that do a

518
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,440
job for like an assembly line.

519
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,700
You don't even have to think about what

520
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,400
you're doing anymore.

521
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,480
You're an autopilot, right?

522
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,540
So we have these autopilots of new concepts

523
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,119
that run, especially when they're new.

524
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,420
And then we kind of forget about them.

525
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,339
That's a whole other.

526
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,119
That's a big topic to crack open.

527
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,880
But anyway, that was more of a comment

528
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,520
than a question.

529
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,960
How these things were just happening for this

530
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,780
individual, right?

531
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:15,240
Right.

532
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,720
And actually, like I said, it was about

533
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,839
three people commented with the same thing.

534
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,859
So somebody else talked about the biological vacuum.

535
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:23,780
And they give a story here about, you

536
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,260
know, giving blood and this and that.

537
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:27,160
And this is what they had to say.

538
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,320
I'm thinking how to make an experiment that

539
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,720
shows by the biological vacuum that demonstrates easily.

540
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,620
I thought about a can of food contaminated

541
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:39,920
with positive botulism, expanding and exploding.

542
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,500
The bacteria definitely are doing something to the

543
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:44,600
cell.

544
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,080
Well, canning, by the way, is a form

545
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,860
of vacuum, right?

546
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,120
Because it's sealed when it reaches its maximum

547
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:50,740
temperature.

548
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,880
And then as it cools, you have a

549
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,680
tremendous contraction.

550
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:58,060
And that prevents the imbalance.

551
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,200
There's still bacteria in there.

552
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,080
It's just dormant, right?

553
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,700
You can open some canned food and it'll

554
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,300
spoil once you open it, right?

555
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:04,680
Right.

556
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,560
And he just asked if anybody's brainstorming this.

557
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,240
He pointed out the thing about the can

558
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:10,960
and there's pressure.

559
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,000
But he was wondering if anybody had come

560
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,520
up with a way to sort of demonstrate

561
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,300
this and be able to do it with

562
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,900
a single cell all the way up to

563
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,580
maybe an animal.

564
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,500
And is anyone brainstorming this is finally the

565
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:22,820
question.

566
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,960
Oh, I'm glad because I put it out

567
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,180
there.

568
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:29,900
I need help in that field to, let's

569
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,520
say, make more of a summarial kind of

570
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,040
presentation and with examples.

571
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,700
I know the heart not being a pump

572
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,520
is easy to do.

573
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,980
One of the very, very old Frank Chester

574
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,900
videos, he has a silicone tube with a

575
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,140
two by four on a weight and he

576
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,000
increases the weight.

577
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,160
And he hits a plunger to move the

578
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,600
liquid.

579
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,920
And it hardly moves through the tube, right?

580
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,320
It doesn't even move five feet.

581
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,800
So how is it going to move through

582
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,660
the body, you know?

583
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,480
So there's various ways of doing that.

584
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,200
Now you have to think of the biological

585
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,060
vacuum as an ethereal effect.

586
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,700
It goes from low to high potential.

587
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,700
And it's going to be different.

588
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:10,760
The closest thing I can imagine that you

589
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,560
can demonstrate is probably the pleura, which is

590
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,900
the cavity around the diaphragm.

591
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,100
And that cavity, the pleura, is something called

592
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,740
pleurisy pneumonia, which is one of the worst

593
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,860
pneumonias you can get.

594
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,520
And the pleura is the area.

595
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,060
Oh, you think so, pleurisy, right, pleurisy.

596
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,220
Pleurisy, yeah.

597
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:32,240
So people think it's the diaphragm, right, projecting

598
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,980
the energy and fluctuations that create breathing, pulsing

599
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,020
sensations, and all that.

600
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:37,980
It's not.

601
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,540
It's the change in the pleura that does

602
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,100
it, right?

603
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,040
The diaphragm is there like a joint.

604
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,460
The diaphragm is like the muscle.

605
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,600
The pleura is like the joint.

606
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,980
So if you can simulate, like you remember

607
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,840
the iron lung people who had collapsed lungs,

608
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,580
they put them in a tube that they

609
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,580
pressurized and depressurized so their chest would expand

610
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,320
under a vacuum?

611
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,320
Right, right.

612
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,180
Yeah, that's an idea.

613
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,540
But you have to go further than that

614
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,140
because it's not purely mechanical.

615
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:04,920
It's energetic.

616
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,820
But it's not energetic because when you use

617
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,880
that word energy, people's minds going into plugging

618
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,980
things into a wall outlet or a battery

619
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,620
or burning something.

620
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,600
It's not energy per se.

621
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,880
You could call it a scalar condition throughout.

622
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,920
Scalar just means it's the same throughout.

623
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,940
Anyone says a scalar wave is a moron,

624
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,460
by the way.

625
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,460
A scalar wave would be so big that

626
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,960
it wouldn't be considered a wave.

627
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,920
But anyway, let's just say it requires a

628
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,280
little more thought for food and food for

629
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:37,720
thought.

630
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,540
But whoever just made my week, whoever made

631
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,680
that last comment about making an example because

632
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,860
that's what I'm looking for.

633
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,560
Also, I had someone, not to mention his

634
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,380
name, Neil, he gave me a really good

635
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,340
comment on the scalarator and how it has

636
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,140
the ability to manifest, and I said, well,

637
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:55,600
build it.

638
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,120
So that's great.

639
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,040
I'm getting a little more of what I

640
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,920
asked for, which is people giving input on

641
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,560
water and the body and other stuff.

642
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,360
So I really appreciate you folks, even though

643
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:06,940
it's just a few.

644
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:07,800
That's all it takes.

645
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:08,840
Well, there you go.

646
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,200
It doesn't take that many to get it

647
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,420
going.

648
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,300
So the last thing, of course, again, we

649
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,800
already covered the Middle East, obviously, but they

650
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,760
were asking about the idea of whether this,

651
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,880
because they're slugging back and forth according to

652
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,140
what's being shown on the news, and they're

653
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:27,660
asking about whether this is, again, the right

654
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,160
time to consider whether that Middle Eastern Union

655
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,020
that you talked about years ago is coming

656
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,300
in and stuff like that.

657
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,240
So I wondered if you wanted to just

658
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,060
add to that just a little bit, because

659
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,600
even though it's not really a war, it

660
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,220
is an event.

661
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,960
It is occurring, and it's being put on

662
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,680
for a reason.

663
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,020
And the reason I gave is for the

664
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,740
people watching it, not for the people being

665
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,300
conflicted.

666
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,340
I assure you there's an order of 1

667
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,580
,000 times more people dying in Israel and

668
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,980
Persia from medical care.

669
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:56,660
Really?

670
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,700
On an order of maybe 10,000 more,

671
00:21:59,660 --> 00:21:59,940
right?

672
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,780
Millions of people in each one of those

673
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,000
countries.

674
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,600
Well, it wouldn't be a million, but, right?

675
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,060
Well, I do believe the reports that that's

676
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:09,060
happening and also that people are starving because

677
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,420
they've cut off everything.

678
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,600
Gaza, yeah.

679
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,720
And in Gaza, people are literally starving.

680
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,120
So I think they're using that as a

681
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,380
weapon, for sure, on people.

682
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,680
That's really happening.

683
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:18,440
Yes.

684
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,080
Well, Gaza is being run by the Egyptian

685
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:21,660
underworld.

686
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,260
Greek, how do you know so much about

687
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:23,840
the underworld?

688
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:28,620
Anyway, the Egyptian underworld is what runs Gaza,

689
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,260
and the Egyptian underworld, again, is tight, but

690
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,800
not as tight as the Persians are with

691
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,840
the Israeli underworld, right?

692
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:35,260
Okay.

693
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,380
Let me give people an example of what's

694
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:37,880
going on.

695
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,600
Okay, you have something called a – this

696
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,020
is a segue, but it ties in –

697
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,400
you have something called the DEA, right?

698
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,080
And that was created by Nixon, I think.

699
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,060
You're pretty good at that time.

700
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,180
Okay, you know about that.

701
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,080
All right, so that has nothing to do

702
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,480
with enforcing or limiting the use of drugs

703
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:52,980
and all that.

704
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,560
What that is is the cartels always had

705
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,940
a big influence on the politicians and all

706
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:03,900
that, and they all got together, the cartels

707
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,240
and the Americans, and it actually came out

708
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,600
– they used the army, by the way,

709
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,220
Delta Force, the DEA, right?

710
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,500
And they also go around for all kinds

711
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,080
of stuff, like arrest people for terrorism and

712
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,760
whatever.

713
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:19,100
Remember the guy – they made a movie,

714
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,040
Lord of War.

715
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,260
What was his name?

716
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,000
Oh, my gosh.

717
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,860
He was arrested by the DEA in Thailand

718
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:28,280
for selling the nukes that hit the Pentagon.

719
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,460
Right, right, right.

720
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,920
The P-700, granted, it was a nuke,

721
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,240
but it was – just because something's a

722
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,760
nuke doesn't mean it's going to go nuclear.

723
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,800
You need the trigger to be proper.

724
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:40,220
So the DEA is nothing more than this.

725
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,640
They had a big meeting, the American military

726
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,080
politicians and the cartels, and they said, we

727
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,140
need more stability.

728
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,420
So we have a pact here with the

729
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:54,240
way the cartels run, and when one gets

730
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,600
weak and starts messing up – when you

731
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,560
have an underground whatever – what do you

732
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,180
call them, mob?

733
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:04,520
What would you call them, associations, organizations, organizations?

734
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,280
A secret society, let's say.

735
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,440
Yeah, or an organization that does, let's say,

736
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,380
drugs and human trafficking because they also do

737
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,500
weapons, the cartels.

738
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,620
Let's stick with the DEA.

739
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,040
Sure.

740
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,660
When they start being disorganized, it becomes a

741
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,380
threat to all the other cartels because it

742
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,320
draws attention, so they have to be taken

743
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,400
out, decapitated.

744
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,480
So the DEA goes in and does it

745
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,300
instead of showing that another cartel is decapitating

746
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:28,840
them, right?

747
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,840
So the DEA is like a referee –

748
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,120
that's a good way to put it –

749
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,620
in a football game, but not the basic

750
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,360
American sports where you have one side versus

751
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,060
another side.

752
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,180
It's a team sport, like a cycling event,

753
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,180
or we have multiple teams.

754
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:50,620
And the DEA is the enforcement agency, literally,

755
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,020
for the cartels.

756
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,680
For the cartels.

757
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,940
So when one starts going awry, they decapitate

758
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,660
it so it doesn't draw attention, or if

759
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:03,960
one starts doing bad deals and dishonor, they

760
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,640
get decapitated.

761
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:05,480
They send in the DEA.

762
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,340
It's very plausible.

763
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,920
Then the Zetas coming in and hitting the

764
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,840
Medellins, right?

765
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,240
So they need a referee because you can

766
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,940
argue with the – was it Pete Roszarski

767
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,560
– arguing with the referee for his call?

768
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,460
Yeah, you can argue with the umpire, sure.

769
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,560
Yeah, I'm sure.

770
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,400
Or the umpire, yeah.

771
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,160
So you have the umpire referee as the

772
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:24,480
DEA.

773
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,500
That's all it is.

774
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,120
And the reason the DEA is there is

775
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,580
to stabilize the drug trade and stabilize the

776
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:33,240
relationships and also keep it to a certain

777
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,420
quality level of operation.

778
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:40,720
If you understand what I just said, you

779
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,580
will see it very clearly if you just

780
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,040
study the DEA and the cartels.

781
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,460
Now, another thing is like the FBI.

782
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,900
Before the FBI, there was another police –

783
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,020
I forgot.

784
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,580
It was like the Brinks – what was

785
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,000
it called?

786
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,040
Well, there was the Bureau of Investigation that

787
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,940
preceded the FBI, but then there was also

788
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:56,820
the Pinkertons.

789
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,420
The Pinkertons, that's right, and they got really

790
00:25:59,420 --> 00:25:59,840
dirty.

791
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,100
And there was a lot of – always

792
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,960
when there's a lot of negative input on

793
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,280
something.

794
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,260
So the Jewish mafia came in and said,

795
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,320
our relations are so good with everybody, but

796
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,640
it's only going to be so good for

797
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,240
so long because when we get more power,

798
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,620
we're going to get feed – whatever, blowback.

799
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,180
Yeah.

800
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,620
So let's get – let's set up the

801
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,160
FBI, fund it, and get it to the

802
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,160
Jewish mafia so we could – when we

803
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,760
feel like there's going to be blowback from

804
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,620
the Italian mob, we go after them, and

805
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,200
that's all it is.

806
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:37,460
Look at the ratio of Italian mobsters versus

807
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,760
Jewish mobsters that are taken out by the

808
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,100
FBI.

809
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,280
Right.

810
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,020
The ratio is – so it's pretty obvious.

811
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,520
And if you study the history of it,

812
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,860
Department of Justice is very similar.

813
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,700
That's from the Bar Association.

814
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:53,240
So all of these agencies – another one

815
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:53,900
is very simple.

816
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,620
I think the FDA was also – there

817
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,140
were several FDAs, but the one that's recent,

818
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,780
it was, again, Nixon, right?

819
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,840
Well, he did the environmental – the EPA.

820
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,080
The EPA.

821
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,380
Yeah, but he didn't do the FDA.

822
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,820
The FDA has been around for a while.

823
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,080
Right.

824
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:09,460
As the drug companies, yeah, when they brought

825
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:12,380
over the Nazis or the Germans with their

826
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,840
drug potions.

827
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:19,880
Yeah, that's paperclip, like 1950, like later 40s,

828
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:20,260
all that.

829
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,100
Yeah, exactly.

830
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:21,640
Right.

831
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,100
Yeah, so you're looking at your – your

832
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,520
lizards – this is – okay.

833
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,540
The magic, the trick here is amazing.

834
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:33,160
You take the most vile, repugnant organization and

835
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,100
you have people worship it as an authority

836
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,240
or hold it in esteem, and this is

837
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:37,940
what's going on.

838
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:40,140
Oh, you want to get into Catholic Church,

839
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,320
the Vatican, talk about a vile, repugnant –

840
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,080
Organization.

841
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:44,640
Organization.

842
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,260
And, you know, so this is the way

843
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,300
it is here on this – in this

844
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:50,560
realm.

845
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,640
You know, call it a planet, call it

846
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:52,940
whatever.

847
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:58,460
Anyway, yeah, thank you for whoever wanted to

848
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,420
set up, let's say, a demonstration of the

849
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,420
biological vacuum.

850
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,460
I think the best way to start demonstrating

851
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:07,560
it, but, you know, these academic morons can't

852
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,480
visualize and transfer, but would be with vegetation,

853
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,220
with seeds.

854
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,880
You know, I even got to a point

855
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,720
where years ago I brought up to a

856
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:21,340
medical professional that halide group elements cause sclerosis,

857
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,480
calcification in soft tissue glands.

858
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,000
We showed him, you know, that was like,

859
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:31,280
you know, bromine, fluoride, chlorine creates calcification.

860
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,560
Soft tissue, especially brain, brain stem, pituitary, all

861
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,480
that other stuff, right?

862
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,860
And I showed him all the studies, and

863
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,100
he says, well, that's not human, that's all

864
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,260
mammal testing, right?

865
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,220
They always have a reason, they're always going

866
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:44,740
to deflect.

867
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,280
Of course.

868
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,720
So I think the best place to visualize

869
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,260
and go is to start with seeds and

870
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:54,420
vegetation, and when you talk about going with

871
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,720
a single cell, you're going to have to

872
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,580
remove that cell.

873
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,800
Unless you go with protozoa, like amoeba, paramecium,

874
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,700
that type of stuff.

875
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,140
Fungus, I would say, yeast I would stay

876
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,120
away from, because yeast is neither mammal nor

877
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:05,520
plant.

878
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,980
Nobody knows what yeast is.

879
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,540
I mean, it's its own life form, right?

880
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,340
Its own category.

881
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:11,800
Fungus.

882
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,480
So, among us.

883
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,880
But start with the seeds and the vegetation,

884
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,940
and if you're going to move to cells

885
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,680
like blood and other tissue like that, remember,

886
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,180
it's dead.

887
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,720
Just like in the Chitango, someone posted, or

888
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,020
the same individual posted the thyroid and how

889
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:28,940
it looks like a raspberry.

890
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,340
Remember, all of the anatomy that they're showing

891
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,440
you is from cadavers.

892
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,000
So the living being, it doesn't quite look

893
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,700
like that.

894
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,200
It doesn't, it's a little different.

895
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:43,140
And I wonder how much the radiation, and

896
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,760
you know, when they do MRIs and CAT

897
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,000
scans and all that, the body knows it's

898
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,380
being, you know, it changes again.

899
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:51,920
But if you scrutinize the way organs and

900
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,820
things look, if you can, with other forms

901
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,720
of imaging other than the anatomy, you'll notice

902
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,280
that everything is a little tighter, smaller, more

903
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:58,640
upright.

904
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,340
Because you're looking at cadavers, right?

905
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,880
Looking at a dead fish is not the

906
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,760
same as going to the aquarium, right?

907
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,580
Well, even observing the blood outside of the

908
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,640
body, once it's outside of the body, it's

909
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,900
no longer participating in the process, so therefore

910
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,080
it's not going to be the same.

911
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,060
It has luminosity when it's in the body.

912
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,460
And there's more and more people doing live

913
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,100
blood testing.

914
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,640
The shameful part there is they don't know

915
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,540
what they're looking at.

916
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,260
But that's fine.

917
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,940
I don't think I have enough energy, life,

918
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:33,160
or whatever in me to pursue and advance

919
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,020
these fields.

920
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,460
But others probably do.

921
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,540
But even if you do have energy, life,

922
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,640
or whatever, and funds or whatever to pursue

923
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,320
these things, you don't have that much time.

924
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,800
These things take a long time.

925
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,440
But I think speaking on it and pursuing

926
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,560
it is still noteworthy, especially with trauma.

927
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:56,260
The main thing is trauma, unless you're traumatizing

928
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,440
yourself all the time, eating junk food and

929
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,080
being around stupid people.

930
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,400
So, yeah, what else you got?

931
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,520
No, that covers just about everything that I

932
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:05,720
got.

933
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,380
Oh, all right.

934
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,840
So we'll uncover some more the next time.
