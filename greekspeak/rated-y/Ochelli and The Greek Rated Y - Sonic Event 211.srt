1
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,560
Rated Y Sonic Event 2.11. Oh look,

2
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,060
I think I'm a little low this time,

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:12,240
Greek.

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:12,760
There we go.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,420
Now I think I'm at my regular volume.

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:15,820
How are you today?

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:17,460
Okay.

8
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,800
Yeah, just doing it, man.

9
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:19,400
Okay.

10
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,560
Got any questions?

11
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,840
I got questions.

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,700
I got comments.

13
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,780
You want to start weird or you want

14
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:26,900
to go with reactive?

15
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,060
No, it's up to you, it doesn't matter

16
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:29,520
to me.

17
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,240
Ah, dealer's choice, eh?

18
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,880
Okay, so let's start with this one.

19
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,320
This is somebody who's talking about dreams, okay?

20
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,780
And they've listened to everything you have to

21
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,160
say, and yet they have a question that

22
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,980
I think you've already kind of answered, but

23
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:44,760
let's try it anyway.

24
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,400
They're dreaming of dead people, okay?

25
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,760
And in the dreams, they're usually seeing them

26
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,100
in mundane situations.

27
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,780
However, in a recent string of them, lately,

28
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,040
this is women that they've been with in

29
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,260
the past, and now they're seeking to like

30
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,220
move in with them.

31
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,680
And these are the circumstances they keep having

32
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,060
dreams of until they realize that they're, you

33
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,480
know, obviously it's like, wait a minute, you're

34
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,620
dead, this and that.

35
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,180
So anyway, the overall- I get it

36
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,400
because I've lately been having the same stuff.

37
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:16,960
Really?

38
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,660
So the question is, do you think that

39
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,920
there are messages in patterns like this in

40
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,280
dreaming?

41
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:21,840
Yeah.

42
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,420
If so, what should someone do to change

43
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:24,920
or stop?

44
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,200
It always goes by the same rule.

45
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,240
If you can manipulate it, you're not in

46
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:30,640
a dream.

47
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,820
In other words, if you can remember when

48
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:33,820
you're in the dream, the thing is we

49
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,440
get so caught up in the dream, we

50
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,160
forget to look at our hands.

51
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,700
Oh, and that's what he says.

52
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,380
You see, he says he's so caught up

53
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,380
in it, and then the moment he goes,

54
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,320
wait a minute, you're dead, you know, then

55
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:44,780
it ends.

56
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:45,820
Yeah, that's right.

57
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,340
Okay, so you're being messed with.

58
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,440
If you can remember, it takes a lot

59
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:50,860
of work.

60
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,760
It could take years just to be able

61
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,920
to get yourself to remember.

62
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,020
So look for your hands, or look for

63
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,200
mouths when there's speech, because usually the mouths

64
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,860
don't move.

65
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,240
If you can move your hands, you're like

66
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,520
in a membrane, a threshold into another reality.

67
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,500
Still in this reality, it's just a very

68
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,940
fine, you know, just like anyone who does

69
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,720
radio, you could tune into a whole bunch

70
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,200
of terrestrial radio right now, right?

71
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,740
So it's just tuning into it when you're

72
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,280
asleep because your senses don't allow you to

73
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,980
tune into it with too much sensory input.

74
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,560
Looking back over his explanation and his comment,

75
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,180
though, two things I realized.

76
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,740
One, he doesn't realize about the mouths moving

77
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,580
because he mentioned that, that he references it.

78
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,940
Like I said, he listened to you talk

79
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,760
about this before.

80
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,800
Yeah, but he didn't bring it up.

81
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,100
He didn't know.

82
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,540
So it's probably he's being messed with.

83
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,040
Well, he did see his hands, though, in

84
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,720
the last one.

85
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:43,580
Oh, did he?

86
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,860
Was he able to manipulate them, move his

87
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,140
fingers?

88
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,120
Yeah, he grabbed- Oh, so he's in

89
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,080
another, he's picking up a finer reality.

90
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,140
Here's something from years of study and listening

91
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:54,660
to people.

92
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,020
As you get closer to death, the individuals

93
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,440
having the dreams, the dreams will become more

94
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,980
vivid and you'll be seeing more people that

95
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,620
have died and the dreams become more vivid

96
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,060
and they also interact with recent events.

97
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,700
As you, so in other words, when you're

98
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,280
60 or 70 or 80, you're closer to

99
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,020
being dead than when you're 20 or 30.

100
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,920
So I reckon this person is probably older

101
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,480
than 40.

102
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,560
I don't know.

103
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,520
I'm just guessing.

104
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,280
Yeah, I'm guessing too also, yeah.

105
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:22,980
Yeah, yeah.

106
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:29,000
So, yeah, that's an entirely, but just remember

107
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,200
that there are beings that hang out and

108
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,400
they're like, hey, what are we going to

109
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,320
play on these humans?

110
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,940
And what, you know, what, you know, if

111
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,380
we want to scare them, what scare, what

112
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,980
have they been taught to be scared of,

113
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:38,440
right?

114
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,000
If we want to get them aroused, what

115
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,820
have they been taught to be aroused by?

116
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,360
And they present those things and they rarely

117
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,640
present them flawlessly, but they present them enough

118
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,640
that enough of it is there that you

119
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,520
go for it, right?

120
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,100
Right.

121
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,100
But if you feel like you're in another

122
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,800
reality and you can move your, and there's

123
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,780
mouths moving when they're speech, especially.

124
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,000
And they've captured this in film, by the

125
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,820
way, where there's someone's in a dream and

126
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,120
there's speech, but the mouths don't move.

127
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,260
I forget which film.

128
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,480
It might've even been a twilight zone.

129
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,680
I think it was a twilight zone.

130
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,540
But yeah, believe it or not, it's taboo.

131
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,140
Just like the financial system, medical, whatever law,

132
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,200
it's not talked about the dream stuff because

133
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,500
it's not really dream.

134
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,980
It's a very big subject, right?

135
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,700
It's a very big subject because you can

136
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,540
easily mix it in with the world that

137
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:33,520
you perceive that when your senses are tuned,

138
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,560
you know, the regular senses are off, you

139
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,640
know, when you perceive another world is very

140
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,140
different than being messed with, but they kind

141
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,680
of mess with you in that world anyway.

142
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,980
So big subject.

143
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,340
All right, let's move on.

144
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,280
Big subject, but just on a personal note,

145
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:49,800
you know what?

146
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,760
I've noted that I've seen dead people a

147
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,640
lot lately too.

148
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,140
And you mentioned it yourself.

149
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,280
That's a weird crossover right there.

150
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,500
Now I'm not afraid of it, but I

151
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,980
wonder if that means I'm on my way

152
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,460
out soon.

153
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,200
I mean, if so, whatever, so be it.

154
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,160
Well, it's on different levels.

155
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,360
You know, there's the worldwide, there's the national,

156
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,600
then there's the familial, you know, the associations

157
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,720
that you have personally.

158
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,180
Okay.

159
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,180
On the worldwide level, we're all, the majority

160
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,700
of the big part of the planet is

161
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,700
pretty close to being dead and very soon,

162
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,320
like, you know, in terms of Earth time,

163
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,960
you know, a decade, decade and a half,

164
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,180
right?

165
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,700
According to the archaics timeline.

166
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,540
Not all the whole world, but a big

167
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,820
portion and starting even earlier than that.

168
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,840
So on a worldwide level, there is a

169
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,540
lot of death coming because when you look

170
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,080
at 10 or 15 years on a world

171
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,400
timeline, that's like a few seconds, right?

172
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,180
So indeed, we all could be having a

173
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,480
common sort of just- On a worldwide

174
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,520
level, yeah, it is.

175
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,140
Everyone is getting a sense of death coming

176
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,140
because, you know, it's like the two seconds

177
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,920
to midnight, right, over 6,000 years, right?

178
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,960
So then there's the national one where whenever

179
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,520
a big war breaks out, people prior to

180
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,500
the war breaking out have death dreams in

181
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,000
that nation.

182
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,740
And then there's familial dreams where there's a

183
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,240
lot of the symbolism, like, you know, if

184
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,440
you're having a dream where your teeth fall

185
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,400
out, someone's gonna die, someone close to you

186
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:09,740
is gonna die.

187
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,620
Remember the old wives' tale and stuff, right?

188
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,800
I thought that was sexualization if the teeth

189
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,240
fell out.

190
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:14,940
I thought it was.

191
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,180
Okay, well, there's different interpretations and they change

192
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,820
every two decades.

193
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,420
So yeah, it's a big subject.

194
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,260
How about we make a footnote somewhere or

195
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,040
a note or a market somewhere that we'll

196
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,680
get into the dream world and the parallel

197
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,840
worlds soon?

198
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,040
We'll do an entire thing on it.

199
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,300
Dedicated Sonic to the dream world and parallel

200
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:35,660
worlds.

201
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,120
You got it.

202
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:36,300
Yeah.

203
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,440
Okay, when you realize, this is another one,

204
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,560
when you realize this entire planet is run

205
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,660
like a family business, it all starts to

206
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,280
make sense.

207
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,560
When you realize we live in a biological

208
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,800
program, you understand why they keep the prophecy.

209
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,020
Obfuscation is how you maintain power over the

210
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,260
masses and power is just getting people to

211
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,120
take action on your behalf.

212
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,060
Right, like a horse or a beast of

213
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,500
burden does work for you, yeah.

214
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,580
So let's see, this is, nope, nope.

215
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,260
The next one I wanted to get to.

216
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,260
That's the Rolling Stones song, A Beast of

217
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:10,540
Burden.

218
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,300
Yeah, of course.

219
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,780
Most people are beasts of burden.

220
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,400
That's why I'm like, I'm totally happy just

221
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,700
being like either in the lab or at

222
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,840
home, you know, like that house arrest thing.

223
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,720
I couldn't care less.

224
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,100
That's what I want.

225
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,480
I hate going out.

226
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,200
And I'm not agoraphobic.

227
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,880
It's just, I look forward to going out

228
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,880
and I'm like, what the?

229
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,240
I come back and I'm like, what the

230
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,280
hell is that?

231
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,940
Is that what humans are like?

232
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,340
And I'm talking about running into like, you

233
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,680
know, not trashy people either.

234
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,320
I'm talking about running into people that are

235
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,520
quote unquote professionals.

236
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,620
I said, oh my gosh, that's, I felt

237
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,220
like these are, this is the best society

238
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:45,740
has to offer.

239
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,180
I felt like I was scraping the bottom.

240
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,200
I need to just avoid it, you know,

241
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,480
just so, yeah, anyway.

242
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,440
Sounds like a cross between a George Carlin

243
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,780
and a Jerry Seinfeld riff because, you know,

244
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,380
Jerry Seinfeld does the whole, when you go

245
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,880
out, you want to get home, when you

246
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,880
go home, you want to go out.

247
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,160
But George Carlin goes, you know, I hate

248
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,580
going out because all I got to deal

249
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,880
with are morons and a-holes.

250
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,060
Anyway, Greek has made a good point saying

251
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,580
that this is not an actual war.

252
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,860
Now, the reason why I go to this

253
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,500
comment, Greek, is because there's a bunch of

254
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,000
them about the conflict.

255
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,680
You know, I'm calling it the two eyes

256
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,520
war at this point.

257
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,000
The two eyes war, Israel and Iran.

258
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,120
All right, hold on, let me stop here

259
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,500
for a moment.

260
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,500
We know what Trump is doing.

261
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,300
He's replaying what Obama was doing.

262
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,680
Word for word, play for play, except it's

263
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,520
going more hot.

264
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,980
Do you remember during the Obama thing, Iran

265
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,919
was really bad?

266
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:35,400
Yeah, I thought it was more of a

267
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,059
Syria thing.

268
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,179
I could play Syria in the same place.

269
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:40,559
Yeah, but Syria is still going on, so

270
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,500
that's already started.

271
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,100
But if you look at what was put

272
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,960
on Iran, when was Obama, 2008 to 2016?

273
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:48,740
Yeah.

274
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,760
Something like that, yeah.

275
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,020
Look at Iran, mentioned Obama, and it's a

276
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,280
replay of it all.

277
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,440
It's all weak, stupid shit, but go ahead.

278
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,860
I just wanted to say that he's carrying

279
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,500
on Obama's policies so that, you know, don't,

280
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:02,440
yeah.

281
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,000
I noticed that they were releasing many images

282
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,320
of missiles being dropped on both sides, but

283
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,100
they never mentioned dead people, civilians actually being

284
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:10,380
injured.

285
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,080
Well, I see mentions of dead people, but

286
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,020
the numbers are pretty low.

287
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,940
I even saw a video of an outside

288
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,940
party where a bunch of people are actually

289
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,720
having fun and filming missiles in the sky

290
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,620
as if it was some kind of New

291
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:25,240
Year's Eve firework, this guy says, so.

292
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,660
But it's weird, because they're asking questions like,

293
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,200
is this now something that's being lit off?

294
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,480
Is this a sign?

295
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,260
This is what people want to know about

296
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:33,440
it.

297
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,060
Yeah, there was an article a few days

298
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:40,300
ago about 10 countries like Qatar, UAE, Saudi

299
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:44,380
Arabia, Kuwait, and whatever are joining into a

300
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:44,700
union.

301
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,580
Did you pick up on that?

302
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,260
Yeah, they have a, there's actually a name

303
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,220
for it, but yeah, there is.

304
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,540
Yeah, but they decided to form this alliance

305
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,460
of six countries, and they're gonna recruit more.

306
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,040
I just think it's funny, because they said

307
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,940
around 2025, you're gonna see a Middle East

308
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,040
Union coming around, so.

309
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,660
Yep, oh, I was just grabbing my keyboard

310
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,300
so it didn't fall off the table, so.

311
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,260
Oh, that's fine, yeah.

312
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,740
So what else you got on that, yeah,

313
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,520
so he's got some interesting, or she's got

314
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,540
some interesting comments about the war is not

315
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,120
a war, yeah.

316
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,240
Yeah, it's not a war.

317
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,080
It does seem kind of fake, because they're

318
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,140
not really showing you massive casualties, but they're

319
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,620
talking about it and whipping you into a

320
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,580
frenzy, and of course, Trump is threatening stuff.

321
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,060
This is all a combined group of comments,

322
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:26,540
by the way.

323
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,020
You know, Trump is threatening stuff, but is

324
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,420
he really the guy in charge?

325
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:30,880
You know.

326
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,040
No, no, Trump is a TV person.

327
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,580
Of course, you know, he didn't learn.

328
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,260
It's cumulative, so before he got into politics,

329
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,660
he did the TV shows, right?

330
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,460
Right, he's the boss on the TV show,

331
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,000
but he doesn't run the TV show.

332
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,340
You know, it might be a prejudice.

333
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,900
Yeah, it's an unlawful, the United States is

334
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,480
an unlawful, some say it's not a corporation,

335
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,360
it's a scam.

336
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,560
It's a total scam.

337
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,820
It's kind of like when you work with

338
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:59,700
the mob, or you play a card game

339
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,640
with the mob, and you own a sporting

340
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,320
goods store, big store, just 10, 15 million

341
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,640
a year in sporting goods, right?

342
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,380
And you play, you get addicted to gambling,

343
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,280
and you're in the whole quarter of a

344
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,100
million dollars with them, and you can't pay

345
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,740
them because you don't have any cash flow.

346
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,620
So the mob comes into your sporting goods

347
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,440
store, starts taking this stuff and selling it

348
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,100
on their own, and they order more stuff

349
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,440
so they can sell it on your end,

350
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,500
close down your shop.

351
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,920
This is like a thing from the Sopranos,

352
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:26,180
right?

353
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,400
Yeah, it's called a bust out.

354
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,000
Yeah, yeah.

355
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,800
A bust out, yeah.

356
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,460
That's what they're doing, a bust out.

357
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,500
All these idiots, they're all idiots.

358
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,800
And whether you're working in the DMV as

359
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:43,440
a clerk, you know, reinstating people's driver's license

360
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,860
all the way up to the president, they're

361
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,280
morons.

362
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,960
There's not one person that makes any sense.

363
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,540
Now, there are people behind the scenes that,

364
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,480
for example, going back to the Obama thing,

365
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,100
whether it be Obamacare, there was one guy

366
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,240
that popped out, and it was kind of

367
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,460
hard to get someone to comment on it,

368
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,520
and he came out and says, the reason

369
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,800
we're doing this is because the American people

370
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,360
are stupid.

371
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,100
They don't read, right?

372
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:03,780
Do you remember that guy?

373
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,880
I do remember that guy.

374
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,720
Yeah, yeah, so you have people like that

375
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,300
that know what's going, but the people that

376
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,920
you, he was never supposed to be on

377
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,320
camera.

378
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,080
No.

379
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,380
He was never supposed to, because all the

380
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,940
people that know what's going on just think

381
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,320
everyone around them is stupid.

382
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,100
Right, and that guy said it.

383
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,880
So if you think everyone around you is

384
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,140
stupid, you're doing great.

385
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,960
That guy said it on TV, though.

386
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,800
That was the big deal.

387
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,200
It was like, I can't believe this guy

388
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,920
said this on, like, for weeks and replayed

389
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,020
it.

390
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,180
Because he's one of the people that are

391
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,360
actually doing something.

392
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,300
The rest of them are morons, pretty much.

393
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,600
So if you got, like, the three million

394
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,320
government employees, there's probably less than 1,000

395
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,180
that are worth anything.

396
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,180
And that union, by the way, which they've

397
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,600
now dragged China, Russia, and North Korea into

398
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,200
is what they refer to as the axis

399
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,000
of resistance, by the way.

400
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,320
But, okay, it's true.

401
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,720
This is another one.

402
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,740
It's true what the Greek always said, that

403
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,560
we must have done something wrong to be

404
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,400
here on this planet.

405
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,420
Yahshua said, my kingdom is not of this

406
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:58,720
world.

407
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,260
Satan is the god of this world.

408
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,580
We have no business being here.

409
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,020
Okay, I checked, does the Greek, oh, does

410
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,800
the Greek believe that the descendants of Cain

411
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,340
are ruling the earth?

412
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,920
That's the follow-up on that.

413
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,560
It's more than that, because remember, scripture is

414
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,180
very specific of a certain area.

415
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,420
Like, if you read the genealogies, they didn't

416
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,560
know that the Zulu people existed or the

417
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,860
Moors existed, right?

418
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,900
Right, so it's limited to a certain area.

419
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,820
There's always something going on in parallel somewhere

420
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,520
else, right?

421
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,800
Yeah, like they didn't know about ancient China,

422
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,500
let's say.

423
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,840
Yeah, there's nothing mentioned about, you know, supposedly,

424
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:37,340
yeah.

425
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,160
So, no, there's always something going on somewhere.

426
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,160
And my favorite is the, where else was

427
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:45,280
that?

428
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,100
The Japanese government officially put out a map

429
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,640
a long time ago in the 60s that

430
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,560
showed the seven continents and then, like, Antarctica

431
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,000
spread out and then a whole bunch of

432
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,520
continents beyond that that we've never even seen.

433
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,500
Have you ever seen that map?

434
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,700
Yeah, it's weird.

435
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,380
It's like the world plus, yeah.

436
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,520
Yeah, so it goes on like that.

437
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,120
So, you know, our world, you know, like

438
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,340
the sea, you know, our world is really

439
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,260
small and we've been tricked in believing we're

440
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,780
shown all of it, you see?

441
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,680
So even scripture runs that, you know, idea.

442
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,960
So the descriptions might be places that we've

443
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,420
never heard of otherwise.

444
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,580
Yeah, there's a lot more to everything.

445
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,060
There's a lot more than that came from,

446
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:24,640
we should say.

447
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,460
There you go.

448
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,700
But the God of this world and all

449
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,320
that other stuff, this is an evil place.

450
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,960
And when you get it down to the

451
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,140
nuts and bolts of it, it's not run

452
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,260
by humans at all.

453
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,320
And that's pretty obvious when you look at

454
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,660
the level of deceit.

455
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,080
There's no species that deceives its own species

456
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,260
to the degree that humans deceive other humans.

457
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,620
Yeah, but that's the thing.

458
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,660
Even when you observe the animal kingdom, right,

459
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,820
they're not really stealing from each other like

460
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,400
we do.

461
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,260
And the level of deception, like for example,

462
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,700
the bankers will kick you out on the

463
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,560
street and take your stuff and they know

464
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,460
you've already paid for everything more than twice.

465
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,540
That's not a human thing, right?

466
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,840
But that's the same thing you do with

467
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,260
cows.

468
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,760
You know, you feed them until they get

469
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,320
big and plump and ready and then you

470
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,680
slaughter them for their meat.

471
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,160
But here you're being slaughtered for your credit.

472
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,160
So yeah, okay, what else?

473
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,000
Well, let's see, this is totally a death

474
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,660
camp place.

475
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,940
I'm in Canada and the local public health

476
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,920
is now calling us and saying we have

477
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,780
to get measles vaccines.

478
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,160
Obviously this is- Yeah, tell them it

479
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,520
has to be, they have to follow an

480
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,100
affidavit.

481
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:34,880
If it's not an official order by the

482
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,840
government, they have to have a sworn affidavit

483
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,040
that you have to have that done.

484
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,480
It's in the laws there.

485
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,940
In other words, they can't make you do

486
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,760
anything unless there's an order that's accompanied by

487
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,860
a sworn affidavit and they can't do that.

488
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,640
So I just wanted to let you know

489
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,620
- And also you have privacy laws that

490
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,460
they're evading.

491
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,640
So if someone asks you a question, you

492
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,320
don't have to answer it because answering it

493
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,580
you feel is an evasion of privacy laws.

494
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,520
You can, right?

495
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,360
I got you.

496
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,360
People have done that with the census takers

497
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,260
here in this country where- Yeah, you

498
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,400
could say, well, you're asking me or telling

499
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,620
me to get the measles vaccine.

500
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,220
What if I already have one and what

501
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,020
if I don't have one?

502
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,340
That's my own private business.

503
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,980
Or if I gotten it already, I'm not

504
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,440
gonna tell you.

505
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,520
And if I haven't gotten it, I'm not

506
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,120
gonna tell you.

507
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,220
Go look at the laws.

508
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,140
A sworn, anything that's compelling someone to do

509
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,480
something by judicial order or whatever has to

510
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,600
be accompanied either an order or a warrant

511
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,600
for arrest has to be accompanied by a

512
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,520
sworn affidavit.

513
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,680
A sworn affidavit, no one's gonna swear.

514
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,180
So, yeah.

515
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,420
And you have the privacy laws that protect

516
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:38,680
you.

517
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,720
That's the only way- And they started

518
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,880
back in 1974.

519
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:42,900
Yeah, that's the only way you're supposed to

520
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,960
legitimately get probable cause is through a sworn

521
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,660
affidavit where a witness actually swears to account

522
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,920
that you did some damage or caused some

523
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,160
harm.

524
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,640
Yeah, and if they're arresting you or detaining

525
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,980
you for it, then there's due process.

526
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,780
They have to produce all of that again,

527
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,100
so.

528
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,480
That's, what do they call it?

529
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,800
All the countries have that, by the way.

530
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,119
You just have to find it and know

531
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:04,480
about it.

532
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,839
Nobody knows about any of this because it's

533
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:07,780
a planet of morons.

534
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,240
That's why I don't argue with those guys

535
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,920
who talk about the use of the Magna

536
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,680
Carta from 1215 or whatever, because it basically

537
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,240
states everything is under this.

538
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,720
Yeah, yes and no.

539
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:21,380
But look, when it comes to vaccines, I

540
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,579
think so far most of everyone that I've

541
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:26,859
ever met should get vaccinated often and early.

542
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,140
No, that's if you don't care about surviving.

543
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,360
Anyway- Yeah, yeah, it's a good way

544
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,660
to get rid of a lot of people,

545
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,460
I think, but anyway.

546
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,540
So, outside of a bunch of feedback that

547
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:41,040
said they really enjoyed the Arkham's Razor podcast

548
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,480
there, which we posted on Patreon as a

549
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:44,780
bonus.

550
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:45,780
Oh, good, okay.

551
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,660
That's about it for the questions and comments.

552
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,240
I covered everything pretty quickly there.

553
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,980
So, where else do we need to go?

554
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,560
What else do I need to learn?

555
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,420
Yeah, we'll just plan some theme-based sonics

556
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,800
that we've been having, well, more questions about

557
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,020
dreaming and stuff like that.

558
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,320
I'll just have to think about it.

559
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:01,900
That's one.

560
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,580
You also wanted to go more into the

561
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:04,940
body.

562
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:05,980
Now, I don't know if you want to

563
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,020
continue on with that.

564
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,840
Do we need to cover more, or should

565
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,820
we go more into the biological vacuum?

566
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,220
We're going to wait a little bit because

567
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,920
I have some, myself and other people, maybe

568
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,500
one or two others, looking into some ways

569
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,300
to demonstrate the biological vacuum.

570
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,200
Ah, okay.

571
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,560
And it's not just like years ago when

572
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,700
I talked about biological vacuums, everybody's a vacuum

573
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,560
cleaner, ha, ha, ha.

574
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,800
The typical room temperature IQ people, right?

575
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,940
They don't understand what causes a biological vacuum.

576
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,380
So, it's very easy to demonstrate the heart

577
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,160
is not a pump.

578
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,560
And there's no pumping action that it's all

579
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,740
suction, because the capillaries, how they terminate, how

580
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,480
is the pump going to send something forward

581
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,800
and then pull it back, right?

582
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:51,360
So, it has to be done autonomously within

583
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,720
each capillary at the cellular level.

584
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,200
That's very difficult to prove when you want

585
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,360
to scale it up, right?

586
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,840
Because a cell is, compared to, let's say,

587
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,340
a vein, you're talking a magnitude of 100

588
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,660
or 1,000 times, right?

589
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,080
So, how do you do a scale experiment

590
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,340
and still have it visible?

591
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,680
You'd have to have the smallest capillary tube

592
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,280
and then something like the size of a

593
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,420
four-inch pipe.

594
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,280
It gets really spooky when you look at

595
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,880
the scale of the human body.

596
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,900
Wasn't there a film with Raquel Welch called

597
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,220
The Incredible Journey where they miniaturized people and

598
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,560
injected them in to kill cancer, supposedly, or

599
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,280
something in some way?

600
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,960
Well, they did a few different takes on

601
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,960
that sort of thing with the miniaturization and

602
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,380
injection.

603
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,780
Yeah, it's kind of fascinating.

604
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,600
And then they put them in a little

605
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,500
vehicle and they're fighting blood cells and things.

606
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,740
Yeah, it was just totally ridiculous.

607
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,160
But yeah, the idea of scale, though, is

608
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,080
massive.

609
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,640
So, it has to be done philosophically, almost

610
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,080
Rudolf Steiner, but he's too airy-fairy.

611
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,000
Like, Rudolf Steiner had a lot of correct

612
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,500
ideas, but to get to the meat of

613
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,340
what he was talking about was so airy

614
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,080
-fairy, I just wanted, like, I felt like

615
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,100
I was going to float away.

616
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,740
I had to tether myself down, right?

617
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,560
So, that's how airy-fairy he is.

618
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,900
But it doesn't mean that he's not correct.

619
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,400
Fair enough.

620
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,400
Look, I saw in the chat, there was

621
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,300
some discussion about the shape of the kidney

622
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,340
and foods and relating it to it.

623
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,540
Yeah, look, that fruit that was put up,

624
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,400
I suggested it would be more for the

625
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,240
kidney than the lung.

626
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,420
And there's reasons for it.

627
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,320
Look at how the fruit grows, also.

628
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,140
See, the lotus root is the lung because

629
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,440
the way it grows in clusters and it's

630
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,220
in water, right?

631
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,940
Where the other fruit grows more like a

632
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,120
regular fruit, like an apple.

633
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,020
So, that would be more like the kidney

634
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,560
and it actually matches the kidney better.

635
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,760
So, yeah, there's a lot of that.

636
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,740
There's a term, someone will find it and

637
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,640
probably put it in the Chitango later, about

638
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,600
getting how certain foods and things appear to

639
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,000
be, like, parts of the human body, right?

640
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,520
Like, the cabbage is the brain and the

641
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,500
lotus root is the lungs and the beans

642
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,560
are the kidneys and the cucumber is, you

643
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,080
know.

644
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,120
So, whatever.

645
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,980
Yeah, I would say that there's a term

646
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:10,340
for that.

647
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,600
I forgot what it is, but that's not

648
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,460
the be-all, end-all.

649
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,220
It's the energy that, and energy is also

650
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,740
how these things move when they grow.

651
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,620
Like, the simplest thing to imagine to illustrate

652
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,380
this is fruit.

653
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,920
When the blossom is pointing up like a

654
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,860
flower, but once the fruit forms, the fruit

655
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,600
is pointing down towards the ground.

656
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,200
It gets heavier and it's trying to reach,

657
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,800
it's trying to get to the ground because

658
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,300
ultimately that's what happens, right?

659
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,840
It falls off.

660
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:38,280
Yeah.

661
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,600
I think generally that might have been called

662
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,500
the doctrine of signatures or something because there's

663
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,960
like a signature shape to different, especially fruit,

664
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:47,700
like you were saying.

665
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,540
It's a- Yeah, but it's the energetic,

666
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,000
not just the way it looks, the way

667
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,880
it grows, right?

668
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,700
Yeah, but it's- So, that's why when

669
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,080
you take fruit, you feel good for a

670
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,540
moment or a little bit and then you

671
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,720
want to crash, right?

672
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,500
It brings you down, believe it or not.

673
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,340
Fruitarian diets always do that.

674
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,340
You want to sleep a lot.

675
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,620
What they call a sugar crash.

676
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,580
Yeah, they call it, but it's not, it

677
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,740
has nothing to do with sugar.

678
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,200
Yeah, but that's- It has to do

679
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,660
with the energy of, yeah.

680
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,400
I'm just saying that's what they call it,

681
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,280
but the anatomical shapes that match something is

682
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,380
also an indicator, but it's not the only

683
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:19,720
thing.

684
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,180
Like you said- Because of the energy,

685
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,600
and it's, in other words, an archetype.

686
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,140
Yeah, okay, an archetype.

687
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:25,540
There you go.

688
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,880
Well, there's some words and phrases for you.

689
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,020
I'm not sure if they're exactly correct.

690
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:32,560
Because we live in such a limited archetypical

691
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,500
kind of structure here.

692
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,280
This existence that we have, 3D, it seems

693
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:38,840
complex.

694
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,640
We're amazed that it's complex, but it's actually

695
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,780
very simple once you understand universal principles.

696
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,220
It's all made of the same stuff.

697
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,580
It's hydrogen-based, by the way.

698
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,320
The other thing you have to get your

699
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,740
mind around if you're going to assemble a

700
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,340
biological vacuum, we're not carbon-based.

701
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,860
We're hydrogen-based.

702
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,360
Hydrogen-based, okay.

703
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

704
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,020
So that's a, yeah, it seems like I'm

705
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,700
just contraire on everything, right?

706
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,140
It does seem that way, but then again,

707
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,360
like I said, there's a bit of a

708
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,520
logic to it with observe.

709
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,220
I mean, you can observe stuff like, what

710
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,200
is it, broccoli and cauliflower very much look

711
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,320
like the brain, you know, to me.

712
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,100
I mean, just simple examples like that.

713
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:16,200
The lobes, yeah.

714
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,860
The lobes of the brain, fine.

715
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,480
But the cabbage more so.

716
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:20,660
Okay.

717
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,700
And cross-section.

718
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,900
So neither one is fully like the brain,

719
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,200
right?

720
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,200
In other words, your point on the broccoli

721
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,700
and cauliflower and the point on the, they

722
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,720
do look like the lobes, or let's say,

723
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:37,040
or the lobing, but the cauliflower overall is

724
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,400
more, but neither one is, but they're close.

725
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:40,440
Yeah.

726
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,660
Right, the lotus root is really close to

727
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,220
the bronchi.

728
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,220
It's not for the entire lungs, by the

729
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:45,340
way.

730
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,600
The lotus root is for the bronchi.

731
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,400
Okay.

732
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,160
So when the bronchi either are too expansive,

733
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,320
pneumonia, or too contractive, asthma, right?

734
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:57,400
Now, the lotus root, you don't wanna do

735
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,140
if you have asthma, because if you ever

736
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,640
handled lotus root, it's very dense, very difficult

737
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,580
to cut, right?

738
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,740
It's like sugarcane.

739
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,660
You ever cut sugarcane?

740
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:06,860
It's really dense.

741
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,240
I can imagine something like that, or ginger

742
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:09,660
root.

743
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,200
Okay, ginger.

744
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,240
It's harder than ginger root.

745
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:11,940
Wow.

746
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,880
Yeah, so you don't wanna, if you have

747
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,720
a contractive issue, you don't want it.

748
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,520
You want it when you have a loose

749
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,300
issue with the lungs.

750
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:24,060
And most people misinterpret expelling a phlegm and

751
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,060
mucus as a loose condition.

752
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:31,260
No, no, loose, expelling mucus and phlegm through

753
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,920
the mouth and orally and the nose is

754
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,780
loss of body vacuum on the young part

755
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,540
of the body.

756
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,040
A loose condition in the lungs is something

757
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:42,380
different.

758
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,980
It's more like a pneumonia where it stays

759
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,540
in the lungs.

760
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,000
It doesn't come up, doesn't expel.

761
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:46,560
Right.

762
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,120
So you know what'd be interesting?

763
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,480
I don't have the time.

764
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,140
I probably will never do it, but discussing

765
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,100
more of like the basics, and this is

766
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:56,540
gonna help, quote unquote, God forbid, heaven forbid,

767
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,780
young parents, right?

768
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,440
Oh boy.

769
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,560
With children, right?

770
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,260
You know how young parents are major targets

771
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,720
for the medical industry, you know?

772
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,060
Well, because they can't talk to the baby,

773
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,340
so they bring them to them.

774
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,220
Yeah, and all the time for the slightest

775
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:10,920
things, yeah.

776
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,740
And the thing is, I can't stand it

777
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,660
when people are having babies and all that.

778
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,960
I'm like, how dare you have a child?

779
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,300
Unless you know you're raising the next messiah.

780
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,680
And when I say that, I'm not talking

781
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,860
about the J-E-S-U-S, I'm

782
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,300
talking about a messiah that's gonna come out

783
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,700
with a thing and really bring hell on

784
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,680
earth to end all the shit going on,

785
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:31,900
right?

786
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,000
That kind of a messiah, right?

787
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,240
So- When I was young, I definitely

788
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,800
thought my children would be very impactful and

789
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,780
would definitely shake things up.

790
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,540
That's what I thought.

791
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:42,960
Yeah, everyone does.

792
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,280
Everyone thinks they have, you know.

793
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:48,200
We need, like, Genghis Khan, Adolf Hitler, Joseph

794
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,640
Stalin, Andrew Jackson all wrapped up in one.

795
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:52,340
Yikes.

796
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,400
It'll probably be blue-eyed, red-haired, and

797
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,460
seven-foot tall.

798
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,880
Male or female, doesn't matter.

799
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,280
They kind of did that in a G

800
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,700
.I. Joe cartoon years ago.

801
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:05,220
They called him Serpentor, where they went around

802
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,340
and they got, like, Hitler and some Egyptian,

803
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,700
you know.

804
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,880
Well, by the way, Hitler has a really

805
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,420
bad rep.

806
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,820
He was very mild-mannered, you know?

807
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,660
He was an artist.

808
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,060
He was kind of a terrible artist.

809
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,740
He was a flunky.

810
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,060
He tried a whole bunch of stuff.

811
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,180
He was thrown in jail for, you know,

812
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,360
protesting whatever, the woke movement.

813
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,420
What was going on with the gray shirts,

814
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,720
and they became the brown shirts, the Democrats.

815
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,640
What they call the beer hall, pushed, and

816
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,640
pushed, or whatever, yeah.

817
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,520
Yeah, they were against the woke movement.

818
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:37,580
They were against transsexual stuff, and prostitution, and

819
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,260
all that stuff that's been going on with

820
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,240
the Biden administration was what was going on.

821
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,940
Pre-1933 Germany was going on for more

822
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,380
than a decade, since after World War I,

823
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,520
and it was put on by, basically, Jewish

824
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,520
intellectuals from Brooklyn and Germany.

825
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,200
That's why they went after the Jews.

826
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,940
They didn't go after the Jews, per se,

827
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,720
because you could look this up.

828
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,460
I think it's University of Kansas has written

829
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:07,380
a paper trying to examine the fact why

830
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,500
there were 100,000 practicing Jews in the

831
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,540
German National Socialist Wehrmacht, in the army.

832
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:18,240
There are 100,000 practicing Jews in the

833
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,520
German army under Hitler.

834
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,440
So how could they be going after Jews?

835
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,520
You see, we've been given a bill of

836
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,040
goods that is, yeah, just bullshit.

837
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:34,600
But yeah, Stalin, he was just ruthless.

838
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,380
He didn't want intelligent people around him.

839
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,080
He wanted stupid people around him, because he

840
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,120
couldn't sleep if he had intelligent people around

841
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:42,300
him.

842
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,860
So it sounds like the current state of

843
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,680
the United States.

844
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,140
But actually, like I said earlier, there probably

845
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,020
are some intelligent people, and I'm sure they

846
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,060
don't last very long.

847
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,940
If you want to know what the current

848
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,480
United States is, it's BlackRock and Vanguard, by

849
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:57,860
the way.

850
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,160
It's not, anyway.

851
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,300
Oh, they own a piece of everything.

852
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,840
You can see that publicly.

853
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:06,260
Yeah, they're like combined 20 trillion on books

854
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,780
or 10 trillion on the books.

855
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,040
That's what they're showing, right?

856
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,020
And that's their controlling.

857
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,960
And actually, the guy from BlackRock came out

858
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,120
and said, with the Biden, you're going to

859
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,040
take on this new movement, the BLM and

860
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,900
the woke stuff, or you're going to suffer

861
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,040
consequences.

862
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:23,580
Remember that?

863
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,360
He did a speech.

864
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,920
This is the new way of stuff, with

865
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,980
the trannies and all that and the Black

866
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,540
Liberation Movement or whatever, Black Lives Matter.

867
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,320
Black Liberation Movement and Black Lives Matter, right?

868
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:35,980
BLM, right?

869
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,820
You're going to have to put up with

870
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,640
all that, or you're going to suffer consequences.

871
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,180
So they're trying to tell you, they're just

872
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:43,840
trying to push.

873
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,820
So what happened after the woke movement, after

874
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:50,460
World War I in Germany, you had the

875
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,980
Reichstag, supposedly, which was the 9-11 here.

876
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,720
It doesn't quite parallel, and then the National

877
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,620
Socialist Party.

878
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,160
So now you have Trump, who's going to

879
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:00,760
do the...

880
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,520
So when people say Trump is like a

881
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,160
dictator or like a Hitler, they're not far

882
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:08,240
off, but it's the Disney, Elon Musk version.

883
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,660
It's the Disney of it, right?

884
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,760
That's the one thing.

885
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,700
Look, there's two things missing, is that he

886
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,780
needs a war that needs to go on,

887
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,800
like an actual war where we're involved directly.

888
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,900
That's not going to happen.

889
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,100
And the other thing he needs is a

890
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,760
Reichstag fire, an inciting event, right?

891
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,020
A 9-11, which will get everybody saying,

892
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:26,520
well, we need to stay behind the leader.

893
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,980
That's not going to happen either, because of

894
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:28,560
cell phones.

895
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,640
Well, there you go.

896
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,760
So you have to have something happen that's

897
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,820
going to be with AI, an AI war.

898
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,160
Where AI starts, they blame it on AI,

899
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,260
starts taking down infrastructure and killing people.

900
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,400
And then that way, since nobody understands it,

901
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,220
it'll work out fine.

902
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,180
Yeah, but you'll have to wait a few

903
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:46,860
years for that.

904
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,840
So Trump won't be alive, probably, by the

905
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,920
time that really comes in.

906
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,140
So who's the next figure in?

907
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,800
No, it's only just a few years, like

908
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,040
2027 or so.

909
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,380
Well, he's what, almost 80.

910
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,400
I mean, he don't look healthy.

911
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,620
Well, which Trump are you talking about?

912
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,780
Oh, I don't know.

913
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,500
You know, when they brought the...

914
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,280
Yeah, you know what I mean?

915
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:02,840
When they brought the...

916
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,700
I doubt these people are real.

917
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,060
When they brought the Department of Homeland Security

918
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,760
lady into the hospital earlier for an allergic

919
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,560
reaction, I was wondering about that too.

920
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,840
Did you read about that?

921
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,380
No, no, I don't.

922
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:14,980
No, no.

923
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,760
No, you don't really read.

924
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,820
I try not to, yeah.

925
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:17,760
Because you missed a whole lot.

926
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,940
I do a lot of reading, but not

927
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:19,640
that kind of stuff.

928
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,080
But I get where you, yeah.

929
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,840
I think that we're in a, what is

930
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:23,980
it?

931
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,680
Star Wars, the Clone Wars, right?

932
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,200
Clone Wars.

933
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,260
We are in the Clone Wars.

934
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,460
I think there are more...

935
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:32,280
Remember, we were being warned in the 70s

936
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,240
and 80s about human robotoids replacing politicians.

937
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:35,980
That's true.

938
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,440
They call them robotoids, which has nothing to

939
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,000
do with robots, you know, like an Erector

940
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,380
set.

941
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,780
Androids, no, it has to do with cloning,

942
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,480
yeah, so.

943
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:45,340
Exactly.

944
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,720
So, yeah, I definitely noted that.

945
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:52,020
So anyway, we got the dreams thing and

946
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,480
you...

947
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,760
Yeah, more on the human body.

948
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,980
We'll see what transpires in the next couple

949
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,420
of weeks.
