1
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,680
Greek, you know, as we speak, I understand,

2
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,260
now I can't see it right this second,

3
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,400
but I could turn it on if I

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:17,820
wanted to.

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,340
The president is supposed to be telling us

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,700
how he just bombed stuff, because now the

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,300
US is involved in the battlely over there

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,200
between the two IS.

9
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,640
Well, anyway, I just figured I'd run that

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,040
at you because I know I had a

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,240
couple of reactions and comments about it, so

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,980
I figured I would just put them all

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,760
together in one shot for you here and

14
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,400
just let you speak to it while it's

15
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:38,620
happening.

16
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,740
It's a conflict, and it's what they do.

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,660
That's the same reason they have police.

18
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,900
For example, police get a quota, right?

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,780
You've got to go out and write tickets,

20
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,160
or otherwise we're going to have to send

21
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,180
out the department, whatever they tell them, right?

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,160
The attorneys, you know, the prosecutors, they have

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,720
a 99% conviction rate or 95%

24
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,860
conviction rate, right?

25
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,520
It's all bullshit.

26
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:07,060
So, it's called industry, so, yeah, there is,

27
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,660
like, you know, here's the thing, you know

28
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,400
the CIA has an aircraft carrier, right?

29
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,780
Most people don't know that.

30
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:12,600
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

31
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,760
Yeah, they have their own aircraft carrier.

32
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,880
Everybody's got a military of some kind, so

33
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,400
if you're going to start a nation, the

34
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,700
way you start it is you need a

35
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,500
post office first.

36
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,760
That's the first thing you need, and then

37
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,600
you have to have the ability to wage

38
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:24,980
war.

39
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,540
A post office, really?

40
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,920
That would be the primary thing?

41
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,500
Yeah, exactly.

42
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,700
That's how you set up.

43
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,700
It comes from the old Roman convention.

44
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,240
When the Roman Empire established that, actually, it

45
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:37,960
was before that.

46
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,300
I know I read this somewhere.

47
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:39,780
You know what?

48
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,520
You're reminding me.

49
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,760
I read this somewhere, and I can't think

50
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,600
of exactly where it was, but it's some

51
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,560
sort of set of rules.

52
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,240
Yeah, yeah.

53
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,080
Yeah, yeah.

54
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,120
To establish a nation, you're not considered a

55
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,220
nation.

56
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,880
In other words, you can get a piece

57
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,340
of land, and you establish a post office

58
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,000
that could receive and send, and the actual

59
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,220
office is established.

60
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,040
You're ready.

61
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,800
You're ready to go.

62
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,000
The political body and the governing body is

63
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,920
to ...

64
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,260
You've had monarchies turn into parliaments and vice

65
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:06,500
versa.

66
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,340
That doesn't matter.

67
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,320
What matters is the post office and the

68
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,180
ability to wage war or to be an

69
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,180
ally in war.

70
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,640
It's a lot more ...

71
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,820
That's what people ...

72
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,080
Okay.

73
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,700
In a lot of countries, like Greece, Israel,

74
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,780
and I used to be able to name

75
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,140
30 countries where it's mandatory, especially if you're

76
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,220
a male, to be in the army for

77
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,020
at least two years.

78
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,280
Right.

79
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,280
It's considered a right of passage.

80
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:32,680
Right?

81
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:33,860
Compulsory service.

82
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,340
Yeah, yeah.

83
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:34,860
Mm-hmm.

84
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,940
A political right of passage based on time,

85
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,200
like decade or whatever, this decade, this who

86
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,900
goes to war.

87
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,660
It's one of those things, but it's not

88
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,220
really a war, even legally.

89
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,560
It's just a police action, just like you

90
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,080
have police.

91
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,000
Everything the police do is illegal.

92
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,220
Everything they do.

93
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:52,700
Everything.

94
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:53,280
Right.

95
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,140
They have to get you to agree to

96
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:55,300
it.

97
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,260
It's just like a Walmart security cop.

98
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,900
In other words, police don't have any more

99
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,360
authority.

100
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,420
They have more ...

101
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,160
What do you call it?

102
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,740
They can kill you and get away with

103
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,360
it, while a Walmart security guard probably won't.

104
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,380
I don't know about that, but- They

105
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,000
equally enforce policy.

106
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,440
They enforce policies of the property you're on.

107
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,060
That's really what it's about.

108
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:17,300
Right?

109
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,140
Well, not even that.

110
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,160
I mean, they have no business ...

111
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,560
Here's the thing, and there's a revival of

112
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,180
the Constitution, which is true.

113
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,940
Jonah Bay talked about it, and I've always

114
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,320
known this.

115
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,600
Rod Kloss, who I studied with 15 years

116
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,660
ago, also talked about it.

117
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,760
If you have the rights, you can defend,

118
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,600
and you can be belligerent about it.

119
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,260
In other words, if the police come to

120
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,920
arrest you or even pull you over for

121
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,180
a red light, they have to have a

122
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:43,440
warrant.

123
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,140
That warrant has to be accompanied by a

124
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,960
signed affidavit, a sworn affidavit.

125
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,480
That never happens.

126
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:48,740
Right?

127
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:49,400
Never happens.

128
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,740
But if you stay on that point, the

129
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,980
case has to go away.

130
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,440
They all know this.

131
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,740
I've been at sentencing trials, and I saw

132
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,260
these attorneys.

133
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,120
What are you guys doing here?

134
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,280
Make sure their constitutional rights are not violated.

135
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,160
Because they didn't say anything, those people that

136
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,960
are being sentenced don't know their rights, that

137
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,300
the whole thing is a sham.

138
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,440
They're not being violated.

139
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,060
You get it?

140
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,800
No one has a duty to protect your

141
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,880
rights other than yourself.

142
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,380
That's why they don't teach it.

143
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,260
They don't teach anything about the financial.

144
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,800
Heck, they don't even teach anything about what's

145
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,440
in the ancient writs in the Bible.

146
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,900
They give, for example, these Christians, they give

147
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,420
them a few verses, and they do a

148
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:33,580
bullshit Bible study class to give the impression

149
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,520
that they're studying it.

150
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:35,740
Right?

151
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,380
But you can take any verse out of

152
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,300
any book and turn it into a holy

153
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:40,960
book that way.

154
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,920
But here's the thing.

155
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,880
War is something that men do.

156
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,660
People do.

157
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,060
Men meaning men and women.

158
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,480
People.

159
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,560
It's not a big deal.

160
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,700
This is more of a quota.

161
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,040
It's like, cops are writing a lot of

162
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,760
tickets today.

163
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,740
Yeah, they were told.

164
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,120
You get it?

165
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,260
This is what's going on.

166
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,840
I mean, what was Biden blowing up?

167
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,720
What was he dropping bombs on?

168
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,540
Then Obama was dropping plenty of bombs on

169
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,240
Syria and ISIS.

170
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,600
Biden didn't actually drop too many bombs.

171
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,120
See, and that's the weird thing, because something

172
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,640
I note is that organizationally, in the ether,

173
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,460
it seems, there are battles that'll be waged

174
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,140
between groups, even if it's not under the

175
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:23,900
banner of money.

176
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,580
But hold on.

177
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,020
Biden was dropping bombs.

178
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,000
The stimulus checks were financial bombs.

179
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,700
I don't know if you remember.

180
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,960
I don't know if we were doing this

181
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,000
back during COVID time, but I told people

182
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,340
consistently if you get a stimulus check, whatever

183
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,620
that amount they're giving you, you're going to

184
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,640
pay for it ten times over with inflation.

185
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,260
No, you did say that, and that was

186
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,940
only because we did it on a show,

187
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,780
because you did it on my show one

188
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,020
time.

189
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,900
A long time ago.

190
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,320
Yeah.

191
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,580
Before even the stimulus, when they just started.

192
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,100
I said, watch what happens with inflation.

193
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,260
You have to be a total idiot not

194
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:52,840
to see that.

195
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,160
So we have to come up with a

196
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,240
word that means someone would be below an

197
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:57,520
idiot.

198
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,140
I don't know.

199
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,840
Anyway, so here's the thing.

200
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,120
So that was the financial.

201
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,900
There was a financial bomb he was doing.

202
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:05,360
Yeah.

203
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,620
But but here's the thing.

204
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,520
That's why ISIS disappeared, because they were all

205
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,800
receiving stimulus checks.

206
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,160
Right.

207
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,780
Because they're on the payroll.

208
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:13,240
Right.

209
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:14,920
I'm serious.

210
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,440
They did receive stimulus checks.

211
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,360
ISIS fighters.

212
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,880
Well, that's also why Antifa.

213
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,920
Remember, Antifa is going to, you know, they're

214
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,860
going to the left wingers.

215
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,320
They're going to rise up against the country.

216
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,500
And they were all over the place.

217
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:25,980
Oh, my God.

218
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:26,740
They got T-shirts.

219
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,020
And it's all fake.

220
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,060
Well, you know, this Trump.

221
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:30,840
What is it?

222
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,820
Not a king or no king protest is

223
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,300
all fake.

224
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,340
Also, it's all planned.

225
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:34,620
Right.

226
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,580
No king's protest.

227
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:35,800
Yeah.

228
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:35,980
Yeah.

229
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,240
Yeah.

230
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:36,600
No king.

231
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,960
It's all everything.

232
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,220
Look, if it's not planned and funded by

233
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,940
them, it doesn't make it to the media.

234
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:43,940
Well, that was the thing.

235
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,900
That's what I was trying to say.

236
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,920
The reason why there was a legitimate Antifa

237
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,900
group that organically grew up at one point,

238
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,460
but it wasn't.

239
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:50,760
Yeah.

240
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,560
This thing was people that were paid to

241
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,000
show up.

242
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,240
And that's why they had uniforms.

243
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,420
What do you do when you get a

244
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,000
crap job?

245
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:57,980
You get a uniform.

246
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,040
That's the kid at McDonald's.

247
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,140
Anyway.

248
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,120
I get it.

249
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,980
Antifa was around in the 90s, wasn't it?

250
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,740
No, Antifa wasn't really around in the 90s

251
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,200
here.

252
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:08,960
Not at all.

253
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:09,820
It was in Europe.

254
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:10,920
In Europe.

255
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:11,380
Got it.

256
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,820
This whole thing that came up just during

257
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,060
COVID time around then, you know, during the

258
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,440
George Floyd and all that, those people, I

259
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,600
said, they're going to disappear.

260
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,120
You know why?

261
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,200
They're going to stop paying them.

262
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,080
And as soon as they stop paying them,

263
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,680
poof, you don't see them anymore, do you?

264
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:28,800
No.

265
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,720
It's kind of like, you know, these terror

266
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,960
events are all fake, right?

267
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,760
And the school shootings and all that, right?

268
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,000
It doesn't mean people don't get killed.

269
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,300
But do you remember this happened more than

270
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,160
once in a decade?

271
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,120
I keep using this example.

272
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:47,480
Blackhawk helicopters at low altitude, two dozen helicopters

273
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,180
all over L.A. downtown, low altitude, like

274
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,440
almost to top level for two hours buzzing

275
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:52,800
around.

276
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,380
And people are calling like, what's going on?

277
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,120
What's going on?

278
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,680
No answer.

279
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,400
They call Pentagon, the military, the local bases,

280
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,520
the police, the governor.

281
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:01,580
No answer.

282
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,240
The next day, they don't answer for like

283
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:04,920
24 hours.

284
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:05,420
The next day.

285
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,420
Oh, yeah, we were doing an exercise.

286
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,080
Sure.

287
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,260
Sure.

288
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,560
That was a real event.

289
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,480
And they were trying to figure out, you

290
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,900
know, what to do or suppress it.

291
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,200
Right.

292
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,200
A bunch of idiots probably found something, a

293
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,480
way, a weakness in the system.

294
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,140
They were going to trigger something off or

295
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:20,460
whatever.

296
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,580
And they were able to fight, you know,

297
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,620
listen to it and pick up on it.

298
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,680
And they sent their helicopters and troops on

299
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,000
the ground.

300
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,820
Something like that happened here in Tucson.

301
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,679
Also, back in the early 2000s, a whole

302
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,440
area was shut down by military.

303
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,640
And there was no answer on what was

304
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,299
going on.

305
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:39,580
Right.

306
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,299
So it was.

307
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:42,760
But then they call it a drill.

308
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,140
Right.

309
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,920
Now, when there's a terrorist event, you always

310
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,240
find out that it was.

311
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,900
That day was also planned a drill.

312
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:50,600
Always.

313
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:50,960
Right.

314
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:51,600
Always.

315
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:51,860
Yeah.

316
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,100
So.

317
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:52,200
So.

318
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,160
So you'll never.

319
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,300
If there's a real pro.

320
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,200
I gave you an example.

321
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,240
I think the last sonic.

322
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,880
There were millions of people.

323
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,420
I've got hundreds of thousands protesting throughout Europe

324
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:00,960
and wherever.

325
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,340
Various things that didn't make it to the

326
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,580
mainstream media at all.

327
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,160
At all.

328
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:05,560
Right.

329
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,400
Because it was an organic protest.

330
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:07,880
Right.

331
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,180
For various things.

332
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,220
I think one of them might have been

333
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,340
the cold, the lockdowns that never made it

334
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:12,940
to the media.

335
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,600
It was people with cell phones and social

336
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:15,940
media.

337
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,100
And even then they blocked it.

338
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,660
So it's all fake.

339
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,220
Get used to it.

340
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,940
Actually, I shouldn't say get used to it.

341
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,160
You either know it or you don't.

342
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:24,840
And you ignore it.

343
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,520
But here's the thing.

344
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,300
More power to it.

345
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,160
Look, you know what I say?

346
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,680
If they all want to kill each other,

347
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,640
have at it.

348
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,760
You know, I don't even want a front

349
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,240
row seat.

350
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,020
Just just leave me out of it.

351
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,200
Right.

352
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,300
If they want world peace, have at it.

353
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,560
I still want nothing to do with it.

354
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,320
So I'm not really someone that has any

355
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,340
anything in the game or is a dog

356
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,420
in the game or whatever.

357
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,140
I really don't care if they want to

358
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,740
wipe out all of Israel and all over

359
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,560
Iran with nukes.

360
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:49,860
It's fine.

361
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,420
Do it.

362
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,320
It's not fine.

363
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,640
But but here's the thing.

364
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,680
They'll never be a nuclear interchange because they

365
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,660
don't work that way.

366
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,440
You can drop one nuke and you got

367
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,680
to wait about a half an hour to

368
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,760
drop the next one.

369
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,640
One at a time.

370
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,760
If you can even deliver it, if you

371
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,800
can even deliver it.

372
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,100
Right.

373
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,900
So I've always had a theoretical question about

374
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,460
that because they talk about all this, you

375
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,560
know, different hardware and everything that has to

376
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,580
be in each one of them.

377
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,300
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

378
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,180
And I say to myself, you know, once

379
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,840
one goes off, doesn't that completely disrupt all?

380
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:20,580
That's right.

381
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,140
That's right.

382
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,140
So if you have 10 of them up

383
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,560
in the air, only one can go off.

384
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,380
All the other ones get zapped.

385
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:25,840
Right.

386
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,340
All of the electronics on the ground to

387
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,920
launch the next one gets zapped if it's

388
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,500
in the area.

389
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,100
So, right.

390
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,740
It's like an automatic EMP comes with it.

391
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,620
So boom.

392
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,160
Exactly.

393
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:36,900
So it doesn't work.

394
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,000
But people don't have enough sense to think

395
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,380
about it.

396
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,360
That's why when you tell them 9-11

397
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,480
was a lot of textbook 101 nuclear demolition,

398
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,240
they only think like atmospheric mushroom cloud.

399
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,180
We didn't see a mushroom cloud.

400
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,880
They don't understand that all the research, well,

401
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,140
90 percent of the nuclear research is underground.

402
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,280
See, that's why one of the questions I

403
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,240
that was one of the questions I asked

404
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,200
stupidly President Reagan when I wrote him a

405
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,540
letter when I was 12, which is how

406
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,780
I got on a government list in the

407
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,280
first place.

408
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,040
It was that, you know, just maybe that's

409
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,020
why they put me on the list.

410
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,740
Anyway, it's true what the Greeks always said.

411
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,100
This is from a subscriber that we must

412
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,940
have done something wrong to be here on

413
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,520
this planet.

414
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,280
Yeshua said, my kingdom is not of this

415
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:20,660
world.

416
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,900
Satan is the guy in this world.

417
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,160
OK.

418
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,840
You mentioned this the last time.

419
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,400
Yeah, I did.

420
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,860
But there was a follow up to it.

421
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,140
OK.

422
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:26,900
OK, go ahead.

423
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,540
Does the Greek believe that the descendants of

424
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,540
Cain are ruling the earth since Cain was

425
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,660
scared that he was going to be the

426
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,140
killer?

427
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,440
Yeah, but but not just Cain.

428
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:42,620
Cain represents an idea, a collective that you

429
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,080
can transfer to different parts of geographic parts

430
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,980
and economic and elite levels.

431
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,140
Yeah, yeah, it does.

432
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,200
But not solely Cain.

433
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,480
Like, for example, if you read the Bible

434
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,300
in genealogy, how come it doesn't talk about

435
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,940
people that lived on the southern tip of

436
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,600
the African continent or the north and most

437
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,460
east part of Asia?

438
00:11:59,660 --> 00:11:59,840
Why?

439
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,860
Like Yahweh doesn't know they exist.

440
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,020
Right.

441
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:03,940
So it has to do.

442
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,520
Cain has to do with a very small

443
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,960
group of regional area.

444
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,140
Yeah.

445
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,500
But not solely because there's people on this

446
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,040
side and people on the four winds.

447
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,140
You got people ruling the north, people ruling

448
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,220
the south, people ruling the west, people ruling

449
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:17,640
the east.

450
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,480
So Cain would be those ruling the east.

451
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,880
You still have at least three other groups

452
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,720
that are that are not spoken of or

453
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,820
mentioned in the Bible.

454
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,080
Yeah.

455
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,480
And the Bible is a law form and

456
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,740
it has to do with a certain group

457
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,280
of people.

458
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:30,480
You.

459
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,200
Yeah.

460
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,140
It doesn't have iPhones in there.

461
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,200
It doesn't tell you the ruling families.

462
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,080
It doesn't tell you this or that.

463
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:37,340
You know.

464
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:37,660
Yeah.

465
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,220
It doesn't tell you about the others, either,

466
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,040
because no easy point there is, look, Adam

467
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,360
and Eve.

468
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:42,600
Right.

469
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,940
So they have a bunch of kids.

470
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,540
Now, their kids wind up marrying people.

471
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,120
Now, unless they married the same children, you

472
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,380
know, unless brother and sister started marrying right

473
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:50,860
then and there.

474
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,480
Guess what?

475
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,840
There are other people around for them to

476
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,160
marry.

477
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:54,500
Right.

478
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:54,900
Sure.

479
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,960
But here's the thing.

480
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,640
There's a weird tradition growing up with Sephardic

481
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,540
Jews that used to vacation a deal.

482
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,560
They were upper crusty.

483
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,600
You know, they always had mercy, mercy, you

484
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,240
know, fake cat.

485
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,580
You know, Cadillac was passed.

486
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,500
It was Mercedes.

487
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,240
You know, I worked as a security guard

488
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:11,540
and deal.

489
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:11,980
I know.

490
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:12,720
Yeah.

491
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,760
And the fancy, you know, the cabana deal

492
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,380
and all that.

493
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,880
And when I found out there was a

494
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,680
marriage and I was like, oh, I've known

495
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,320
those for quite a few years.

496
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,180
Aren't they cousins?

497
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,020
Aren't they cousins?

498
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,240
Yeah.

499
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,180
Yeah.

500
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,640
And I was like, OK, is it incest?

501
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,800
Technically, it's it.

502
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,480
It isn't technically, but it's too close for

503
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:37,940
comfort.

504
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,540
You know, I would be mixing.

505
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,180
Yeah.

506
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,860
But especially when you find out the grandmother

507
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,800
married the cousin.

508
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,480
And so now you're narrowing.

509
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,780
And now it's like really narrow pot.

510
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,420
Might as well be incest.

511
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:49,660
Right.

512
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,260
Yeah.

513
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:50,860
Well, that's right.

514
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,260
When your family tree starts twisting around, it's

515
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,240
like, you know, one of those things, one

516
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,200
of those fake Christmas trees you got to

517
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,540
take out of the box and untwist the

518
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:57,880
branches.

519
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:58,360
It's really.

520
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,660
Oh, yeah.

521
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,200
So I found out what a lot of

522
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,980
these, quote unquote, Jews, especially the Sephardic and

523
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,460
the Syrian Jews, they were marrying first cousins.

524
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,700
That's what they were doing.

525
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:08,960
Deal.

526
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,740
Mostly Syrian Jews, if I remember right.

527
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,000
Yeah.

528
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:11,700
Syrian Jews.

529
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,500
I said Sephardic.

530
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:12,880
I'm sorry.

531
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,180
Yeah.

532
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,560
Syrian.

533
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,760
Syrian Jews.

534
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:14,960
Yeah.

535
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,460
They were in the textile business.

536
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,740
Import, export factories in Asia.

537
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:19,380
Yeah.

538
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:20,760
Yeah.

539
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,740
Lots of money.

540
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,580
Lots of money.

541
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:22,840
Lots of entitlement.

542
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:23,600
I know.

543
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,000
I believe me.

544
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,060
I had to try and try and work

545
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,260
for them for like pitiful wages per hour.

546
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,680
And they want to push you around even

547
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,040
though you're trying to protect their stuff.

548
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:31,340
Anyway.

549
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,100
You're a goy.

550
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,740
You're a goy.

551
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,420
Yeah, that's right.

552
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:34,860
Oh, yeah.

553
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,360
Because I'm a goy and I'm Slav and

554
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm, you know, less than anyway, cattle, chattel,

555
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:40,240
whatever.

556
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,160
There's a heavenly entity called Yahweh that sits

557
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,160
in the council, but is superior to the

558
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:47,640
70.

559
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,080
He's referred to as the ancient of days

560
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,600
in Daniel seven, nine.

561
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:51,860
OK.

562
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,420
There's all this stuff here about this period,

563
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,260
the council of Yahweh.

564
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,000
Ultimately, everything and emirates from the father, though.

565
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:01,860
OK.

566
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,720
I don't know what all of this is,

567
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,920
but he's quoting stuff from Enoch and a

568
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,560
whole bunch of things.

569
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,180
If you want to go through it, it's

570
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,440
a patriarchal wing.

571
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,060
Right.

572
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,900
We also that we also have the matriarch.

573
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,440
I talked about the revived goddess religion for

574
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:15,720
decades.

575
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,620
Watch out for that.

576
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:17,840
Watch out for that.

577
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,100
And that still sits there.

578
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,340
So there's both.

579
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,500
You know, it's it's like imagine a family

580
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,940
with a domineering father.

581
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,120
If you go to a Latin family, it's

582
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,380
a domineering grandmother.

583
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:28,840
Right.

584
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:29,260
Yeah.

585
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,580
So, yeah, it just happens that particular covenant

586
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,780
or group has a dominating father figure.

587
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,320
Right.

588
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,560
Look, I want to jump out of the

589
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,620
biblical, though, because I'll tell you, it gets

590
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,020
my head spinning at this point.

591
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,800
Yeah, it's just it's limited.

592
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,620
The reason I adhere to it is because

593
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,840
I need a law form.

594
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,140
I'm not going I'm not going to the

595
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,500
state of or what scientists say.

596
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:52,820
Right.

597
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,700
And also it's proven that a lot of

598
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,300
this stuff that's considered lawful, clean food and

599
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,360
behavior and business in the Bible is universally

600
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,320
adapted anyway.

601
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,580
And if you know it, you're going to

602
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,540
be ahead of the game.

603
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,360
So, for example, if you understand how to

604
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,020
do Bible according to the biblical law and

605
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,700
you do your business that way, you'll always

606
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,480
be well regarded.

607
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,160
You know what I mean?

608
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:14,860
There you go.

609
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,900
Because there's no cheating.

610
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:16,360
Right.

611
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,340
It doesn't mean be ruthless and whatever or,

612
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,580
you know, look out for your own benefit.

613
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,880
But there's no cheating.

614
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,740
You're always disclosing what you're going to do.

615
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,620
And, you know, always do.

616
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,300
Right.

617
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,400
So, you know, the regulations, the 72 hour

618
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,900
rule comes from the Bible.

619
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,060
And, you know, that's the typical financial thing

620
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:38,700
for contracts.

621
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,660
You can impose that.

622
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,400
And the people are surprised when you know

623
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,120
that.

624
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,520
Well, I learned it from the Bible.

625
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,320
So, yeah.

626
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,520
And you'll notice that these things are applied

627
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:47,940
in business.

628
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,480
So it seems to be an archetype.

629
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,220
So might as well.

630
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,340
There you go.

631
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,320
So here's a completely different issue.

632
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,700
And it comes from when we talked about

633
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,100
food being shaped like things.

634
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,800
I'll be damned if oysters don't remind me

635
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,080
of some part of the body.

636
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,740
But I can't quite think of what it

637
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,079
is.

638
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,940
Well, two oysters next together might look very

639
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,359
gynic.

640
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,119
Actually, there are gynic flowers.

641
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,099
Oysters would be the spleen, maybe.

642
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,720
That's what I was thinking.

643
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,579
But then again, what about the liver?

644
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:21,040
The little rock oysters are the liver.

645
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:21,579
Yeah.

646
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,880
I think they're called little rock or baby

647
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,180
rock.

648
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,800
Yeah, they're very popular at the clam shucking

649
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,240
places.

650
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,780
But that's what I was thinking where I've

651
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,260
seen them.

652
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,620
Yeah, they'll rebuild your liver.

653
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,200
Yeah, not directly, but the energy helps.

654
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:35,500
Right?

655
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,320
Fair enough.

656
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,220
The energy helps.

657
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:44,360
If you mind that geometric archetype form, if

658
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,780
it looks like a part of the body,

659
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,880
it will help that part of the body.

660
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,020
You're not wrong.

661
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,420
But if you rely solely on that, you

662
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,160
may not get the results you're looking for

663
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,420
either.

664
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,760
It's like a toolbox.

665
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,860
The reason it's called a toolbox is because

666
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,960
you have multiple tools, right?

667
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:02,520
Right.

668
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,180
And it's something that always needs to be

669
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:05,540
considered.

670
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,280
I think there's more to it.

671
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,900
This is where we do a sonic just

672
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,340
based on input.

673
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,120
Like I've always talked about, the way you

674
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,360
start changing your diet is by not switching

675
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,740
over cold turkey to something else, but incorporating

676
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,400
what you want to switch over to little

677
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,740
by little, but also emphasis on your condiments.

678
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,580
Because even if you switch your diet to

679
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,360
something else, if you have poor choices of

680
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,880
condiments, it's not going to be good for

681
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,220
you anyway.

682
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,320
It's really the condiments.

683
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,020
But is it?

684
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,200
No.

685
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,040
It's everything.

686
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,240
You have to have a good combination.

687
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,260
It's like tuning an engine.

688
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,620
You got what's called a fuel-air ratio.

689
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,480
It's not just the fuel.

690
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,080
It's the air also, right?

691
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,260
And then it's the temperature and the altitude,

692
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:48,840
right?

693
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,180
You know, cars don't operate that well at

694
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,260
10,000 feet above sea level, right?

695
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,680
And the temperature, the given temperature, the time

696
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,140
of year, so to speak.

697
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:57,640
Yeah, exactly.

698
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,580
All that stuff.

699
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,820
You know, in Alaska, you know, the cars

700
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,900
just won't start because it's too cold, you

701
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,600
know, and whatever.

702
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,900
So it's a combination.

703
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,720
If you look at, for example, like a

704
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,780
computer is like the mind and a car

705
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,940
engine is like the body.

706
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,840
There's so many variables that need to be

707
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,260
considered.

708
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,440
It's never one thing.

709
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,580
And then when you consider that each individual

710
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:22,000
is slightly different, it would make any medical

711
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,700
industry mad to be able to treat anyone.

712
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,640
That's why they've convinced everyone to just take

713
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,680
this pill for everyone.

714
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,520
It doesn't work.

715
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,680
That's why the only medical stuff that works

716
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,900
is painkillers, right?

717
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,080
And that's what really has anesthesia.

718
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,900
Anesthesia and painkillers is what and hygiene.

719
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,480
Of course, having top water and sewer separated

720
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,960
is why people have fewer, why we have

721
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,800
fewer diseases.

722
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,120
Like, for example, when the pandemic broke out,

723
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,000
they said, I said, we still have good

724
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,380
water.

725
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,760
Our top water is not polluted.

726
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,540
Like if I heard the top water was

727
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,080
polluted and people were getting diphtheria.

728
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:57,460
Oh, yeah.

729
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,920
Then I would buy the pandemic to a

730
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,300
degree.

731
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,120
It wouldn't be worldwide.

732
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,420
It would be only where the water is.

733
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,220
Source of water is like that.

734
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,580
It could be a source of water like

735
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,440
New York that feeds 20 million people.

736
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,940
Let's say, yeah, buy it, but only in

737
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,180
New York.

738
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,280
So that's why it's just counted as bullshit.

739
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,140
So the condiment issue is something that I

740
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,040
haven't leaned on.

741
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,100
And I think I need to.

742
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:20,960
And it's very simple.

743
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:25,180
Like when you eat, for example, fried food,

744
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,360
acid.

745
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,600
Like when you eat fish and chips, they

746
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,960
have malt vinegar, right?

747
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:30,380
Right.

748
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,700
Or ketchup, which is more of a vinegar

749
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,960
flavor or lemon.

750
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,920
If you're in a Mediterranean country, you're always

751
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,140
putting lemon on everything.

752
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,960
Like you put it on rice, put it

753
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,120
on your meat, put it on your French

754
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:41,680
fries, right?

755
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,220
Now, when you live in a colder climate,

756
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,160
they tend to go more fatty food.

757
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,340
You put mayonnaise on everything, right?

758
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,560
Like the Netherlands, right?

759
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,000
Right.

760
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,100
Or whatever.

761
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,980
So you have to understand that it's also

762
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,080
cross-latitude, you know?

763
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,020
Like, for example, I remember in the 70s,

764
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,180
remember the Alaskan pipeline?

765
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,440
They're trying to recruit workers.

766
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:02,400
Oh, yeah.

767
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,860
Yeah, this chick's dead.

768
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,280
I remember I've got a crush on her.

769
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,820
Was it Dawn Delaney?

770
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,500
And her dad was going to go up

771
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,680
there and I was over her house.

772
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,040
And they had a typewritten Xerox copy papers

773
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,400
as well.

774
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,080
For two weeks before you come up to

775
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,000
Alaska, you go out and get yourself a

776
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,620
thing of cool whip and put two tablespoons

777
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,380
of corn oil in it and eat that

778
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,160
in two days, right?

779
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,780
Because that's like fat, right?

780
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,540
So you adjust to the, you know, like

781
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,340
they eat well-fat and sealed fat and

782
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,200
they're just fine, right?

783
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,020
So when they tell you fat is bad

784
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,400
for you, well, it depends on where you

785
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:37,840
live.

786
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,040
They never discern any of that.

787
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,780
So you have to discern your food and

788
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,900
all that cross-latitude.

789
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,740
You have to discern what you're eating with

790
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,680
a proper condiment.

791
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:53,120
Like, for example, eating meat without a condiment

792
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,180
can be detrimental.

793
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,700
Because you're not really eating, you know, they

794
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,760
say we're carnivorous.

795
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:58,800
We're not.

796
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,100
We're not.

797
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,280
We're carrion eaters.

798
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,220
We don't eat meat the way animals eat

799
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:03,540
meat.

800
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,780
When animals eat meat, they just killed it

801
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,960
and they're eating it live.

802
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,100
It's just basically was alive five minutes ago.

803
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:10,820
We don't eat.

804
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,040
We are carrion eaters.

805
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,260
When you go to the supermarket and they

806
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,760
have all the meat wrapped up and it

807
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,940
was, it could be up to a month

808
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,480
old, frozen or whatever.

809
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,220
That is not meat carnivore type diet.

810
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,820
That is a carrion diet.

811
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,640
Meaning you're eating roadkill.

812
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,800
It's no different, right?

813
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,140
So, except it doesn't have the development that

814
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:30,900
roadkill does.

815
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,620
We're not really, we can't say these animals

816
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,460
do better because they'll kill something and eat

817
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,800
it immediately, most of it.

818
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,420
We don't eat that.

819
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,680
We don't eat that way.

820
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:45,260
We are actually a properly slaughtered animal needs

821
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:48,560
to cool down before you dress it and

822
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,060
butcher it for quite a while.

823
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,920
Sometimes more than a day or at least

824
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,380
a day to drain that out and dry.

825
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,360
So, that's carrion.

826
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,660
That's not carnivorous.

827
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,340
It's different.

828
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,820
So, that requires condiments.

829
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,920
And the easiest one is the meat should

830
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,120
be salted always.

831
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,020
Some kind of salt.

832
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,760
That's why even when you go get sushi,

833
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,260
it's offered with soy sauce.

834
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,640
It's not whether you like the soy sauce

835
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,100
or not.

836
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,680
You better eat the soy sauce if you're

837
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,880
going to have the sushi, right?

838
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,000
Also with some type of mustard or horseradish,

839
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:20,900
right?

840
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,200
So, if you're going to have sushi or

841
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,220
sashimi and you say you don't want the

842
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,620
horseradish or mustard or soy sauce, you better

843
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,320
leave it alone.

844
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,640
Because it will be not good for you.

845
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,080
Unless you eat just a tiny amount like

846
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:38,840
at a tasting.

847
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,340
But I wouldn't have it as a meal

848
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,440
without those condiments.

849
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I've also mentioned I had gotten a burger

850
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,940
from McDonald's without any condiments.

851
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,020
It was inedible.

852
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,020
And I said it was completely inedible.

853
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,580
And I brought it home and I said,

854
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:54,220
let me do an experiment regarding condiments.

855
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,340
And I put a little bit of ketchup

856
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:55,680
on it.

857
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,660
Now, it just tasted like a regular McDonald's

858
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,740
burger should taste, right?

859
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,780
It was semi-edible or edible like you

860
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,600
would remember those who have eaten McDonald's what

861
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,100
it tastes like.

862
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,160
So, it was a very interesting experiment.

863
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,260
So, I haven't leaned on that.

864
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:14,320
But just one thing, I'm very dismayed on

865
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,020
how little information is on the Internet.

866
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,920
Bullshit about, you know, we have a little

867
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,100
bit of information age and stuff.

868
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,540
I was able to do much better research

869
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:25,880
30 years ago in good libraries than I

870
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,040
can right now on the Internet.

871
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,220
Because right now, when you look up the

872
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:33,300
concepts that I'm discovering or discussing, whether it's

873
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:37,440
the universal principle, you know, macrobiotic stuff, nine

874
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,180
-star key, a lot of the Asian stuff

875
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:42,440
or traditional Western stuff that's been done away

876
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,840
with, you will not find it on the

877
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,080
Internet.

878
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,560
It's pathetic what you find on the Internet

879
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,620
regarding these subjects.

880
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,240
And I'm so glad I picked up on

881
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:49,400
it.

882
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,880
And I have to recollect.

883
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,860
But fortunately, I had a working knowledge 30

884
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,820
years ago, meaning I was able to apply

885
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,700
it and learn by application.

886
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,440
So, I'm like one of the last people

887
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,360
left that I don't know anyone else that

888
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,160
can do this stuff, not only like develop

889
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:08,440
it.

890
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,380
And because someone getting into it now is

891
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,660
going to go online and it's going to

892
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,740
be rudimentary bullshit.

893
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,260
You're not going to really get far with

894
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:15,500
it.

895
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,180
And it's sad.

896
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,000
And I have to really think about that

897
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,060
or find a source.

898
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,780
There has to be some good stuff.

899
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,540
A lot of the Michio Kushi stuff is

900
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,180
really good.

901
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,680
But also, he's very, very dogmatic.

902
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,280
And he did admit that in his last

903
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:29,640
days.

904
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,100
He even said, yeah, go ahead and have

905
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,720
ice cream if you want, you know, and

906
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,480
pizza and whatever.

907
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,100
Give you an example.

908
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,560
When Michio, I know someone who knew someone

909
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,060
who was hanging out with Michio in the

910
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:45,540
early 70s, Michio Kushi and George Asawa, Herman

911
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,120
Aihara.

912
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,960
I don't know if Shizuko was there.

913
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,360
But and Michio Kushi says to George Asawa,

914
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,620
who was his mentor, we're in New York

915
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:56,940
City.

916
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,500
Where are we going to find good miso

917
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:58,920
soup?

918
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,800
He says, miso soup in New York City?

919
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,160
No, we're going to have hamburgers.

920
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,800
As a matter of fact, he tells Michio

921
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,520
Kushi, I want you to go over there

922
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,320
to that candy store, buy a candy bar

923
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,900
and eat the whole thing right now.

924
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,560
You see, so this stuff about I see

925
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,240
this dogma you know, like today I was

926
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,040
driving around.

927
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,560
I was welding today, so I need some

928
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:22,820
stuff.

929
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,860
I had to get some 7014 welding stick

930
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,160
because I was doing fine sheet metal attached

931
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,180
to metal rods and stuff.

932
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,500
So I finally got it anyway.

933
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,020
And I saw a lot of advertisements and

934
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,760
stuff, billboards about health, health, this healthy food,

935
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,540
this healthy, that healthy, that.

936
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,540
Oh, my gosh.

937
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,480
The people that are promoting health and healthy

938
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,700
don't know anything about it.

939
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,560
It's a fad.

940
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,320
They're totally like zero.

941
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,540
There's always a health fad.

942
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,940
It's just a fad.

943
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,180
It's all fad like even when you go

944
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,400
to a quote unquote medical alternative and they

945
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,540
say eat healthy and they tell you this,

946
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,260
so they know nothing about energies.

947
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,020
They know nothing about latitude.

948
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,340
They know nothing about condiments.

949
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,420
They know nothing about the effects of foods.

950
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,020
They know nothing about diagnosing you properly.

951
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,540
They know nothing at all.

952
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,400
It's really sad.

953
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,440
But look, this is not to bring anything

954
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,500
down anyone listening because it's a testament to

955
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,420
how robust the human body is with all

956
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,560
the abuse that we're getting.

957
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,020
What do you mean Greek?

958
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:25,840
I'm not being abused.

959
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:26,480
You are.

960
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,860
We're totally ignorant about everything.

961
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,440
Even though we're in total blindness and complete

962
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,000
ignorance about everything, we're still chugging along pretty

963
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,920
much okay, which is a testament to how

964
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:42,120
robust we are spiritually, mentally, right, and physically.

965
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,460
We're very robust creatures.

966
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,580
We could take a lot of punishment and

967
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,120
suffer a lot of ill stuff, meaning suffering

968
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,460
means to know you're going to go into

969
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,140
something bad.

970
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:51,920
We do that.

971
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:52,380
Right.

972
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,000
And we're still okay.

973
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,620
So anyway, I don't want to get on

974
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,160
a rant that was slightly ranty.

975
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,500
It's okay.

976
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,280
Look, it fits perfectly with this.

977
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,100
Does the Greek have any recommendations for mitigating

978
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:11,440
vascular calcification or arthrosclerotic plaque formation?

979
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,260
What is the Greek perspective on the role

980
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,520
of dietary oxitate?

981
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,580
Excuse me.

982
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,000
No.

983
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:19,700
Okay.

984
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,660
You don't even have to finish.

985
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,200
Okay.

986
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,480
First of all, you're being.

987
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,360
What is it?

988
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,360
70% of all diagnoses are fictional or

989
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:27,680
false.

990
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,380
So how do you know you have that?

991
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,020
Oh, because I got tested.

992
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:32,700
Prove it.

993
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:34,560
Prove it.

994
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,040
The lab said, fuck the lab.

995
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,460
You know how when you work in a

996
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,120
blood lab and they have all these machines,

997
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,380
do you know that those machines are calibrated

998
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,120
by the workers?

999
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:49,060
So you have a tall, skinny guy that

1000
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,420
does cratum and coffee and smoke cigarettes.

1001
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:57,320
He's 6'2", 110, 120 pounds, red hair

1002
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:57,960
freckles.

1003
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,380
He calibrates it with his blood.

1004
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:04,820
Then you've got a 280-pound woman with

1005
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:12,340
canary green hair or that's addicted to whatever.

1006
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,740
And she tests.

1007
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,660
She calibrates her machine that she's going to

1008
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,240
be testing blood with her blood.

1009
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,440
You get my point?

1010
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:20,700
Yep.

1011
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,840
Have them swear to it that you have

1012
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,420
that and have them explain to you that

1013
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,440
they did orthoscopic where you can see it

1014
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,800
because I think they're lying to you.

1015
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,200
I don't trust them.

1016
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,420
I wouldn't trust them anymore.

1017
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,160
Forget about throwing.

1018
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,080
Well, look, as far as you can throw

1019
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,340
them, I wouldn't mind throwing them out of

1020
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,140
a window any day.

1021
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,200
But they only got mostly one-story buildings

1022
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:40,500
here.

1023
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,380
So here's the thing.

1024
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,520
I don't trust anything they say.

1025
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,240
If there's a way to self-diagnose that

1026
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,260
condition, I would go with that unless you

1027
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,240
have a trusted source.

1028
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:56,180
Now there is a chance because I know

1029
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,760
what throwing craps is like dice.

1030
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,420
I know.

1031
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,360
You can go into it.

1032
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,360
You can see a crap game.

1033
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:00,980
It's exciting.

1034
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,120
You feel lucky.

1035
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:02,540
You go there.

1036
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,260
You might do okay.

1037
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,480
But it's throwing dice, right?

1038
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:04,880
Yeah.

1039
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,900
So you might do all right, right?

1040
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,860
So you might do okay.

1041
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,340
It's just no different than throwing dice right

1042
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,240
at this point.

1043
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,840
If you feel lucky or fortunate and you

1044
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,360
think you got they put you on the

1045
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,440
right track with that condition or that diagnosis.

1046
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:17,800
Okay.

1047
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,080
Then what causes that?

1048
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,700
First of all, low cholesterol and all that.

1049
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,840
There's no such thing as food with cholesterol.

1050
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,000
Cholesterol something the body develops when you have

1051
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,420
a certain blood condition, right?

1052
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:28,940
Has to.

1053
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:29,300
Yeah.

1054
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,120
Yeah.

1055
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,880
Because this is food is high in cholesterol

1056
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,360
because it's no such thing.

1057
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,300
Right.

1058
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,080
So you're getting into like the study of

1059
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,060
lipids now and how the body reacts to

1060
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:38,260
that.

1061
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:42,240
Now it's very well known fact for documentation

1062
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,020
since the 1950s that halide groups create calcification

1063
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,800
on soft tissue including the blood vessels.

1064
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:52,120
Halide groups are anything in the halide group.

1065
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:52,660
Look it up.

1066
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,760
So it would be fluoride, fluorine, bromine, chlorine,

1067
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,240
right?

1068
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,560
So chlorinated water, any chlorine.

1069
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,320
If you're susceptible to this, any chlorination, even

1070
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,540
taking a shower will create calcification in the

1071
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:04,980
body.

1072
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,160
Brominated flour.

1073
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,500
Bromine is used as a bleach.

1074
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,640
If you have a swimming pool that has

1075
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:13,920
bromine tablets, your skin will ingest that and

1076
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,980
induce that.

1077
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,940
Brominated flour.

1078
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:17,780
All right.

1079
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,840
Look for that.

1080
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:19,300
Bromine.

1081
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,920
Of course fluoride, fluorine.

1082
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:21,980
Doesn't that somehow matter?

1083
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:22,860
Chocolate too?

1084
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,540
Like cheap chocolate or michael?

1085
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:28,100
Could have byproducts of halide group elements.

1086
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:28,360
Yeah.

1087
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,880
The halides are very well known.

1088
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,720
Even a mainstream idiot doctor knows that the

1089
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,080
halide.

1090
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,780
If you bring it up to them, they're

1091
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,720
like, yeah, I've heard that.

1092
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:39,060
You know?

1093
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:39,540
Okay.

1094
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:43,520
So the halogen or halide groups.

1095
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,280
Iodine is a big one.

1096
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:49,640
Iodized salt is a big halide, a halogen.

1097
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,640
That will create calcification.

1098
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,800
So look up what the halogen group elements

1099
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,600
are and see what foods have it and

1100
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,780
avoid those because you might have hypersensitivity to

1101
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:00,980
it.

1102
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,500
But I would say there's a 20 to

1103
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,940
30% chance you have that condition.

1104
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,680
Actually, there's a 0% chance you have

1105
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,220
it if they're lying to you.

1106
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:10,480
Right?

1107
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,940
Then it's just like shooting craps.

1108
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,560
But when people come to me with diagnoses,

1109
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,500
I say go back and they find, yeah,

1110
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,380
I really don't have that.

1111
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,080
They actually admit that they do.

1112
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,500
Especially, you know, the big ones.

1113
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,380
Diabetes, AIDS, cancers.

1114
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,920
All those are pretty much false.

1115
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,220
Yeah.

1116
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,020
Let's be fair.

1117
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,660
Unless they invented the condition, though.

1118
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,980
I mean, it is a crapshoot so you

1119
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,080
could possibly have it.

1120
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,680
But there's no proof in it in their

1121
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,820
lab test is what you're saying.

1122
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,440
Well, yeah, they want you to get the

1123
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:34,780
treatment.

1124
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,120
Yeah.

1125
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:35,520
Yeah.

1126
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,520
It's such a joke.

1127
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,140
Oh, my gosh.

1128
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:41,520
What's the latest buzz term about living in

1129
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,980
a fucked up world is it's a clown

1130
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,480
world, right?

1131
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,040
Clown show.

1132
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:44,480
Yeah.

1133
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:44,960
Sure.

1134
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:45,440
Yeah.

1135
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,400
So you basically, if you went to a

1136
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,040
clown show to get medical advice or a

1137
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,100
doctor, it's no different.

1138
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,300
So it's up to you.

1139
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:53,760
Gotcha.

1140
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,900
Anyway.

1141
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,740
Has anyone interrogated or synthesized overreaching concepts from

1142
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:04,040
the Greek capacitor layering of Wilhelm Reich, low

1143
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:08,040
to high principle or of Trevor, J.C.

1144
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,580
and the block wall idea from Ken Wheeler,

1145
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:14,440
particularly in relation to compression, layering and magnetism

1146
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,540
while applying these principles to the human body?

1147
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:19,740
Wow.

1148
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:20,000
Yeah.

1149
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,440
It's slow.

1150
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,220
They're all slow except for the block wall.

1151
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,560
I'm not familiar with Ken.

1152
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,240
I've looked at Ken Wheeler, not as much

1153
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:25,780
as others.

1154
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,080
Everybody cover your ears.

1155
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,100
I really can't stand him, but I like

1156
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,120
the work that he does.

1157
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,100
Yeah.

1158
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,100
So nothing too adverse.

1159
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,260
You know, I could put up with him,

1160
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,920
but I could tolerate because he's imparting a

1161
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,340
good message.

1162
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,400
But I'm not familiar with him doing any

1163
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,540
work with the block wall.

1164
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,940
He'll identify the block wall, but he doesn't

1165
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,020
do any work with it.

1166
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,240
I was going to say, nobody's got to

1167
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,680
like you, but they can take your information.

1168
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:52,820
Yeah.

1169
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,640
I'm the only one.

1170
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,540
I'm the only one that's working with the

1171
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:54,960
block wall.

1172
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,540
If I listened to Ken Wheeler about the

1173
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,020
block wall, I wouldn't do what I'm doing

1174
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:58,300
now.

1175
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,940
It had nothing to do with Ken Wheeler

1176
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,480
at all.

1177
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,020
Fair enough.

1178
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:01,940
Okay.

1179
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,020
So that kind of ends.

1180
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,620
In other words, everything.

1181
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,120
Yeah.

1182
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:08,540
Whatever I don't know about magnetism, Ken Wheeler

1183
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,820
knows, and whatever Ken Wheeler doesn't know about

1184
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,840
magnetism, I know.

1185
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:12,520
Wow.

1186
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:12,960
There you go.

1187
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,920
So if we put the two of you

1188
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,940
together, we got it covered.

1189
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,260
Oh, yeah.

1190
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:16,960
Yeah.

1191
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,300
You'll be building time machines and spaceships in

1192
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:19,659
no time.

1193
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,480
There you go.

1194
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,659
So, Greg, is there anything else on your

1195
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:22,920
mind?

1196
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,679
I'm hearing dogs all over the place.

1197
00:34:24,739 --> 00:34:26,400
Is there some particular happening?

1198
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:27,679
Yeah.

1199
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:28,199
I don't know.

1200
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:31,260
People, there's rentals about a block or two

1201
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:31,520
away.

1202
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,280
You know what happens.

1203
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,139
People move in, and they have dogs, and

1204
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:34,719
they move out.

1205
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,580
Then you don't have dogs anymore.

1206
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,639
It's about a block away.

1207
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,320
Okay.

1208
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,480
I live right in the middle of town,

1209
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:41,520
right in the center.

1210
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:44,100
If you folded the map laterally and then

1211
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,380
vertically and opened where the two creases intersect,

1212
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,860
that's exactly where I am.

1213
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:48,400
Wow.

1214
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,000
Interesting.

1215
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,739
And they didn't shut that area down.

1216
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:54,320
When they did the military thing, huh?

1217
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:55,440
No.

1218
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,620
It was more over about three miles to

1219
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,100
the west.

1220
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:58,780
Nice.

1221
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,400
Anyway, anything else on your mind tonight?

1222
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,200
Not much.

1223
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,000
It's getting the sun's going down.

1224
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,840
Maybe I'll go finish that cupola.

1225
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,160
C-U-P-O-L-A.

1226
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,520
It's like a vent that you put on

1227
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:09,980
your roof.

1228
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,220
If you put windows in it, it's called

1229
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,180
a widow's watch, right?

1230
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,180
It's on top of a roof.

1231
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:14,800
You climb up.

1232
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,800
It's a tower to look out.

1233
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,200
Right.

1234
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,680
But this is a venting tower.

1235
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,700
It's about, I don't know, two feet by

1236
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,440
two feet by two.

1237
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,760
It's almost like a cube shape with a

1238
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,580
little roof and four vent panels all around.

1239
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,120
And I'm holding it together to ventilate the

1240
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,740
attic space because I have two hatches that,

1241
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,780
incidentally, I left open overnight.

1242
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,040
And during the nighttime, there was no heat

1243
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:34,780
gain in the house.

1244
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,720
I was like, wow.

1245
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,180
So, I'm underventilated in the attic.

1246
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,700
So, I need to build a big ass

1247
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,120
cupola, put it in the middle, you know,

1248
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,160
where a good breeze can come through, right?

1249
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,880
You know, we're looking at, you know, like

1250
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,480
five or six square feet of opening, right,

1251
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,880
versus these little slots.

1252
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,260
And then, you know, I'll have a much

1253
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,520
more comfortable living space.

1254
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,740
And that's what I'm on the past day

1255
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,240
or two.

1256
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,400
There you go.

1257
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,260
Besides that food, clothing, shelter, you're still standing

1258
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:00,860
by that.

1259
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,220
Oh, of course.

1260
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:02,880
Of course.

1261
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,300
Look, if you pursue the best food and

1262
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:11,740
clothing and shelter in that order that you

1263
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,980
could possibly get being in this existence, you're

1264
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,160
going to find out a lot.

1265
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,500
I've had someone once say, that sounds really

1266
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:17,840
simple.

1267
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,700
I said, yeah, it sounds simple but to

1268
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,240
the wise, it will be like, wow, that's

1269
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,440
one hell of a pursuit, right?

1270
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,020
How do I get the best food, the

1271
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,320
best clothing, and the best shelter?

1272
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,840
You're going to run into just pretty much

1273
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,560
everything you could ever run into in this

1274
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:29,820
world.
