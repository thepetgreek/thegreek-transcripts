1
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,560
The sonic event 2-1-3 and this

2
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,500
is Rated Y so but you already know

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,180
that because the only way you get it

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,660
is by subscribing on Patreon.

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,240
Greek, how are you today?

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,400
Oh, that's a either a colloquial question good

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,260
to say I'm fine, but otherwise I'm doing

8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,860
okay fair to Midland actually too great depending

9
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:30,600
depending.

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,840
Yeah, mostly dishonest answers come out of that

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,640
question from people, you know, they just they

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,380
just respond out of reflex.

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,300
It's I can't yeah, how am I doing?

14
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,800
Well, let's say what am I doing?

15
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:41,460
Let's do it.

16
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,620
We're 213 times.

17
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,540
We've met already here.

18
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,380
All different lengths of all sorts just organically

19
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,460
banging out something.

20
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,580
I mean anywhere from two hours to 26

21
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:52,860
minutes.

22
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,560
I think they've been you know, so anyways,

23
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,140
you got you said you got a lot

24
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:57,760
of stuff, right?

25
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,460
Want to try to battle through it or

26
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,820
I do I'm going to get to everything

27
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,340
as quickly as possible.

28
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,200
So here's one.

29
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,540
I've read a small book from Michio Kushi.

30
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,660
Okay, Greek mentioned.

31
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,800
He's a very dogmatic about some things.

32
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,060
Okay.

33
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,480
What about cannabis?

34
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,560
Because he's really condemning it as a bad

35
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,520
substance in his book.

36
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,400
So what do you think of cannabis?

37
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,640
There's the question overall.

38
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,300
Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful plant depends on who's using

39
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,800
it and how you're using it because you

40
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,780
can go to the variety of hemp, which

41
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,220
is a superior fiber to the oils, which

42
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,440
are superior oils.

43
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,700
They are superior, you know, when certain oils

44
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,840
have a too low of a flashpoint to

45
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,540
cook with or go rancid or this or

46
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:43,740
that.

47
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,460
They have the entire hemp genre cannabis superior

48
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,800
oil extraction.

49
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,340
You can it can be eaten as a

50
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,440
supplement as an herb.

51
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,340
It can be smoked.

52
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,220
It's really a miracle.

53
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,480
It's a miracle plant.

54
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,380
Extremely versatile.

55
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,500
It also seems to filter out bad things.

56
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,100
You know, if you plant it around other

57
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,000
things, it seems to suck it up so

58
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,919
you can get rid of it and you

59
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,120
can just sort of burn it off if

60
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,400
you want.

61
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,740
Yeah, it adds nitrogen.

62
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,360
Sometimes it takes nitrogen.

63
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,240
So I would say that it's fine.

64
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,040
Now, if I smoke it, it turns me

65
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,440
into a piece of the furniture and I

66
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,800
prefer like, you know, the THC part and

67
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,160
there's a CBD and all that.

68
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,240
It turns me into a piece of the

69
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:26,640
furniture.

70
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,440
And whenever I feel its effects, I'm waiting

71
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,600
for it to wear off.

72
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,840
I'm more I feel better not doing it.

73
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:34,240
Right.

74
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,020
But that's me.

75
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:35,880
That's me.

76
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,600
But just like anything, too much is too

77
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:37,920
much.

78
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,000
And everybody's different.

79
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,780
You know, I mean, for me, it's any

80
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,340
amount, though.

81
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,400
Even taking a puff off of even back

82
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,140
in the back of the day, I did

83
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:46,760
a lot.

84
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,680
And even like when I was still in

85
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,840
bed, I'd reach over and grab a roach

86
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,580
in the ashtray and puff on it before

87
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,620
my feet touched the bed.

88
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,140
So I would start my day off.

89
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:56,400
Right.

90
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,040
You know what I mean?

91
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,540
Yeah, you're describing my teen years.

92
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,020
But go ahead.

93
00:02:59,100 --> 00:02:59,260
Yeah.

94
00:02:59,480 --> 00:02:59,840
Yeah.

95
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,220
Before I even got out of bed, you

96
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,980
know, you finished off, you know, as I

97
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,480
was going to sleep, I smoked.

98
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:05,980
Right.

99
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,000
So, yeah.

100
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,880
But then I realized, you know what, I'm

101
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,820
better off without it.

102
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,680
And one of the realizations was I was

103
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,980
with a band and we're like, oh, this

104
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,480
is really good.

105
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,400
We let's record.

106
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,300
And they recorded and it sounded so bad,

107
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,020
so incoherent.

108
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,160
Now, let's fast forward.

109
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,620
We'll get to the good part.

110
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,900
There was no good part.

111
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,820
It makes you think things sound amazing until

112
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,160
you stop, you know, feeling the effect is

113
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,140
what the fun part is.

114
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,700
And with musicians, I notice that all the

115
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,040
time.

116
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,200
But, you know, yeah, I think it's great.

117
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,520
You're like, oh, no, you're just not listening

118
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,800
to the part where we've got really good.

119
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,040
No, this is the best part.

120
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,960
No, it's terrible.

121
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,900
Stop getting high.

122
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,300
We were creative.

123
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,480
Where's the rest of the tape?

124
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,720
That is the whole tape.

125
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,380
Yeah, I know.

126
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,540
Anyway, on the topic of plant energy.

127
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,440
So otherwise the plant itself is wonderful.

128
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,040
But go ahead.

129
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:54,700
Sure.

130
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,140
On the topic of plant energies.

131
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,180
Now, somebody wrote a whole long thing about

132
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,380
how they've been doing observations based on the

133
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,780
ways that you've described plants and energetic motions

134
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,520
and how, you know, things dip and everything

135
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:05,720
else.

136
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,540
One interesting one is okra.

137
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,360
It is a prolific producer, can grow taller

138
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,380
than corn, although not ideal.

139
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,920
The flowers point vertically.

140
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,480
The fruits grow vertically.

141
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,200
Any fruit left on them dies, will stay

142
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,880
on the plant.

143
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,100
The dead plant will stay upright all winter.

144
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:23,840
Pods dry.

145
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,600
It's like a hollow stalk.

146
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:25,860
Yeah.

147
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,260
Like a sunflower almost.

148
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:27,620
Yeah.

149
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:27,900
Yeah.

150
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,800
So he's describing this and using the same

151
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,960
observations that you use with the plants and

152
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,400
just wanted you to know that somebody is

153
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,700
picking up on that part.

154
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,460
Well, that's good.

155
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,900
And also that real slimy mucus texture that's

156
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,900
inside the fruit, very similar to papaya seeds,

157
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,460
if you've ever or some melons, that real

158
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,080
slimy, heavy texture goes almost from like a

159
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,340
male, you know, semen texture to light, light,

160
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,640
like a thick liquid gel kind of stuff.

161
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,300
Whenever you see anything that has that, it

162
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,640
promotes vacuum in the body.

163
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,920
It's actually producing the stuff the body produces

164
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,540
to induce and protect itself from vacuum.

165
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,380
So, yeah, it's quite interesting.

166
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,980
So it can be used for healing.

167
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:12,480
It's very.

168
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,480
The only thing is, though, when you have

169
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,880
a plant that produces that slimy texture, papaya.

170
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,080
I recently got a big papaya, cut it

171
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,220
open and put it put it in the

172
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,560
blender, just papaya, a little juice juices itself.

173
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,200
It's really cool.

174
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,280
And you could drink it because there's no

175
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,160
fiber in it, really.

176
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,480
And I felt really good from that.

177
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,700
And but it gave me a little bit

178
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,620
of a sore upper intestine.

179
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,400
I did too much of it, I think.

180
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,480
But that when you when you clean the

181
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,420
seeds out, anything that has that slime like

182
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,460
okra, papaya was the two things I could

183
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,060
think of.

184
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,340
Melons kind of have it.

185
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,800
It depends if it's really ripe, it's dry

186
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,440
on the inside.

187
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,140
Right.

188
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,200
Like cantaloupe or whatever.

189
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,700
But typically, if you can get anything that

190
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,580
will that will induce and promote vacuum in

191
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:54,980
the body.

192
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,380
The only thing, though, is that it does

193
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,300
it very rapidly, almost too quick.

194
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,040
All right.

195
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,880
So you're better off, again, using something that

196
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,460
isn't so.

197
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,180
But let's say someone is losing vacuum.

198
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,720
Like, well, how do you diagnose that?

199
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:10,920
Right.

200
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,520
That papaya and okra or whatever supplement would

201
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,240
be good or fresh.

202
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,100
Anyway, I was going to say, why not

203
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,160
create a condiment out of the papaya, in

204
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,340
which case you could utilize it just a

205
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,600
little bit along with your food and then

206
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,600
you can take in a little bit.

207
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,400
And it's actually papaya and it's called but

208
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,820
you can buy papaya and it's a meat

209
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,180
tenderizer, which can be considered a condiment.

210
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,840
Well, I didn't know that, but I was

211
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,460
just thinking, why not create a condiment?

212
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:36,780
Sure.

213
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,660
It doesn't change.

214
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,860
One thing with these kinds of things that

215
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,680
like papaya and content in papaya, fresh papaya

216
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,220
is 100 times more potent than when you

217
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,100
dehydrate it.

218
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:50,820
Yeah.

219
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,920
So they synthesize it also.

220
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,380
So the crystal kind of looks like MSG,

221
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,760
almost like actually MSG is a very weird

222
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,380
looking crystal.

223
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,660
It almost looks toxic.

224
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:06,440
Yeah, it does.

225
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,460
I'm not taking notes.

226
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:12,300
I was thinking segue, but tangent.

227
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,840
If you look up the word economics, ecos

228
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,620
means house and nomosnomics means law.

229
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,380
And I was speaking to someone earlier about

230
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,180
all the ideas that I have, you know,

231
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,460
and why not do a small two or

232
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,700
three part series called microeconomics.

233
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,340
And I'll throw people off because when you

234
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,600
take economics, they think it has to do

235
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,320
with finance.

236
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,600
Well, it does.

237
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,880
It does as well, but very small.

238
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,220
Remember home economics, right?

239
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:36,400
Yeah.

240
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,300
And the terms macro and microeconomics do exist.

241
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,620
So you're going to have to redefine it

242
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,140
probably.

243
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,140
Yeah.

244
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,300
Microeconomics, basically when you're around your dwelling, covering

245
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,480
all the various subjects from cooking, cleaning, repairing,

246
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,840
maintaining hygiene, because, you know, the condition of

247
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,220
your dwelling is part of your hygiene.

248
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,480
Imagine walking into a dwelling place, apartment or

249
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,520
house, and you haven't met who lives there

250
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,940
yet, but the place is like a real

251
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:06,500
bad mess.

252
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,060
You don't say this person also has bad

253
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:09,820
hygiene, right?

254
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,300
But it's tied in.

255
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,300
You know, you can say that and be

256
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,020
pretty accurate.

257
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,800
Well, you don't expect a perfectly clean, absolutely

258
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,800
pristine person to walk out of a disaster

259
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,540
area like that.

260
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,580
That's what's true.

261
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:20,760
Yeah.

262
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,620
But typically a disaster, you know, grime and

263
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,240
stuff, you know, a really dirty car, dirty

264
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,900
house, also associates with the person's hygiene.

265
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,240
So microeconomics would be how to stay on

266
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,860
top of these things.

267
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,860
And one of the reasons I was bringing

268
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,940
this forward is because as our environment is

269
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,900
changing, you know, the simulation, let's say, the

270
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,059
way things are accredited to us.

271
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,300
Things that I did in the past, like,

272
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,820
you know, mow the lawn, fix this, paint

273
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,040
the fence, you know, just giving examples here,

274
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,920
sew up some pants you don't want to

275
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,020
throw away, repair some shoes, takes so long

276
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,560
to do now that it's almost not worth

277
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:58,880
doing.

278
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,300
It's like, why is this taking me so

279
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:00,580
long?

280
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,600
Why is it taking me half the afternoon

281
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,100
to repair these cargo pants that I like

282
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,980
where before I would just like to sit

283
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,540
around and do it in 15 minutes?

284
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:09,380
Why?

285
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,180
I mean, so things like even just cleaning

286
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:15,120
house takes so long to do comparatively, something's

287
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,720
going on in our reality, right?

288
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,100
So I wanted to maybe bring these things

289
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,300
forward so if other people are experiencing chores

290
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,900
and things that normally, you know, were done

291
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,920
automatically seem to take so long now, maybe

292
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,440
it would help.

293
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,200
So we'll just put that, you know, we'll

294
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,440
see if we get any feedback for the

295
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,940
microeconomics course.

296
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,920
We'll do it with you.

297
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,820
We'll do it right here.

298
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,340
It'll be available to whoever is on.

299
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,860
I'll go down a long list of things

300
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,740
to cover in your in your everyday surrounding

301
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,580
life, workplace, home and all that.

302
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,640
So let's go back to the questions.

303
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,000
So it could be, you know, the Greeks

304
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,800
on that class.

305
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,260
Literally.

306
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:47,800
All right.

307
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,100
Literally what is, but we may call it

308
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:50,940
microeconomics.

309
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,360
It's, you know, micro meaning close, right?

310
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,160
More small.

311
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,400
But it's either way.

312
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,040
I wouldn't feel bad about going to home

313
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,420
ec either.

314
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,340
Just just because it's shorthand and it would

315
00:09:59,340 --> 00:09:59,520
make.

316
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,620
I like home ec is better.

317
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,800
It probably explains more.

318
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,980
I think they stopped teaching that, though.

319
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,300
Or let's say part.

320
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,340
I don't think that's part of any curriculum

321
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:07,780
anymore.

322
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,860
It might be correct me if I'm wrong,

323
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,420
but I think it was done away with

324
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,000
a while back.

325
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,280
It may be a little more rare than

326
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,600
it used to be, sort of like civics

327
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,020
classes.

328
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,260
Anyways, it's interesting that Iran's leader gave 2040

329
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,560
as the end of Israel, which is also

330
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,460
the Phoenix year given by archaics.

331
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,960
In Iran, they display on one of the

332
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,540
main squares a countdown screen that goes all

333
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,040
the way to 2040.

334
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,520
Are you aware of this?

335
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,000
And what are your thoughts?

336
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,340
I wasn't aware of it, but you'll see

337
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,740
if you go and put in the what

338
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,060
happens in the year 2040.

339
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,780
I remember articles from MIT putting stuff out

340
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,100
that society, as you know, will end in

341
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:52,540
2040.

342
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,940
I knew that in 2005.

343
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,960
There was stuff in the 90s saying 2040

344
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,760
was the end of that.

345
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,740
So when archaics came out with this 2040,

346
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,780
I was like, oh, yeah, I've heard that

347
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,220
before.

348
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,220
The 2012 stuff was a fashion, right?

349
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,160
Everybody, you know, the only thing that would

350
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,420
happen after 2012 is 2013.

351
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,620
So and I told that to people because

352
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:16,340
the Mayan calendar can't be reckoned cross calendrically

353
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,220
with the Gregorian calendar.

354
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,580
There's no cross.

355
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,080
You know, there's no cross reckoning.

356
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,840
You have to do the counts independently.

357
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,520
And archaics gets into that.

358
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,760
If anybody's heard me before archaics came on

359
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,900
the scene, they know I was on board

360
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,100
with all that.

361
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,780
But not specifically the Phoenix.

362
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,500
I was not aware of the Phoenix other

363
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,420
than when he talked when I first heard

364
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,120
of him speaking on the Phoenix.

365
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,800
I said, oh, that's the great crossing that

366
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,500
I've read about.

367
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,320
There's a crossing that happens or an object

368
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,420
goes from north to south and also reading

369
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,200
Charles Fort.

370
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,460
But Charles Fort never showed a periodicity.

371
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,060
He just talked about the phenomenon.

372
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,760
So, no, it does.

373
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,400
It makes sense.

374
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,660
I do recall, though, reading an article a

375
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,480
long time ago at MIT Computer.

376
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,640
All right.

377
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,380
Calculated 2040 was the end of everything as

378
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,360
we know it at the end of, you

379
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:05,780
know, whatever.

380
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,780
And I was using biblical reckoning.

381
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,200
Nineteen ninety eight's end of time.

382
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,300
And you add thirty three and then you

383
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,300
add another three and a half to that.

384
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,480
So that would put us in the year

385
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,360
30, 20, 33, 20, 34 from biblical reckoning

386
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,800
that we have in the Middle East Union

387
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,700
or a lot of hoopla in the Middle

388
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,020
East.

389
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,900
That Middle East would be world focus and

390
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,220
dominance by starting in twenty twenty five.

391
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,740
That was my shtick on that from the

392
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,760
information I had.

393
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,380
So, no, I think it's brilliant.

394
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,980
I think the periodicity is more important because

395
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,540
when you what our brochures did by nailing

396
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,360
down the periodicity of one hundred thirty eight

397
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:44,700
years.

398
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,240
Right.

399
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,740
Is really what you need.

400
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,700
If something has a periodicity, find out what

401
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,180
it is.

402
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:50,460
Right.

403
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,660
So there's no guesswork.

404
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:51,960
Right.

405
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:52,420
Right.

406
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,700
So it's got a reoccurring time span.

407
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,780
Get to know that.

408
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,480
Yeah.

409
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:56,960
So you can.

410
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,060
Yeah, that's more.

411
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,840
That's, you know, like the bus schedule.

412
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,200
Right.

413
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,520
It might be a little early, a little

414
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,360
late, but, you know, it's coming at.

415
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,500
But generally speaking, it runs out right at

416
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,240
about the hour.

417
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,360
And, you know, it's you've got to be

418
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,840
there before the hour to make sure you

419
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,340
catch it.

420
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,240
And, you know, if you're a little bit

421
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,460
past the hour, you missed it.

422
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,360
I mean, that's kind of sticklers about getting

423
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,140
it out on time.

424
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,660
So I think it's a stickler thing, the

425
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,660
Phoenix 2040, I think.

426
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,400
But typically there are signs way before.

427
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,180
So we'll see that.

428
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,900
And yeah, we'll see.

429
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,880
I think as as year as more time

430
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,520
goes by, it'll be quite obvious, more obvious

431
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,460
what's happening.

432
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,120
But I think they're going to do an

433
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,480
artificial shutdown because they don't want to they

434
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,280
want to be in control.

435
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,040
So they'd rather say the end of society

436
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,860
happened in 2036 than 2040, because then they

437
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,240
did it.

438
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:45,500
Right.

439
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,480
You know, the ego thing.

440
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:46,760
Right.

441
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,460
So, yeah.

442
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,640
And plus, you don't want to do it

443
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,520
on even year because then it becomes more

444
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:50,880
obvious.

445
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,040
Yeah, they're going to try to shut it

446
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,280
down before the Phoenix comes, because, again, like

447
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,220
Brashear says, when they do reemerge after the

448
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,060
disaster, they don't want to see anyone with

449
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,300
any kind of advantage here.

450
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,480
They want to be able to come back

451
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,200
up and dominate.

452
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,240
So they want to disadvantage you before we

453
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,380
can you before the blow.

454
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,660
So it's funny.

455
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,020
It almost sounds like that nonsense Boogliosi invented

456
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,880
about Manson coming out of Death Valley with

457
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,380
his followers.

458
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,660
Anyway, Greek, can you tell a bit more

459
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:20,120
about how to diagnose the difference between circus

460
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,720
flu in quotes versus loss of vacuum?

461
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,960
I use circus flu as the example you

462
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,020
gave us about not feeling well.

463
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,920
I call it the circus flu.

464
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,980
Yeah, because it came on when my niece,

465
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,660
Wendy Blades, came to visit.

466
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,800
And the conditions I've explained of a traveling

467
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,420
circus.

468
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,680
Also, she's a blood relative.

469
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,060
Sister's daughter.

470
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:42,980
My sister's daughter.

471
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:43,280
Right.

472
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:43,660
Right.

473
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,600
Very close.

474
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,380
And it her frequency.

475
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,440
She was adapted to it.

476
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,020
I wasn't.

477
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,020
And it slammed me.

478
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,600
It's all frequency.

479
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,580
Of course, we, you know, hugged and kissed.

480
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:58,560
Right.

481
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,240
No exchange of bodily fluids, but close proximity.

482
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:01,960
Right.

483
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,660
Right.

484
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,620
Was enough.

485
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,500
And frequency.

486
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,400
And yeah.

487
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,800
But a loss of vacuum.

488
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,060
Okay.

489
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:08,900
Loss of vacuum.

490
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,140
Your body.

491
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,420
In order for a living thing to be

492
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:16,360
alive, it has to have a biological vacuum

493
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:16,840
induced.

494
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,900
Meaning an inward pressure, something that sucks things

495
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,000
together to hold them together by a negative

496
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,440
pressure.

497
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,280
And it's very slight, but it's biological.

498
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:26,680
Right.

499
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,020
When that goes, the thing starts to decompose,

500
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,500
where it doesn't matter if it's a bacteria,

501
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,100
plant, animal, human, fungus, whatever.

502
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,240
Once I shouldn't say fungus because fungus preserves

503
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,720
itself by becoming a crystal.

504
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,620
Because it's a crystalline form.

505
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,080
So fungus is an entirely different thing, which

506
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,000
would be a very good study because it

507
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,040
seems to be able to bypass the necessities

508
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,840
of the biological vacuum.

509
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,840
But what happened was with the circus flu,

510
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:55,240
it disturbed the body's ability to maintain the

511
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,960
biological vacuum, that the biological vacuum started to

512
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,980
deteriorate.

513
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,880
That's what poisons do.

514
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,000
So all the cells go into just like

515
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,840
you have these metronomes, you know, these things

516
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,440
that keep time, just like timing in an

517
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:09,840
engine.

518
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:15,600
You have mitochondria, external internal impulse, mitochondria inside

519
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,680
of the cell all the way to external

520
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,680
forces like nitrogen.

521
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,160
We're nitrogen breathers that require oxygen mixed with

522
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,440
the nitrogen in order for it to work.

523
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,500
We're not oxygen breathers.

524
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,040
Remember when NASA, they gave them oxygen, everyone

525
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,540
got sick.

526
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,720
You get pneumonia if you just get oxygen.

527
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,200
We're actually nitrogen breathers that requires a percentage

528
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,660
of oxygen for it to work.

529
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:40,080
So because we convert the nitrogen to oxygen

530
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,740
in the body with a catalyst of some

531
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,100
oxygen.

532
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,660
So all these influences, it's not one thing.

533
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,260
See, we still have the mentality that you

534
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,040
take this pill or this antidote or this

535
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,620
and that's it.

536
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,820
It's a very complex system if you don't

537
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,540
understand it.

538
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,680
The only thing is when you do understand

539
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,280
it, it's simple to you, but complex to

540
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,060
those who don't again.

541
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:00,440
Right.

542
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,780
So there's someone who understands this biological vacuum.

543
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,339
And here's the thing.

544
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,640
I have people in the field say in

545
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,560
medical field and biology say, Greek, you're the

546
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,760
only one talking about or emphasizing the biological

547
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,220
vacuum.

548
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,540
Hey, I'm not saying you're wrong.

549
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:14,960
I'm just saying you're the only one like

550
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,280
there's something wrong with that.

551
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:16,540
Right.

552
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,680
So by looking at it, it requires timing.

553
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,619
Like, for example, when you have a timing

554
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:25,040
chain or a timing belt that turns the

555
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,480
cams on an engine, if you don't know

556
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,780
anything about it, you can look this up

557
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,680
and see how it makes sense.

558
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,040
The teeth on the teeth on the cogs

559
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,280
for the cam have to be exact, exact

560
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,620
fit on the chain.

561
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,580
You know, it's called TDC, top dead center.

562
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,520
Everything has to be aligned perfectly.

563
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,680
If you're off by one tooth, it's hard.

564
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,180
You know, you might look like you have

565
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,440
everything aligned.

566
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,140
But if you don't check those timing marks,

567
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,020
that's how I work is slightly.

568
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,120
Obviously, I think it's on that.

569
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,360
It's not one tooth off.

570
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,840
The engine will run rough, really rough.

571
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,440
It'll vibrate.

572
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,940
So it's it's a timing thing.

573
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,360
It's a pulsation thing.

574
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,780
Well, almost almost anybody who was a kid

575
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,260
and had a bicycle would also identify with

576
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,520
the same problem with the chain.

577
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,900
The second you bend a part of the

578
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,320
sprocket.

579
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,480
I mean, it's a nightmare.

580
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:09,860
Right.

581
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,680
Well, yeah, yeah.

582
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,860
But the timing, what I mean by that,

583
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,240
see the poisons in the body like that

584
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,200
you can administer to kill someone like cyanide,

585
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,240
arsenic, things like that.

586
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,620
Yeah, it goes after the cells ability to

587
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,580
produce phosphorus.

588
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:24,680
Right.

589
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,600
That's what they say.

590
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,340
Chemically, it's partially true.

591
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,340
And there's an ignition cycle inside the cells.

592
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,660
And if you disturb that, I believe all

593
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:37,420
these these things act as engines to keep

594
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,920
the biological vacuum going.

595
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,600
And it's not necessarily a force, but it's

596
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,810
a force when it's in motion.

597
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,100
In other words, once once it gets going

598
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,460
and it's in balance, you have what's called

599
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,180
a very fit or healthy organism.

600
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,290
Anything to disturb any anything in that clockwork.

601
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,000
Right.

602
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,480
And the simplest example of that is when

603
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,240
you break the skin, you've breached the vacuum

604
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,320
and the body right away gets the signal

605
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,820
to send fluids and swelling and all that

606
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,440
to stop it.

607
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:05,680
Right.

608
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,080
But the circus flu and the vacuum is

609
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,760
a very I don't see a direct correlation.

610
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,180
But, yes, that's what it would do.

611
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,860
I've coined it the circus.

612
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,360
Actually, that would be interesting.

613
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,260
You know, we can we've coined a lot

614
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:16,680
of stuff.

615
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,260
You know, the last thing I remember going

616
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,700
on a tangent here again is when you

617
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,660
see stuff and it looks fake and I

618
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:27,120
call the aftertaste, you know, so the circus

619
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,120
flu could be something that might sound too

620
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,140
comical for people.

621
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,820
But that that's that comes from pure induction.

622
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:34,460
Right.

623
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,380
So, yeah.

624
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,020
All right.

625
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,100
I can get it.

626
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,540
You know, I've got a lot of thoughts

627
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,180
on these things and anything, you know, the

628
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,540
biological vacuum, because I'm actually working on it

629
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,360
and researching it.

630
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,980
And anything, any question on it will actually

631
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,300
let you know where I'm at with my

632
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:48,700
research.

633
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,040
Also, I kind of give it away.

634
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:52,340
Yeah.

635
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,540
So anyway, it's a big field and and

636
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,420
I've been getting some messages of some people

637
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,180
looking into it.

638
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,700
But we're in a culture that completely denies

639
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:01,840
it.

640
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,020
You know, I said, if you ask, check

641
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,780
GPT, is the body under a biological vacuum?

642
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,100
It clearly says no.

643
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,760
And then comma, there is a pressure in

644
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,540
the body that, you know, it's like, oh,

645
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,240
my gosh.

646
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,160
Yeah.

647
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:16,840
Well, anyway, look, there's a lot more to

648
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,560
get to anyhow.

649
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,660
Look, you've got somebody who lives in Southeast

650
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,140
Asia.

651
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:20,640
All right.

652
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,480
And they describe something called D.E.N

653
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,060
.G.U.E. Not sure how to pronounce

654
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:25,780
that properly.

655
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,880
Fever, which is caused by mosquito bites now.

656
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,340
Yeah.

657
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:29,880
Yeah.

658
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:30,700
Yeah.

659
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,180
Fever that dogs get that pets get that

660
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:33,540
here.

661
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,780
Well, yeah.

662
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,040
Well, they're concerned about getting it there because

663
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,580
it causes chronic problems.

664
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,340
It's pretty painful.

665
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:39,800
All that.

666
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,420
OK, so do you know anything of this

667
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,340
type of illness?

668
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,900
It looks like there are no preventative measures.

669
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,840
You find out only when you get it.

670
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,980
What would you take in this case?

671
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,140
OK, we're baking soda help or something like

672
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:53,640
that.

673
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,400
The best thing is find out what the

674
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,560
people who are, quote unquote, an air quotes

675
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,360
immune to it or don't have it that

676
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,860
are near places that you could get it

677
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,120
and eat what they eat.

678
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,480
Like, for example, the water in the Ganges

679
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,420
River, you know, people use for drinking water

680
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:12,360
and you'll see people defecating in it and

681
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,720
dead bodies floating in it.

682
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:13,940
Right.

683
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,800
But they don't get sick because if you

684
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,200
look at what they eat, they have these

685
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,900
intense curries and intense herbs that they eat

686
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,960
in the Indian diet.

687
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,480
So if you're going to go there and

688
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,460
find out where the gangue fever is prevalent

689
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,040
and what the people that are in that

690
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,540
prevalent zone eat and eat that before you

691
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:32,940
go there.

692
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,240
OK, well, this person lives there and seems

693
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,800
to say that, like, it's just not preventable

694
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,740
for people there.

695
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:40,800
Oh, I see.

696
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,780
So it might be outbreaks and things like

697
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,140
that.

698
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,960
Baking soda, definitely, because that would change your

699
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,160
frequency big time.

700
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,680
And they asked about them as well.

701
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:48,960
So.

702
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:50,720
I don't know.

703
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:50,900
Yeah.

704
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,280
That's experimental.

705
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,860
It's experimental.

706
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,860
But I would definitely do the baking soda

707
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,420
water.

708
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,600
OK, I would do I would do also

709
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,800
the quinine water, you know, the tonic water,

710
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,600
the tonic with the quinine in it.

711
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,520
OK, yeah.

712
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,400
Yeah.

713
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,100
And I would do I would do whatever

714
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,540
local citrus is there.

715
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,040
Incorporate that into my diet.

716
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:12,600
Also good.

717
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,920
I have small various varieties of limes and

718
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,380
citrus.

719
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:18,140
Yeah, that quinine tonic water is also good

720
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,380
for cramping in the lower in the in

721
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,120
the lower legs and stuff like that, too.

722
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:22,420
It helps.

723
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,400
And also learn how to make the aqueous

724
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,220
Argentum.

725
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,720
You know, it's basically it's not colloidal.

726
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,980
So sorry, not colloidal silver because there's no

727
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:30,800
silver content.

728
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,500
But you use a one volt battery single

729
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,860
cell with silver to make it put it

730
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,020
in the water for just a minute.

731
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,000
Yeah, I put a few people together about

732
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,400
that and I haven't heard back yet.

733
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,420
Hopefully there'll be some stuff and gave the

734
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,140
schematic which you passed to me.

735
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,080
Anyways, question number two from the same person.

736
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,760
I heard the Greek saying many times that

737
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,820
he enjoys kratom.

738
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,500
I also like it a lot, but I

739
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,420
have a hard time dealing with the taste.

740
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,620
Do you have any good recipes to make

741
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,200
the kratom more tasty?

742
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,080
One time I was at a bar in

743
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,760
Thailand where they mix it with ginger, lemon

744
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,680
and sparkling water and it tasted very delicious.

745
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,720
You could do it that way.

746
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,160
What I do is I have a small

747
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,820
wooden spoon.

748
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,580
It would be comparable to a quarter of

749
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:12,960
a teaspoon.

750
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,280
OK, and I just slam that in the

751
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,320
mouth and then immediately have something to wash

752
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,540
it down with something warm like coffee or

753
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:19,860
tea.

754
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:23,000
Don't do soda or juice with it.

755
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,380
It turns absolutely rancid, you know, because of

756
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:25,840
the acid.

757
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,220
It's very alkaline.

758
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:27,440
Right.

759
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:27,820
So.

760
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,240
So water, warm water.

761
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,220
Definitely.

762
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,280
I've tried other ways and definitely for me

763
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,280
is just slam a little bit of powder

764
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,460
in the mouth and wash it down with

765
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,260
a body or room temperature liquid.

766
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:44,000
That's not acidic like a tea or a

767
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,500
coffee team.

768
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,480
That's that's not hot, obviously.

769
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,960
Yeah, because you have to slam it.

770
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,780
Otherwise you got a mouthful of powder.

771
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,860
That's the way I like to do it.

772
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,080
Yeah.

773
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:53,620
Yeah.

774
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,320
I don't like to have it mixed in

775
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,000
whatever.

776
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,560
If you mix it in any kind of

777
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,660
a juice or a soda or something that

778
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:03,280
has, you know, the acid and the citrus,

779
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:06,060
it nullifies it because it's it's an alkaline.

780
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,280
Fair enough.

781
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,460
And nobody wants a mouthful of powder or

782
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,180
muddy powder.

783
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,380
Anyways, if someone was to get a loan

784
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:17,360
from a private trust, would the holder of

785
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,840
that trust be able to access the borrower's

786
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,000
line of credit?

787
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,080
It depends on the what access, if the

788
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,600
trust is set up as an intermediary, meaning

789
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,180
a banker.

790
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:32,940
All right.

791
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,580
If they're an intermediary, they have access to

792
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,900
the O.C. 10 or an O.C.

793
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:39,060
7 operating Circular 10, which is a window

794
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,920
of the Federal Reserve or an operating Circular

795
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,020
7, which is different.

796
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,400
You know, it depends.

797
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,620
A trust is a trust.

798
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,160
You know, I mean, everything is in trust.

799
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,240
If I hand someone five bucks to go

800
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,220
to the store, someone asks them, do you

801
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:51,600
have any money?

802
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,140
They say no.

803
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,440
And they sit there, they have five bucks.

804
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,240
They say, I have no money.

805
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:54,940
Well, it's not mine.

806
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,280
You see.

807
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,060
So trust is very, very wide thing.

808
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,300
But if they if they're an intermediary, like,

809
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,140
you know, with a license or permission to

810
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:06,060
do so from all the securities agencies and

811
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:06,880
the Federal Reserve.

812
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,840
Yeah, they can access your line of credit,

813
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,240
but they usually can't do it with just

814
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,020
your name.

815
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,820
They what they would do is they would

816
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,420
negotiate whatever you give them.

817
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,540
But to access a line of credit, they

818
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,920
would you would have to give them some

819
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,560
kind of a credit number, like a Social

820
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,600
Security number, and they'd have to have access

821
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,200
to the window.

822
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,560
So the general answer to the question is

823
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:33,040
no, because of insufficient details.

824
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,580
All righty.

825
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,180
Somebody asked for you and me to pick

826
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:43,240
two songs, a piece that that we appreciate

827
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:43,980
most.

828
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,120
And just easy.

829
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,080
Yeah, good.

830
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,700
What I could do one I've been listening

831
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,580
to a lot lately.

832
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,880
Band on the run.

833
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:51,780
Paul McCartney.

834
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,260
That song is about the simulation.

835
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,940
It's like, oh, stuck in these four walls.

836
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,960
Here we go again.

837
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,320
Mom.

838
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,040
All right.

839
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,060
You see his mom again and trying to

840
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,880
break out, you know, the jailer and the

841
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,940
sailor and the right and the judge.

842
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,400
And here we go crashing into the sun.

843
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,780
The rain crashes into the sun.

844
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,640
Hope you're having fun.

845
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,060
All this stuff.

846
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:13,320
Yeah.

847
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,940
Breaking out of this reality.

848
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:15,800
Here we go again.

849
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,380
Kind of thing.

850
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,900
Oh, clearly banned on the run.

851
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,520
Listen to the lyrics of that.

852
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,300
Holy shit.

853
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,780
And then it would be listening to a

854
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,340
lot lately over and over is two albums.

855
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,040
One is Physical Graffiti and Houses of the

856
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,440
Holy, both from Led Zeppelin.

857
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:32,160
Those are more than just two songs, but

858
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,440
band on the run, man.

859
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,960
Another one that's good if you're feeling like

860
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,940
nitty gritty boots to the ground here.

861
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,080
It's Bruce Springsteen Badlands, probably the best song

862
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:41,760
he's ever done.

863
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:47,080
But, yeah, that's for that genre.

864
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:51,380
See, for me, any music that sounds good

865
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:51,840
is good.

866
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,760
The genre is irrelevant, but I've just gave

867
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,480
out what I've been very impressed with lately

868
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,360
is band on the run.

869
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,400
Listen to, you know, you just put in

870
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,360
band on the run song and look at

871
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,120
the read the lyrics.

872
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,800
You're like, oh, my gosh, that's about breaking

873
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,320
out of here.

874
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,340
You know, keep you keep being sent back

875
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,820
here and these guys break out and it

876
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,040
pisses off the authorities because you broke out.

877
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:11,240
Right.

878
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:11,940
Right.

879
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,840
So, yeah, that's really good.

880
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,060
And again, Houses of the Holy album and

881
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,820
Physical Graffiti album.

882
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,080
Yeah, Led Zeppelin.

883
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,620
I'm a little bit different than you, obviously.

884
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,540
Look, I appreciate a lot of stuff by

885
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:27,800
Motorhead and Black Sabbath.

886
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,860
My favorite song is Under the Sun.

887
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,820
And take a listen to it.

888
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,720
You'll figure out why.

889
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,920
But also, I got to tell you, I

890
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,780
have a great appreciation for Alice in Chains

891
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,000
in general.

892
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,300
Previous Alice in Chains, not the new stuff.

893
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,560
And Rage Against the Machine.

894
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:45,700
I like them.

895
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,980
It's very interesting.

896
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:47,760
It's like a fusion.

897
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,360
And I appreciate it.

898
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,400
And, you know, the message is.

899
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,420
I used to, when I did bicycle racing,

900
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,520
I got into mountain bike racing.

901
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:58,300
I put rage in the machine riding off

902
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:58,880
road, you know.

903
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,400
You took the fear away.

904
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,720
Here's the thing about fear.

905
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,840
People talk, don't have fear.

906
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,640
It's stupid.

907
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,800
It's OK to have fear, but don't let

908
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,120
the fear disable you.

909
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,720
And can you operate at your best and

910
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,900
still be in fear?

911
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,160
You know, people say don't fear.

912
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,100
That is a terrible thing to say to

913
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,260
people because it makes them.

914
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,540
That is that's what the collect that's what

915
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,260
they put out to the collective to disable

916
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:23,580
you.

917
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,140
Right.

918
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,200
Don't have any fear.

919
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:25,980
Right.

920
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,600
It's can you operate under fear?

921
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,800
And I think Rage Against the Machine is

922
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,380
something that helps you operate under fear.

923
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:32,860
Yeah.

924
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:33,720
But here's the thing.

925
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,940
I think it's great to punch straight through

926
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:36,320
it.

927
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,080
You know, do not allow it to dictate

928
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,980
your actions.

929
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,400
It just yeah.

930
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,440
No matter how fearful you are, you can

931
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,340
still function.

932
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,440
Yeah, absolutely.

933
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:45,320
Yeah.

934
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:45,940
Anyway.

935
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,020
OK, this is an odd question for us,

936
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:50,700
but here we go.

937
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,280
Why are they demonizing the white race?

938
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,260
Oh, that that's happened before.

939
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,000
OK, these these things go in cycles.

940
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:03,580
They just read about was it Morgenthau?

941
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,460
And who was it who wrote the pastoral

942
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:09,200
policy for Germany that Germany should be turned

943
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:09,940
into a pasture?

944
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,960
And all the German people eliminated.

945
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,120
Oh, right.

946
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,160
And the Huns and they used to be

947
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:15,860
the Huns.

948
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,320
The white people were called the Huns.

949
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,380
So there was posters throughout the US during

950
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:22,760
World War Two.

951
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,680
Let's let's go fight the Huns.

952
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,980
Well, that's what they called the Germans.

953
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:26,300
Yeah.

954
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:26,900
Yeah.

955
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:27,660
Yeah.

956
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:28,680
Yeah.

957
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,560
Which is really weird.

958
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,180
It's really an anti-Aryan, anti-German thing,

959
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,600
more than anti-white thing.

960
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,520
Which is crazy because Attila the Hun, according

961
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,400
to historians at the time, was right here

962
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,320
and seven feet tall.

963
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,340
They didn't know what race he was.

964
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,960
They looked at him and went, we don't

965
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,260
know where the hell this guy came from,

966
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:44,520
even.

967
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,200
And they live on the backs of horses,

968
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:46,920
these Huns.

969
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,480
Yeah, that's what they told us, because if

970
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,900
you start if you get too much stuff,

971
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,600
you connect the dots and get a sense

972
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,380
of real history.

973
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:54,680
Right.

974
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,400
Yeah, of course.

975
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,580
Breshears, right now, I think Breshears is at

976
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,100
the top of the mountain with that.

977
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,980
He's putting out some really good stuff, you

978
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,500
know, archaics for history and all that.

979
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:03,780
Yeah.

980
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:05,420
OK.

981
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,960
So here's here's one.

982
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,620
I hate this question.

983
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,440
I'm just going to read it.

984
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,060
Hi, Greg.

985
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,960
After the Christ laid down his life and

986
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,820
was resurrected, do you think that it gave

987
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:18,160
the higher level gods no reason to interact

988
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,600
with man as they did in ancient times?

989
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:21,440
Yeah.

990
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,320
Yeah, absolutely.

991
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,600
I think that did.

992
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:24,280
OK.

993
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:24,660
Yeah.

994
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,240
We're living in a quiet time and the

995
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:27,880
quiet time.

996
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,340
There's many quiet times that we've gone through.

997
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,820
This is a quiet time.

998
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:33,520
OK.

999
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,160
When you say the war is for meeting

1000
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:36,740
a quota.

1001
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:39,880
Are you talking just as a money making

1002
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,800
racket for the military industrial complex?

1003
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,240
Or is there also a killing quota, too?

1004
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,700
Killing quota.

1005
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:46,320
OK.

1006
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:52,900
Also, why didn't you use a neodymium magnet

1007
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,300
in the scalarator?

1008
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,300
OK.

1009
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,040
Like Ken Wheeler.

1010
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,680
I think somebody's busting your chops, but go

1011
00:30:59,680 --> 00:30:59,780
ahead.

1012
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,160
Yeah.

1013
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,120
Neodymium are really strong.

1014
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,160
They give you because they're very high density,

1015
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,160
which means that it's the same amount of

1016
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:10,660
magnetism in a much smaller area.

1017
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:11,580
Right.

1018
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:15,660
And we don't want that because, first of

1019
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,560
all, we're not even using the magnetism.

1020
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:21,500
We're using the the block what's known as

1021
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,540
the block wall, which is the potential.

1022
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,640
That's where the two parts of what people

1023
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,540
refer to as magnetism.

1024
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,980
The poles, which are not poles, is a

1025
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,120
vortex going right through it.

1026
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,480
But we don't use that.

1027
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:41,900
So we need that that extension from a

1028
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,260
less dense field.

1029
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,180
Now, the neodymium, because it has a higher

1030
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:51,220
dielectric property, even though it's a metal, it's

1031
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,120
a centered metal.

1032
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,920
It does have more magnetism as well as

1033
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,680
higher density.

1034
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,460
And it just doesn't work as well as

1035
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,880
a ceramic with a lower density because we

1036
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,360
need that.

1037
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,340
We're not looking to have a small magnet

1038
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,500
that could lift anything or use.

1039
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,260
We're not looking for the magnetic part.

1040
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:10,980
That's the thing.

1041
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:11,460
Right.

1042
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,480
I assure you, I'm the other than a

1043
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,780
couple of people that do.

1044
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:17,920
What are those catskin that catskin MRIs?

1045
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,260
I was just going to say, what you

1046
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,660
don't need is the MRI giant, what they

1047
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,660
call a monster magnet.

1048
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,000
Right.

1049
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,260
Yeah, there's no there's no one discussing the

1050
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:25,640
block wall.

1051
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,880
The only reason they don't even know what

1052
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,720
the block wall is.

1053
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,980
They just they just discuss it because that's

1054
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:30,840
where the transmission.

1055
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,440
That's the that's how they define, you know,

1056
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:36,100
where they're going to overlap and focus getting

1057
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:36,640
their images.

1058
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,400
That's the break the for them.

1059
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,080
It's just a break where the field changes.

1060
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:41,460
Right.

1061
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,300
They don't understand how to use it.

1062
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,820
And that's why I'm talking publicly.

1063
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,440
There's nothing.

1064
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:49,380
I'm the only one that's emphasizing the use

1065
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,140
of the block wall bar none, period, in

1066
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:52,940
the world right now.

1067
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,580
I enjoy monster magnet, the band as well.

1068
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,920
Back to that question about music.

1069
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:57,420
But anyway.

1070
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:57,900
Yeah.

1071
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,460
But the reason we don't use the NEOs

1072
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,620
is because the density pulls everything in too

1073
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,000
close.

1074
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,680
And we want it to extend out further

1075
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,460
into the flow.

1076
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,260
Because remember, using it to treat water, which

1077
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,560
is incredible, by the way.

1078
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,180
I don't think I've gone into too much

1079
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,200
detail on it lately.

1080
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,320
But I had it sent to someone, a

1081
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,180
lab in Louisiana.

1082
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,680
And I was like, you know, I kind

1083
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,980
of get a weird feeling.

1084
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,800
This is, you know, let's send it to

1085
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,340
my house.

1086
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,120
I think I don't know if I said

1087
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:25,880
this on the Sonic.

1088
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,620
And it was a Tuesday and I sent

1089
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,240
it priority.

1090
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,600
So it should get there on a Thursday

1091
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,100
from Tucson to Lake Charles, Louisiana.

1092
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:34,600
Right.

1093
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,600
But anyway, I checked tracking.

1094
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,680
So it leaves Tucson that night.

1095
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,080
Next day it's in Houston.

1096
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,380
And then it goes from one place to

1097
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:42,700
Houston.

1098
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,640
It goes to Austin.

1099
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,540
Then it goes to Dallas on Thursday or

1100
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:45,980
Friday.

1101
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,800
Then it goes back and then it goes

1102
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,860
finally goes to Louisiana.

1103
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:49,620
I'm like, wait a second.

1104
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,180
Supposed to be delivered Thursday.

1105
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,440
It's the weekend.

1106
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,720
It's still in Texas moving around.

1107
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:57,860
And it gets delivered to this person's house

1108
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:00,420
at Sunday at five o'clock p.m.

1109
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:00,740
Right.

1110
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:01,780
Who the hell gets mail?

1111
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,040
And I said, listen, you know, please photograph

1112
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,520
the box.

1113
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,820
I want to see if it's been tampered

1114
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,900
or anything because I'll do better.

1115
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,620
I'll do a video.

1116
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,280
So I did an unboxing video and it

1117
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:12,600
wasn't.

1118
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:14,719
It just everything was exactly like I had

1119
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,280
packed it.

1120
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,659
And I didn't put any kind of a

1121
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:19,219
trip in there or anything to see, you

1122
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:21,040
know, because you know how years ago you

1123
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,360
put a string on top of your door

1124
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,440
to see if someone's come in.

1125
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:23,679
Right.

1126
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,159
Oh, yeah.

1127
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:24,500
Yeah.

1128
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:26,340
So I didn't do anything like that.

1129
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,340
But it was pretty much whatever.

1130
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,800
But I hear at the post office, they

1131
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,800
have these small needles that they randomly penetrate

1132
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,699
packages with.

1133
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,420
That's why they keep asking, you know, liquids,

1134
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:34,960
no liquids.

1135
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:35,300
Right.

1136
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,620
And it sniffs and then it just sniffs

1137
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,080
it and it doesn't really get reviewed.

1138
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:41,380
It just goes on file, you know, just

1139
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,620
like all of our conversations.

1140
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,480
Transcripts are being made and they don't really

1141
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:44,960
get reviewed.

1142
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,980
They just be put away, you know, maybe

1143
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,239
randomly get reviewed.

1144
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:51,500
Well, they're stacked in a database somewhere.

1145
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,659
So what I presumed happened is they probably

1146
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:57,220
broke out one of these new two million

1147
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,820
dollar X-ray machines and it was a

1148
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,240
little too close and blew up the X

1149
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:00,760
-ray machine.

1150
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,100
That's what I'm presuming.

1151
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,620
That's why it didn't get there.

1152
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,480
I didn't make a stink about it.

1153
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:06,860
It should.

1154
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,040
You know, I paid postage to get it.

1155
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,800
They're always priority two days and it didn't

1156
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,400
get there till Sunday at five o'clock.

1157
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,220
I didn't get back to the post office.

1158
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:15,940
What's the delay?

1159
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,580
I was just watching it on the tracking.

1160
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,420
I thought it was funny.

1161
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,720
It was kind of like one of those

1162
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,580
wily coyote maps, you know, and a roadrunner.

1163
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,500
That's what it looked like.

1164
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,920
And so I just wanted to put this

1165
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,020
out publicly because I don't think I have

1166
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:29,520
before.

1167
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,680
It's it's been quite an adventure working with

1168
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:31,920
this.

1169
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,480
Yeah.

1170
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:35,420
And I've watched stuff disappear and reappear in

1171
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,260
tracking before.

1172
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,120
It's funny.

1173
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,020
And in Georgia, I'll let you know that

1174
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,140
they do have these weird Sunday night late

1175
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,920
deliveries, but only mail that they've monitored or

1176
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,060
redirected in some way.

1177
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,880
So further on, one of the labs, I

1178
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,440
kept asking them, how's this fantastic result?

1179
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,860
So we'll send me something in writing or

1180
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:52,340
a lab, right?

1181
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:52,960
You do reports.

1182
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,440
We will finally get back to him and

1183
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,920
say, oh, we don't have it anymore.

1184
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,560
It's in our other lab in Illinois.

1185
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,300
And I'm like, what?

1186
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,020
OK, so I call them.

1187
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,240
They're like, well, what do you plan on?

1188
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,060
So you got a report.

1189
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:03,880
We'll get your report.

1190
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,080
By the way, this is a couple of

1191
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,320
months ago and they still haven't gotten me

1192
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:06,780
a report.

1193
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,140
And I said, what do you what are

1194
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,440
you planning on doing for post-preparation after

1195
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,220
the water goes through?

1196
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,060
So what do you mean post-preparation after

1197
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,020
the water goes through?

1198
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,380
I said, don't you know?

1199
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,460
I said, what, what, what?

1200
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,200
He says, well, we have our control samples,

1201
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,820
which didn't go through the scalar.

1202
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,380
Then the water that went through the scalar.

1203
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:24,960
I said, yeah.

1204
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,140
And he says, you know that after about

1205
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:30,080
48 to 72 hours, you have precipitants in

1206
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,820
the in the test samples.

1207
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,940
So in other words, you see these jars,

1208
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,220
three jars that didn't go.

1209
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,740
The same water didn't go through.

1210
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,680
And the three jars where the water went

1211
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:38,920
through.

1212
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,540
Stuff starts to come out of the water

1213
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,120
and settle at the bottom of the jar.

1214
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,320
I was like, oh, my gosh.

1215
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,260
So it's actually the water puts the water

1216
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,820
in a mode where the water starts to

1217
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:48,620
clean itself.

1218
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,000
That's interesting.

1219
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:50,820
Yeah.

1220
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,880
That's why they were wondering.

1221
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,540
I say, what do you propose to do

1222
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,160
for that post-preparation?

1223
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,600
You know, for the stuff that falls on

1224
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,640
us, I never knew it did that.

1225
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,300
I just put it on homes.

1226
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,640
So we have excellent water.

1227
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,260
I don't capture the water later and see

1228
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,680
stuff, you know, for three, four days.

1229
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,700
What falls out of it, you know, never

1230
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,160
knew that.

1231
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,640
So that's why that's cool to go to

1232
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,100
a lab.

1233
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:09,360
Right.

1234
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,940
Now you can and can discover something occasionally

1235
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:12,480
through the.

1236
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:12,960
Yeah.

1237
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,720
So I didn't know it did that.

1238
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,940
So there's this huge potential for that, you

1239
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,500
know, for many, many different things.

1240
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,400
And it's it puts the water in a

1241
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,280
state way beyond what's considered to be H2O.

1242
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,920
Water is not H2O at all.

1243
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,020
It's fooled.

1244
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,740
Everyone's been fooled by that.

1245
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,840
You can even ask chat GPT.

1246
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,940
Water is not H2O.

1247
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,320
So, yeah, water is not H2O.

1248
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:35,100
But for chemical description, that's what we use.

1249
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,500
Make a long story short, not getting into

1250
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,560
it, it does still learning about what it

1251
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:40,840
does.

1252
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,840
And it just increases the quality of the

1253
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,140
water, just like if you're not feeling well,

1254
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,420
you're not going to do stuff around the

1255
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:46,620
house.

1256
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,140
But if you're really fit and you do

1257
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,620
and you're doing well, you're probably going to

1258
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,160
do more.

1259
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,220
And the water is that way.

1260
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,620
It puts the water at a higher level

1261
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,160
of fitness.

1262
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,760
And one thing that I've been telling people

1263
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,080
lately is anyone wants to get into water

1264
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,800
healing spas, you don't have to travel to

1265
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,040
these places where they have, you know, these

1266
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,480
movies, natural spas and take a bath to

1267
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,100
get rid of your skin disorders or muscle

1268
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,080
or joint disorders.

1269
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,220
You've heard stories, right?

1270
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:11,480
Yeah.

1271
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,160
And some what some of those springs are

1272
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:13,800
pretty good.

1273
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,020
I mean, they are.

1274
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,660
But now you can you can you can

1275
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,280
do it yourself.

1276
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,500
If you set up the sclerator right anywhere,

1277
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,440
you set up anyone who has one.

1278
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:24,200
If you fill a bathtub, the water looks

1279
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,260
blue, turns blue.

1280
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:28,120
Just just with the lights on or low,

1281
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:28,700
it doesn't matter.

1282
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,320
Oh, yeah.

1283
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,160
With certain light, the world.

1284
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,540
So, no, I'm talking about any light.

1285
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,940
The water starts to look like tiny bowl

1286
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:34,420
blue.

1287
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:35,840
I've gotten pictures.

1288
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,660
People who had the scars and look at

1289
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,000
the water.

1290
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:38,880
Look how blue it is.

1291
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,920
I'm like, yeah, it shows up in the

1292
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,680
picture really well.

1293
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,820
How does it look in real life?

1294
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:42,640
It's just like that.

1295
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,780
I'm like, perfect.

1296
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,100
Yeah.

1297
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,820
So where if you don't run it through

1298
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:49,060
the scale, you get this grayish, you know,

1299
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:49,600
a tap water.

1300
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,880
Looks like, you know, blah.

1301
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:52,460
Right.

1302
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,700
So it looks dirty even when it's clean.

1303
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,660
OK, so can you please ask the Greek

1304
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:01,120
if he has any thoughts on gene keys?

1305
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:05,600
It's a system that blends Western astrology and

1306
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,460
I Ching.

1307
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:09,360
Nothing at all.

1308
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,900
Nothing at all.

1309
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,940
I was just fascinated by the nine star

1310
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:15,580
key because it's a collection of data for

1311
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,600
thousands of years.

1312
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,220
Now, whether it's been misused or are we

1313
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,860
getting an accurate whatever?

1314
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,020
No, I just I find it to be

1315
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:25,500
fairly accurate, especially with people around you.

1316
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,160
But no, I don't know about a crossover.

1317
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,360
No, I'm not an astrology type person.

1318
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,020
Fair enough.

1319
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,620
Just got two more.

1320
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,740
I got a short one and a long

1321
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:33,960
one.

1322
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,240
So go with the short first.

1323
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,360
What are the Greeks thoughts on Wim Hof

1324
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,760
breathing techniques and cold showers?

1325
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:41,740
Thank you in advance.

1326
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,280
Never heard of it, but I have heard

1327
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,320
about the cold bath dipping and all that.

1328
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,560
That will make you extremely young because the

1329
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,640
water, cold water is extremely lean.

1330
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,220
That'll really tighten young men.

1331
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,160
It'll tighten you up.

1332
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:54,780
It'll it'll.

1333
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,460
And, you know, when you give me an

1334
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,360
example, when you this is not a direct

1335
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,020
answer, but when you subject yourself to cold

1336
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,140
and you're shaking, that's shaking is the releasing

1337
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:04,720
of yin.

1338
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,160
Right.

1339
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:08,580
The yin energy has to be released because

1340
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,120
in order for you to become young from

1341
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:13,200
being exposed to such a yin energy or

1342
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,280
principle, let's say of something being cold, which

1343
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,720
is extremely lean, it'll make your body young

1344
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,220
to balance.

1345
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:21,940
So you you're you're actually shaking is releasing

1346
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:22,920
yin.

1347
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,380
Also a sneeze when someone sneezes, it's a

1348
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,520
release of yin.

1349
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,840
Like when you eat spicy food or put

1350
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,800
spicy food up, you know, the snuff or

1351
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,740
whatever makes people sneeze from back in the

1352
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:32,860
day.

1353
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:33,660
Snuff boxes.

1354
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:33,920
Right.

1355
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:34,320
Yes.

1356
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,400
That was because spices are very yin.

1357
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,760
So it over yin.

1358
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,840
It creates a reaction that releases you.

1359
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,500
So sneezing, shaking from being cold is a

1360
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,320
release of yin.

1361
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,860
So, OK, so the cold, what it'll do,

1362
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,040
a cold shower, cold bath, these ice baths

1363
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,540
that people do.

1364
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,240
It's fashionable wherever it's going to really seen

1365
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,780
if you're on any kind of medication, prescription

1366
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,600
drugs or even taking vitamins or eat fatty

1367
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:01,360
oils or processed food, it could actually force

1368
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,620
a rapid response of release of yin.

1369
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,940
It could actually hurt you or damage your

1370
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:06,380
organs.

1371
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,000
So you have to be really fit and

1372
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,520
balanced to do those things.

1373
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,020
And if you're doing those things to be

1374
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:16,920
fit and balanced, you're kind of like experimenting.

1375
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,060
You might hurt yourself.

1376
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:18,360
Right.

1377
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:18,940
That's what I'm saying.

1378
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,420
The body always reacts better to a warm

1379
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,620
shower and a hot bath.

1380
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,280
It doesn't matter if it's cold or hot

1381
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:24,500
out.

1382
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,280
You always react better to a hot sauna,

1383
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,960
a steam room, hot bath, hot shower than

1384
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,720
anything cold.

1385
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,160
And that's what I recommend.

1386
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,080
I would never recommend anything cold on the

1387
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,920
body because it forces a rapid release of

1388
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,220
yin.

1389
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,600
And knowing that the day and age we

1390
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,320
live in and all that, most people not

1391
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,640
being as fit as you could be because

1392
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,060
the environment is so toxified.

1393
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,580
I wouldn't do anything, any kind of a

1394
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:50,500
cold treatment or anything.

1395
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,280
The only cold treatment I would do is

1396
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,960
if you had a bruise, you know, the

1397
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,560
cold pack.

1398
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,240
I have a cat that's having a hard

1399
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,720
time adapting to the desert heat.

1400
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,360
So I have to do cold coat on

1401
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:00,460
him.

1402
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,680
I have these these ice packs that I

1403
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,400
rub on his coat, cools him down because

1404
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,420
he's really hot and itchy and he's having

1405
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:07,940
a hard time.

1406
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,620
He's like one of these cats that belong

1407
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:13,060
in the forests of Sweden or Norway or,

1408
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:13,700
you know, cold.

1409
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,120
He's like imagine a husky in the desert.

1410
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:16,380
Right.

1411
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,340
So, yeah.

1412
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,460
So, yeah.

1413
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,480
That only that like I've used cold packs

1414
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:21,980
before.

1415
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,980
I've had a skin manifestation that was so

1416
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:25,240
itchy.

1417
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,360
I was like that that's a young manifestation

1418
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,700
breaking through the skin.

1419
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:31,220
I need to put ice pack on that.

1420
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,500
And it just made it stop.

1421
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,420
And yes, knowing diagnosis.

1422
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,080
But again, just to I would like to

1423
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:41,360
emphasize and underscore that my recommendation for any

1424
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,680
kind of a treatment doesn't matter if it's

1425
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,220
hot or cold.

1426
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,400
That is a hot bath, hot shower, steam

1427
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,720
room sauna, never a cold shower, never a

1428
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:51,580
cold dip because it forces a rapid discharge

1429
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,040
of yin.

1430
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:53,460
Yeah.

1431
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,980
Somebody once asked in one of these little

1432
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:57,500
community chat things about like, you know, why

1433
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,880
is my dog so miserable?

1434
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:00,580
And I took a look and realized, you

1435
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,540
know, they had a husky living in Florida.

1436
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:04,460
And I'm like, are you stupid?

1437
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,240
I mean, that dog is not supposed to

1438
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:07,800
be in Florida.

1439
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,680
It's very literally made for cold weather.

1440
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,860
He's literally designed for cold weather like that.

1441
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,360
That dog belongs way north up in Canada

1442
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,760
somewhere, you know, at least.

1443
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:18,480
Yeah.

1444
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,680
I've seen them pulling with those sleighs, you

1445
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,800
know, and they're just happy as anything like

1446
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,880
minus 20, you know?

1447
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,200
Yeah.

1448
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:26,340
But you bring them into, you know, 102

1449
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,140
degree weather.

1450
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,960
They're sitting there panting, like trying not to

1451
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:29,400
drop.

1452
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:30,920
Anyways.

1453
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:31,320
Yeah.

1454
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:32,840
So this is a long one, Greek.

1455
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,980
But bear with me because it tells a

1456
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:35,200
lot.

1457
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:37,160
OK, well, you can abridge it, but go

1458
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:37,340
ahead.

1459
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,580
Yeah, I'll read some of it, but not

1460
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:39,920
all of it.

1461
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,160
OK, I understand the frustration with the so

1462
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:42,940
-called doctors.

1463
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:43,680
They're terrible.

1464
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,780
I went last week for a health check.

1465
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,860
I never go to doctors, but I had

1466
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,360
to do it because of work.

1467
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:53,400
Basically, the only thing they do is measure

1468
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,100
blood pressure, high blood pressure.

1469
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:00,040
Before going there, I spent two hours walking

1470
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,240
around the city and it was almost 40

1471
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:02,980
degrees outside.

1472
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:05,960
So my heart was still beating at an

1473
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:06,660
increased rate.

1474
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:09,210
The doctor instantly suggested blood pressure medications.

1475
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,160
So no, thanks.

1476
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,240
Just give me my certificate.

1477
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,980
These doctors are really clowns.

1478
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,600
Is that the only thing they taught them

1479
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,160
in college to measure blood pressure?

1480
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,220
What a joke.

1481
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,400
I went to check the definition of blood

1482
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:22,740
pressure.

1483
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:26,120
It says the force that blood exerts against

1484
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,240
the walls of the arteries.

1485
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,280
So ultimately, here's the questions.

1486
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:33,000
How do they measure the force?

1487
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,620
Same way they measure gravity?

1488
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,480
You could look that up.

1489
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,440
Look up the history.

1490
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,480
I've had several people in the medical industry

1491
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,920
that I've told, when you look up definitions,

1492
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:50,740
you're going to get the political definition.

1493
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,760
You're going to get what they want you

1494
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,120
to do.

1495
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,080
If you looked up COVID four years ago,

1496
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,100
it'd be very different than if you looked

1497
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,660
it up 15 years ago or now.

1498
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:01,840
So you have to look up the history

1499
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,240
of the blood pressure cuff and blood pressure

1500
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,860
measurement devices history.

1501
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:09,280
And they'll walk you through what they were

1502
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,540
trying to do and what they developed to

1503
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:12,660
measure those things.

1504
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:16,340
And they'll explain how it evolved into what

1505
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:16,860
it is now.

1506
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:18,240
You're going to be scratching your head and

1507
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,980
you're like, they did all this for what?

1508
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:20,740
For nothing?

1509
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:21,460
Yeah.

1510
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,900
Basically, this is the same thing from listening

1511
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,000
to Brandon Joe Williams.

1512
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,660
When attorneys get out of law school, or

1513
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:29,760
when you get out of law school, you

1514
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,020
still don't know how to write a court

1515
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,160
case, a lawsuit.

1516
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,560
You still don't know how to write a

1517
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:33,880
lawsuit.

1518
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,660
Now, what they do is the same thing

1519
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:35,960
they do.

1520
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,420
And I've seen nursing school books.

1521
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,780
They spend most of their time talking about

1522
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:43,280
what chemicals are inside cells, which none of

1523
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,860
them could confirm any of that.

1524
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,040
It's all bullshit, right?

1525
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:48,620
Because I've told you that the way they

1526
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:51,300
find out what chemicals are inside cells is

1527
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:54,040
by first crushing the cell, centrifuging it, and

1528
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:57,000
then assaying it, either combining it with caustic

1529
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,960
chemicals, acidic chemicals, or burning it.

1530
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,340
So when you do all those things, you've

1531
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:02,640
changed into something else.

1532
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:05,880
Like, you can't tell me orange marmalade is

1533
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,500
orange, and you can't tell me that a

1534
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:11,260
pickle is a cucumber, even though, right?

1535
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:12,380
It started off as the same.

1536
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:13,820
They want a cucumber in their hamburger?

1537
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:14,400
No, hell no.

1538
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:15,440
I want a pickle, right?

1539
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,020
Not the same thing anymore.

1540
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,480
So it's all a distraction.

1541
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:23,360
The medical thing, hospitals, because of the hospital

1542
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:25,500
business and all that, is a farce.

1543
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:28,360
I cannot emphasize that.

1544
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,480
You could look this up.

1545
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:30,540
I don't know how much of it will

1546
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:31,420
still be left online.

1547
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:34,700
Socialized medicine countries have, and they go on

1548
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:35,520
strike occasionally.

1549
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,280
When they go on strike, the morgues are

1550
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,320
literally empty.

1551
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:41,060
When the doctors go back to work, the

1552
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:43,700
morgues begin to operate at regular capacity again.

1553
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:45,280
That's all you have to say.

1554
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:47,120
Now, walking around.

1555
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,940
So go look at the history, because I

1556
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:51,560
can run down the technical stuff right now,

1557
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,080
what they're doing, and what it actually measures.

1558
00:46:54,600 --> 00:47:00,280
It measures literally the pulse, the time in

1559
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,160
between beats.

1560
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:03,540
And there's an algorithm for it.

1561
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:04,760
And it's all BS.

1562
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:07,800
Because, excuse me, if you're going to talk

1563
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,020
about blood pressure, it better be negative pressure.

1564
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:11,020
Right?

1565
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:11,700
Because it's moving.

1566
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,520
People think, like, remember in the old?

1567
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,960
Well, the timing between beats is easy to

1568
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,400
see because they used to, when people wore

1569
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,380
watches, they would look at their watch, and

1570
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:22,520
they would watch the second hand, and look

1571
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:22,920
at it.

1572
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,320
Yeah, right, exactly.

1573
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,340
The timing in between, and there's a motion

1574
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:28,140
in the cuff disturbance of the pressure.

1575
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:29,260
But here's the thing.

1576
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:33,400
They've got everyone programmed, including these idiot doctors,

1577
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:35,220
that we're pressurized filter bags.

1578
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,740
We're filter bags because we absorb things, right?

1579
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:39,240
And we're pressurized.

1580
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:42,780
If you're going to talk about pressure, it's

1581
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:43,560
got to be negative.

1582
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:46,420
And if you're talking about filtering or absorption,

1583
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,520
it better be using the term induction because

1584
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,540
nothing passes through any of the tissues at

1585
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:50,820
all.

1586
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:54,260
And so, yeah, are they moronic?

1587
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,560
Yeah, just like, well, here's the thing.

1588
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:57,280
You can go to a banker, a Series

1589
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:01,420
7 licensed broker, stockbroker.

1590
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,700
Someone's been working 30, 40 years in banking,

1591
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,980
investment banking, and they don't know what negotiable

1592
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:06,660
instruments are.

1593
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,120
They don't know.

1594
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:07,960
They can't define it.

1595
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:08,960
They can't define anything.

1596
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,540
They don't know what the Federal Reserve is

1597
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:10,820
doing.

1598
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,860
They don't know what monetization is.

1599
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,960
They don't know anything at all, just like

1600
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,280
attorneys don't know any law.

1601
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,900
They just write nasty grams, right?

1602
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:18,820
Oh, yeah.

1603
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:20,920
Yeah, so no one knows anything.

1604
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:22,900
So my question to the person writing this

1605
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,600
is I really appreciate that, but it sounds

1606
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,280
like you've been on this planet for 30

1607
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,100
days only.

1608
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,040
In other words, what I recommend to the

1609
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,340
person who wrote the question in the email,

1610
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,100
by the way, I highly appreciate it because

1611
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:37,180
you're sharing an experience, is don't be so

1612
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:39,180
naive, and you should take a more sarcastic

1613
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:42,200
undertone, not an overtone with this, which you

1614
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,140
actually did.

1615
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,480
I'm giving you high marks for this, by

1616
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:45,740
the way.

1617
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:49,260
Don't take what I'm saying as whatever berating

1618
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:49,720
you or anything.

1619
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,420
I'm actually giving you high marks for bringing

1620
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:54,700
this forward because you actually brought out what

1621
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:57,360
you did and what they did, and clearly

1622
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,860
they don't know what they're doing, and you

1623
00:48:58,860 --> 00:48:59,540
notice that.

1624
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,600
The shame of it is that the people

1625
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,960
around you don't know that what you know,

1626
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:08,120
most likely, I'm presuming, and the person that

1627
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,100
you went to, right?

1628
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:10,560
So here's the thing.

1629
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:14,120
By the way, one suggestion I would make

1630
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,140
is when they said, I suggest you to

1631
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:18,520
be on blood pressure medication, just say, give

1632
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,720
me the script, right?

1633
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,480
In other words, go along with them, with

1634
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:24,080
those idiots.

1635
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:27,780
When you're dealing with illegal morons, you have

1636
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:30,340
to rebut everything they say.

1637
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,640
Don't rebut the doctors that much because they

1638
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,100
have a lot of legal power also.

1639
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:38,080
You might tell you one thing and send

1640
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,720
something else to your employer.

1641
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:42,060
So say, give me the script and I'll

1642
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:43,740
consider it, and then they feel like, yeah,

1643
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:44,840
I got another one.

1644
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:47,400
You don't want to wake these idiots up

1645
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,200
because it's actually, they've chosen to be asleep,

1646
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:51,560
these medics, right?

1647
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,040
And they've chosen that life.

1648
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:54,620
They know it.

1649
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:55,600
None of them are happy.

1650
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,140
Trust me, I know that.

1651
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,120
If you know any of these medical morons,

1652
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,940
they take more interest in hobbies and other

1653
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:05,220
pastimes than their career.

1654
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,820
They have to for their sanity, right?

1655
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:11,180
So, yeah, they really do.

1656
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,040
If you know anyone who works as a

1657
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,260
doctor, they have any pastime, whether it's a

1658
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:18,480
sport or whatever, pastime, hobby.

1659
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,200
They take it very seriously because they have

1660
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,420
no way to define themselves.

1661
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:25,480
Now, you have the surgeons and the interns

1662
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,900
who take a tremendous amount of time that

1663
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,500
is taken from them to work there, and

1664
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,280
that's all military.

1665
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,320
That's all based on military protocols.

1666
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:37,780
But anyway, I'm glad you shared that.

1667
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:40,240
But again, to go back to what blood

1668
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,400
pressure is, just like diabetes and all that,

1669
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:43,780
study the history of it.

1670
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:47,940
How was blood pressure equipment developed and why?

1671
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,500
And you're not going to get into a

1672
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,400
big thing about it.

1673
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:56,000
Wikipedia will do that for you really quick.

1674
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:56,900
It's fine.

1675
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:59,700
And you'll see that they started off with

1676
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:01,440
something that was a notion and a theory,

1677
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,800
and they pursued it disregarding the facts.

1678
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:08,300
And they made it a fact in people's

1679
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:09,580
minds, even though it doesn't exist.

1680
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:10,220
There you go.

1681
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:13,440
And look, I actually missed one question, didn't

1682
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,200
realize it, but I double-checked and found

1683
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:15,380
it.

1684
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:17,780
So here it is, the last thing that

1685
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:19,520
I need to ask you, which is, Greek,

1686
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:22,660
what does it mean in this current reality

1687
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:26,140
to, quote, seek enlightenment, end quote?

1688
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,080
Well, here, I'll use this.

1689
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,220
You ever hear people say, oh, he's very

1690
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:32,620
spiritual, and I'm like, and?

1691
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:34,000
Right?

1692
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:36,200
Well, spiritual could be, is that like, let's

1693
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,500
say, demonic spiritual or angelic spiritual?

1694
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,600
Spiritual just means not physical.

1695
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,780
It could be like Linda Blair and the

1696
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:44,400
Exorcist, right?

1697
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,400
Or it could be, you know, what was

1698
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,080
that funny movie they did about a guy

1699
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,420
talking to God, right?

1700
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,180
With George Burns.

1701
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:50,700
Remember that?

1702
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:51,720
And then they did another one.

1703
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:52,160
Oh, yeah.

1704
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,320
It was called Oh, God.

1705
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:54,240
Oh, God.

1706
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:54,480
Yeah.

1707
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:55,260
So which one?

1708
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:57,400
They're both spiritual movies, by the way.

1709
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:57,680
Yeah.

1710
00:51:58,020 --> 00:51:58,260
Right.

1711
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,520
Oh, God is a spiritual movie.

1712
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:00,960
And so is the Exorcist.

1713
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:03,380
And then they did the second one, Oh,

1714
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,140
God, you devil.

1715
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,520
And George Burns played both God and the

1716
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:06,740
devil.

1717
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:07,020
Remember?

1718
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:07,900
Yeah.

1719
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:08,540
So, right.

1720
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:09,260
Right.

1721
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:09,620
Yeah.

1722
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:11,080
You showed up in a different colored suit,

1723
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:11,460
I think.

1724
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:12,880
He had a red suit on, like, and

1725
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,300
lit his cigarettes with his fingertips or whatever.

1726
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:16,180
Right.

1727
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:16,640
Right.

1728
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,920
So the thing about that is, like, when

1729
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,280
you say revelation, it just means, or apocalypse,

1730
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,380
this just means to open.

1731
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,660
So when you enlighten, to put light on

1732
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:27,740
something, it could be anything.

1733
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:28,640
I mean, what does it mean?

1734
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:30,200
It could make you very upset.

1735
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:32,640
Like, if you're in a relationship and that

1736
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,440
person is cheating on you for a long

1737
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,700
time and you have no suspicion of it,

1738
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,280
and you find out that that's happening, that's

1739
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:40,460
enlightenment, isn't it?

1740
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:41,980
What do you do now?

1741
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,400
What are you going to do now?

1742
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,400
Now you have, you get into confrontation, right?

1743
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:46,280
Or you just let it go.

1744
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,860
But either way, right?

1745
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:49,720
In Spanish, they call that a cover on.

1746
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:51,800
So, so what are you going to do?

1747
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:52,420
Right?

1748
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:56,340
So when you, when you go into enlightenment,

1749
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,260
that just means you're going to be putting

1750
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:00,380
on light on things that are pitch black

1751
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:01,580
and you haven't seen before.

1752
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,360
And it's not always good.

1753
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:07,780
And in this particular reality that we're manifesting

1754
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:12,740
right now, the trivial things, that's why I

1755
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:15,500
want to do the thing on home economics,

1756
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,880
can be very good when you become enlightened.

1757
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:20,600
But the big things, the overarching things that

1758
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:25,200
government, religion, you know, the mainstream religions, finance

1759
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,060
and all that, you start enlightening yourself on

1760
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:28,500
that, you're going to see it's super, super

1761
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,720
dark, darker than anything you've seen online.

1762
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:32,200
Worse.

1763
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:32,680
Yeah.

1764
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,060
So that's why years ago I've been telling

1765
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:37,000
people, they got some pretty crazy theories on,

1766
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,700
you know, wild shit on the internet you

1767
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:40,880
could look up, but I'll tell you what,

1768
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:42,980
reality is 10 times even more wilder than

1769
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:43,520
that.

1770
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:45,360
That's why it doesn't get out.

1771
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:45,740
So.

1772
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:49,040
And that's why, you know, that old advice

1773
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,320
about it's always dangerous to wake a sleepwalker.

1774
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,460
I absolutely agree with it, you know, because

1775
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:54,640
there's a lot of sleepwalkers.

1776
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,180
Listen to Robert.

1777
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:57,360
There's a, there's a channel.

1778
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:00,160
No, I call it no thinking a lot.

1779
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,420
It's new thinking allowed.

1780
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:04,340
He used to be on, uh, what's his

1781
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:04,540
name?

1782
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:05,120
I forgot his name.

1783
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,480
He used to have a, uh, back when

1784
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,920
public access TV in San Francisco, he's a

1785
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,480
paranormal researcher, a parapsychologist.

1786
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:16,020
Uh, anyway, it's called new thinking allowed.

1787
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:19,460
Uh, two months ago you interviewed Robert Temple.

1788
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:21,080
Listen to that interview with Robert Temple.

1789
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,160
Robert Temple is a little bit of a

1790
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,940
flake, but his information seems to be pretty

1791
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:27,940
good about the astral journeys that he goes

1792
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:29,380
on and he's told to come back and

1793
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:30,380
tell people on earth.

1794
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:31,680
And when you die, you go up to

1795
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:32,700
this other place, right?

1796
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:33,800
And there's nothing to do there.

1797
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:34,080
Right.

1798
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,120
So, uh, and he's quite surprised and how

1799
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,320
they show us a lot of the stuff

1800
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:42,580
in film, but Robert Temple interview on, uh,

1801
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:45,040
no thinking, new thinking allowed new thinking.

1802
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,260
The reason I call it no thinking allowed

1803
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:49,340
is because he's an academic and he, you

1804
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:50,760
know, he props up academia.

1805
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:53,100
So academia is no thinking a lot, but

1806
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:54,260
it's new thinking allowed.

1807
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,560
Robert Temple from two months ago, he did

1808
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,060
another interview about a year ago, but the

1809
00:54:58,060 --> 00:54:59,060
more recent one is more.

1810
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:01,220
And it's interesting when he starts talking about

1811
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:04,060
one of the guides that like used to

1812
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:05,920
come down to earth, doesn't anymore because the

1813
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,860
evil on the earth has reached a point

1814
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:09,160
where they have to stay up in the

1815
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:11,480
stratosphere because the lizards won't let them come

1816
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:14,220
down to the surface like they used to

1817
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:14,800
at all.

1818
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:16,700
Cause the lizards are running everything.

1819
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:17,840
And he cuts soon as he said that

1820
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,920
he cuts them off and he says, well,

1821
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:21,900

1822
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:23,240

1823
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,720
reptilians that run this place.

1824
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:25,420

1825
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:27,620

1828
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,160
know, anyway, you can imagine querying them, you

1829
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:39,000
know, so there you go.
