1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,460
The Sonic entity known as H.E.V

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:04,880
.A. has been created.

3
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:30,560
And I'll tell you why.

4
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,460
I got objections to Led Zeppelin, and I'll

5
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,780
shut up after this and let you roll.

6
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,440
But the thing about that is Led Zeppelin

7
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,200
to me is exactly how they made fun

8
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,320
of it on that cartoon show.

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,200
They called them lifted riffs because they ripped

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,620
off, and I realize every musician's a thief,

11
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,340
but they ripped off hundreds of musicians and

12
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,320
didn't pay them and all kinds of lawsuits.

13
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,780
And it's ridiculous.

14
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:51,400
Led Zeppelin.

15
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,840
Songwriters, manager was a thief and a murderer.

16
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,280
I mean, you know, come on.

17
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:56,580
Yeah.

18
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,940
But here's the thing.

19
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,640
So this is exactly the people's.

20
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,780
What's your favorite food?

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,560
I mean, I can only tell you what

22
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,180
I'm craving right now, like chocolate babka.

23
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,660
And Trader Joe's fortunately has one that has

24
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,840
like a Brooklyn recipe, you know, Ukrainian bakeries

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,640
at a common Tom and Tosh and Babka.

26
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,720
It's like a roll up dense cake, you

27
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,880
know, like that that Yiddish kind of bakery

28
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,340
stuff feels, you know, I crave that, you

29
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:19,440
know.

30
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,840
So if you ask me what's my favorite

31
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,600
food, I'll say chocolate babka, babka, babka, B

32
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,640
.A.B.K.A. And it's like and

33
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,120
it's not it's it's just what I'm listening.

34
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,340
So I've been putting on Led Zeppelin lately

35
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,300
because that reminds me of a rowdy time

36
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,540
that I had in the early 80s and

37
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,920
things are kind of rowdy in a good

38
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,420
way and whatever, whatever.

39
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,140
There's a band called Greta something that's if

40
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,560
that's better than Led Zeppelin, a new a

41
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,400
new or newer.

42
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,160
They're like 10 years old now, 10 years

43
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,740
and a young guy sounds just like Robert

44
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,100
Plant.

45
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:50,680
Yeah.

46
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:50,940
Yeah.

47
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,880
You know what I'm talking about?

48
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:52,400
Absolutely.

49
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,420
I can't think of it.

50
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,580
But they're from overseas somewhere and they're pretty

51
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:55,840
good.

52
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,280
They're not better than Robert Plant.

53
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,620
So the thing is, when you ask me

54
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,040
what's my favorite food, I'm going to tell

55
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,800
you what I'm like.

56
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,840
I'm into this week.

57
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,200
I never I never go all time favorite,

58
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,460
you know, the same with music like before

59
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,260
Led Zeppelin and a little bit of Bruce

60
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:13,800
Springsteen recently because it's it's just it's just

61
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,160
like power giving me the same power that

62
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,300
I had in the early 80s.

63
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,280
I'm looking for that a little bit for

64
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:20,480
that.

65
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,300
It was like underground disco.

66
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,400
I was listening to underground disco from Paradise

67
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,960
Garage and like The Loft, you know, David

68
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,140
Mancuso, stuff like that, you know, listening to

69
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,840
some really original, creative stuff.

70
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,240
And every once in a while, I've actually

71
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,000
caught you listening to some R&B, some

72
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,100
classical, some jazz.

73
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:36,600
Yeah.

74
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,420
You know what that was?

75
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,300
It's like because I like the underground stuff.

76
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:40,660
Yes.

77
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,880
Some of the stuff I did not recognize.

78
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:43,820
Absolutely true.

79
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,660
But I've always been, yeah, very much.

80
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,340
Look, I love Motown stuff.

81
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,620
I love the stuff that my father like.

82
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,680
One thing like I was into Kruan Bin,

83
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,740
Kruan Bin means airplane in Thai, Kruan Bin.

84
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,940
And there they have like this melodic, like

85
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,600
1970s melodic guitar sound.

86
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,360
I mean, there's I do not have a

87
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:03,920
favorite food.

88
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,500
I do not have a favorite band or

89
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,020
music.

90
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,400
That's kind of like, you know, they always

91
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,120
try to that.

92
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,480
That's whoever wrote the comment.

93
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,340
No, no, no stain on them.

94
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,480
But the whole thing about being here is

95
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,780
whoever's figured out what this place is about.

96
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,300
The first thing they did was they hurried

97
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,160
up and wanted to make sure to distract

98
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,480
and deceive everyone about what's going on here.

99
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:26,820
Right.

100
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,200
You hear all these cliches.

101
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:28,500
Sure.

102
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,900
Like, what's your favorite color?

103
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,320
You know, you mean like right now or

104
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,180
10 minutes ago?

105
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:33,520
Right.

106
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,360
Or last month?

107
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,720
You know, there's no all these things like,

108
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,380
how about you over here?

109
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,160
Oh, everyone's got a special talent.

110
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,660
You just got to find it right now.

111
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,300
Bullshit.

112
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,540
No, most people here are completely useless.

113
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,660
My taste, my taste in almost anything is

114
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,000
in a constant, you know, state of change.

115
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,360
It may not change a lot, but oddly,

116
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,140
my favorite band's always been my favorite band,

117
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,880
although my musical tastes have evolved a lot.

118
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,920
I mean, there was a point in my

119
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,620
life early on when I was listening to

120
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,040
Led Zeppelin.

121
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,540
I didn't listen to hip hop at all

122
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,920
because I kind of reject hip hop.

123
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,120
You've heard me.

124
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,320
You've called me in for Sonic and I

125
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,160
have Wu-Tang on.

126
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:09,400
Right.

127
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:10,740
Oh, yeah.

128
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,760
No, I love that stuff.

129
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,360
And I love that at a certain point,

130
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,900
but at a certain point, it became very

131
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,820
commercial and I hated it for a while

132
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,620
and I absolutely rejected it where it was

133
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,500
garbage to me.

134
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,700
And then I got back around to it

135
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,320
and remember the old stuff and remember the

136
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,160
original stuff.

137
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,320
And that's the thing.

138
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,360
Like Zeppelin, I can remember partying with Zeppelin,

139
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:27,600
too.

140
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,160
By the way, that guy wrote again and

141
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,960
I want to get it in.

142
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,740
So Greek is a Led Zeppelin guy.

143
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,740
My personal favorite.

144
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,660
This is this guy speaking.

145
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,120
No, I'm not a Led Zeppelin guy, but

146
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,460
go ahead.

147
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,020
I happen to reason when the question came

148
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,660
up, that's what I was listening to that

149
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,460
week or day.

150
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,780
No, you already answered that.

151
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,980
So anyway, yeah, he says Greek is Led

152
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,160
Zeppelin.

153
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,100
My personal favorite is Babe, I'm going to

154
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:47,600
leave you.

155
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,040
There's something about the guitar in that song

156
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,560
that is very trippy.

157
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,760
There is the dark vibe in some of

158
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,320
their songs, which is very interesting.

159
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,120
I wonder if the inspiration came from Jimmy

160
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,760
Page's interest in the occult.

161
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,680
Interesting band.

162
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,280
OK, hold on just a second, because let

163
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,040
me just put this when they put out,

164
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,020
they put out their interest in the occult.

165
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,060
You have no choice.

166
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,820
If you're a famous boxer, a famous rock

167
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,240
and roll, whatever, you're going to lose a

168
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,560
child.

169
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,380
First of all, show me someone.

170
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,340
It's a famous rock person or whatever that

171
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,840
has not lost a child, a son, usually

172
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,120
under the age of eight.

173
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,240
For sacrifice, they tell you they died from

174
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,780
a stomach virus or they fell out a

175
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,440
window like Eric Clapton or Mike Tyson, their

176
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,620
dog got strangled, strangled herself on a treadmill.

177
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,980
You know, so you'll hear usually children under

178
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,580
eight years old.

179
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,640
They have to give up.

180
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,920
All of Ozzy Osbourne's children are still alive.

181
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:46,580
All of them are.

182
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,460
OK, well, he's an exception because he might

183
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:48,680
be.

184
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,380
Here's the thing.

185
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,180
He might be more, more overt, so overt

186
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,620
into that dark side that he doesn't need

187
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,620
to give up one.

188
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,280
He'd make it because he might have bought

189
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,420
one and brought it in.

190
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,880
Well, he had a family, too.

191
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,820
That's the other weird like that's the other

192
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,020
thing.

193
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,720
When these guys always have a second family

194
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,020
and they yeah.

195
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,660
And quite often, like you said, Robert Plant

196
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,320
lost that kid through.

197
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:10,940
Yeah.

198
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,100
Most of them.

199
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,660
And if you don't have if you if

200
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,160
they demand when you have to buy one,

201
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:14,680
it's easy.

202
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,980
The hospitals are notorious when the mom when

203
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,660
they realize the couple or the mom or

204
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,260
whatever doesn't really want the child, they'll take

205
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,660
the baby and say, oh, it died.

206
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,000
And she's like, OK, bye.

207
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,560
And they never see the body and the

208
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,860
child gets put on the market.

209
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,300
Yeah.

210
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,460
A lot of children, like hundreds of thousands

211
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,740
per year, go that way.

212
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,040
You know, they just tell the mom it

213
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,340
died.

214
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,360
You can't see it because it's toxicology.

215
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,260
You know, it's already in the morgue.

216
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,640
You know, you're young.

217
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,640
You could have another one.

218
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,160
Even the FBI says, oh, you're young.

219
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:43,980
You could have another one.

220
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:44,740
Yeah.

221
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,160
So the children market is so these people's

222
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,280
when you say the occult.

223
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:48,840
Yeah.

224
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,500
It's not a preference.

225
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,600
You have no choice.

226
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,640
That's what I'm trying to say.

227
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,540
No, I know.

228
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,040
Yeah, I know.

229
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:55,320
Yeah.

230
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:55,800
No.

231
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,460
But the thing about look and when I

232
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,760
was in the Zeppelin, I was in the

233
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,220
Zeppelin because it was fun to be around

234
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,440
the girls that were in the Zeppelin.

235
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,060
You know what I mean?

236
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,500
And it was it was a good time

237
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,320
because they weren't playing anymore.

238
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,940
But we all had their tapes or their

239
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,700
records or whatever.

240
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,780
And and it was fun.

241
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,300
I like Houses of the Holy, too, by

242
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:13,540
the way.

243
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,640
You mentioned that album.

244
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,700
Yeah, that was a good.

245
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,300
I mean, the thing is, early on, it

246
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,580
was like, you know, I like Led Zeppelin

247
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,040
because I can't tell.

248
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,220
He sounds like a bitch.

249
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,000
Yeah.

250
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,380
He sounds like a woman singing.

251
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,540
You know, I mean, you know.

252
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,040
When I say what I refer to a

253
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,560
woman as a bitch, it's affectionate.

254
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:29,780
Right.

255
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:30,380
I know.

256
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,060
So affectionately referred to.

257
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,200
That's ghetto talk.

258
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,200
But so.

259
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,280
Yeah, I guess.

260
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:35,780
No, no.

261
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,380
It's cool.

262
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,420
And look, but I just always laugh because

263
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,740
what he called Bill Bill Burr put out

264
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,440
a cartoon called F is for Family.

265
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,240
And in the cartoon, there's the most popular

266
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,100
band in the 70s is called Lifted Riffs,

267
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,600
which is obviously Led Zeppelin.

268
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:52,380
Yeah.

269
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,060
Well, they were.

270
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,760
They're always the biggest people who knew music

271
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,280
in the industry were surprised at how they

272
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,180
did well enough to buy an airplane, right?

273
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:01,900
Yeah.

274
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:02,800
Fly around.

275
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,640
They were surprised because they were always a

276
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,520
B level band.

277
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,640
They were never a never considered an A

278
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,940
class band like whatever else would you consider

279
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,420
a class?

280
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,800
They never made it to the A list,

281
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,400
but they did.

282
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,500
They acted like it.

283
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,020
And to tell you the truth, the greatest

284
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,460
musicians I've ever met, seen, heard of or

285
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,140
anything, every one of them is a thief

286
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:20,800
on some level.

287
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,040
They all stole something from somebody.

288
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,440
I mean, it's it's never possible that anybody.

289
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,000
Yeah.

290
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,140
But here's the thing is that they steal

291
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,980
it from someone who was original and not

292
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,360
give credit or they didn't like the person.

293
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,120
You know, there's many reasons to do that.

294
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:35,880
I get it.

295
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,240
Yes.

296
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,299
And that's the thing about it.

297
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:39,520
I don't like the vibe of the way

298
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,220
they did it.

299
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,020
And the fact that they never paid anybody

300
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,720
until people, you know, brought him to court

301
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,440
and sued him over.

302
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,520
They have no they have no choice to

303
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:46,680
pay.

304
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,760
They don't even get paid.

305
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,380
Yeah.

306
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,440
They don't even get paid.

307
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,260
You know, because they don't read their contracts.

308
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:51,560
Right.

309
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,800
Well, that was a way to do a

310
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,660
little bit of a diversion here.

311
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,060
Yeah.

312
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,920
They got around this.

313
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,420
Well, they got ripped off badly.

314
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,940
But that's the thing about contracts, though, is

315
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,140
that.

316
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,200
Yeah.

317
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:02,820
Yeah.

318
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,680
But contracts.

319
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,960
Let me just say this for people that

320
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,520
we did the financial stuff.

321
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,000
We stopped that because I found it to

322
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,480
be ineffective or the people were not into

323
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,740
it as much as I thought they would

324
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:12,980
be.

325
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,540
But when you do the bills of exchange

326
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,740
and you endorse a utility bill or whatever,

327
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,920
they don't have to do it.

328
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,840
And the reason they don't have to do

329
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,340
it is because they feel like you're an

330
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,160
idiot and you're a baby and you're a

331
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,180
child and they're in charge.

332
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:27,820
How dare you?

333
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,820
So what you have to do really is

334
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,140
with these utility companies, let's say, or whatever,

335
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,540
is let them know that you are you

336
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,340
have the right to be the master over

337
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,880
that account because you're the issuer.

338
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,580
It was issued.

339
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,860
You're the one that did it.

340
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,520
And also because of the collateral in the

341
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,220
application.

342
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,520
So you have to let them know that.

343
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,260
And you also just don't let them know

344
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:52,840
it like that.

345
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,720
You send them a series of letters, meaning

346
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,500
at least two with that regard questions almost

347
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,920
like an like a admissions where they have

348
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,440
to answer, you know, do you work with

349
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,780
a financial institution?

350
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:07,620
Yes.

351
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:11,200
You know, our our application information and the

352
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,240
application itself sold or shared with third parties.

353
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,320
Yes or no.

354
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,560
Is the application itself a collateral security?

355
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,560
Let them say no.

356
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:20,500
Right.

357
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,660
You know, so you send in stuff like

358
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,000
that and you let them know that you're

359
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,400
the issuer according to law and any good

360
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,680
business you you you're taking control of the

361
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,220
contract of that account.

362
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,940
And then you start endorsing them because then

363
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,580
they'll say, oh, this person, you know, they

364
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,980
do have a right to do that.

365
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,500
And what's coming next?

366
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,260
They can guess.

367
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:40,560
Right.

368
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,360
But once you endorse and send it, they

369
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,040
don't have to do it.

370
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,540
So we don't take that form of payment

371
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,720
usually, usually sometimes they do.

372
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,060
So I just wanted to put that in

373
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,160
there because I'm still working on all that

374
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,840
stuff, even though I'm not doing the financial

375
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,700
group anymore.

376
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,880
It's still moving forward.

377
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,220
And and it's funny, because right now I'm

378
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:04,560
in the position where we're looking at everything

379
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,560
that I'm doing is seven figures and up.

380
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,300
Six figures now are like cigarette money.

381
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,740
So pushed around.

382
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,660
You can't do anything with six figures.

383
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:16,500
Right.

384
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,260
You need seven figures.

385
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,940
You what I mean is to get a

386
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,040
building in California, six hundred thousand gets you

387
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,240
a six hundred square foot wooden house with

388
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,260
no insulation.

389
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,700
It looks like it looks like a shack,

390
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,040
right?

391
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,140
Half a house, maybe not even.

392
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,040
Yeah, not even.

393
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,340
So so seven.

394
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,280
Everything now is seven figures.

395
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,140
You know, close to eight figures.

396
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,760
And that's what I'm working with.

397
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,500
And and I ain't going to go to

398
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,400
put the money in a bank account, transfer

399
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:44,540
it.

400
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,040
No, because.

401
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:45,880
Yeah.

402
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,300
So we're going to be using all this

403
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,780
stuff and it has to move forward.

404
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,620
And I'm trying to figure out really what's

405
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,120
going on.

406
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,740
There's a lot of the stuff on the

407
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,660
Internet is a distraction.

408
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,320
All these gurus and even people that I

409
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,280
brought up, they're all winging it their way.

410
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,620
And that's why when you just try to

411
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,560
follow what they're doing, it doesn't really work

412
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,260
most of the time, because what everyone is

413
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,620
missing, the only one that really put it

414
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,960
forward was to make of pass the freedom.

415
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,500
You got to take control, take away their

416
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,220
security interest.

417
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,380
But you got to take away more than

418
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,360
security interest.

419
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,460
You have to be able to put a

420
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,300
claim on that account.

421
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,800
If you don't claim that account or, you

422
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,480
know, I'm talking about majority share of that

423
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,320
account, they don't have to do anything.

424
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,380
You got to be able to move around.

425
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,600
So we'll get into there might be another

426
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,940
financial group like I threatened to do a

427
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,180
cooking class.

428
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,640
You know, it was like three hundred bucks

429
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,320
for the three three hour sessions.

430
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,120
I just don't have the time.

431
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,380
I don't want to make the time to

432
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,880
do it and whatever.

433
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,080
But I might once I get things moving

434
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,440
with the financial stuff, let's say another few

435
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,460
months or so, I will definitely do a

436
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,060
pay to play seminar on that.

437
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,720
We'll see how it goes.

438
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:51,820
I just want to put that out there.

439
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,980
I don't like keeping information to myself, but

440
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,580
you're going to have to pay this time

441
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:59,200
because no more free stuff, because there has

442
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,840
to be an exchange of some kind.

443
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,580
And to me, the best exchange is when

444
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,560
I bring information and I see people flourish

445
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,240
and use it and move forward and all

446
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,440
that.

447
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:08,660
Right.

448
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,560
That's the best payment.

449
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:09,860
Right.

450
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,520
But in this case, I'd rather just have

451
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,100
them send the funds and then what they

452
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,340
could do, whatever they want with it.

453
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,160
So anyway, I want to be a part

454
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,720
of that, that financial.

455
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,560
I want to learn.

456
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,500
But I couldn't keep track of when you

457
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,440
were meeting on Skype.

458
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,340
I mean, I but I want to learn.

459
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,340
There's always there's always an excuse, but it's

460
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,500
really about timing when the time is right,

461
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,060
because I've been talking to people for decades

462
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:32,980
about this stuff.

463
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,340
And some of those people even recently, like,

464
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,760
oh, my gosh, I think I'm ready now.

465
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,180
Right.

466
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,500
It's like, oh, my gosh.

467
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,780
OK, yeah, it's all timing.

468
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,200
But anyway, let's let's let's let's get back

469
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,180
to the sonic event.

470
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,300
I just wanted to say you got to

471
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:45,760
take control.

472
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,300
They count.

473
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,080
Yeah, right.

474
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,660
No, look, a decade ago when you said

475
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,080
it, I kind of stopped at it because

476
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,860
it sounded to me very much like those

477
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,520
guys with the sovereign citizen deal.

478
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,760
And I went, nah, this I don't even

479
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,920
want to get involved in that because I

480
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,640
know where that goes.

481
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,060
It always goes bad.

482
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,480
When you get involved with those guys.

483
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,720
Well, here's the other thing I did talk

484
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,200
about.

485
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,400
I wanted we missed a sonic event with

486
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:05,940
Jonah Bay.

487
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,780
Did a thing on the injunction driving injunction

488
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,500
that works.

489
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,700
That's when the cops pull you over and

490
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,620
then tell you got to go.

491
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,260
You let me leave because you're on a

492
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,800
list that you do not detain list.

493
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,620
That's real.

494
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,960
I knew someone that was on it.

495
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,280
And the injunction is very simple.

496
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:20,960
It's one paragraph.

497
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,300
Basically, you know, you have a constitutional officer

498
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,260
and you got to do what the Constitution

499
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:26,740
says.

500
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,200
And the laws even say that you can

501
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,780
make as many laws as you want, but

502
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,160
they only apply whoever volunteers into it.

503
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:34,420
Right.

504
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,460
So it's very simple that you can do

505
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,300
an injunction for anything, by the way.

506
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,520
It doesn't have to be as long as

507
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,240
you've had a mix up with someone like,

508
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,960
let's say the IRS says you owe them

509
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,180
money.

510
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,800
You can do an injunction on the IRS.

511
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,840
I was going to I might be working

512
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:54,020
with someone who is importing, exporting rice to

513
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,520
third world, what's called third world countries.

514
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,560
I'm surprised the same third world country still

515
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,540
has not become politically incorrect.

516
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,140
Right.

517
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:02,880
Yeah.

518
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,100
And because of the tariffs in the Constitution,

519
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,620
there's a thing where the government cannot charge

520
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:12,480
one of the people a terror either coming

521
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,500
in or going out.

522
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,380
Right.

523
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,600
If you're one of the people here.

524
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:15,900
Right.

525
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,320
So you can do an injunction on that.

526
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,300
So the tariffs, if you can do injunction

527
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,040
on that stuff.

528
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,600
So anyway, that's a whole other thing.

529
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,800
But right now, I'm in the middle of

530
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,720
a bunch of corn farmers and rice farmers.

531
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,980
I want the technology.

532
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,720
And I didn't know farmers were that.

533
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,420
Well, you must have just moved around.

534
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,240
You must be moving around because you're breaking

535
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:40,540
up.

536
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,780
I mean, if you find out these big

537
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:48,380
agricultural farmers, there are going to be more

538
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,080
agriculture.

539
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,480
Greek, hang on a second.

540
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,080
You just broke up all over the place.

541
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,080
Whoa.

542
00:15:59,280 --> 00:15:59,900
Can you hear me?

543
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,060
Oh, I might have lost the Greek anyway.

544
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,520
Well, you dropped out.

545
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,740
No, you were gone.

546
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,480
I was still going and speaking.

547
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,920
You went all robotic and crazy for a

548
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,220
minute there.

549
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,480
The last thing I heard is I'm in

550
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,100
the middle of a bunch of weather.

551
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:18,800
Device on.

552
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,700
OK, let's go inside.

553
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,800
Yeah, let's do this.

554
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,800
Sorry, because you just said I'm in the

555
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,480
middle of a bunch of rice and corn

556
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:25,960
farmers.

557
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,580
And then all of a sudden, I didn't

558
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,740
know that they were that wealthy.

559
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,220
Oh, you know, I didn't know how wealthy

560
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,660
they were in terms of their assets and

561
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,120
what they make selling crops.

562
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,200
It's it's a lot.

563
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:38,840
It's a lot.

564
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,700
And I was like, oh, farmers are poor,

565
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,020
right?

566
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,020
They don't have any bank, right?

567
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,440
No, they got a lot of bank.

568
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,380
Yeah, that's a complete fallacy.

569
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,020
That's true.

570
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,080
But yeah, I'm finding that out.

571
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,540
OK, let's let's move on anyway.

572
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,320
Yeah, absolutely.

573
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,340
Look, there was a couple of interesting things

574
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,640
again about, you know, what about the war

575
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,300
and all that.

576
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,160
But let's put that aside just for a

577
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:00,400
second.

578
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,100
So it was.

579
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,260
Didn't that fizzle out?

580
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,240
I mean, by now.

581
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,119
Well, that's the thing is they're asking, is

582
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:08,859
there now is the real action happening when

583
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:09,720
we're hearing nothing?

584
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,220
That's the overall question.

585
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,579
Very good.

586
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,220
Very good.

587
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,339
Because that's it.

588
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,339
That's exactly what they were coming to.

589
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,020
And that's what they wanted me to ask

590
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:19,180
you.

591
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,700
And I said, yeah, but yeah, but how

592
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,880
are you going to find out what's going

593
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,339
on if there's no input, you know, if

594
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:25,460
they're not making any sounds?

595
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,800
So now you have to go intuition.

596
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,240
You have to go to see how patterns

597
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:29,920
repeat.

598
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,120
Or you could have connections with real people

599
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,340
instead of, you know, entities.

600
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,880
And you can actually talk to a person

601
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,460
somewhere and say, hey, is there shooting going

602
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,980
on on the ground, boots on the ground?

603
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,120
What's the sentiment there?

604
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,100
Yeah, exactly.

605
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:40,620
Right.

606
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,840
Like a real reporter.

607
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,420
Like what they tell you they do on

608
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,940
the media, but they don't.

609
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,240
Anyway, a lot of trial or a cab

610
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,820
driver in a Capitol building, like someone who

611
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,180
has a cab driver, a limousine driver in

612
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:56,300
Tehran or in Tel Aviv, let's say, or

613
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:56,820
Moscow.

614
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,220
You know, they drive people around.

615
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,160
They hear things, right?

616
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,740
Bar bartenders.

617
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,600
The CIA is interested.

618
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,860
Most of the energy, you know, when it

619
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,060
comes to the people, they put energy into

620
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:13,400
cab drivers, bartenders, haircut, you know, people in

621
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,820
the service industry like that, especially where people

622
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,740
loosen up, right?

623
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:17,220
Right.

624
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,220
To get it, to get data information.

625
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,540
So if you're, let's say, a cab driver

626
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,020
in a whatever foreign country, you will get

627
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,440
approached by the CIA with the minimal connections

628
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,500
to, you know, get data.

629
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,400
So anyway.

630
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,100
And in some cultures, they'll go to the

631
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,020
massage therapist, by the way, because.

632
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:34,760
Oh, absolutely.

633
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,020
Yeah, because, you know, what do you hear

634
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,040
about when people go away on these resorts,

635
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:39,240
right?

636
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,580
They always go for these massages.

637
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,440
Everybody's talking and nobody's paying attention.

638
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,460
Everybody's relaxed.

639
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,660
And, you know, that's right.

640
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,680
They ignore it.

641
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,140
Yeah, they don't.

642
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:47,420
Right.

643
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,320
It's all that type of industry.

644
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:49,860
Exactly.

645
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,920
And like you said, the bars, people got

646
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,440
loose tongues.

647
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,360
So it all makes sense.

648
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,000
The bartender.

649
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:54,360
Yep.

650
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,360
The cab driver, the massage, whatever.

651
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,380
Happy ending, whatever.

652
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,500
Yeah, there you go.

653
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:58,940
All right.

654
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,460
So look, somebody asked for clarity.

655
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,480
Now, they already asked this question before, but

656
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,700
I guess you didn't quite clarify it for

657
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:04,840
him.

658
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,220
So let's run it by you one more

659
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:06,520
time.

660
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,220
I agree.

661
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,920
Just to clarify, are diagnoses such as pneumonia,

662
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:15,280
bronchitis and similar thesis, loss of vacuum issues?

663
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:15,960
Question mark.

664
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,600
Typically, they are.

665
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:17,920
Yes.

666
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,560
OK, typically they are a virus or a

667
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,020
bacteria.

668
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,960
But I want to understand it from biological

669
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,720
vacuum understanding.

670
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,840
OK, let's give it let's if someone really

671
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,520
wanted to get serious about it, we'll get

672
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,400
serious about it.

673
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,800
First of all, when you have a particular

674
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,600
when you target an area of the body,

675
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,220
let's say the pulmonary system.

676
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:40,640
Right.

677
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,640
You have discomfort.

678
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,040
So you go get checked out.

679
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,380
You get a diagnosis, whatever.

680
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:46,800
Right.

681
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:47,580
OK.

682
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:51,040
The reason why you're focusing on that area

683
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,680
is because that area has is suffering or

684
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:58,440
experiencing what's called irritation, inflammation, some some sort

685
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,160
of discomfort.

686
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,240
Right.

687
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:03,880
OK, so what causes the irritation or discomfort

688
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,580
in that area?

689
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,120
So why would you say lungs, pneumonia and

690
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,140
that and not kidneys or your feet or

691
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,840
your ear, right, or your scalp?

692
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:11,080
Right.

693
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,460
Well, because that's the one that's requiring your

694
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:17,320
attention due to some kind of signaling, nervous

695
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:17,860
signaling.

696
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,680
By the way, there's no nerve endings in

697
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,080
the lungs.

698
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,640
You manifest that usually between your shoulder blades.

699
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,740
You'll get cramping.

700
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,960
Yeah, because there's no nerve endings.

701
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:26,740
Yeah.

702
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,680
Just like there's no nerve endings in the

703
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,120
brain.

704
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:29,680
Mm hmm.

705
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:34,360
So so you're suffering some sort of irritation,

706
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,020
that irritation or weakening of that.

707
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,240
Let's call it an organ.

708
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,880
And you want to say, let's call it

709
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,740
an organ, because in medical terms, sometimes they

710
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,580
call something an organ and other times they

711
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,280
don't, depending if it's for an exam or

712
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,720
for practice or for study.

713
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,020
Right.

714
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:49,980
They flip flop.

715
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,000
So let's say those organs are irritating you

716
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,340
or not functioning right to the point where

717
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,480
to the point where you're feeling disabled.

718
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:58,740
Right.

719
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,300
You can't breathe or whatever.

720
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,000
Right.

721
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,280
So they're going to get it checked out.

722
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,440
OK, let's just bounce over to this next

723
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:05,780
part.

724
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,560
The viruses and bacteria are not the cause.

725
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,920
Your body creates that.

726
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,720
So if your body doesn't have the right

727
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:18,340
ecology or topography or condition, those things will

728
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,920
only live, cannot exist.

729
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,620
So in 99 percent of the cases where

730
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,920
a biopsy or something is found, a sampling

731
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,980
where there's certain distinct things that they've categorized

732
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:33,940
as the cause of the dysfunction or the

733
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:37,020
irritation known as bacteria or viruses that was

734
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,440
created by your body as an alternate effect.

735
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:43,140
So instead of the body creating, quote unquote,

736
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,940
wellness and fitness or healthy tissue, it's creating

737
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,420
these bacteria and viruses.

738
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:48,740
Right.

739
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,540
It's the opposite of what you're being told.

740
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,960
I'm not saying they don't exist.

741
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,300
They do.

742
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,620
But your body's creating them.

743
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:53,840
Right.

744
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:54,300
Right.

745
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,160
So so that's that's not.

746
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,820
So treating that will not work.

747
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,620
So the loss of vacuum is overall wellness

748
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:06,320
and fitness and health consideration.

749
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,220
So you can lose a certain amount of

750
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,040
vacuum and it won't affect your overall wellness

751
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,160
and fitness or health.

752
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,780
It's when you lose it long enough or

753
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,540
at times when it needs to be peaking.

754
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,180
It's not also at times when it needs

755
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,660
to be going down and diminishing.

756
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,280
It's not.

757
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,240
It's a balancing act.

758
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:24,620
Right.

759
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,980
So, again, out of balance.

760
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,540
The the lungs and all that they require

761
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,460
each organ requires a different type of therapy.

762
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:35,780
Right.

763
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,320
So the therapy for the lungs and all

764
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,760
that depends on the individual, depends on where

765
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,340
you live, because you're breathing and you're using

766
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,520
it and you're getting irritation from it.

767
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,400
It's usually going to be something in the

768
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,480
air, either where you live or where you

769
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,240
work or whatever.

770
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,660
And the other thing, it could be something

771
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:01,260
that is inherently, you know, a weak part

772
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:01,820
of your body.

773
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,820
So then you have to take that in

774
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,420
consideration.

775
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,680
But what always helps that is warm, moist

776
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,720
air and it has to be fresh air.

777
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,100
And that's the only thing that I would

778
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:13,880
seek for that.

779
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,520
And then, of course, a balanced diet.

780
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,280
You must have a very good balanced diet.

781
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,100
So otherwise, you know, here's the thing.

782
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,020
You can't tell someone this is good for

783
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,400
this and this is good for that without

784
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,000
really knowing their lifestyle, what they look like.

785
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,420
Also, you know, are they male or female?

786
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:31,760
Right.

787
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,580
Man or woman, you know, you can't there's

788
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,900
no there's a general thing what's good for

789
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,340
the lungs.

790
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,340
But if your lungs are irritated to the

791
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,740
point where you have a pneumonia, sorry, something

792
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:45,100
like a pneumonia where you have fluid build

793
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,960
up, they say the diet, there's something called

794
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,400
a plera.

795
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:48,640
Right.

796
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,360
We talked about it.

797
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,060
It's a vacuum.

798
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,300
It's an area around the diaphragm.

799
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,280
Maybe I'm not being as accurate as it

800
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,780
could be, but that's what's being affected, which

801
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,800
then affects the diaphragm, which then affects the

802
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,060
lungs.

803
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,540
So the easiest way to build up the

804
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:06,760
body's vacuum is with compression for a certain

805
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,140
area.

806
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,120
The other way is to do it is

807
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,520
with exercise, because when the when the body

808
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:16,520
goes through exercise vigor, the the heart rate

809
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,940
speeds up, which slows down the blood flow.

810
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:19,780
Right.

811
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,460
And then that's why you feel a throbbing

812
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,760
in your head if you're not fit.

813
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,320
But anyway, slows down the blood flow and

814
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,900
it gives the body a chance to recoup

815
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,460
the vacuum.

816
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:33,580
So actually trying to do exercise, people that

817
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,920
do exercise and work get less sick, usually

818
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,860
the people who don't.

819
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:41,440
So whatever exercise you you see to do

820
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,800
warm, warm, moist air, it has to be

821
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,580
fresh air, though.

822
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,000
If you're in a room, let's say your

823
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,960
bedridden, you have to have air exchange, not

824
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,480
like they do in hospitals where none of

825
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,240
the windows open.

826
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,340
And by the way, they found those filters

827
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,440
that those big buildings to be moldy and

828
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,340
laden with, you know, crap.

829
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,040
So, yeah, I don't know that I would

830
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,120
do other than that.

831
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,800
I would do a lot of vegetable broth,

832
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,460
parsley, tea, things like that.

833
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,900
Small plants like carrot tops and carrots, the

834
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,860
carrots with the tops simmered parsley tea.

835
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,360
I don't know if anyone here has ever

836
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,180
boil a pot of water, turn off the

837
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:26,280
water, throw the parsley in there, come back

838
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,280
the next day or overnight.

839
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,400
It's completely like pectin.

840
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,680
It's like jello.

841
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,320
Right.

842
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,240
You see what that does is good for

843
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,120
the body's vacuum.

844
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,900
So the body, the biological vacuum is something

845
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,400
that exists in all living things.

846
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,920
And that's how you you shut that down.

847
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,540
You cannot be alive in this type of

848
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,940
ecosystem that we have.

849
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:49,320
Right.

850
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,400
So everything required, anything alive, you know, requires

851
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,480
a biological vacuum and a vacuum and some

852
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:56,840
moisture.

853
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:57,980
There has to be some water.

854
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,180
Otherwise, no good.

855
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,040
Typically, there's some strange phenomenon like fungus.

856
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,520
Well, fungus goes into a crystal when all

857
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,600
those things don't exist.

858
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,060
And it could be a crystal in form

859
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,060
for thousands of years.

860
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,560
Then when the conditions are right, there's some

861
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,020
kind of brine, the sea monkeys.

862
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,400
OK, there's a brine shrimp or something that

863
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,740
you can dehydrate completely.

864
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:19,380
Yeah.

865
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,200
And a hundred years later, put it in

866
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,540
water and it comes to the right.

867
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,500
Remember the sea monkeys?

868
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,200
Yeah, they sell.

869
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,520
They used to sell them in comic books.

870
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

871
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,940
There's a whole there's some exceptions.

872
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,180
And those are interesting things to study.

873
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:31,920
Right.

874
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,260
What they call extremophiles.

875
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,040
But they're in.

876
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,380
But they're in like a stasis or like

877
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:37,660
a.

878
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:38,940
Yeah, exactly.

879
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,500
I don't understand how they do it.

880
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,080
I don't know without the moisture in it.

881
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:42,680
Yeah.

882
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,880
But the thing is, generally speaking, if something

883
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,220
is living and moving around, it requires the

884
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,820
biological vacuum and liquid.

885
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,920
If you go into like a stasis, a

886
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:54,000
cocoon, a what do they call that hibernation

887
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,720
type state?

888
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,120
That's a different bears out of bears.

889
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:57,860
Hibernate.

890
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,180
Right.

891
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,000
It's more than just bears, snakes, mice, rats.

892
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,300
So a lot of creatures are never discussed.

893
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:03,820
Hibernate.

894
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,100
There are various types of snakes that hibernate

895
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,660
for certain time periods and under certain conditions,

896
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,040
like in the cold.

897
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,580
A snake you can basically freeze to death.

898
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,880
Some snakes, you can freeze them to the

899
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,640
point where it would kill almost anything else.

900
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,020
You can throw them out and they're fine.

901
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,520
Flies also.

902
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,340
I mean, they're mad to fly their fridge.

903
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,980
The typical magic trick was they show some

904
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,260
people like dead flies and he moves them

905
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,600
in his hand and they fly away because,

906
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,120
you know, bugs in the fridge look like

907
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:30,560
they're dead.

908
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,120
Yeah, there's some interesting stuff that needs to

909
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,900
be studied to a degree, but not for

910
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,480
this society.

911
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:36,920
Here's the thing.

912
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,140
When I say this stuff needs to be

913
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,920
studied and brought forward, not in this society.

914
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,640
You're just going to be met with resistance

915
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,340
and you'll be shut down.

916
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,460
All this stuff is for the next society

917
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:49,140
to come or maybe you might want to

918
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:49,940
skip one or two.

919
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:50,480
Who knows?

920
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,680
And maybe the third one from now.

921
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,740
And it's also for those that want to

922
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,280
use it for their own personal benefit.

923
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,520
You know, you don't talk about it.

924
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,940
You just learn it and do it and

925
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,200
you share it with those that can handle

926
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:00,320
it.

927
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,040
But this is nothing that will ever become

928
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:02,540
popular.

929
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,420
Never, ever, ever.

930
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,680
If you've got to be like really dumb

931
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,800
to think that this kind of, let's say,

932
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,340
technology or knowledge will go out into society

933
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,400
and make society better.

934
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,100
No, no, no, no.

935
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,200
That will never, ever, ever, ever happen.

936
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:15,520
Right.

937
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,920
So look in this society.

938
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,640
I got one last question and then and

939
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,840
then I have something I want to ask

940
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,680
you for myself.

941
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:24,920
Just a random curiosity about condiments.

942
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,920
Anyways, so another person writes that universally it

943
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,520
seems like there are a lot of problems

944
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,740
where people have back pain.

945
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,980
Now, I understand that the narcotics are great

946
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,440
for curing the pain, but they don't solve

947
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,080
the issue.

948
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,300
They simply mask it.

949
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,340
And it does seem to be something that

950
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,980
is so common that there must be a

951
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:45,900
common solution.

952
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,600
Yeah, I think we got it.

953
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,460
We went over this maybe two sonics ago.

954
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,320
The first thing that I've noticed is the

955
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:55,540
concept of dread or fatalism in your life

956
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,100
will will be.

957
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:02,600
Oh, got sirens, sirens, sirens, right on time.

958
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,340
Fatalism in your life will make any the

959
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:09,620
slightest thing that would trigger back issues to

960
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,200
be triggered.

961
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,300
In other words, if you have back issues,

962
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,120
we're not talking about someone who fell off

963
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,740
of a horse and landed on their head

964
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,440
and woke up, was in a coma for

965
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,140
a month and then found out they had,

966
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:22,160
you know, L1, L2 and L3 crushed.

967
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,420
No, I'm talking about typical people.

968
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:27,520
I mean, myself included for years, every like

969
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,600
first or second week of February, I'd be

970
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,020
bedridden.

971
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,920
I could move because my back stiffened up

972
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,760
and I've had back injuries also.

973
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,460
But I noticed that the psychological part is

974
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,220
if there's any fatalism or defeat in your

975
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:44,500
life, like if you had a bad family

976
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,240
life and you don't know where you go,

977
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,780
you know, insecure financial stuff, all that stuff

978
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,540
adds up.

979
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,360
If you can really convince yourself that everything

980
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,520
is going to be fine, because here's the

981
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,920
thing, if everything's going to be fine in

982
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,600
the end, that means it's fine right now.

983
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,920
Well, no matter how bad it is.

984
00:29:59,040 --> 00:29:59,160
Right.

985
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,840
And honestly, look, when I was married to

986
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,600
my first wife, I had brutal back pain

987
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,260
all the time.

988
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:03,860
I get it.

989
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,320
But the thing is, it does seem to

990
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,140
be a common look.

991
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,400
I've had broken, broken bones in the neck

992
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:09,960
and the back.

993
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,580
So I know I'm misaligned a little bit

994
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,920
and there's not much I can seem to

995
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,100
do about putting it exactly back where it

996
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:16,800
needs to go.

997
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,900
So I'm always having it will adapt.

998
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:20,620
It will adapt.

999
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,420
There's people that are walking around with metal

1000
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,000
in their bodies, whether it was put there

1001
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,940
like our knee replacement or bullets in their

1002
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:29,060
bodies, fragments from battles and living in the

1003
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,800
ghetto, whatever.

1004
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,340
So, you know, here's the thing.

1005
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:37,060
Take care of that mental side first and

1006
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,060
it won't trigger that.

1007
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:40,200
The other thing is that I worked for

1008
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:40,320
me.

1009
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,580
The best was decompression.

1010
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,900
But if you have that fatalist doom kind

1011
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,160
of thing inside of you, it'll just come

1012
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:47,820
right back.

1013
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:52,960
So it's it's I found that most of

1014
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,720
the back stuff is psychological, meaning the spiritual,

1015
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,260
mental.

1016
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,740
But the thing is about the back is

1017
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:02,220
it has the ability to lock you up

1018
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,440
or you just can't move.

1019
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,440
And it's very painful to do anything, even

1020
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,140
go to the bathroom.

1021
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,420
So, you know, you can't even get out.

1022
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,140
You can't even just even turn over in

1023
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:10,400
bed.

1024
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:13,580
So it's I found that it's mostly a

1025
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,460
mind thing.

1026
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:18,620
The drugs will prove that it's a mind

1027
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:21,160
thing to a degree where you get more

1028
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,180
flexibility and all that.

1029
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,440
But it comes right back.

1030
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,920
So if you could take care of the

1031
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,660
mental side, the other side, there's a lot

1032
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,760
of, quote unquote, therapy.

1033
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,880
Always avoid surgery if you can.

1034
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,900
But, you know, there was a rash of

1035
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:39,600
third surgery promotion even since the nine.

1036
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,440
Remember the Lewis at LASIK even in the

1037
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,340
New York subway there, everybody who ever got

1038
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,040
LASIK, by the way, to the eye surgery

1039
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,120
went right back to how it was before

1040
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:47,600
surgery.

1041
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:47,860
Right.

1042
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,860
Everybody in the world, everybody in the world

1043
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,040
came.

1044
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,680
Oh, they got LASIK surgery now.

1045
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,740
They should be able to fix you.

1046
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,160
And I'm like, no, no, no, no, it

1047
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:54,500
doesn't.

1048
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,040
It goes right.

1049
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,940
It reverts right back to how it was

1050
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:57,540
before that.

1051
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,960
So all these surgeries, people get knee replacement,

1052
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,500
hip replacement, all that stuff.

1053
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,960
Yeah, they're a little better.

1054
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:03,880
But are they really?

1055
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,840
Most people want to say they're better because

1056
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,960
they don't want to seem like they got

1057
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,160
suckered right for doing the procedure.

1058
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,940
Well, nobody wants to avoid that.

1059
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:11,960
Always avoid surgery.

1060
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,040
Nobody wants to be the moron that paid

1061
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,240
a couple of grand for nothing.

1062
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,520
You know, no one wants to admit that

1063
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,700
they've been defrauded either.

1064
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,640
You know, that's why.

1065
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,200
So.

1066
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,400
So, yeah, I really don't have a solution

1067
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,360
direct other than the mechanical side.

1068
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,040
All I could say, again, good diet and

1069
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,700
decompression.

1070
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,020
If you can hang from a bar or

1071
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,200
whatever or stretch out, lay down.

1072
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,420
Actually, rolling, rolling, you know, that scene where

1073
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,440
children roll down a hill.

1074
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:35,900
Yeah.

1075
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:38,180
If you could roll down a hill where

1076
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:41,620
it literally gives you that kind of like

1077
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:44,900
pushing feeling, you know, it's going to it's

1078
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,160
going to mobilize you or just rolling across

1079
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,500
the floor, having someone stretch your arms and

1080
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,200
legs out and have someone roll you back

1081
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,180
and forth across the floor of a hardwood

1082
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,480
floor or carpet floor.

1083
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,020
It doesn't matter what the floor is, really.

1084
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,500
I found that that helps.

1085
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,960
I found it very helpful every every now

1086
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,980
and then to use a cement slab that

1087
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,560
is smooth and lay down on it and

1088
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,680
then make sure to straighten my spine, like

1089
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,580
literally take even the arch out of the

1090
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:09,860
spine.

1091
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,420
Very slow breathing and you'll feel releases in

1092
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:13,860
your spine.

1093
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:14,380
Exactly.

1094
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,120
That's what I do.

1095
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,480
And that's a natural way of decompressing the

1096
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:17,900
whole thing.

1097
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,780
And you lay down straight and that doesn't

1098
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,940
that doesn't help if you have feelings of

1099
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:22,900
doom and gloom.

1100
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,060
Well, no personal ones.

1101
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:24,280
Yeah.

1102
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,240
The back pain will come right back.

1103
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,680
And yeah, it sounds kind of crazy.

1104
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,800
Again, I don't have a direct solution.

1105
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,000
It depends on who it is.

1106
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:32,380
Right.

1107
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,760
You have to be able to, you know,

1108
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,200
do diagnosis.

1109
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,180
A proper diagnosis is just like what these

1110
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:38,760
quacks do.

1111
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,460
They look at you.

1112
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:39,700
Right.

1113
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:40,920
Diagnose you.

1114
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:41,180
Right.

1115
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:45,360
But the way a proper diagnosis would be,

1116
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:48,260
would be also query, find out what the

1117
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:48,980
person's habits.

1118
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,980
Anyone, anyone lived in New York or San

1119
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,200
Francisco and went to a Chinese apothecary or

1120
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,320
near a Chinatown where they have the Chinese

1121
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,160
doctor, they come out.

1122
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:56,860
And they have a questionnaire.

1123
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,200
You know, how's your sex life?

1124
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,820
Are you angry at anyone?

1125
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,080
Are you happy?

1126
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,300
Do you this stuff?

1127
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,300
The medical quacks here don't ask.

1128
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:05,560
Right.

1129
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:05,840
Yeah.

1130
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,880
They ask you a hundred things.

1131
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,100
Yeah.

1132
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:09,219
You know, all kinds of questions, you know,

1133
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,560
first of your they they need to know

1134
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,239
what type of person, you know, how you

1135
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:14,880
function.

1136
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,179
You know, I love best is the acupuncturist

1137
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:18,139
who I said, how the hell do you

1138
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,139
know where to stick the needles?

1139
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,719
And he said, I don't worry about it

1140
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:21,239
doesn't matter.

1141
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,340
And he put him in.

1142
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,300
It didn't hurt.

1143
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,040
It was great.

1144
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:25,940
It was like, right, right.

1145
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,139
But that's it only if you ask nine

1146
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:29,620
out of 10 acupuncture, they don't know what

1147
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,199
the what the basis of it is.

1148
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:31,960
No, but it worked.

1149
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:32,840
Actually, it was funny.

1150
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,800
It actually worked on my knee really well.

1151
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,800
I was like, wow, my knee just like

1152
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,300
stopped swelling and I could use it again.

1153
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:38,920
Thank you.

1154
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,139
I didn't even care.

1155
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,500
And I didn't know how it worked anyway.

1156
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,320
Yeah, it is.

1157
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,300
It is a valid it's a valid science.

1158
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,239
It is a valid science.

1159
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,340
And he didn't even want to, you know,

1160
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,960
what's he going to explain it to me?

1161
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,239
Anyway, speaking of this, I just my last

1162
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:51,760
little thing.

1163
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,480
I noticed that lately I've been like wanting

1164
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,460
mustard and I don't know what I'm not

1165
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,200
usually a mustard guy, but condiments.

1166
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,560
I've been going after mustard.

1167
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,980
And I'm curious if sometimes maybe there's certain

1168
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:05,100
like condiments that you wind up sort of

1169
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:05,520
craving.

1170
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:09,120
And if that's because I'm now, you know,

1171
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,060
doing that thing where you're like, I noticed

1172
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,880
that if I need certain things, I go

1173
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,080
looking for, you know, some of those nutritional

1174
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:16,580
things.

1175
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,600
And I'm wondering if the condiments are like

1176
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,700
that, too, because very much because the condiments

1177
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,880
are what balances out a meal.

1178
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,100
So the one thing, if let's say someone

1179
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,060
said someone's craving mustard, what would that mean?

1180
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,660
First of all, it means that the weather

1181
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:30,340
is getting warmer and you crave that to

1182
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,900
relief that change that the warm weather does.

1183
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:33,200
Right.

1184
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,140
OK, the other thing that it would be

1185
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,640
is you eat your meat intake.

1186
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,380
Animal intake is increased somehow or animal fat

1187
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,740
has increased somehow.

1188
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,060
So those those three things, you know, I

1189
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,300
would first suggestions I would make if you're

1190
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:49,120
someone is increasing their craving of mustard.

1191
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,680
All three of those things are true.

1192
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,880
OK, no, no, no.

1193
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,500
I had not been able to eat meat

1194
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,220
for a bit because we just didn't have

1195
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:55,380
it.

1196
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,380
And then when I started to again, yes,

1197
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:57,740
same thing.

1198
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,560
And I'm starting to get your animal intake

1199
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,300
is increased.

1200
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,420
So you're craving mustard.

1201
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:01,980
It's normal.

1202
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,140
That's a balancing act because your body is

1203
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,900
aware of the mustard balancing out in, you

1204
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,560
know, unconsciously.

1205
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:09,680
Perfect.

1206
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,140
So, yeah, see, it works.

1207
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,600
I mean, these are general.

1208
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,260
But then when you meet the person, you

1209
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,560
look at their, you know, you do a

1210
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,420
facial diagnosis.

1211
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:19,160
You see, you ask someone to sit down

1212
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:19,940
and stand up.

1213
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,220
I see how, you know, when someone sits

1214
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,480
down, how they sit down.

1215
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,280
You know, some people just drop themselves in

1216
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:25,540
a chair.

1217
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,400
Some people are very careful and lower themselves.

1218
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,480
Some people lower themselves.

1219
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,420
They look like they're in pain.

1220
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,220
You know, you learn a lot by just

1221
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:31,920
as people do.

1222
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,580
It's kind of like the job interview is

1223
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,500
sorting out coins.

1224
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,240
I have my own way of diagnosing people.

1225
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,300
It's usually spot on.

1226
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,440
And, you know, when I do this stuff,

1227
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,500
it's like more than nine out of ten

1228
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,840
people get relief or get better or completely

1229
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,640
fix whatever they're coming to me for.

1230
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:49,020
So because it's very simple, it's universal principles,

1231
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:49,280
right?
