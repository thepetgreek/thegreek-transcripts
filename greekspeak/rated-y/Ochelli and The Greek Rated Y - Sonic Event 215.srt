1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,890
All right, so you're set to roll, right?

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:03,610
Yep.

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,730
All right, so here we go.

4
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:19,570
Rated Y Sonic Event 215.

5
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,890
Greek, it's warm here.

6
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:23,630
Is it warm there?

7
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:25,410
Yeah, it's hot.

8
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,470
And by the way, I'm enjoying some cold

9
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,350
pizza from like three hours ago.

10
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:31,470
I have a little pizza oven.

11
00:00:31,729 --> 00:00:33,890
Just can't stop eating it, you know, sometimes.

12
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:34,710
Awesome.

13
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,310
Your homemade stuff then?

14
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,050
Oh yeah, my own stuff.

15
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:40,070
I haven't bought pizza in a long time.

16
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,850
And I send pictures to people and it's

17
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:43,850
as good as it gets.

18
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:44,950
No, definitely.

19
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:46,050
I've got no doubt.

20
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:49,070
800 degree oven, 90 seconds, you know.

21
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:50,130
Nice.

22
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,650
Do you put it straight on a stone?

23
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,130
I have no choice.

24
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,290
It's a stone brick oven pizza.

25
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:01,330
I mean, not brick, it's a pizza oven.

26
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,209
There's a thermometer that goes up to a

27
00:01:03,209 --> 00:01:05,210
thousand degrees on top.

28
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,630
So, you know, it closes completely.

29
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:11,290
It has various adjustments, a chimney, stone.

30
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,610
It's about a medium, it's like 18 by

31
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:14,170
24.

32
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:15,810
You can't do a lot.

33
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:16,870
You can't do a lot.

34
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,690
I'm just trying to figure out how to

35
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:20,550
create more pressure.

36
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,930
Because what makes it work well is you

37
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,550
don't want to rely on the heat that's

38
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,090
in the oven when the pizza's in there.

39
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,630
You want to rely on the heat that

40
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,790
was in the oven, right?

41
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,130
In other words, if you put your pizza

42
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,010
in, you're not looking to increase your fuel

43
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,090
or anything, it's too late.

44
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:43,570
In other words, the pizza should cook based

45
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,570
on whatever heat is in the oven already.

46
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,130
And I have the heat, I just don't

47
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:47,750
have the pressure.

48
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,350
So I need to make it a little

49
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:49,670
bigger.

50
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,350
But anyway.

51
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,830
Well, that's why when you go to any

52
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,370
of those pizza joints on the East Coast,

53
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,910
it used to be anyway, you know, the

54
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:57,770
big metal thing, the springs would really slam

55
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:00,030
it shut to pressurize the inside, right?

56
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:00,430
Right.

57
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,390
Well, it's those Blodgett ovens.

58
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,050
Yeah, those are classics, gas fired.

59
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:04,350
Yeah.

60
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:05,450
They're not bad.

61
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,030
They're not bad.

62
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,070
But they're pretty good.

63
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,250
Better than conveyor belts.

64
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,090
We go west of the Mississippi, they do

65
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,250
pizza on conveyor belts.

66
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,130
It's disgusting.

67
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:12,650
But anyway.

68
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,750
Yeah, that's terrible.

69
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,390
But I was thinking of the one I

70
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,930
saw one in a home once with a

71
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,910
stone slab that they put in the bottom

72
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,450
of the thing and they actually just put.

73
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,150
It was weird, but it worked.

74
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,430
Well, it's the same principle as like there's

75
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,770
a Japanese and Korean rice recipe where you

76
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,610
have a granite bowl, a very heavy ceramic

77
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,970
bowl, and you put that in the fire,

78
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:33,970
remove it from the fire.

79
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,970
Then you put your water and rice and

80
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:36,490
cover it.

81
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:36,730
Right.

82
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,210
So whatever heat is held in the container

83
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,650
is enough to cook what you're doing.

84
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,270
So crepes are done that way.

85
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,730
When I make crepes, I heat the pan,

86
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,590
turn it off, take it off the flame,

87
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,110
put my mixture in there.

88
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:47,370
Right.

89
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:47,830
You don't want.

90
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:48,130
Right.

91
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,510
So that's how people make that mistake all

92
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,850
the time with, you know, they burn the

93
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,650
outside of the thing, but the inside is

94
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,870
still like not even fully cooked because they

95
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,390
didn't take that into account.

96
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:57,670
Right.

97
00:02:58,690 --> 00:02:59,070
Yeah.

98
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,650
Well, the whole thing about cooking is, you

99
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,250
know, heat and chemistry, but chemistry the way

100
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,630
we're taught chemistry, which is boring and unintuitive

101
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,510
and false.

102
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,290
But generally all the chemistry that works, that's

103
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:17,310
used in industry was established way before modern

104
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,810
chemistry, you know.

105
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,670
Like, you know, varying the heat levels to

106
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:26,030
get certain effects that create chemical combinations based

107
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,390
on the conditions.

108
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,350
So anyway, that's one of them.

109
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,050
So what do you got?

110
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,850
We got some input, output questions and comments.

111
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,190
I got a few things and they're all

112
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:39,290
responses to the most recent Sonics.

113
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,610
So here we go.

114
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,910
How could a bank possibly fail when it

115
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,750
effectively creates nine times the value of every

116
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,570
loan it issues?

117
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,830
It seems like they'd have to be incredibly

118
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,650
reckless to ever run out of credit.

119
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,070
No, they don't.

120
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,530
Well, yeah, there is fractional banking.

121
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:56,890
It's not as simple as that.

122
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,050
But yes, that's generally a true statement.

123
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,190
What they do is very simple.

124
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,670
They do what the cartels do and all

125
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,190
that banks fail in this way.

126
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,490
They all do questionable activity.

127
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:12,470
And there's a cycle where the regulation authorities

128
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:16,529
or government or whatever, let's say shareholders and

129
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:18,350
regulators have to come down on the banks

130
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,750
because they've been doing all this crap for

131
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,570
10 years, let's say.

132
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,490
Right, right.

133
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,810
So what they do is they find someone

134
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:27,450
in their group, in their industry, another bank,

135
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,930
and they start making it very easy for

136
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:33,430
them to acquire all these products that they

137
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,630
know is going to be under question.

138
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,990
And they load up one company with all

139
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,290
these things that the regulatory and the government

140
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,970
could come after them on one bank.

141
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,890
And then they crash that bank.

142
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,270
Lehman Brothers is an example of that recently.

143
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:48,550
I mean, almost all the banks that I

144
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,370
grew up with, like remember Chemical Bank, Manhattan

145
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,590
Bank, all that, they're gone.

146
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,750
So what did the same thing the cartels

147
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,050
do?

148
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,910
It's like when the cartels are when they're

149
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,630
tired of the way one is doing business

150
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,630
or they have they seem weak, you know,

151
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,230
while a pack of wild dogs or wolves

152
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,470
will attack the weakest one.

153
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:06,750
Right.

154
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,690
So when someone's weak or whatever with the

155
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,890
cartels, they get the DEA to bust them.

156
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,050
It's very simple.

157
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:13,470
Right.

158
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,090
The DEA only goes after who the cartels

159
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,450
tell them to take out because a weak

160
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:22,470
institution will also leave a stain on the

161
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:23,610
industry's name.

162
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,010
So they don't really go out of business.

163
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,890
They load up, front load all their crap

164
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,310
to take the light.

165
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,550
So when you tell all the idiots, oh,

166
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,290
this bank was the worst and it went

167
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:36,710
out of business.

168
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:37,490
Good, good.

169
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:38,670
They don't know what's going on.

170
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:38,850
Right.

171
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:41,950
If you go out and interview a thousand

172
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,030
people right now, just general, it doesn't matter

173
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,770
if they're college professors, even bankers.

174
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,750
None of you might have one out of

175
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,230
a thousand that has an inkling based on

176
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,550
the question that was just asked.

177
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,230
Very few people know how it works because

178
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,290
it's a planet of idiots.

179
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:54,890
Well, right.

180
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,590
Like you said, with the cartel members, they'll

181
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,050
turn around and they'll dump a bunch of

182
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,710
product on them nice and cheap so that

183
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:00,690
they're well stocked.

184
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,350
And then they turn the DEA on to

185
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,130
them to legitimize the DEA.

186
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,430
And therefore, the DEA looks like they're doing

187
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,070
their job.

188
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,810
And therefore, the black market is sustained.

189
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:10,150
Right.

190
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,070
I mean, it's literally.

191
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,870
Well, the more regulation, the more black market.

192
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,150
So if they want to if you want

193
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,810
to pump up the black market, because that's

194
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,610
what you want to invest in, you pump

195
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:20,370
up regulation.

196
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:23,050
When you remove regulation, the black market becomes

197
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:23,370
weak.

198
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:24,690
Look at the cannabis market.

199
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:25,670
Right.

200
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,670
You don't see too many pot dealers at

201
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,070
Washington Square Park anymore.

202
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,230
No, not so many.

203
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,450
The only reason why pot.

204
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:32,050
It's not any.

205
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,790
Well, the only reason why pot dealers have

206
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,390
any business in any of the states is

207
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,230
because they've overtaxed.

208
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,350
So now if somebody needs to go for

209
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,370
the discount weed.

210
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:41,330
It's cheaper.

211
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:41,750
Yeah.

212
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,310
It's the it's the bunk stuff.

213
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:43,610
Yeah.

214
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:43,950
So.

215
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:44,550
So.

216
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,250
But that's how basically it works.

217
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,930
Years ago, knowing people in law enforcement, you

218
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,510
pull out an article, they busted, you know,

219
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,630
40 pounds of cocaine, all these pills and

220
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:53,950
all that.

221
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,830
And I look at the guy in law

222
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,030
enforcement.

223
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,150
This is going to be on the street

224
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,250
in about three months.

225
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:58,510
Right.

226
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:58,970
None of it.

227
00:06:59,210 --> 00:06:59,370
None of it.

228
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,230
A little tiny amount, maybe one percent of

229
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:01,950
evidence from.

230
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,130
Yeah, that's right.

231
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,150
Sure.

232
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:05,290
Yeah.

233
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,490
This is a human problem and they're morons.

234
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:11,810
And I still don't get what's really going

235
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:12,390
on here.

236
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:15,470
I've kind of stopped researching other things because

237
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:18,970
I've seen enough, not too much enough.

238
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,590
And it's bad on both ends.

239
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,670
In other words, the institutions, whether it's medical,

240
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:28,690
government, banking, religious are so fucked up and

241
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:29,430
what they're doing.

242
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,430
And the people are so fucked up because

243
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,250
they do nothing.

244
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,650
It's just a big fucked up sandwich.

245
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:35,050
Right.

246
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,210
You know, like soup sandwich in the military.

247
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:37,590
Right.

248
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:38,030
Mm hmm.

249
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,750
Army and running the army of soup sandwich.

250
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:40,030
Right.

251
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:40,790
So anyway.

252
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,230
Yeah.

253
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,790
It's just you don't want to if you

254
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,870
know the situation is so fucked up all

255
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,130
around.

256
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,750
Always has been always will be.

257
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,470
Why do you want to keep going into

258
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:50,610
it?

259
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,330
Just do what it takes to have a

260
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:52,830
good life.

261
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,550
But the banking thing is that they don't

262
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,310
loan money as very clear.

263
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,430
So just stick on that.

264
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,590
So like if you go to a bank

265
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,670
and you have a loan, a car loan,

266
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:03,090
house owner.

267
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,670
OK, you said a loan.

268
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:05,070
Right.

269
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,810
Well, you're not allowed to loan and show

270
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,350
me how you let me something that you

271
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,150
already had.

272
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,750
And they avoid that question saying, well, you

273
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,390
agreed to give us all security interest.

274
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:18,410
So what they do is it's kind of

275
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,830
like you go to Starbucks, you buy your

276
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,530
coffee, you go outside and you're ready to

277
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,350
leave the place or go into your car.

278
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:24,610
So you got to pay for that again.

279
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,710
They don't tell you got to pay for

280
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:27,850
it because you didn't pay for it.

281
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,250
That's why all loans have to be what

282
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:33,940
secured.

283
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,340
You pay.

284
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,059
You have to repay.

285
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:36,720
Oh, repay.

286
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,159
Repay.

287
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:37,820
Yes, yes, yes.

288
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:38,400
Yeah.

289
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,880
Repay means you already paid for it.

290
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,900
So when you have a loan, you have

291
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,720
to repay it.

292
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:42,559
A car.

293
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,300
You get a car loan.

294
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:43,660
You have to.

295
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,840
It says on the paper, you have to

296
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,560
repay the loan because it's already been paid.

297
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,100
Yes.

298
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:47,740
By you.

299
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,060
So we obviously, by my definition, means you're

300
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:51,700
paying again.

301
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,540
You're not paying it.

302
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:52,880
Yeah.

303
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,520
Repaying it.

304
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,160
You've already paid it.

305
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,360
Yeah.

306
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,680
So everything belongs to the United States.

307
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,320
Now, most people think it's because of the

308
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:00,780
bankruptcy.

309
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,500
But I dare you to look up and

310
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,420
read the Articles of Confederation, which are 1774,

311
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:06,940
roughly.

312
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,420
And they say that all debts belong to

313
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,120
the United States.

314
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,200
You know, the corporate government.

315
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:11,460
Right.

316
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,000
Always.

317
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,820
It's kind of like think of it this

318
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:13,920
way.

319
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,800
When you work in a corporation, a big

320
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,640
company, and you're using the company car, who

321
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,480
pays for the gas?

322
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,560
The company.

323
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,640
Who pays?

324
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:21,880
Right.

325
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,960
Who pays for the uniform?

326
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:23,640
The company.

327
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,000
Who pays for the company car?

328
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,580
So because whatever is under the United States

329
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,320
jurisdiction, they have to pay for it.

330
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:29,600
Right.

331
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,500
And I'm using the term pay, however.

332
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,160
Right.

333
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:33,580
I understand.

334
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,540
So this has been going on even before

335
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,880
1750, even.

336
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,740
It was the same thing.

337
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,980
When you form a corporate, a government that

338
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,440
has administrative power in a corporate capacity, they

339
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,300
pay for everything.

340
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,760
And part of this situation, well, OK, if

341
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,040
you look back at history, especially 1900s history,

342
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,340
which is still fairly tangible, you'll find that

343
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,240
there was a big mistrust of the banks

344
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:56,980
by everyone.

345
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:57,540
Right.

346
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:57,860
Right.

347
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,800
And but the problem there was that they

348
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,000
didn't educate those that were mistrusting the banks,

349
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,480
let's say.

350
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,580
They just say mistrust, don't trust the banks,

351
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,700
because the interest of the banks goes so

352
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,560
far and deep.

353
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,500
You see.

354
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,000
So.

355
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,440
So, yeah, it's just it's a shit show,

356
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,600
clown show, dumpster fire here, whatever.

357
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,540
It's always been that way.

358
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,020
Always.

359
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,500
And it always will be under the current

360
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,820
structure of society.

361
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,480
What I mean by structure of society is

362
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,220
like when you have a family unit that

363
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,200
has children and raises their children, it's going

364
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,020
to be fucked up because all you got

365
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,220
to do is fuck up the head of

366
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,580
the household and the rest of the family

367
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,120
is fucked up.

368
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,340
Right.

369
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,000
Of course, I'm using the medical term.

370
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,180
Right.

371
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,160
So the proper way to raise a family

372
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,700
is they have the children.

373
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,360
The children are taken away to a camp.

374
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,880
How would you call it?

375
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,440
Like a boarding situation.

376
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,220
And they're raised by people who are competent

377
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,460
and have the capacity to properly educate a

378
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,380
child, not daddy or mommy.

379
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,220
Right.

380
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,020
And this happens.

381
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,980
This is actually a model that you might

382
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,680
have seen demonstrated in some of these, quote,

383
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,380
unquote, hardcore communist countries.

384
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:04,500
Right.

385
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,340
And they're not wrong.

386
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,040
It's just that they're corrupt again because.

387
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:08,820
Yeah.

388
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,000
So it's always the corruption is always the

389
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,520
root of the issue when things go sideways.

390
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,200
I mean.

391
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:15,640
Yeah.

392
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,060
Yeah.

393
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,300
It's in the genetic purification, like nine out

394
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,040
of 10 times.

395
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,160
If you know a parent of a disabled

396
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,200
child, like someone who can't take care of

397
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,920
themselves at all, meaning that if they live

398
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,320
till 40, they'll still be in diapers.

399
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,560
You know, of course, you know, say all

400
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,300
things aside, you'll do anything for your child

401
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:32,780
because you're a child.

402
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,880
But if you knew this prior to them

403
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,340
being born, would you have still had them

404
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:37,520
born?

405
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,020
And they always say, no, I wouldn't have

406
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,460
had them born for them and for me.

407
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,020
Right.

408
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:42,640
Right.

409
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,580
So there is a thing where there's a

410
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,280
there was a Greek Likud goes and he

411
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,020
would go around.

412
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,080
This is an ancient Greece.

413
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,160
And you would go around and they would

414
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,440
have an inspection for children.

415
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,340
And if the child was deformed or slow

416
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,960
in any way, how do you find out

417
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,380
if a child is slow when they're less

418
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,600
than six months old?

419
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,180
I don't know.

420
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,420
They had a pit.

421
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,480
They would just throw you in.

422
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:01,700
Right.

423
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,560
So there's an ethnic ethnic, but the genetic

424
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,180
cleansing, it was in the Third Reich.

425
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,340
Also, if you were wherever they just got

426
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,640
rid of you, that was the policy.

427
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:16,120
And this is not ongoing for the entire

428
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,020
duration of human society.

429
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:18,560
No.

430
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,480
The well-known story of Sparta is exactly

431
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:21,820
that.

432
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:22,900
Similar.

433
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:23,260
Yeah.

434
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:23,620
Yeah.

435
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,140
I don't know if they had the genetic

436
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,080
cleansing type thing.

437
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,800
Where this this is absolutely necessary at this

438
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,200
point.

439
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,360
But it's going to be much more drastic

440
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,160
because you're going to have a massive population

441
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,140
decrease across the board and the retards will

442
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,380
still be with us, unfortunately.

443
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:38,920
Right.

444
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,360
But it's not a good place yet.

445
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,380
But the Spartans examined the child at birth

446
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,660
and looked at it and said, if there

447
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,160
was something wrong with it or whatever, that's

448
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:45,360
it.

449
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:45,980
They just let.

450
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,020
Yeah, that's right.

451
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:47,220
Yeah.

452
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:47,560
Yeah.

453
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,200
And that is proper to do when you're

454
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,560
building a society, when you build it up

455
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,060
enough and you have proper breeding programs and

456
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:56,400
all this.

457
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,260
Remember a program.

458
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,080
Right.

459
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,500
Because people don't know what they're doing.

460
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,780
It's just like the idea, like, oh, women

461
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,680
think they're good at sex.

462
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,200
What a joke.

463
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:02,500
Right.

464
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,840
Go read a book or something or whatever.

465
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,680
You know, so there's a joke that this

466
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,620
is a self writing joke that the family

467
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,400
unit is good.

468
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:11,980
Bullshit.

469
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,060
You got to look at what what's going

470
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:14,580
on inside.

471
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,600
How is it being by who?

472
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,440
I'm how two morons get together and procreate.

473
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,520
You're going to get another moron.

474
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:20,960
What the hell?

475
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,400
Stop.

476
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:21,880
Stop.

477
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:22,940
Stop.

478
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:23,720
Right.

479
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,360
But fortunately, it hasn't been working that way

480
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,680
because there's a spiritual level that overtakes it

481
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,700
where you could have a moron parents and

482
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,480
sisters and brothers.

483
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,880
And that child is a genius.

484
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,820
And the black sheep, it's called the black

485
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,520
sheep of the family complex.

486
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,260
Right.

487
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,200
So, yeah.

488
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,200
But he's got they've got he or she

489
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,540
has so much working against them as they're

490
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,520
in their formative years.

491
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,300
And can you imagine if they were cultivated

492
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:48,900
properly?

493
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,520
So anyway, I can you know, I've talked

494
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,360
about this before.

495
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,180
This is society is very easy to fix

496
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:54,440
it.

497
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,780
People based on their conventional training and what

498
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,040
they've been trained as good and bad won't

499
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,540
like it at all if they find out

500
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,740
what it takes to fix any society in

501
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,400
any world.

502
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,760
It's the same thing.

503
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,580
It's the same thing as farming, whatever you

504
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,260
are being farmed, just like the banking was

505
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:10,800
brought up.

506
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,920
It's like they tell the cows, imagine cows

507
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,360
can talk and they back and forth with

508
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:14,580
humans.

509
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,700
All you got to do is go out

510
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,680
in the field, eat the grass.

511
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,820
We take some milk from you in a

512
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:17,960
while.

513
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,800
And that's and that's it.

514
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,840
Yeah, that's it.

515
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,820
No, there's a lot more to that.

516
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,300
That's how humans are.

517
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:24,660
Yeah.

518
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,420
Just go get a bank.

519
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:25,800
Get a loan.

520
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,140
First of all, banks don't even lend money.

521
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,420
It's illegal for them to do that.

522
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:28,660
Right.

523
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,740
So back to the banking.

524
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,440
But you've signed all your interest away.

525
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,980
It's called a gift.

526
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,920
And you actually become an investor in their

527
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,360
company.

528
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,160
It's the same with.

529
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,460
And if you bring this up and say,

530
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,780
well, you're saying is unconventional and not traditional,

531
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,020
you know, because traditional conventional be fucked up

532
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,160
and give everything away and then go back

533
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,480
to those that you know and complain.

534
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,880
People don't complain to the banks and they

535
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,640
complain to their own people that they know

536
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,640
their friends are getting screwed by the base,

537
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,500
but they don't go to the bank and

538
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:56,940
deal with it.

539
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,140
Right.

540
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,020
So it's indirect.

541
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,300
No responsibility.

542
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,340
Medical doctors are the same way.

543
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,760
You know, lawyers are the same way.

544
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,160
It's all it's all just a clown show

545
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:07,980
where you want to call it.

546
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I won't use the F word again.

547
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,160
What else you got?

548
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,420
The connection between musicians and their children dying

549
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,340
at such a young age is very intriguing.

550
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,480
What about the so-called 27 Club?

551
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,140
Question mark.

552
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,100
Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison, Jim Morrison

553
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,040
again for some reason.

554
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,860
Kurt Cobain, Janice Joplin.

555
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,540
Coincidence or ritual is the question.

556
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,220
And let's just end the conversation by saying

557
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,100
the best band ever is Tool, period.

558
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,080
You like the tool, do you?

559
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:36,780
That's fine.

560
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,100
It's so subjective to me.

561
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,060
Like if you ask me what's my favorite

562
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,800
food, it depends on when you're asking me

563
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,800
what I feel like eating.

564
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,100
Right.

565
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,620
You know, and also when you ask a

566
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,840
question like favorite food, you mean sweet, savory,

567
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:49,200
what?

568
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,500
Because you're sweet and savory.

569
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:50,780
Right.

570
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,800
There's on dinner and dessert.

571
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,040
Right.

572
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:53,900
What's your favorite dessert?

573
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,820
What's your favorite dinner?

574
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,360
Breakfast, lunch, whatever.

575
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,260
OK, so forget favorite.

576
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,480
So what about the 27?

577
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,440
I'm not familiar, but I know the ones

578
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,260
that are mentioned and more are about right

579
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,940
in terms of, you know, saying that there

580
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:06,660
is a club for that.

581
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,320
Yeah, I have no direct knowledge of it.

582
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,120
I just just like anyone, you know, when

583
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,680
the facts and the statistics are brought forward,

584
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,580
you can surmise, hey, there's something going on.

585
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,740
But we do know what the child sacrifice.

586
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:19,740
That's pretty eminent.

587
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,000
I mean, that's pretty obvious and open.

588
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,540
But the 27, I don't know much about

589
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,800
it, but keep looking.

590
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,660
Well, I'll ask you this question, even though

591
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,800
the listener asked me and I'll just tag

592
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,120
along.

593
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,280
We lost you.

594
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,060
Oh, you don't know.

595
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,040
You don't hear me.

596
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:36,880
Hello.

597
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,640
OK, Greek doesn't hear me, I guess.

598
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,660
There you go.

599
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,920
I walk too far away.

600
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,700
OK, sorry.

601
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,040
I was hearing you the whole time.

602
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:44,980
Anyway.

603
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,000
Hi, Greek.

604
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,820
Listen, this is a question they asked me,

605
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,660
but I'm going to ask you anyway, and

606
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,020
then I'll just tail on to your answer,

607
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:52,340
OK?

608
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,740
Do you think do you think Randy Rhodes

609
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,540
was sacrificed or Cliff Burton?

610
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,580
Just to name a few.

611
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,740
It seems after a member dies, the bands

612
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,500
take off and start to do well.

613
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,700
Is that something that happens as well?

614
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,300
A band member?

615
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:04,640
Yeah.

616
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,980
Yeah, very much so.

617
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,339
Businesses do that as well.

618
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:07,560
Yeah.

619
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,920
You know, Elon Musk with Tesla, you know,

620
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,560
they loaded back in the early 2000s.

621
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,720
They loaded their best engineers in a small

622
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,780
airplane and on their way back from Washington,

623
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,700
D.C., crashed and killed all of them.

624
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:20,780
Right.

625
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,079
I heard about that, but I've never seen

626
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,780
anything on it like, you know.

627
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,680
You'll find it.

628
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,900
You'll find if you look at it.

629
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,560
I remember in real time.

630
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:29,960
Yeah.

631
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,240
And, you know, when it when it happened

632
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,380
in the media, I was like, Tesla car.

633
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:33,780
Cool.

634
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,400
I was like, oh, that's not really Tesla.

635
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,040
Why?

636
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,300
They shouldn't even be using his name.

637
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,060
What a fraud.

638
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:38,560
Yeah.

639
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,660
But, you know, if it's not a fraud,

640
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,780
no one will go for it.

641
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:40,980
Right.

642
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,280
So.

643
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:41,840
Yeah.

644
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:42,500
True enough.

645
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,040
I mean, everything has to be a fraud.

646
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,620
Otherwise, it wouldn't be traditional and it wouldn't

647
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,100
be acceptable.

648
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,160
Anyways, Rage Against the Machine, because I brought

649
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:49,660
it up.

650
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,560
Yeah, I like them.

651
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:54,040
Weren't they one of the bands during the

652
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,260
COVID PSYOP requiring their audience at their concerts

653
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,580
to be fully vaccinated?

654
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,300
Question mark.

655
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,540
Sounds like they are working for the machine.

656
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,320
Well, look.

657
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,740
Here's the thing about it.

658
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:03,880
Of course they are.

659
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,420
They all are.

660
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,000
You asked about music.

661
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,400
You, the listener, asked about music.

662
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,640
So I gave you what I like about

663
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,340
the music, their music, their lyrics.

664
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,080
I enjoy it.

665
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,320
I find it valid.

666
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,300
And it's good.

667
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:15,940
It's good stuff.

668
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,520
It's strong.

669
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,080
Even the Greeks said the the sound, the

670
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,440
tempo was useful, you know, in biking and

671
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:21,960
this and that.

672
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,560
Other people have told me about using it

673
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,380
during exercise, et cetera.

674
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,960
So, yeah, music.

675
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,900
But their politics, if you get into their

676
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,220
politics, you're going down a weird, twisted road.

677
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,700
It's it's like Hollywood.

678
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,620
It's an arm of the government, in other

679
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,920
words, just like the circuses and the bakeries

680
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,360
in Rome were an arm of the government.

681
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,820
But the government, by the way, we're not

682
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,960
run by human agency.

683
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,820
You have humans that take orders, but it's

684
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,360
not human.

685
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,960
I keep saying this.

686
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,540
There's no human agency at the top.

687
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,880
It's a non-human agency.

688
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,300
You can call them the lizards or whatever,

689
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,620
but they're not human.

690
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,540
That's for sure.

691
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,440
And anyone does enough homework will see that

692
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,800
when you have an occupying force, the the

693
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,820
government, the current government that you're used to

694
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,580
stays in place.

695
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,420
Like, for example, if the U.S. lost

696
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:13,080
became became occupied by the CCP, communist Chinese,

697
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:13,480
right?

698
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,300
Your governors would still be there.

699
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,240
You'd still have, you know, whoever Trump would

700
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:18,960
still be there.

701
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:19,580
Right.

702
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,160
Everybody will be all your congresspeople will be

703
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:22,440
there.

704
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,600
But you're under occupation.

705
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:24,640
Right.

706
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,120
Right.

707
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,200
You know, you might see some military, you

708
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,460
know, CCP military, Chinese, you know, guards or

709
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,020
stuff around.

710
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,540
But your current policy.

711
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:33,820
Yeah.

712
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,660
So, no, the media will still exist, too.

713
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,160
It's not like they'll shut down the media.

714
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,860
They'll just now give them new orders.

715
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:40,960
Even more.

716
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,860
Even more media.

717
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:42,160
Yeah.

718
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,100
Yeah, exactly.

719
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,480
So in other words, what people are used

720
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,160
to is, to me, is all has all

721
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,740
the signs of an occupation, a non-human

722
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,660
one, by the way.

723
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:51,320
Yeah.

724
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:51,660
Absolutely agreeable.

725
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,760
No, absolutely agreeable, because that's why it doesn't

726
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,240
seem to comport with, you know, you sit

727
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,300
there and you say, how could a human

728
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,620
being want to do this because it's not

729
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,220
human rules?

730
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:58,840
That's why.

731
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,200
Exactly.

732
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,420
Yeah, that's the statement.

733
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,100
Everything is going to be fine.

734
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,020
Now, they're responding to something you said here

735
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:09,020
in the particular sonic, the statement, everything is

736
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:09,880
going to be fine.

737
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,760
You mean once we leave this place?

738
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,300
Question mark, because here there will always be

739
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,860
something that irritates me or I worry about.

740
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,260
This is what the.

741
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:18,860
Yeah.

742
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,220
And what I mean by that on a

743
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,020
deeper level is you'll never run out of

744
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,060
energy like like there's a sign.

745
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,860
There's a sci fi thing where they punish

746
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,560
people by putting them in a time machine

747
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,400
where they serve a one thousand year prison

748
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:30,880
sentence.

749
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,040
And when it's done, they come back and

750
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,820
only one minute has passed when they come

751
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,200
back.

752
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,840
But they already suffered for a thousand years.

753
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,300
They did a Star Trek like that once

754
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,460
where it was like they injected the guy

755
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,220
and then he spent the next 40 years

756
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,780
in prison and then they woke him up

757
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,840
and said, OK, you're done.

758
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,240
You've only been here about 15 minutes, but

759
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,200
he experienced.

760
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,240
Yeah, exactly.

761
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:51,960
That's what I mean.

762
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,500
That's what it means.

763
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,180
You're going to be fine.

764
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,480
You have unlimited energy in that respect either

765
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,060
way.

766
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,780
And when you if you go if when

767
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,940
you die, you go into total unconsciousness.

768
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,600
It would be just like saying, what do

769
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,520
you remember from 500 years ago?

770
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,220
Well, when you when you go to sleep

771
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,020
and you don't dream or you don't recall

772
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:07,420
a dream.

773
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:07,680
Right.

774
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,560
You just wake up.

775
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,940
It seems like sometimes.

776
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,680
Hey, did I just you know, you question

777
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,080
yourself.

778
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,420
Right.

779
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,480
Sometimes that's what it's like is one of

780
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:16,700
those.

781
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,960
Did I actually just sleep?

782
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:18,500
I don't know.

783
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,380
It seems like I just look at it

784
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:20,820
this way.

785
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,200
Look, if you anyone, I've turned them on

786
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,800
people on to look out for Charlie.

787
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:26,300
Right.

788
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,500
Look out for Charlie.

789
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,900
And it's undeniable what he's showing is there.

790
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,460
It may not be as clear as some

791
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,160
people like for it to be or prominent.

792
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,440
It shouldn't be.

793
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,740
But the subliminals that we're constantly being hammered

794
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,860
with one thing that look out for Charlie

795
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,740
doesn't get into is who's doing it and

796
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,080
for how long it's been going on.

797
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,500
But you can find that kind of stuff

798
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,080
back all the way in history.

799
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,360
You know, since technology has been around, if

800
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,220
you get films and music from the 1930s

801
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,320
with high enough resolution, you'll see there's subliminals

802
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,100
in there also.

803
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,260
Who's putting that in there?

804
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,380
So we're always under attack.

805
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,080
Just like, look, I don't endorse this, but

806
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,980
you know how like we're always in bacteria.

807
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:03,380
Right.

808
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,000
You know, you get a cut, you know,

809
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:05,980
bacterial infection.

810
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:06,500
Right.

811
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,620
And in reality, you know, your body creates

812
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,440
if there's any bugs or anything, your body

813
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,240
has created it.

814
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,740
But it's the condition.

815
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,020
So we're under such harsh conditions that are

816
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,660
the same thing that I mentioned to people

817
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:17,960
that.

818
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:18,800
Oh, Greek.

819
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,880
Remember before when Obama came in, a lot

820
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,760
of people said, I'm going to live off

821
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,100
the grid.

822
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,020
I'm going to move to the country.

823
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,000
And so that was about a half a

824
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,580
dozen people.

825
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,940
I said, you know, everything's going to be

826
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,880
five times more expensive and you'll find out

827
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,600
that everything in nature wants to kill you.

828
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,160
Oh, OK.

829
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,100
Half of them that I still stayed in

830
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,400
contact with a few years later.

831
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,000
Right.

832
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,240
Yeah.

833
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,700
Everything was five times more expensive and everything

834
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,460
wants to kill you.

835
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,420
It doesn't matter what part of the world

836
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:41,860
you are.

837
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,700
I mean, everything meaning nature wants to kill

838
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:43,920
you.

839
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:44,220
Yeah.

840
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,980
And it's like it's safer in a city.

841
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:46,560
Absolutely.

842
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:47,640
I will.

843
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:51,900
I would take like, you know, Alphabet City

844
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,180
in the 1980s, a tenement apartment over living

845
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,020
in the country full time any day.

846
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:57,580
Any day.

847
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,160
Which, by the way, was the grid was

848
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,900
cracked ends and shooting galleries.

849
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:04,640
Like, yeah, as in shooting galleries was what

850
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,980
he's talking about in Alphabet City.

851
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:07,420
Yeah.

852
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,120
You go out.

853
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,340
You can't you can't leave.

854
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,060
If you try to open the apartment door

855
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,280
to get out and you're like, what the

856
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:12,460
hell?

857
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,880
Turns out somebody passed out and vomited on

858
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,220
themselves.

859
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,880
And you got to push the door so

860
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,900
hard to slide the whole body over.

861
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,420
Right.

862
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,260
To get out, you know, kind of thing.

863
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,700
You're guessing as to whether the guys laying

864
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,400
on the street are dead or passed out

865
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,420
and you're stepping on stuff and it's going

866
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,420
crunch and it's cracked.

867
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:33,440
That is far, far better living conditions for

868
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,340
me than living out off the grid in

869
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,860
the country where I got to do everything.

870
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,000
Yeah, it's not.

871
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,160
Man always starts off in the wilderness, always

872
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,280
ends up in the garden.

873
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,180
It's I mean, in a city.

874
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,660
Oh, you know, like the city that comes

875
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,280
down from heaven.

876
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,420
Oh, the city is where just like ants

877
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,880
live in a colony or whatever.

878
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,820
Man is the pinnacle of man's existence is

879
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,460
to have a perfect city.

880
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,300
Yes.

881
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,060
I said perfect.

882
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:58,720
Right.

883
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,460
Not not living off the nature of the

884
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:01,660
country.

885
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,460
Nature hates you.

886
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,660
And by the way, if you if any

887
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,640
species that evolves over the planet will find

888
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,180
out how to all the stuff we talk

889
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,960
about, induction and replication, they won't have to

890
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,980
mine or grow anything.

891
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,760
They create everything they need from energy directly

892
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,320
and they eliminate anything else.

893
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,340
So you don't need trees.

894
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,180
You don't need plants.

895
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,460
You don't need animals.

896
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,420
You get rid of all of that stuff.

897
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,000
And I'm not saying that this is what

898
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,840
people do or this is what would be

899
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,060
done.

900
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:32,000
And you have a fairly sterile, seemingly boring

901
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,880
environment.

902
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,220
You probably have a Dyson sphere around your

903
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:35,540
planet.

904
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,360
I'm saying if this type of stuff exists.

905
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,920
And then then eventually you can leave the

906
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,640
body and shed the body, put yourself in

907
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,720
amber for 500 years and crack out of

908
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,260
it, whatever.

909
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,640
But you won't have Adam.

910
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,240
You won't have.

911
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,240
Yeah, you won't have what you have now.

912
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,420
And trust me.

913
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,760
And look, I'm not an advocate for that.

914
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,260
But I remember speaking, living in the city.

915
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,140
I mean, I was away at the time,

916
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,800
but when I got back, I was away

917
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,520
for a couple of weeks.

918
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,900
So it was a horror story that there

919
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,400
was a really bad smell in the hallway,

920
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,280
like garbage.

921
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,020
Oh, yeah.

922
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,420
And then it became worse than garbage.

923
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,200
And they finally opened the door and there

924
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,300
was a dead lady had died in there

925
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,460
and she had a bunch of cats and

926
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,220
the cats gnawed off all her toes and

927
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,480
her fingers and her nose.

928
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,320
Oh, yeah.

929
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,040
Her own cats.

930
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:17,300
Right.

931
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,640
That happened many times.

932
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:19,560
Yeah.

933
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,240
But this was in a place that I

934
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:21,380
live.

935
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,800
But I missed the whole episode.

936
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,880
And I was like, at least I hope

937
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,040
they bleach the place down.

938
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,600
Oh, yeah.

939
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,200
You know, so.

940
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:28,480
Yeah.

941
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:28,740
Yeah.

942
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,500
So there's the animals that love you so

943
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:30,720
much.

944
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:30,920
Yeah.

945
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,140
Right.

946
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,760
You got to get rid of that smell.

947
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,320
No, that's the thing to remember about your

948
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,720
animals, especially the cats.

949
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,500
As soon as you're dead, they're eating you.

950
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:38,340
Yeah.

951
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,180
Pretty much.

952
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,500
Well, if you haven't fed them.

953
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,140
Yeah.

954
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:41,760
And the whole thing is.

955
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,260
And I've heard that over and over.

956
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,400
First, it smells like rotten garbage, like people.

957
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,260
And then it starts to get worse, like

958
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:47,980
something died.

959
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,860
And then they finally go in there.

960
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:50,500
Yeah.

961
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:51,260
Yeah.

962
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,080
And it happened at a trailer park down

963
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,580
here when I first moved here.

964
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,660
A couple of months after I got here,

965
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,280
a guy just suddenly wasn't around.

966
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,960
And then a few weeks later, somebody said

967
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,020
a bad smell was there.

968
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,280
And they had to get him out of

969
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:01,680
the trailer.

970
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,580
And he was a mess.

971
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,680
Anyway, the guy was dripping all the way

972
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:05,980
through.

973
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,120
He was dripping through the damn body bag.

974
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:13,140
Anyhow, last question for this particular Sonic is,

975
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,880
does the Greek have any thoughts on the

976
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,400
Venus Project?

977
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,100
And that whole thing that went on with

978
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,320
Zeitgeist a few years back.

979
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,320
I think somewhere in 2010.

980
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,420
Yeah, somewhere in there.

981
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,780
There was a Zeitgeist thing.

982
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,700
Jacque Fresco, you mean?

983
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,040
Yeah, Jacque Fresco, all that.

984
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,540
Yeah, Jacque Fresco.

985
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,600
Take what you can and leave what you

986
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:31,760
can.

987
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,880
Like the thing that I would agree with

988
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,540
a lot of the things Jacque Fresco talked

989
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,980
about from the engineering side.

990
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,400
But socially, you know, they asked him once.

991
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,320
This is what blew it for me from

992
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,000
him.

993
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,900
They asked him, like, you know, you set

994
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,620
up this community.

995
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,600
What if someone, you know, decides to, you

996
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,560
know, keep their wealth and not share and

997
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,280
this and that and doesn't want to play

998
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:51,500
along?

999
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,040
Oh, yeah.

1000
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,020
We're going to shame them.

1001
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,740
We'll put in the paper all these things

1002
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,600
about them just to shame them into doing

1003
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:57,960
it.

1004
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,820
You know, I'm like, oh, let's talk about,

1005
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,920
you know, not very, not very quote unquote.

1006
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,220
That's a little too nice for me, Jacque.

1007
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,880
You should have thought about that a little

1008
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,340
bit more.

1009
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,160
I would have rather him say, like, I

1010
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,380
don't know what we would do at that

1011
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:12,640
point.

1012
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,400
We have more things, you know, that we

1013
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,540
probably will deal with.

1014
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,260
When we get with it, that would have

1015
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,460
been a far more educated and evolved answer

1016
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:19,880
than that.

1017
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,740
When I heard that, I was like, oh,

1018
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,980
you know, you live to 105 or whatever,

1019
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:24,880
but he's still 12.

1020
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,860
He's a smart 12 year old.

1021
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:27,960
So, yeah.

1022
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,560
No, fair enough.

1023
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,520
And I mean, that is a weird answer

1024
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,840
because I mean, you know, that's.

1025
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,740
Well, that's what he said.

1026
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,740
Yeah, it's weird.

1027
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,780
Educate someone more evolved.

1028
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,200
We said, well, we have everything that we've

1029
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,760
laid out all these years is so much.

1030
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,200
We'll have to.

1031
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,540
We haven't covered that yet.

1032
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,040
That's all.

1033
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,720
This way he maintains the integrity of his

1034
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,400
principle.

1035
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,480
That would have been a better answer.

1036
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,140
That's true.

1037
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,360
So anything that you'd like to close with

1038
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,400
on this one, anything on your mind at

1039
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,900
the moment that you want to just drop?

1040
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,100
Or do you want to get into a

1041
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:58,880
rant for a minute?

1042
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,020
Or are you good?

1043
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,880
No, I think I'm good.

1044
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,040
We'll make this one kind of short.
