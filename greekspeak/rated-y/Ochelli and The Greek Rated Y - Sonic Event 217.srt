1
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,800
Rated Y Sonic Event 217, now I made

2
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,200
a little mistake the first couple of days

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,240
when I posted 216 and didn't realize I

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,460
was posting the wrong one.

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:19,980
It's been corrected.

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,520
So if you think the 216 is, I

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,360
put up 215 again, it was a duplicate.

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,180
That's fine.

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:27,740
It's fine.

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,280
You know, we were just talking, by the

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,520
way, about whether devices are off and we

12
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,340
won't get wonky Sonics and, and I've had

13
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,520
people that are subs come over here and

14
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,360
see some of them we replicate.

15
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,360
And these are just hollow tubes with reflectors,

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,260
meaning like just makeup mirrors you buy at

17
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,280
the dollar store and a small nozzle of

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,300
water, let's say on a big water gun

19
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,560
or something, but passive, like primitive, you could

20
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,180
have built these 200 years ago.

21
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:53,560
Okay.

22
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,040
So you mean like those little mirrors that

23
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,420
come with the suction cup, that kind of

24
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:56,600
thing?

25
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:57,520
Yeah.

26
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,700
Or the compact mirrors, cause you need two

27
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,880
mirrors and all that to build a translator.

28
00:01:03,019 --> 00:01:04,400
There's a certain specificity.

29
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:04,840
Okay.

30
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,040
I had never really got into the golden

31
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,740
mean ratio.

32
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,600
Like a real effective one is like 22

33
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,140
and a half inches and they use that.

34
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,860
You say you go above 22 and a

35
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,820
half and below two and a half using

36
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,280
the golden mean, discuss that with Trevor.

37
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,380
And we did experiments a while back and

38
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,040
we're talking like 2013, 14 and it didn't

39
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,900
really matter that much, but he said, do

40
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,300
it anyway.

41
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,200
But, you know, and I do, so that's

42
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,520
why when people said, how big is your

43
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,400
trend, the translators and I'm like, well, that

44
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,240
one's about nine and three quarter inches and

45
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,360
like, why not in three quarter?

46
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,900
Cause it's a factor of 22 and a

47
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,180
half.

48
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,000
So whatever.

49
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:43,080
So who was it had a song, my

50
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,320
big 10 inch, who was it?

51
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,580
It was Aerosmith.

52
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,640
I didn't have that one.

53
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:51,080
No.

54
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:51,980
Okay.

55
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:52,860
Look it up.

56
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,340
Anyway.

57
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,400
So what's interesting about it around 2003 or

58
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,540
so I was hanging out with some people

59
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:04,300
from Raytheon and a guy's making 450,000

60
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,199
a year salary in 2003 and he's drives

61
00:02:07,199 --> 00:02:10,700
a 1989 Toyota Corolla with a broken air

62
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,460
conditioner and all four tires are different tires,

63
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,660
right?

64
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:15,680
Okay.

65
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,200
Yeah.

66
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:16,620
Yeah.

67
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,540
Cause here you need air.

68
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,820
Like even people that have, you know, they'll

69
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,260
buy a big borrow and steal just to

70
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,580
get their air conditioner fixed.

71
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,540
Cause the car is 150 degrees locked up,

72
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:25,760
right?

73
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,140
Depending on where you live.

74
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,680
I mean, you're, you're rolling around in a

75
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,280
heat box.

76
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,620
I mean, yeah.

77
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,300
So anyway, uh, he's passed away since then.

78
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,580
So I'm not going to mention his name,

79
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,020
Clifford Smith, but he passed away and, um,

80
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,560
did the guy with no name, Clifford Smith

81
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,420
die in the car?

82
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,060
No, no.

83
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,940
And, uh, I didn't mention his name.

84
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:44,720
How did you know his name?

85
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,380
I, I, I, so really the perks, I

86
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,920
said, so, you know, you get everything paid

87
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,500
for by them.

88
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:51,680
Yeah.

89
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,480
So roughly how much, you know, is your

90
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,860
total is about two and a half million

91
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,340
cause he, anything he wanted to buy, they

92
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,360
bought, right.

93
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,480
And it was, it was for experimenting and

94
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:01,620
stuff.

95
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,920
So he invited me to a group, a

96
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,900
party kind of thing.

97
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,640
All these are like the kind of to

98
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,660
a party full of people that you would

99
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,740
not invite to a party.

100
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,160
Just think about that for a minute.

101
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,980
And um, I've seen parties, people who are

102
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,280
no fun, don't really talk, just stand around

103
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,240
staring at each other.

104
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,420
Yeah.

105
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,620
And if you meet anyone that says they

106
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,620
work for Raytheon, you know, the missile company

107
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,220
and this aerospace Hughes and all that, and

108
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,660
they tell you they're an engineer, don't be

109
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,920
impressed because they have the dog is an

110
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,480
engineer.

111
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,680
The person working in the gift shop is

112
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,160
an engineer.

113
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,940
So anyway, um, let me, let me just

114
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,820
shorten this up without getting into too many

115
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,500
experiences.

116
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,600
So I saw him, I was building these

117
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,860
weather devices based on William, Mike, and half

118
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,440
of them looked at me and gave me

119
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,760
a bad stare and I said, what's up,

120
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:47,600
why, what is this?

121
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,740
Because I'll tell you, I'll tell you in

122
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:49,980
a minute.

123
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:50,900
So he takes me outside.

124
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,420
He says, you know, cause if a city

125
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,740
that had these devices would be impervious to

126
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,560
missile attack.

127
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,900
And I was like, what?

128
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,560
How can a hollow tube with, um, just

129
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,180
a spray water on one end or, you

130
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,900
know, foil and silk rotating.

131
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,460
And I didn't know about that at that

132
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,840
time, but a hollow tube with a, right,

133
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,460
basically a hollow to make a city impervious

134
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:13,760
to missile.

135
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,519
And then recently it hit me and they

136
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,260
would never tell me why, because the guidance

137
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,200
systems won't work.

138
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,080
Well, it relies on the ether, the guidance,

139
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,020
the radio, the radio guidance and all that

140
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,280
stuff.

141
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,380
So anyway, that's, what's always amazed me about

142
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,120
those things is like when people talk about

143
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,140
all of them, they got to shoot them

144
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,860
out of the sky, but, and they're talking

145
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,620
about it like, you know, you literally got

146
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,420
to like make contact and hit it with

147
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,180
a Patriot missile.

148
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,280
And I'm saying to myself, why not just

149
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,020
create a disruptive field that they can't navigate

150
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:41,460
through?

151
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:46,720
Well, it's, it's the military or is there,

152
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,320
okay, humans are morons and military is weaponized

153
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:50,980
moron, right?

154
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,360
Right.

155
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,440
So it's still more on the morons.

156
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,480
Um, like, you know, with McNamara, he was,

157
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,960
I think defense back in the day.

158
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,100
And later on, he gave, got a little

159
00:04:59,100 --> 00:04:59,940
seat and I'll make it out to be

160
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,300
a McNamara.

161
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,340
I think it was McNamara.

162
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,340
He came out and said, uh, McNamara, I

163
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,420
sold, I actually saw him speak in, uh,

164
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,000
like 2001 at NYU.

165
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:07,580
Right.

166
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,620
And the thing is, he was actually pretty

167
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,420
well together still in 2001, but he was

168
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,840
a guy who ran Ford motor company.

169
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,320
Then he came and he ran, you know,

170
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,620
the Pentagon for Kennedy.

171
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,480
Yeah.

172
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:17,900
Yeah.

173
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,040
Right.

174
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:18,420
Right.

175
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:18,940
Yeah.

176
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,880
But he released this info on 2015.

177
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,920
So he might've gone see now by then,

178
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,160
but, but he said that basically the nuclear

179
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,100
launch codes for the U S the entire

180
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,080
arsenal back then during the cold war was

181
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,180
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.

182
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,240
And the reason why they did that, they

183
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,080
were supposed to change them every day and

184
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,860
scramble them and make them random numbers.

185
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,920
But they said the guys were so young

186
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,600
and dumb at the silos that it would

187
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,400
just confuse them.

188
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,180
And it would make the system ineffective if

189
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,720
they couldn't get the codes, right?

190
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,040
So they just kept them all at 0,

191
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,240
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8

192
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:50,820
zeros, right?

193
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,500
This is the U S military.

194
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,960
And, um, but it's, it fits the population

195
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,580
by the way.

196
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,100
I heard the same story.

197
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,980
I heard the same story once, except it

198
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,560
was, they, you know, they have like a

199
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,040
telephone phone, you know, like numbers.

200
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,440
And what you had to do is hit

201
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,080
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, all the way

202
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,620
to, and then hit zero is the last

203
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:08,880
one.

204
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,080
And then boom, that's the code.

205
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,940
And I said, you gotta be kidding me.

206
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,560
That's insane.

207
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,660
They're like, no, they taught him.

208
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,520
That's all you got to do.

209
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,480
You know how to count.

210
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,220
I didn't care years ago when someone just

211
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,420
gave him a bank card, right.

212
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,260
And my debit card.

213
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,120
So you need to say, just take my

214
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,480
debit card, go buy what you got to

215
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:24,640
go.

216
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,560
It's like, I knew someone just was having

217
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,620
a hard time, said, take this debit card,

218
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,800
just go get what you're going to get.

219
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,500
And I'm going to get a bank statement.

220
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,860
I know what you're going to buy, right?

221
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,580
So if you buy whatever, I know where

222
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:35,980
you want.

223
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,180
So I trust you.

224
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,900
And he says, well, give me the pin

225
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,160
number.

226
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,520
I said, just one, one, one, one, one.

227
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,740
Well, what's your, what's your pin number for

228
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,640
that one, one, one, one, one.

229
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,200
Everything was just pin number for me.

230
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,000
It was one, one, one, one.

231
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,040
You can't do that anymore.

232
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,180
I still try to do it.

233
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,100
He says, no, you can't do it.

234
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,880
They will not let you do a one,

235
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,800
one, one, one, one.

236
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,680
They won't allow it.

237
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,020
And you know what else they won't allow

238
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,540
is if you get a new card, you

239
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,140
can't give it the same pin number anymore.

240
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,920
It's like all these weird rules now where

241
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,520
even because they want to give them the

242
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,740
idea that they're, they're on, you know, they're

243
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,440
trying to look out for you, whether meanwhile,

244
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,580
no, well, they're not really screwing you over.

245
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,740
I want to get into a little bit

246
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,040
of that, but actually I brought up the

247
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,800
zero, zero, zero.

248
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,380
What did I mention before the nuclear McNamara,

249
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:15,740
right?

250
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,040
And the military and all this other stuff.

251
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,800
There was another place I wanted to go,

252
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,460
but let's not because it's really easy to

253
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,100
it's a, yeah, a chicken, Ella King, you

254
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,300
know, that's all I, that's all I got

255
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:29,580
to say.

256
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,400
And hot sauce.

257
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,480
So by the way, out in the field

258
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,840
with the people out in the field, in

259
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,080
the army, hot sauce is money.

260
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:35,940
Oh yeah.

261
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,240
It's my, these little Tabasco.

262
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,780
I don't know if they give them anymore

263
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,540
because the food is so bad or the

264
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,680
MREs that, you know, chicken, Ella King and

265
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,360
this and that up until the early two

266
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,800
thousands, they still had the little mini bottle

267
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,120
of, yes, hot sauce.

268
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,860
And you know, they even still had the

269
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,540
cigarettes in there up to like 2001, I

270
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:53,960
think.

271
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:54,640
Really?

272
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:54,860
Yeah.

273
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,740
I'm surprised.

274
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,600
Two cigarettes.

275
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,260
Was it three cigarettes at least?

276
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,880
No, it was two cigarettes and a book

277
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,620
of matches, two cigarettes and a book of

278
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,020
matches.

279
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:02,640
Every time.

280
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,420
World War II, they had three cigarettes because

281
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,800
that's what I need to wake up by

282
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,100
the way.

283
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,420
Well, you know what it is with these

284
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,860
people, you know, they always got to cut

285
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:09,960
it.

286
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,220
Yeah.

287
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,760
I need two cups of coffee and three

288
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,920
cigarettes and a couple of shots of kratom

289
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,360
powder and about a half hour and I'm

290
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:17,960
good to go.

291
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,940
It's just when I'm good to go, he'd

292
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,100
give a discussion I had with someone recently,

293
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,160
you know, about the state of the world

294
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,540
and all that.

295
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,780
I said, look, all I could tell you

296
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,840
is what I'm experiencing.

297
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,540
I'm in my 60th year and let's say

298
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,679
three quarters of my life.

299
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,980
If you judge that, you're going to go

300
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,860
with the longevity statistics, right?

301
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,080
So I'm past the three quarter mark or

302
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,720
well into the three quarter mark.

303
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,440
You could die tomorrow.

304
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,760
But let's just say and I'm three quarters

305
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,600
into this movie and this movie sucks to

306
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,440
think that it's going to get better in

307
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:47,980
the end.

308
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,600
You got to be an idiot, right?

309
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,980
It's a rare movie that really just all

310
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,740
of a sudden improves at the very end.

311
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:55,920
It doesn't do it.

312
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:56,400
So.

313
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,480
So what you do is like I told

314
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,040
someone, you know, you've been on this planet.

315
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,480
My latest thing is when I talk to

316
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,200
people and they give you that fluoride stare,

317
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,640
you know, and I like that.

318
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,320
I might steal that from you.

319
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,220
Yeah.

320
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,100
So I've seen it around for a while.

321
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:11,400
Yeah.

322
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:11,880
But yeah.

323
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,880
Give me this fluoride stare.

324
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,500
And I'm like, have you been on this

325
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,600
planet for more than a month?

326
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:22,400
Yeah, I've heard of the window licking gaze,

327
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,680
but not the fluorides there.

328
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,460
But go ahead, please.

329
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:25,620
Yeah.

330
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,840
And I get into it.

331
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,060
Have you been on this planet for more

332
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:28,580
than a month?

333
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,940
You know what's going on here, right?

334
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,540
And anyway, just I'm going to just bounce

335
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,320
around a lot of economic stuff.

336
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,460
Some people's minds because you're not going to

337
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,160
the last thing that government media church radio

338
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,960
is where they want to dumb you down

339
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,300
as much as possible because they've been getting

340
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,940
away with things for so long without, but

341
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,060
they're not getting away with it without you

342
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:52,680
being ignorant.

343
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,660
Like I said, it's, they're relying on the

344
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,760
people's ignorance and the people are very reliable,

345
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,040
right?

346
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,120
And it's a very weird situation right now

347
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,560
because I'm going to tell you something strange

348
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,040
and I don't want to just go to

349
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,960
finish this one point.

350
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,860
So we're talking about new cars.

351
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,120
I said, new car, don't buy a new

352
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,500
car.

353
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,620
You shouldn't buy anything that has a touch

354
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,680
screen in it.

355
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,620
So that would be like 2005 and before

356
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,440
is what you want.

357
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:13,760
Yeah.

358
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,020
2000 cause I know like 2005, six, seven,

359
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,220
all everything started getting a touch screen if

360
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,760
it was considered, you know, not the base

361
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,700
base model, but cameras, big visuals on the

362
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,740
GPS talking about how the car companies are

363
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,280
losing money.

364
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,200
I said, no, no, no, no.

365
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:32,360
Since 1933 if all the cars were given

366
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,440
away, the car companies would, would make more

367
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,180
money or just as much money as they're

368
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:37,780
making now.

369
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,580
But when you came to pick up your

370
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,280
free car, you signed your name on a

371
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,980
document and you took your car and you

372
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,320
left that.

373
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,060
They could take that document and go to

374
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,040
the federal reserve and pull whatever number they

375
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,400
put on.

376
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,720
They can get a million dollars a car

377
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,220
per person.

378
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,360
So the whole thing about the car company

379
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,020
is not making, cause they're connected with the

380
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:56,580
government, right?

381
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,420
Even when here's the other thing that it's

382
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:02,880
hard for people to understand negotiable, negotiable insurance.

383
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,320
If all the car companies in the world

384
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,780
gave away all their new cars, you know,

385
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,240
and the conditions were that when you go

386
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,400
to pick up your car, you sign a

387
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,720
document, just a little couple of paragraphs, they

388
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,140
can make tons of credit off of you.

389
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,160
Now you think that that will pay for

390
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,260
the car as if you were paying cash

391
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,080
because that's a cash value, but believe it

392
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,020
or not, when the, before the cars are

393
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,680
built, I mean, you know, the fax machines,

394
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,020
you know, are they, they roll so much

395
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,960
paper you get as it's printing and drops

396
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,580
on the floor into a box, you know,

397
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,360
you've seen that, right?

398
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,920
The printers, the old printers, right?

399
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,300
Yeah.

400
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,380
You used to have to put a box

401
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,540
under mine when I ran a different corporate

402
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,200
stores, when we communicated with them.

403
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,200
They had that thing.

404
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,460
You had to tear off the side.

405
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,020
Cause that's what the roller that held it

406
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:46,640
in there, you know?

407
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:46,960
Yep.

408
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,340
Okay.

409
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,400
So there's this thing called the manufacturer's certificate

410
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,560
of origin or manufacturer's statement of origin.

411
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,800
It looks like a birth certificate when that

412
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,400
is printed.

413
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,040
That is a banking instrument.

414
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,360
So all the VIN numbers for the cars

415
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,960
are printed before the cars are made.

416
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,020
And that is already payment that is cash.

417
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,720
So the car was paid for before it

418
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,260
was built and then you go to pick

419
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:12,420
it up and you sign for it free

420
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,920
and it's paid for again.

421
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,940
But here's the other kicker.

422
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,360
How did the cars get from the factory

423
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,380
or wherever they were to your neighborhood through

424
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:19,900
transport?

425
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:20,520
Yeah.

426
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:20,980
Okay.

427
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,600
Now, hold on.

428
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,020
They have something, the transport, they have a

429
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,040
manifest sheet, a bill of laden, right?

430
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,920
It's on the truck and the trucker signs

431
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,140
it and the receiver signs it.

432
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,480
That is a cash instrument.

433
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,880
So it's been paid for again.

434
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:34,720
Right.

435
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,040
So those cars...

436
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,280
So all the cars, even if you walked

437
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,340
in, in other words, in common idiocy, the

438
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,180
morons on this planet, if you told them,

439
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,600
go get a new car, all you got

440
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,680
to do is sign your name and you

441
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,300
get a new car.

442
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,560
They think it's a free car.

443
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,240
They don't know that it was paid for

444
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,120
before when, in other words, before it was

445
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,540
manufactured or during manufacturing that day with the,

446
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,380
with the document from the factory called an

447
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,660
MSO or MCO, it was paid for again.

448
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,780
In other words, cash was created to cover

449
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,580
its value when it was transported through the

450
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,780
bill of laden or manifest, and it was

451
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,780
paid for again when they gave it to

452
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,620
you thinking you got it for free.

453
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,580
So the car's been paid for three times.

454
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:16,120
So they can literally give, I can prove

455
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,540
this, everything, anyone who's done the financials, a

456
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,280
little bit of study or listen to some

457
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,920
of the people and check up on what

458
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,380
they're saying knows what I'm saying is 100

459
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:24,960
% correct.

460
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,960
So even if all the brand new cars

461
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,600
were given away for free, they've already been

462
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,620
paid for three times over.

463
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,820
Now this concept, this scenario is provable.

464
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,380
Any, anyone, any senior banker will tell you,

465
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:38,900
yeah, that's right.

466
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,280
That's right.

467
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:39,700
That's right.

468
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,040
They won't give you details, but they won't

469
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,920
say you're full of shit.

470
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,600
Now below the senior debt banker, they'll tell

471
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,440
you you're full of shit, but everybody else

472
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,420
would tell you you're full of shit.

473
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,940
So how are you going to change anything?

474
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,340
I'm giving this as an example, right?

475
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,080
I'm giving this as an example.

476
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,600
I mean, I hope bread goes up to

477
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,220
a thousand dollars a loaf and I hope

478
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,520
your rent is 15,000 a month and

479
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,440
your gas bill is 30,000 a month,

480
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,100
right?

481
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,120
And I hope gasoline goes up to $300

482
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,220
a gallon, right?

483
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:05,880
Why?

484
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,040
Why?

485
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,080
Because it doesn't matter what number they attach

486
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,380
to it.

487
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,180
They've got everyone locked in, right?

488
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:12,980
Okay.

489
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,740
Here's another example.

490
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,020
The reason, okay, you pay, I'm just going

491
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,560
to give an example.

492
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,600
These things, everything I'm saying is not 100

493
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,120
% true.

494
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,480
It's a thousand percent true.

495
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:21,420
Okay.

496
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,840
Lock a rock solid.

497
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,660
But I'm giving this as an example of

498
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,640
what I'm saying, I'm going to stay in

499
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,700
the economic for a little while.

500
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,100
It has nothing to do with economics because

501
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,460
we could switch to any category and show

502
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,140
you how this information compared to what people

503
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,860
are talking about on all of the media,

504
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,480
all the universities and 99.99% of

505
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,820
the internet is a hundred percent relative bullshit.

506
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,740
And they're so deep into it.

507
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,000
They will never understand this.

508
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,860
I assure you never, never, ever, ever within

509
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,080
the ever they have left.

510
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,680
It's like I used to, uh, people close

511
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,520
to me or not when they don't get

512
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,440
something and then they get it like later,

513
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,140
like a month, a week, a year later,

514
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,500
I'm like, okay, do you think you're going

515
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,240
to live like 150 years to learn this

516
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:01,480
stuff?

517
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,700
You need to learn right away.

518
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,480
If you don't get it right away, drop

519
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:04,720
it.

520
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,960
You're wasting your time and go to something

521
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,640
that you can take right away cause you

522
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,240
don't have that much time, right?

523
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,200
I'll learn it eventually.

524
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:12,920
No, you won't.

525
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,420
What do you think?

526
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,480
First of all, let me sit you down.

527
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,800
Do you think you're going to learn this

528
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,180
eventually?

529
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:17,940
Uh, yeah.

530
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,320
You're going to live four or 500 years.

531
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,260
How long are you going to live?

532
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:20,620
Huh?

533
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,900
80, 70, whatever.

534
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,380
There's not enough time.

535
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,840
So that's, so here's the thing.

536
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,880
When I say never, these people are never

537
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,540
going to learn this or find out, even

538
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,580
find out about it within the ever they

539
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,340
have, if they lived a few up to

540
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:38,280
a thousand, there's a chance there might be

541
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,680
some instigation, but, and they would get it.

542
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,980
But here, now here's the thing.

543
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,500
So people have this thing called income tax.

544
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,240
You pay tax on the money you earn

545
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,900
and make, and then you go buy stuff

546
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,160
with the money that that you just pay

547
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,900
tax on, that you earn and make, and

548
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,720
you pay sales tax, you pay tax again,

549
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:55,660
right?

550
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,460
And then, wherever you live, even if you

551
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,940
have rent that's factored in, the money that

552
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,240
you- Property tax.

553
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,400
Worked, yeah, the money that you worked that

554
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,260
was taxed, is it taxed again when you

555
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,340
buy stuff, and taxed again where you live,

556
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:09,980
why?

557
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,800
And in the land you're going to collect

558
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:11,900
it.

559
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,240
And I'll tell you what the bullshit story

560
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:13,920
they're going to give you.

561
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:14,900
They're going to say, oh, because it's different

562
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,500
jurisdictions.

563
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,540
Bullshit, you know why it's the same entity

564
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,700
that's taxing you over and over with different

565
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,040
names, but it's the same entity.

566
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,800
Just like, for example, if you say, I

567
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,820
went to Kentucky Fried Chicken and ate today,

568
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,380
and I said, I went to Taco Bell

569
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,900
and ate today, and somebody else said, I

570
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,660
went to whatever.

571
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,700
You know, all of you, no matter where

572
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,360
you eat at these restaurants, all that money

573
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,640
centrally goes to PepsiCo.

574
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,840
Whether you hate Kentucky Fried Chicken and want

575
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,160
to only eat at Taco Bell, you're supporting

576
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:44,640
PepsiCo.

577
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,060
Whether you hate Taco Bell and just want

578
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,280
to eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you support.

579
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,960
Okay, so it all goes to the same

580
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,340
place.

581
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,800
And you talk to any of these legal

582
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,640
morons about this, and they're going to say,

583
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,580
well, it's different jurisdictions.

584
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:56,880
Uh-uh.

585
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,420
Why is it not different jurisdictions?

586
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,400
It's all the same jurisdiction.

587
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:00,700
Why?

588
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,540
Because if it was a different jurisdiction, you

589
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:05,160
would be using a different currency every time.

590
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:05,780
Right.

591
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,720
It's the same jurisdiction because you're using U

592
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,400
.S. dollars.

593
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,359
It's bullshit.

594
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,060
And no one is...

595
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:16,380
By the way, anything that's in the Constitution,

596
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,819
the original Constitution, anything that comes after it

597
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:21,060
that's against what's in the Constitution is void.

598
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,339
That's where the injunctions.

599
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,060
You can do an injunction for taxes.

600
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,859
They will notice it.

601
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,339
Sometimes they send it back, you send it

602
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:27,620
again.

603
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,720
Right, they will acknowledge it.

604
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,380
And you will not do the tax thing.

605
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,220
And by the way, there's a...

606
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,240
If you get a passport, I haven't tried

607
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:36,400
this.

608
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,500
There's two ways to do it through the

609
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:37,980
State Department.

610
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,220
One is a passport card, and the other

611
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,780
one is a sales tax exemption.

612
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,420
I've sent the form to some people.

613
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,180
So you go to Walmart and they ring

614
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,980
up $100 and $131.

615
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,660
You give the passport card or the tax

616
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:53,980
exemption card, and they say the name of

617
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:54,640
the organization.

618
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,340
You give whatever name is on the card.

619
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,660
And they scan it, and then suddenly it

620
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,620
goes from $131, it goes down to 112.

621
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,320
They take the tax off.

622
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,860
It's good if you're buying cars.

623
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:05,980
It's good, well, whatever.

624
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,520
If it's close to 10%, you spend $10

625
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,460
,000 a year, you just saved $1,000.

626
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,140
You spent less.

627
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,540
You know, I hate it when they say

628
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,200
you saved the dollar.

629
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:15,940
Where did I save it?

630
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,440
Where is it?

631
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,080
No, you mean I spent less than less.

632
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,960
Okay, so the idiots here are never gonna

633
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,200
understand this, any, any, any of this.

634
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,040
Now, on both ends of what's going on.

635
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,720
Now, let's go into the medical, every aspect

636
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,300
of the medical.

637
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:30,860
You know why?

638
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,580
Let's not, because it's exactly the same.

639
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,860
If I tell you how the human...

640
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,240
Yes, I do know how the human body

641
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,820
works, and none of these doctors do.

642
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,080
Let me say that again, in case you

643
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:41,700
misheard me.

644
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,940
I know how the human body works, and

645
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,800
none of these doctors do, none.

646
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,540
You know why I say none?

647
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,020
Because once they find out how it works,

648
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,660
and they try to apply it, you know

649
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,500
what's gonna happen to them?

650
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,660
They're gonna get, first of all, from the

651
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,400
upper superiors, they're gonna say, you can't do

652
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,620
that, but we just want you to do

653
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,500
standard practice.

654
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,780
And this is our warning to you.

655
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,820
So that's why none of these doctors, and

656
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,460
I know it.

657
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,360
Yeah, you wanna take that however you wanna

658
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:05,800
take it.

659
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,640
Everything I said about the financial stuff, no

660
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,060
college professors know this.

661
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:10,820
You know why?

662
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,660
I know this for sure.

663
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,660
Because the moment they teach this, you know

664
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,280
what's gonna happen?

665
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,240
Mm-hmm, yeah.

666
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,960
Yeah, they're gonna come in the office, and

667
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,560
they're a little cubicle.

668
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,340
That's where they put people in cubicles, and

669
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,420
say, do you like your job here?

670
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,280
That's all they're gonna say.

671
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,180
Similar speech.

672
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,980
We have a practice here, you do that,

673
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,460
or you don't.

674
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,520
And you go, yeah.

675
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,900
Yeah, so you wanna talk about this, you

676
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,580
wanna talk about that.

677
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,680
It's all the same.

678
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,620
So let me just paraphrase and underscore.

679
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,940
I gave a more in-depth on what's

680
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,760
going on if the cars were given away,

681
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,000
brand new cars were given away free to

682
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,880
everyone, it's still paid for three times over.

683
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,720
As long as you sign in a pickup,

684
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,320
that's the third time it's fully paid for,

685
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:52,960
okay?

686
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:56,140
Do you think that anyone's gonna understand that?

687
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:56,980
I can prove this.

688
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,720
And actually, you can prove it so many

689
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,020
ways.

690
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,280
You could prove it with the acts and

691
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,860
the federal laws and the policies of the

692
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,100
banks.

693
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,680
You can prove it by subpoenaing and getting

694
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,720
what's called a GAAP.

695
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,800
Oh, a GAAP, G-A-A-P, which

696
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,680
any company that's public, these are public motor

697
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,480
companies, they, you could do a FOIA, you

698
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,500
could do FOIA with corporations that are public,

699
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,360
and you ask for the GAAP, which stands

700
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,600
for the General Accepted Accounting Principles.

701
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,600
They have to show you whatever books you

702
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,120
ask for.

703
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,180
Now, usually when you ask for it, they

704
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,100
just send you a bullshit thing.

705
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,600
But if you ask for this ledger and

706
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,580
that ledger, you gotta know what it is.

707
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,580
Do you wanna get into that?

708
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,860
No, we don't need to get into it

709
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,100
now.

710
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,180
But what I'm saying, this can be proven

711
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,880
so many different ways.

712
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,340
As a matter of fact, the bill of

713
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,920
laden when the cars are transported is insured,

714
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:43,960
not the cars.

715
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,420
The bill of laden is.

716
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,940
Okay, so anyway, anything we get into, we

717
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,980
can get into super detail.

718
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,980
I'm telling you, you are screwed.

719
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,620
If you were to play what I just

720
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,820
said on a megaphone to the public, I

721
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,980
wouldn't say this to the public.

722
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,260
All I would say to them is you're

723
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,260
all screwed, you morons.

724
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,100
I wouldn't give them any of this information

725
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,040
because they're gonna laugh at you.

726
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,540
And you don't throw pearls to swine.

727
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,860
And because if you throw pearls to swine,

728
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,040
you have to finish up, they will trample

729
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,540
you and tear you to pieces.

730
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,920
No one says that part, do they?

731
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:20,000
So good riddance to the general public in

732
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,720
this society.

733
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,120
Like I said, it's a big porcelain bowl.

734
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,980
And I don't know why anyone hasn't pulled

735
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,840
the chrome handle and flushed the whole thing

736
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,060
away because that's the status that it's in.

737
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,320
Does anyone ever walk into a bathroom when

738
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,420
someone forgot to flush a big honky number

739
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,480
two and say, how do we fix what's

740
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:36,920
in the bowl?

741
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,160
No, you don't wanna look at it and

742
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,220
you pull that goddamn handle and flush it

743
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,000
away, reset.

744
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,520
So that's where you are.

745
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,360
So the reason I'm saying this, it sounds

746
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,460
like a rant, I'm not ranting.

747
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,020
It's because you are in a place like

748
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:54,400
a bad movie wherever you are in your

749
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:54,840
life.

750
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,300
I adhere to this archaic stuff that we

751
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,260
got 15 years left for the infrastructure.

752
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,820
Doesn't mean 15 years left for everything, everything,

753
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,520
everything, earth will go on.

754
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,380
But the infrastructure, the grid, all that stuff,

755
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,380
government is infrastructure, none of that, right?

756
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,740
So I'm into that.

757
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,580
So wherever you are in your life, whether

758
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,140
you're 10% into that or 15, 20,

759
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,440
it's a shitty movie, a bad movie.

760
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,860
Don't lie, don't lie to yourself.

761
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,480
Now, here's the thing, it's not gonna get

762
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:26,740
better.

763
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,880
That's why I tell people, like I go

764
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,080
back earlier when I said, listen, have you

765
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,320
been on this planet for more than a

766
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:32,500
month?

767
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,220
And they're like, what?

768
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,560
So I'm like, yeah, of course.

769
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,040
I'm like, okay, do you know what's supposed

770
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,260
to do?

771
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:39,160
This is all full of deceit, corruption, blah,

772
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:39,920
blah, blah, blah, blah.

773
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,640
This is a place where you come to

774
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,820
party, to have sex, to get high, to

775
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,280
get drunk, but you do it within a

776
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,380
moral, you have to pick a morality.

777
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,720
If you don't have a morality, that's fine

778
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:52,940
too.

779
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,760
It's gotta be fine, right?

780
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,140
Because you can't make anyone do that, right?

781
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,180
The consequences are there.

782
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,820
So I realized this recently, past few years,

783
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,880
is that this is a place to get

784
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,240
high, have sex, get drunk, party, have a

785
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,660
good time.

786
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,740
You don't believe it?

787
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,080
You don't believe it?

788
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,380
When you ask people, what do they remember

789
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,840
from going to college?

790
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,540
Beer and having party, blah, blah, blah.

791
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,340
That's what I remember from college, right?

792
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,700
Mostly, not everyone, but mostly.

793
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,720
And if you do remember anything they taught

794
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,380
you, dump it.

795
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,740
Dump it, it's bullshit.

796
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,200
So yeah, so you could say, I know

797
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,620
a guy that knows more about the human

798
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,520
body than any doctor or all the doctors

799
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,040
put together, right?

800
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:34,520
True.

801
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,800
So yeah, how many times can you say

802
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,400
that about anyone?

803
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,000
And you know what?

804
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,160
And I'm glad I could say that about

805
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,600
y'all if you heard me speak on

806
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:41,860
it.

807
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,660
So it's, yeah.

808
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:49,300
No, guaranteed by extension, we are all more

809
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,780
aware than what that doctor is right away.

810
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,080
Just, you know, it's under a vacuum.

811
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,540
I'm not harping on the doctors any more

812
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,520
than all the brand new cars should be

813
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,400
given away for free.

814
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,260
Okay, the reason why they have you pay

815
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:05,340
taxes is because when you work and put

816
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,400
equity and send it somewhere and you are

817
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,360
told what you need to send that in

818
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,940
order to support that, now you're invested in

819
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,140
it and you care about it.

820
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,220
So the more corrupt they are, the more

821
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:17,800
they tax you.

822
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,040
So you care more about it.

823
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,360
Where am I?

824
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,820
They say, I'm not paying tax, I don't

825
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,620
want to support the government.

826
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,440
If no one paid a tax ever, ever

827
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,780
again, the government would be just fine.

828
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,320
Not one penny of taxes ever gone to

829
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,400
any government for anything.

830
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,680
Not building bridges, not roads, not anything.

831
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,140
I just explained, the same way you buy

832
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,660
a car, the same way a construction company

833
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,640
builds a $10 billion road.

834
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:45,480
When they apply with a bid, the construction

835
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,560
company executive signature, they pay for the road

836
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,560
three times over.

837
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,620
Yeah, you don't have a government.

838
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,740
How many times did I say, there is

839
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,460
no government.

840
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,540
My gosh.

841
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,040
If you think there's a government, what do

842
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,900
you think's gonna happen when Halloween is over?

843
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,680
In other words, you think this guy's Count

844
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,240
Dracula because it's Halloween.

845
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,940
What are you gonna do tomorrow when it's

846
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:07,520
not Halloween?

847
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,100
What are you gonna do?

848
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,300
Today he's by Count Dracula.

849
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,680
Okay, so for the last whatever 90 years

850
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,180
or so, people think they have a government.

851
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,600
I'm telling you, you've been in Halloween for

852
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,220
90 years.

853
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,460
It's a masquerade.

854
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,200
No government at all.
