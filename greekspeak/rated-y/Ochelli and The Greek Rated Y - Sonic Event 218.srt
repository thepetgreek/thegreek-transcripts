00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,560
Rated Y, Sonic Event 218, Greek.

2
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,080
How's it going, man?

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,380
You know, there's been a little bit of

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,100
discussion of weather work in the, you know,

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,120
the community over there at Patreon.

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,820
So I put up an hour's worth of

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,720
the weather work seminar just to see if

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,520
people were really that interested and really wanted

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,380
to follow through on it.

10
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,300
If you're speaking, I can't hear you.

11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:29,980
So let's just.

12
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:30,700
Well, now I do.

13
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:31,420
Oh, now you hear.

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,180
OK, I heard weather work.

15
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:34,940
OK, no problem.

16
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,920
I explained this to you before we started

17
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,860
recording, so it's OK.

18
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,300
But yeah, the weather right now.

19
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:40,800
Oh, boy.

20
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,520
Oh, something's going on.

21
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,800
You having trouble hearing me now?

22
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,500
It just came on.

23
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:46,700
Can you hear me?

24
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,760
Yeah, you're you're crystal clear.

25
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,420
OK, yeah.

26
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:49,980
All right.

27
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,500
I mean, where I'm right next to Wi

28
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,160
-Fi receiver type thing.

29
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,020
So it should be fine.

30
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:56,880
Maybe it's too strong.

31
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:57,320
I don't know.

32
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:58,520
I got this.

33
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,540
Speaking of Wi-Fi, I feel I went

34
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,860
and bought the strongest one.

35
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,120
You know, they have like Wi-Fi module

36
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,240
modem built together for your home and they

37
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:07,960
got another model.

38
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,660
Then I got one for an office that

39
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,480
like really, really cooks everyone.

40
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:11,800
Right.

41
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:12,500
Oh, yeah.

42
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,960
You know, the big giant router.

43
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,540
Yeah, that's the one I got.

44
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:15,960
It's huge.

45
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,400
It's big.

46
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,580
And it's like, holy shit.

47
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,220
You know, it's here.

48
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,640
And maybe it's too strong.

49
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,940
You know, you know, by the way, so

50
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,320
-called law enforcement, you know, panty sniffers, whatever.

51
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,820
They don't know anything anyway.

52
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:26,660
It's amazing.

53
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:27,760
I have a little bit of a lawyer

54
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,160
story.

55
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,320
But do you know how they shut down

56
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:30,820
cell phones?

57
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,180
You know, they all these law enforcement people,

58
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,600
they could shut down cell phones within an

59
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:34,780
area.

60
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,300
Does anyone here know how to do it?

61
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,520
Raise your hand.

62
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:37,860
OK.

63
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,340
How they do it is they have this

64
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:39,840
jammer.

65
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,180
Duh.

66
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,700
You know, that's the dummy call.

67
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,500
Remember, radar jammers and all that work the

68
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:43,960
same way.

69
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,480
It's a little box and it mimics the

70
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:51,160
the broadcast signal that generally all phones pick

71
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,000
up on to lock onto a tower.

72
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,400
Right.

73
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,120
It takes that signal and it amplifies it

74
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,100
about anywhere between five and ten times.

75
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,780
So any phone in the area will receive

76
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,980
that signal way, way higher than normal.

77
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,040
And what does that do?

78
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,300
It tells the individual phones stop working.

79
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:09,280
Isn't that funny how the technology works?

80
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,500
Everyone thinks here's the thing.

81
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,660
Everyone is being guarded.

82
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,540
You know, years ago, they used to have

83
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,560
a bunch of those things like things that

84
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,280
looked like routers onto the back of a

85
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,980
pickup truck and drive around and they could

86
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,780
knock it out just in that particular block

87
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,160
or whatever.

88
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,960
They used to do that.

89
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,340
Yeah, they have.

90
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,920
And you know, when you go, if you

91
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,940
pull up on the bottom tab of your

92
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,900
computer, usually it's a computer.

93
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,840
And I don't think you do this on

94
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,100
a phone.

95
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:33,640
Maybe you can.

96
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,040
It shows your Wi-Fi and it shows

97
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,260
you the properties and the local Wi-Fis.

98
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,540
And it says, like, you need password, password.

99
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,240
He shows you your neighbor's password and all

100
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:41,400
that.

101
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:41,540
Right.

102
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:41,820
Oh, yeah.

103
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,040
Yeah.

104
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,080
The phones do it now, too.

105
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,700
You usually got to swipe from the top

106
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,040
of the screen.

107
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,180
All of them do it from the top

108
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:46,560
of the screen.

109
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,440
Yeah, but I did I was doing it

110
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,460
for a little while and it said wife,

111
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,760
the next closest Wi-Fi is Homeland Security

112
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,560
slash FBI showed up on my thing for

113
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,160
a little while.

114
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,840
And and it's I got started.

115
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,660
But here's the thing.

116
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,180
If I even told half the stuff that

117
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,700
I've been through, I could do one of

118
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,600
these YouTube channels.

119
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,400
This guy goes through all this shit where

120
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,320
I don't talk about that because I'm still

121
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:10,560
here.

122
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:10,860
Right.

123
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,260
So here about the weather work, people that

124
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,600
have known me for a while, there's something

125
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,380
called a translator.

126
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,160
It's not a Wilhelm Reich device, a portable

127
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:19,580
device.

128
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,840
And what the beauty of it being portable

129
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,240
is you have mobility where it's kind of

130
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,140
hard to move around with a big pipe

131
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,240
that's grounded to water in the ground.

132
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:27,480
Right.

133
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,420
So the beauty of the translator, the portable

134
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,980
one is you do this phenomenon called towing.

135
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,000
So let's say you're driving and on the

136
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,340
left, it's clear weather.

137
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,260
On the right, you see a storm right

138
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:40,800
on the road.

139
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,280
So what you do is you make a

140
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,200
right and you go and you drive under

141
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,800
the storm, you set up your translator and

142
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,560
then you drive away from the storm.

143
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,180
And guess what happens?

144
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,080
Storms follow you.

145
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,900
It's called towing.

146
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,900
And I did this a couple of times

147
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,680
years ago on the west side of town

148
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,260
where it's more really almost country suburban.

149
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,220
But you don't see any road, any heart.

150
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,380
The houses are so far set back.

151
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,140
You go down this road for miles and

152
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:05,320
miles.

153
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,700
You don't even know anyone lives there.

154
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:06,960
Right.

155
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,240
You know, so Georgia is probably mostly like

156
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:10,480
that.

157
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,840
So anyway, I'm doing that.

158
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,260
And it was Sunday, I remember morning and

159
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,000
it was the Harley ride, like a hundred

160
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,779
Harley guys.

161
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,579
And they're drafting and talking.

162
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,480
They just started their ride.

163
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,040
So they're not going fast and they're behind.

164
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:22,760
I'm in a minivan.

165
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,520
So, you know, when you're in a motorcycle

166
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,240
behind a minivan, you catch and drift, you

167
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,600
know, you don't feel any wind resistance.

168
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:27,980
Right.

169
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:28,480
Right.

170
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,760
And I'm trying to tell the guys behind

171
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,380
me, pass me, pass me, because you don't

172
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,580
want to go more than 30 or 40

173
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,620
miles an hour for the tow.

174
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:35,860
Right.

175
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,440
Storms don't want to go 80 miles an

176
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:37,580
hour.

177
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,160
If they do, they're no longer storms or

178
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,580
hurricanes.

179
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:39,860
Right.

180
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,320
And you can't make a hurricane.

181
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,180
So you have to respect the properties of

182
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:43,540
the storm.

183
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,620
So I'm actually going 30 miles an hour.

184
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,800
Usually everybody drives at the speed limits 40.

185
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,880
But everyone drives 70.

186
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,720
You know how it goes.

187
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:49,980
Right.

188
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:50,460
Yes.

189
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,440
So I'm trying to wave them to go

190
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:52,960
ahead of me.

191
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,100
And they're like, no, no, no.

192
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:54,560
It's all right.

193
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,020
It's all right.

194
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:55,780
We don't we don't mind.

195
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,620
We just started the ride.

196
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,140
I'm thinking, you know, psychically picking up what

197
00:04:59,140 --> 00:04:59,560
they're thinking.

198
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,560
We just started the ride.

199
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,280
This raw grouping.

200
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,140
And suddenly here comes the rain.

201
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,020
And as long as there are whoever's behind

202
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,220
me is getting rained on.

203
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:07,680
Right.

204
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,420
That's just a story.

205
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,460
That I want to mention the power of

206
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:11,920
the tow.

207
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,040
Now, once again, there's people that have experienced

208
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,740
this and done this, by the way, that

209
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,520
have picked up from the weather seminar.

210
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,840
And then I bet a bunch of those

211
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,520
motorcycle guys started like stopping and standing under

212
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,220
bridges with their bikes to try and get

213
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:25,880
out of the rain.

214
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:26,120
Right.

215
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,860
Like a little bit.

216
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,100
Well, specifically, they're kind of tougher than that.

217
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,420
But, you know, it's funny about these Harley

218
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,040
group rides.

219
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,500
You look at all the Harleys and you'll

220
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,020
see some llamas, you know, that look like

221
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:35,700
those classic bikes.

222
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,300
And there's one crotch rocket in there.

223
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:37,540
Right.

224
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,520
So it's like you really don't belong.

225
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,000
But anyway, if you know what you're doing,

226
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,880
you can do a hitch.

227
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,360
You can do that also with a ground

228
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,760
based gun, which is which is what I'm

229
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,080
doing all day.

230
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,100
And yesterday, severe thunderstorms, severe thunderstorms.

231
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,200
They did come, but they're five miles south.

232
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,740
So what I did was I aimed at

233
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,160
the storm.

234
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:57,980
This is with a gun.

235
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,040
I'm not moving.

236
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,740
This is ground based aimed at the storm.

237
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,520
It didn't like it.

238
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,860
You could see I just cleared a whole

239
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,640
entire area.

240
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,620
Then I turned the gun around as if

241
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,300
the storm was going to pass over me.

242
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:09,840
But it wasn't.

243
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,000
But it's attracted to the area now that

244
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,540
the gun is aiming at.

245
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,860
So it starts to move over me.

246
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,380
And now that it moved over me, I

247
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,520
aim the other way to to lock it

248
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,060
in.

249
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,480
So can't go back and it can't retract.

250
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,580
And that's what's happening is the darkest freaking

251
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,040
clouds.

252
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,080
When you see like really, really strong storm

253
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,800
clouds, you know, the puffy cumulus ones and

254
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,800
they get a really flat bottom, like someone

255
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,720
shaved it off and it's really dark.

256
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,000
That's how that's when you get that.

257
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,060
So I was telling people years ago on

258
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,960
the weather, there's like 150 types of clouds.

259
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,620
If you can at least jot down at

260
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,740
least 120 different cloud formations, you're getting this

261
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,380
also in a clear blue, blue sky.

262
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,380
There's 14 shades of blue.

263
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,480
Most people will call the skies blue.

264
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,260
OK, I can show you this 14 shades.

265
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,700
If you could be that sensitive, you got

266
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:57,860
it.

267
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,160
And the reason why you can go out

268
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,460
in a totally cloudless, you know, windless day

269
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,140
with a blue sky and I could show

270
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:05,980
you the 14 shades.

271
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,060
And it's important to know that because once

272
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,620
you aim it, the blue sky in one

273
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,580
area, you'll see where you're aiming will change.

274
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,660
It'll actually where you're exactly aiming.

275
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,200
It's really dark, like a round dot, really

276
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:17,840
dark blue.

277
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,640
And then around it, it gets darker again.

278
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,120
And then like it almost like an iris

279
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,660
in an eye and then it gets really

280
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,340
light.

281
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,520
So you can almost see it.

282
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,240
But, you know, if you're not tuned into

283
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,280
it, you won't see it.

284
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,260
Oh, it still looks blue to me, you

285
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,080
know, because you're just used to tuning out.

286
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,000
You know, the sky is blue.

287
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:33,480
That's it.

288
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:33,740
Right.

289
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,620
And it's very interesting.

290
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,640
So the weather, the weather work requires people

291
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:44,020
that are very sensitive and sensible, sensible.

292
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:44,520
Why?

293
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,260
Well, you're dealing with the weather.

294
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,280
That's all you got to say.

295
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,260
It's probably the most powerful force other than

296
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,220
flooding that you can possibly inflict, which can

297
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,800
be done with the weather with no problem,

298
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,380
by the way.

299
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,780
But because here we go again, it's starting

300
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,200
to flood on the eastern seaboard.

301
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:58,500
Right.

302
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,200
This is what I'm seeing anyway in reports.

303
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:01,560
Yeah.

304
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,100
Well, yeah, I know.

305
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,420
I saw like New York City flooding.

306
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,940
It was Brooklyn Carroll Street.

307
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,020
I can't believe how they developed Fourth Avenue

308
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,260
down there.

309
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:10,800
My gosh.

310
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,540
When I was there, it was just like

311
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,720
broken down storefronts, broken down cars, a lot

312
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,700
of drug dealing, whatever.

313
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,200
Now it's like Citicorp is building a building

314
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,680
there and, you know, Italian restaurants where, you

315
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,040
know, the spaghetti is fifty dollars a plate.

316
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,040
I'm like, oh, my gosh.

317
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,720
They gentrified that area.

318
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,760
Well, oh, more than gentrified.

319
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,559
They're trying to make it like Upper East

320
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,240
Side, Manhattan.

321
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:33,740
Right.

322
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,799
Which is more than that.

323
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,400
But yeah, gentrification is you want to hear

324
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,080
that they sort of retain a little bit

325
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,679
of the flavor of the prior, you know,

326
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,500
how the prior setting.

327
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:42,799
Right.

328
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:43,540
Sometimes.

329
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:44,900
Not always.

330
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,640
Not sometimes.

331
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,400
Yeah, yeah.

332
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,180
Yeah, that's true.

333
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,920
You could say what Disney did to Times

334
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,260
Square.

335
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,160
You could say that.

336
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:51,540
Well, yeah.

337
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,120
What the hell?

338
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,640
There's nothing left in the old look.

339
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,980
1970s Times Square.

340
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,680
It don't exist.

341
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,240
Come on.

342
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,200
Oh, man.

343
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,580
I remember going down.

344
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,620
This guy says we've got to go to

345
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,220
the peep shows.

346
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:00,940
I was 14.

347
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,060
And, you know, it's supposed to be 18

348
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:03,900
or 21 or older.

349
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,520
I'm 14 years old going to peep shows,

350
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,940
you know, and it's eating your quarters like

351
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,260
crazy.

352
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,200
It's like 30 seconds.

353
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,880
It's a little eight millimeter film, you know,

354
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,500
and you're dropping, you know, a quarter or

355
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,600
whatever, every every 15, 20 seconds.

356
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,860
You know, I mean, my gosh, I was

357
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,760
like, this is stupid.

358
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,200
If you got a ride in Grimey.

359
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:19,480
Yeah.

360
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,840
If you got to roll the quarters, you're

361
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,340
18, though.

362
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,280
That's all there is to it.

363
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:22,960
But yeah, go ahead.

364
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,300
Oh, I'm 14.

365
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,180
Look, when I was 18, I looked 14.

366
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,480
When I was 25, I looked 14.

367
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,640
You know, I mean, look, I was 40

368
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,420
and getting carded for cigarettes.

369
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:32,920
Yeah, no.

370
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,680
And I was like, I'm 40.

371
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,280
And they're like, yeah, sure you are.

372
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,500
I was like, oh, my gosh.

373
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:38,340
Right.

374
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,160
So I used to say that I was

375
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,540
16.

376
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,640
I don't know what I look like.

377
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,440
I got you.

378
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,740
I used to sit down at either really

379
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,360
busy or really slow bars.

380
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,020
One or the other.

381
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,200
Not in between medium.

382
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,980
You might get carded, but medium or, you

383
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,780
know, like but but really slow or really,

384
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,780
really busy places.

385
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,760
And I would just sit down.

386
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,380
I had a beard.

387
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,260
I was like 13.

388
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,400
You know, they didn't even know.

389
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,060
What do you need?

390
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:58,480
Yeah.

391
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,180
So give me a picture.

392
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,980
I look when young Frankenstein came out, I

393
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,000
was like 12 or something.

394
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,600
I was able to go to the store

395
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,820
and buy a little bottle of liquor.

396
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,860
I remember Southern Comfort.

397
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,960
We we were around.

398
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,480
We had friends whose brothers and sisters were

399
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,000
older and, you know, 17, 18.

400
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,660
And at that point, you're getting high drinking.

401
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,440
And, you know, I was like, oh, I

402
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,940
never saw little bottles like that, whatever.

403
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,760
So I walked to a liquor store when

404
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,600
the movie Young Frankenstein came out.

405
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,620
And that was like 1975, 1976.

406
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,920
And I was able to buy alcohol.

407
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,320
Right.

408
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,100
And, you know, I remember it was weird.

409
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,680
I know it wasn't supposed to do it.

410
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,100
And it's kind of like when they're doing

411
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,540
the transaction, you don't want to go when

412
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:36,820
it's busy.

413
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,040
You want to go and you wait until

414
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,640
you're the only person going in a certain

415
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,240
time a day.

416
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,200
And when they're doing the whole transaction, not

417
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,540
even looking at you, you're looking away.

418
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,060
It's so funny.

419
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,860
We're talking, you know, Brooklyn, Midwood, Flatbush area.

420
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,120
Anyway, I mean, that's not going to work

421
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,500
anymore.

422
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,980
You know, I mean, I don't know.

423
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,680
Who knows?

424
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,700
Maybe in Afghanistan.

425
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,620
But, OK, maybe, you know, there's a lot

426
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,240
of countries don't have the hang up that

427
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,180
Christian, quote unquote, it's not biblical.

428
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,180
It's Christian where alcohol, you know, has to

429
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,220
be in Japan.

430
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,720
You get alcohol in the vending machine.

431
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,420
Anybody can.

432
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:07,700
Right.

433
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,780
So, yeah, that girl's panties.

434
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,060
Right.

435
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:10,460
Yeah.

436
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,140
Yeah.

437
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,440
So anyway, I wanted to get some activity

438
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,620
in the chat tango or jelly in the

439
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,700
Greek, you know, like six months ago or

440
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,860
less than that, if you ask me, what

441
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,560
was the chitang?

442
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:20,900
I don't know.

443
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,440
It's so chilly in the Greek to tango

444
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:22,880
dot com.

445
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,120
Right.

446
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:23,460
Right.

447
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,700
OK, close enough.

448
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,000
All right.

449
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,220
Some someone popped up very appreciated.

450
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,260
And they're talking about water and showing off

451
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,760
their wares and what they're attempting to do.

452
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,500
And I'm giving some feedback.

453
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,740
I don't my my first thing is I'll

454
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,240
discuss it on the next sonic.

455
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,480
Well, all I'm going to say is, OK,

456
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,040
the first thing this is out of context.

457
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,380
But when you're working with magnets and you're

458
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,220
going to end up one pole, you know,

459
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,220
the force in motion side of the magnet,

460
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,880
meaning the north or the south has to

461
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,760
be vertically aligned, always the south pole down

462
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,960
towards the ground, whatever you're doing, unless you're

463
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,340
working on something, you need the other pole.

464
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,360
Now, with poles, there's no such thing as

465
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,820
just a vortex that goes through.

466
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,180
Just like when you look at the globe

467
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,440
model of the Earth, if you're looking down

468
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,040
at the North Pole, it looks like the

469
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,500
Earth is going counterclockwise.

470
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,660
But if you're at the south pole looking

471
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,340
up, it looks like it's going clockwise.

472
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,400
So it's all relative where the view is.

473
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,880
That's how magnets work.

474
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,920
The only reason they repel is because you

475
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,760
can't put two right hand threaded objects that,

476
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,840
you know, moving in the same direction together.

477
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,080
That's all it is.

478
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,120
So the South Pole is always expansive and

479
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,700
the North Pole is always contractive.

480
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,460
Now, for example, when you have a compass

481
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:33,580
in your hand and then you have the

482
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,100
needle, it's it's tipped in red ink or

483
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:36,640
red paint.

484
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,540
It says north.

485
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,960
OK, when that is really a North Pole

486
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,400
on the compass, when you're naming the compass

487
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,940
and it's free to move and it goes

488
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,380
to what you think is magnetic north, the

489
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,100
pole that it's actually going to on the

490
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,900
Earth is actually a South Pole magnet.

491
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,560
So now that you know that, you can

492
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,960
actually pick which pole of the magnet.

493
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,640
So when you have a North Pole, North

494
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,000
Pole end of the needle on a compass

495
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,840
and you have a magnet in your hand,

496
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,120
don't put it too close because you could

497
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,220
screw up the magnet in the compass.

498
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,560
When the face of the magnet that the

499
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,900
compass is pointing north is pointing to is

500
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,260
actually the South Pole of the magnet.

501
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,800
And then the opposite is the North Pole.

502
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,040
So it's still in direction.

503
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,160
Oh, OK.

504
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:19,620
You see?

505
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,260
So it always.

506
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,000
Yeah.

507
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:21,800
So you see.

508
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,180
So anyway.

509
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,180
OK, so what I wanted to say was

510
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,600
pointing down.

511
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,640
The other thing is I wanted to mention

512
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,560
is if they I don't know what you

513
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,640
what status you have on that water thing

514
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,320
we did with Ocelli in the Greek, the

515
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,080
private one like years ago about, you know,

516
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,800
the Brita filters and the magnetite and always

517
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,580
treating water, filtering water when it's cold.

518
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,360
Do you guys accept accessible on the Patreon?

519
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,580
Not in the Patreon yet, but I have

520
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,940
made it accessible to them.

521
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:52,740
Like, here's a link.

522
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,060
You can go you can go listen to

523
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,580
it if you want in the private section.

524
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,780
But I could put it in the Patreon.

525
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,440
You want it there?

526
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,240
Yeah, because from the from the comments that

527
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,280
I've seen, no problem on the to tango,

528
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,600
they haven't been aware of that.

529
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,820
It's a very simple way to get the

530
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:11,320
best water possible from what water you have.

531
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,200
So and the thing that stood out to

532
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,400
me on that is the shape of the

533
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,260
container that you keep it in, which is

534
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,040
really interesting.

535
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,500
And yeah, OK, that'll be posted.

536
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,480
Yeah, just just so I just want to

537
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,560
set up, bring up a few things.

538
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,980
I'm not going to discuss too much more.

539
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,080
The other thing I wanted to bring up

540
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,980
with us in discussion with someone in the

541
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,200
field, engineering, but industrial about what I'm doing

542
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,120
is, well, can you just briefly explain what

543
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,620
you're doing?

544
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,160
And I said, yes, what I'm doing is

545
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,160
this, you know, the device that does this.

546
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,280
But what's more important is now we can

547
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,100
add to the anomalies of how water performs

548
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,960
and how we can physically observe it.

549
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,040
Like the first anomaly water has is it's

550
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,460
the only liquid that we know of that

551
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,540
when you freeze it, it expands, right?

552
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,900
The other thing is it has at its

553
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,400
maximum density is at thirty nine degrees Fahrenheit

554
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,580
or four degrees Celsius.

555
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,540
At that point, it's literally incompressible.

556
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,100
There's no other material that could do that.

557
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,680
You could have a 30 foot thick piece

558
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,140
of steel.

559
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,460
It will still compress.

560
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:06,760
OK.

561
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,440
The other thing that very few people speak

562
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,580
about, it has a latency and heat curve

563
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,180
on the graph at 90.

564
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,340
OK, 98.6. What I mean by that

565
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:20,720
is when you are measuring how warm the

566
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,560
water is getting, when you add heat, it

567
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,720
forms a linear graph.

568
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,760
The more heat you add, the more the

569
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,620
temperature of the water rises until you get

570
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,240
to 98.6 or 38 degrees Celsius.

571
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,600
What happens there as soon as it hits

572
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,940
the 98.6 or 38 Celsius, you keep

573
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,680
adding heat and it doesn't budge.

574
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,840
It stays at 98.6 really stable.

575
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,740
You got to keep adding heat and then

576
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,720
it breaks off a 98.6 and starts

577
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,520
to rise again.

578
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,240
Very anomalous.

579
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,080
It's not linear.

580
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,400
You know that 98.6 should be should

581
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,780
number should ring a bell, right?

582
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,980
So there's a different type of transference or

583
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,740
resistance to transfer at 98.6. Yeah, that's

584
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,640
why our bodies, our blood is the healthiest.

585
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,580
OK, like if you read in the Upanishads,

586
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,540
it's the Upanishads are like a shading of

587
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,020
what Noah taught Abraham.

588
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,920
But it's part of the Hindu culture.

589
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,820
Some say it's a thousand years old.

590
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,360
Some say it's two or three thousand years

591
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:10,620
old.

592
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,680
I'd go in the two and a half

593
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,040
thousand mark in the Upanishad.

594
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,960
One of the teachings is when you drink

595
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,780
water, the gross matter of the water.

596
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,720
This is the translation.

597
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,460
One of the translations when water is drunk,

598
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,000
the gross amount of the water becomes urine.

599
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,220
And the other less gross amount in the

600
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,600
next amount that's left becomes your blood.

601
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,420
And the next amount that's left becomes prana,

602
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,440
right?

603
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,480
Which is energy.

604
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:36,960
OK.

605
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,600
Now, the same thing with food.

606
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,260
It talks about when a gross amount of

607
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,000
food is eaten.

608
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,400
Most of it is excreted.

609
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,220
Then the next amount becomes your flesh.

610
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,480
But then the last amount becomes your mind.

611
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,200
That's why it's very important to eat good

612
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:52,520
food.

613
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:52,840
Right.

614
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,180
That's why, for example, George Osawa, he was

615
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,620
an early microbiotic teacher.

616
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,400
He would have classes.

617
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,460
And when a teacher, when he thought one

618
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,720
of the students would ask a stupid question,

619
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,060
he answered it by saying, what did you

620
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,180
eat for dinner last night?

621
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:06,480
Right.

622
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,160
Yeah.

623
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,160
So it does seem to have a generalized

624
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:10,800
effect.

625
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,800
I've taken note of this before, but never

626
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,440
known why.

627
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,740
It just seems like people that eat better

628
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,460
food are more productive, are less, you know,

629
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,079
less clumsy, less accident prone, et cetera.

630
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,660
So, you know, I don't know what to

631
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,579
make of it, except that that's just a

632
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:25,859
fact.

633
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,819
Well, yeah.

634
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:29,180
And the thing about water also, water is

635
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,760
constantly being produced by many, many things.

636
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,560
So each thing has a different kind of

637
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,560
water, just like each body will produce a

638
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,360
different type of mind and different type of

639
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,540
flesh and a different type of energy.

640
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:43,780
So these things are where you're an operator

641
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,100
and you have to be able to control

642
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,180
it and regulate, you know, your food and

643
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:47,820
your water and all that.

644
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,840
But this is another discussion on the map.

645
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,300
I want to go back to the water.

646
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,180
Actually, I didn't stop.

647
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,720
So the ninety eight point six.

648
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,180
So, you know, so the water is the

649
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,540
only liquid that expands when you freeze it

650
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,260
that we know of.

651
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,460
Then it has a real funky thing happens

652
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,680
at ninety eight point six.

653
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,700
Also, it's not compressible at thirty nine.

654
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,320
Now here's the this is my contribution.

655
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,880
What I've done is when water only passes

656
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,840
over the block wall of the magnet, mean

657
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,620
the median between the poles only and you

658
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,600
shade the other poles.

659
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,520
Shading means in electronics or engineering that you

660
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,880
prevent anything from seeing those poles when your

661
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,460
water flow is only going over the block

662
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,740
wall, the water quality changes.

663
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,840
And this is a new anomaly that we've

664
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,060
added to the repertoire of weird things that

665
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:33,640
water does.

666
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,700
So it's not just the scale orator or

667
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,280
this.

668
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,260
It's we've noticed that water behaves a certain

669
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,220
way and with magnets.

670
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,360
Yes, they've mixed results.

671
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,540
But when you run it over just the

672
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:49,860
block wall, which everyone ignores, I shouldn't say

673
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,980
this, but I'll say it.

674
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,940
I was a short discussion with one of

675
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,060
the largest companies.

676
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,540
Easy to find who it is.

677
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,580
All right.

678
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,080
The largest company, a magnetic company in the

679
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,600
US and it's a woman that's running it

680
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:01,960
and all that.

681
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,280
So we're talking as a supplier.

682
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,080
And I mentioned that she's talking about different

683
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,220
magnets and faces and some some magnets could

684
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:11,960
have multiple poles.

685
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,840
And I'm not interested in that.

686
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,060
So I just need the block wall in

687
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:14,360
between.

688
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,080
As a matter of fact, trying to find

689
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,520
a way to diminish the strength of the

690
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,400
magnet and increase the block wall.

691
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,700
She says, block wall.

692
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,440
Well, we said she was the block.

693
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,540
Well, we we we have some block walls

694
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,020
here, but most of the building is metal

695
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,080
and we have some brick.

696
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,840
Oh, my God.

697
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,820
You know, because we talk about she didn't

698
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,000
even know the block wall.

699
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,800
Oh, boy.

700
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,600
If she's thinking it's a wall wall.

701
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:36,500
Yeah.

702
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,280
Oh, my God.

703
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,760
And I said, oh, she got really quiet

704
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,540
when I showed her that.

705
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,260
Oh, my gosh.

706
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,860
Because first of all, OK, is she a

707
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,180
fault?

708
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:43,480
Yeah.

709
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,060
It's like go to the attorney general.

710
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,120
They don't know any laws or any codes

711
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,140
at all, at all.

712
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:48,720
I mean, at all.

713
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,620
Completely devoid.

714
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,280
Very much just like a doctor doesn't completely

715
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,280
devoid if you start having any discussion about

716
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:56,960
the human body.

717
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,840
Completely devoid.

718
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,620
I mean, just like, oh, my gosh.

719
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,780
So this is very typical.

720
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,540
So she's a she's what I consider a

721
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,140
professional.

722
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:04,460
Right.

723
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,960
Because anyway, they're all screwed up.

724
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,740
So anyway, no stain on her.

725
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,620
It's fine.

726
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,800
That's why that's why I keep telling people,

727
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,860
pick a field, any field.

728
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,180
Get into it.

729
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,060
If you just get really get into it

730
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,880
and don't be don't be feel like a

731
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,980
baited or put off because there are other

732
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,840
people that are professionals and they're morons.

733
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,920
So if you want to get into astrophysics,

734
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,720
magnetism, medicine, whatever, anything like that, don't feel

735
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,360
put off that there already exists a professional

736
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,380
group and they're idiots.

737
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,220
All of them, with very little exception, continue

738
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,160
on that field.

739
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,640
And within six months or a year, you'll

740
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,420
be a world expert.

741
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,060
I'm serious.

742
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,000
And beyond any of those idiotic experts, because

743
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,260
this is the world you're living.

744
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,100
That's what I keep saying.

745
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,900
I have like a lot of meetings, discussions.

746
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,740
This is not a real I'll make a

747
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,840
proposal to do something or make something or

748
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,740
something to happen.

749
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,900
And then someone will be a little skeptic.

750
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,940
By the way, there's a difference between a

751
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,340
skeptic and a naysayer, but a little skeptic.

752
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,080
And I'll say, listen, I know I understand

753
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,600
your skepticism, but we don't live in a

754
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,140
real world.

755
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,820
This is not real, you know.

756
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,320
So if it's not real, what does that

757
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:08,980
mean?

758
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,580
You know, you know, it's like you turn

759
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,360
on a television and when it comes on,

760
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,120
there's a certain channel that's not real because

761
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,660
you can get the remote and go to

762
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,040
another channel, right?

763
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:19,920
And another channel.

764
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,620
And then you could change the format that

765
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,180
does it.

766
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,960
It's really watching, but it's not real.

767
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,120
You have so much control over what is

768
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,620
in the environment, right?

769
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,800
No matter what it is.

770
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,460
And I can prove I've been proving this

771
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,000
over and over.

772
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,420
But look, I'm not supposed to be here.

773
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,780
So I'm not going to act like so

774
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,480
like I do.

775
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:36,980
Right.

776
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,420
So I really don't care.

777
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:42,900
But I've constantly demonstrated Jason Breshears speaks on

778
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,780
this, you know, breaking pattern and calls it

779
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,040
the simulation and all that.

780
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,980
A lot of people also.

781
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,600
But I've been saying for a very, very

782
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,980
long time, pick any field, get into it,

783
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,360
do it.

784
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,720
And you will be a world expert in

785
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,680
a very short group of time because the

786
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,980
people that are in it right now that

787
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,180
are experts are morons.

788
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,040
You think you're not going to do better

789
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,760
than a bunch of more?

790
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,160
All they have is a label.

791
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,020
When you hear about attorneys, doctors, engineers, that's

792
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:07,540
a label.

793
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,340
Those people inside are empty husks filling a

794
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:10,700
position.

795
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,280
They literally have a position.

796
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,720
Like, for example, if you look at the

797
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,460
legal field, they actually have a quota.

798
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,540
How many attorneys we need to hire this

799
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,040
year or not hire.

800
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:21,660
Right.

801
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,280
They have these quotas like with cops.

802
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,700
We need to hire more cops.

803
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:25,860
We need more attorneys.

804
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,000
We need more engineers.

805
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,200
You hear that all the time.

806
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:28,400
Right.

807
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,900
And they also have a limitation on the

808
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,980
number of doctors that are produced in America.

809
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:32,720
I know.

810
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:33,220
That's right.

811
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,500
And we don't need any more.

812
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,200
So they discourage or they have them still

813
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:36,960
get the degree.

814
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,220
Right.

815
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:37,940
Because there's nothing.

816
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,200
It's all private contracts.

817
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,540
So these people are empty and they're lost.

818
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,100
And what their proof of this very good

819
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:44,420
proof.

820
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,360
Put in the latest side, do a general

821
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:46,600
search.

822
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,100
Latest scientific research, 90 percent of it is

823
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:52,580
going to be college kids, little pimply, whatever,

824
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,780
with with Dixie Cups and popsicle sticks stuck

825
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,360
together, making an experiment.

826
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:58,800
I'm serious.

827
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,560
This is what these are the latest scientific

828
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,080
discoveries.

829
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,760
Or it'll be some A.I. bullshit.

830
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,400
There is nothing going on.

831
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:05,900
Zero.

832
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,600
All this stuff that you see that's going

833
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,200
on is basically industrial engineering, how things look,

834
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,260
how they're cobbled together.

835
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,920
So you don't know how it works.

836
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,440
What I mean by that years ago, when

837
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,620
you walked into a printing factory, a printing

838
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,520
house or a factory, you saw the damn

839
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:22,940
machines.

840
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,680
You saw the gears, the screws, the bolts,

841
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,540
the thing, the material being fed in, being

842
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,680
processed, kicked out.

843
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,060
Now, when you go into like a printer

844
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,820
office, a printer, a place where they print

845
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:37,620
things, a factory or whatever, all the machines

846
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,000
look really sleek and covered.

847
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,660
All you do is you put this thing

848
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,300
in here, it comes out.

849
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,840
You don't see anything that's going on.

850
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,060
The same with your stuff at home.

851
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,440
When you get a vacuum cleaner, let's say

852
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,560
you knew where the motor was.

853
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,740
You could see the vents on it.

854
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,320
You see the switch, you know, whatever.

855
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,760
You know, when you got an old toaster,

856
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,960
you know, you didn't want the four year

857
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,400
old brother or sister put a knife in

858
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:56,760
it, right?

859
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,300
You know, like, you know, you saw all

860
00:23:59,300 --> 00:23:59,780
these things.

861
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,600
You were able to see how things work.

862
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,460
They were exposed.

863
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,080
Even with cars, you pop the hood.

864
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,540
You see all the parts of the car.

865
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,800
Now you pop the hood of a car.

866
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,520
It's a fucking plastic cover over the whole

867
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,840
thing you have to take off.

868
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,960
So what they're doing, this is all on

869
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,540
purpose.

870
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,960
Uh, they're, they're, they're getting you to disregard

871
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,680
how things, what things are by based on

872
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,780
what they do, right.

873
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,860
By covering everything.

874
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,040
You said, just do this today and just

875
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:25,620
put this here.

876
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,620
And this is what you're going to get.

877
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,840
They disregard.

878
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,660
So once you separate the human mind from

879
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,280
what is going on to get to the

880
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,860
next step, you've just shut them down completely.

881
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:35,800
Right.

882
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,340
This is, this is where you're at.

883
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,460
That's why all these professionals are idiots.

884
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:40,460
Right.

885
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,840
So all of them were very little exception.

886
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,160
And I've talked about the exceptions.

887
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,000
So are we in trouble?

888
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,020
No, because if you weren't in trouble from

889
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,840
the very beginning, you wouldn't have been allowed

890
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,460
to guide.

891
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,020
In other words, are you in more trouble?

892
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,560
No, because if, if the people had their

893
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,780
shit together, when things were more, let's say

894
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,580
exposed, and you knew what was going on,

895
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,560
if you were headed together back then, you

896
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,820
wouldn't allow this to happen.

897
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,340
So people have been always asleep and they're

898
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,380
always going to be asleep in this type

899
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,300
of situation.

900
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,100
But there's always going to be the few,

901
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,760
maybe like myself, that's going to say, Hey,

902
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,500
look at this, check this out.

903
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:14,760
Right.

904
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,800
So for example, people are proud because they're

905
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,700
technologically advanced because of the phones.

906
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,160
Really?

907
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,960
I'll give a thousand dollars to anyone.

908
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,060
Contact information.

909
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,260
If you could tell me how a cell

910
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:30,940
phone works from the ground up, really how

911
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,280
it works, but you like lay, in other

912
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,320
words, if I took it all apart and

913
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,340
laid it all out, can you piece it

914
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:36,840
all together?

915
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:37,640
It can explain it.

916
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:38,820
All of it.

917
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,440
No one can.

918
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,040
I was just going to say, you know,

919
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,540
about 10, 15 years ago, if you would

920
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,080
have done that to a computer, I could

921
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:45,860
have reassembled it.

922
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,300
No problem.

923
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:46,520
Yeah.

924
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:46,760
Right.

925
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,480
Yeah, exactly.

926
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,440
So, okay.

927
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,980
The part of the, part of the fault

928
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,940
in explaining that as the integration, you can

929
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:56,980
have one chip that's got 10 million switches

930
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,860
in a transistors and one little chip has

931
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,160
10 million, because there's about what, 40 or

932
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,940
50 billion transistors in our average cell phone.

933
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,980
These numbers sound big, but look it up.

934
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,540
I think the new iPhones is a hundred

935
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:10,020
billion transistors in that phone.

936
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,440
The number, what is it?

937
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,780
Remember years ago is that a hundred billion

938
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,240
dollars a stack from here to the moon

939
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,860
used to get proportions like that, right?

940
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,540
Stuff like that.

941
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,400
So stupid shit.

942
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,660
But if you lined up the money, it

943
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,700
would wrap around the earth this many times.

944
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,620
That's again, to give you a proportion and

945
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:24,920
scale.

946
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,760
So when you bought things, looked at machines

947
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,480
or processes, you got to see every step

948
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,580
of the way what was going on.

949
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,840
Now it's all being hidden.

950
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,120
It went in things that people interact the

951
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:33,440
same.

952
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,660
When you go to these professional schools, law

953
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,220
school, medical school, it's like the medical people

954
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,980
don't know anything about a living body.

955
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,240
All they do is look at, I've been

956
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,260
talking about this for a long time.

957
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,160
The other thing I dare people to do,

958
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,260
I was having a discussion.

959
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,820
Someone came back recently.

960
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,040
You're correct.

961
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,740
Greek about 90% of the drugs out

962
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:50,960
there.

963
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,420
I'm not talking about specific drugs.

964
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,460
I'm talking like drugs.

965
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,660
People take for allergies.

966
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,280
Drug people take for this drug.

967
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,980
People take for whatever, just usual, the usual

968
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,220
scripts that are written.

969
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:03,120
90% of those create dementia in the

970
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,660
brain, shrinkage of the brain.

971
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,720
Since the eighties, I've been saying in the

972
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,060
eighties, there was the big thing, you know,

973
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,180
about side effects, right?

974
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:10,600
And all that.

975
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,080
I think it started making it on TV

976
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:12,600
back then.

977
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,320
And drug advertising was in the eighties.

978
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,120
It started, right?

979
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:15,960
I think so.

980
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,260
Yeah.

981
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:16,580
Yeah.

982
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,780
It was not in the seventies.

983
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,800
I know that the only thing you got

984
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,040
in the seventies was maybe mouthwash and deodorant,

985
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,180
aspirin commercials, but a lot of aspirin.

986
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:26,360
Yeah.

987
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,000
But yeah, yeah.

988
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,700
You got a headache.

989
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,200
Take this.

990
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,200
Hey, you don't like aspirin.

991
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:29,840
Take Tylenol.

992
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,360
Yeah.

993
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:30,700
Right.

994
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,660
It was no scripts, nothing with a script.

995
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:33,000
Right.

996
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:37,920
So, so anyway, I said, watch out because

997
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,700
no matter what you're talking about on side

998
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,920
effects, there's no discussion of what the shit

999
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,860
does to your brain.

1000
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,480
It's going to shrink your brain.

1001
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,160
It's going to screw up the electrical brain.

1002
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,760
It's going to make your brain sick all

1003
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:48,900
day.

1004
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,660
And you notice on no side effects, talk

1005
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:54,340
about your liver, sudden death, your balls will

1006
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,360
fall off every, but never talk about the

1007
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:56,540
break.

1008
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,580
Remember what I said, where they're silent as

1009
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:58,780
well.

1010
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,700
The action is going.

1011
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,440
And if some people are doing, we came

1012
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:01,980
back, said Greek.

1013
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:02,260
Yeah.

1014
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,540
It's like these basic, uh, they found this

1015
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:07,000
stuff does, uh, does shrinks your brain.

1016
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,240
This stuff here, just typical allergy stuff, script

1017
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,460
or non-script, you know, a lot of

1018
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,540
the, uh, also I've told people a lot

1019
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,300
of the stuff out there that is over

1020
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,420
the counter used to be a script.

1021
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,040
It always starts off as a script, right?

1022
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,640
Not always, but mostly, mostly.

1023
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,740
So yeah.

1024
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,600
So I was telling people, um, you know,

1025
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,060
you look at this stuff for what it

1026
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,780
does or whatever, and then look at the

1027
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:28,000
drugs about what 40% of the drugs

1028
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,200
over a period of a decade is deemed,

1029
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,640
uh, dangerous.

1030
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,400
And it's taken out.

1031
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,860
The FDA bans it, right.

1032
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,240
Or removes its, uh, certification more than a

1033
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:37,440
half.

1034
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,300
The drugs are like that, right?

1035
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,100
They wait an average between, let's say eight

1036
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,880
to 10 years before they tell you it's

1037
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,320
dangerous, you know, maybe like Accutane and the

1038
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,160
other thing, whatever.

1039
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,560
There's a whole bunch of them.

1040
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,580
And actually the list is thousands of them.

1041
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,960
So this is ridiculous.

1042
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,520
Now where's the outrage?

1043
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,140
Where's cause no one here cares.

1044
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,020
No one's paying attention.

1045
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:59,000
Another example is this is Tracy Twyman and

1046
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,100
a whole bunch of other people.

1047
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:03,120
The madam, the madam that says all these

1048
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,120
people, so I'm not suicidal, not suicidal, but

1049
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,280
they're found hanging in a garage, right?

1050
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,140
And a lot of people say, I'm not

1051
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,120
suicidal, but they're found there.

1052
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,320
So what are their followers?

1053
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:11,920
Oh yeah.

1054
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,560
They killed her.

1055
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,380
And everybody sits back.

1056
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,340
No, no action.

1057
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,440
No real reaction.

1058
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:16,460
Nothing.

1059
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,320
It's like, what a bunch of fucking cowards

1060
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,860
and wimps, right?

1061
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,620
You know, that's why, like when someone says

1062
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,760
you're going to get a lot of support,

1063
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,480
fuck them.

1064
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,980
I don't want anybody's support.

1065
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:25,960
Right.

1066
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,840
You see, because they're not where you, how

1067
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,520
many times have you heard someone being quote

1068
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,260
unquote, an internet or media hero, and then

1069
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,800
they get rubbed out with suicide and they've

1070
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,060
very much said before that I'm not suicidal.

1071
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,320
What are their followers or people that, you

1072
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,160
know, venerated them do nothing.

1073
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,180
Generally.

1074
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,960
No, no one cares.

1075
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:48,480
Even Virginia, Virginia Gu Frey, who was, uh,

1076
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,080
you know, one of the Epstein, uh, victims,

1077
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:50,460
right.

1078
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,440
She recently committed suicide.

1079
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,560
I don't know if you, I know you

1080
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,260
don't watch the news.

1081
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:54,980
No, I know.

1082
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,040
But that's one that we'll do.

1083
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,320
And it's a, well, that's one that said

1084
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,780
I'm not suicidal several times.

1085
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,240
Also.

1086
00:29:59,520 --> 00:29:59,780
Yeah.

1087
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,640
That, that, that's the thing that kills me

1088
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,720
about it is I'm listening to it.

1089
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,280
And these people that knew her are like,

1090
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,520
well, she was very depressed.

1091
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,760
I'm like, but that's not what she was

1092
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,100
saying.

1093
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,520
And you know, what are you guys doing?

1094
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,000
Look, the Epstein thing is so kind.

1095
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,100
They're trying to shade it up.

1096
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,460
Look, I remember once, um, a hillbilly type

1097
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:21,500
guy said he's having sex with his sister

1098
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,500
because he wants, he'd rather hit it first

1099
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,100
than anyone else hitting it first.

1100
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,180
And then he pimped her out for money.

1101
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:27,780
Right.

1102
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:28,960
So he'll Billy type guy.

1103
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,480
And I found out this was not common,

1104
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,080
but if this was in within us, someone

1105
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,160
talking about this person within your own circle,

1106
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,520
it's not a one in a billion thing.

1107
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,200
Like they're trying to make Epstein like it's

1108
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,500
one in 5 billion, right?

1109
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,000
Like let's say 5 billion people on the

1110
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,200
planet.

1111
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,300
He's the only guy doing it.

1112
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:44,520
Right.

1113
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:47,280
First of all, this is very, very common.

1114
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,840
There's pedophilia.

1115
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,000
Then there's pederasty.

1116
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,100
People don't know what the pederasty is when

1117
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,260
you're doing it with teenagers.

1118
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:54,080
Right.

1119
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,100
And those, and that's what pet, what's what

1120
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,060
Epstein was involved in pederasty.

1121
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:58,720
Right.

1122
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,820
Which, which is basically 15, 16, 17 year

1123
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,020
olds being right.

1124
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:04,400
Okay.

1125
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:09,400
So this thing is normal within a certain

1126
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,840
social cut or social, let's say, what would

1127
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,200
you say?

1128
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,780
A latitude or strata strata is a certain

1129
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,660
strata in society that always existed.

1130
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,820
That what Epstein's doing, it is so common

1131
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,080
that if you, if people woke the fuck

1132
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,040
up, they would see it's so common.

1133
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,180
That's even going on with it.

1134
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,620
If you live in a city that has

1135
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,340
more than half a million people, I assure

1136
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,320
you, you have at least three Epstein's like

1137
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,360
that going on right now, a place like

1138
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,040
New York would have a hundred of them

1139
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:36,540
easy.

1140
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,360
Right.

1141
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,340
I remember there was a remote spot in

1142
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,040
Jersey that was kind of like a backwoods

1143
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,620
area where it turns out every time these

1144
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,220
like, you know, kids would end up going

1145
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,700
into the kiddie rehabs, they'd end up spilling

1146
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,400
their guts about how, you know, their families

1147
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,920
were banging them, you know, it was just

1148
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,780
like, and not like just recently.

1149
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,280
I mean, like, you know, since they're eight,

1150
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,760
this kind of thing.

1151
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,280
And they get, do you remember during when,

1152
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:04,300
when Bush poppy Bush became president on TV,

1153
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,600
the call boys, yeah.

1154
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:06,520
Yeah.

1155
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:09,480
When George Bush senior became a, it was

1156
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,280
on TV, there was an orphanage and a

1157
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,960
whole bunch of boys and girls says, Oh,

1158
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:14,780
I know that man.

1159
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,680
He put his peepee in my butt.

1160
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,880
How would they, why would they say that?

1161
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,300
That's bizarre.

1162
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,320
Yeah, I know.

1163
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,380
Why would they say that?

1164
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,520
Why would they just add it?

1165
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,120
I did not only one, but a whole

1166
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,240
bunch of them at a certain point.

1167
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,600
I think it was like near Virginia or

1168
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,400
whatever, you know, this is normal.

1169
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,600
I'm not condoning and saying, Hey, let it

1170
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,160
go or whatever, but it's such bullshit.

1171
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:34,780
And here's the other thing.

1172
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,460
If you believe anything about the Epstein, yes

1173
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,940
or no, and he died or whatever, just

1174
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,500
being attracted to that stuff.

1175
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,640
You got serious issues.

1176
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,060
In other words, you're not good.

1177
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,720
You're definitely not going to know anything about

1178
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,720
cell phones or how anything works for sure,

1179
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,160
or at least you might be able to

1180
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,600
repeat what you've been taught, told to say,

1181
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,020
wait, wait, wait, wait.

1182
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,420
I need to ask you about this.

1183
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,280
Cause you're probably the only person that in

1184
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,080
the world that doesn't like shun me for

1185
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,300
saying this, but every time I see somebody

1186
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:03,260
who's like obsessed about reporting on it or

1187
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,220
they dedicate a lot of time to it,

1188
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,520
I don't know what it is, but all

1189
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,060
of a sudden I get the echo for

1190
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:11,380
them where it's like, there is something wrong

1191
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,440
with you that you need to focus on

1192
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,980
this, this much, you know, you're not personally

1193
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:17,920
connected to it.

1194
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,940
Well, I wouldn't say wrong.

1195
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:20,420
Okay.

1196
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,160
Directly.

1197
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,540
That's maybe more of an outburst.

1198
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,100
I would say that there's, there's wires, their

1199
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,080
character focusing on some, some things.

1200
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,420
So it's so monotone.

1201
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,420
It's terrible.

1202
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,280
I, it's like, it becomes an obsessive thing

1203
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:32,680
with them.

1204
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,000
And it's like, you're almost so much on

1205
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,160
it.

1206
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,520
It makes me feel like it's the same,

1207
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,400
but everyone's doing it because that's why I

1208
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,540
vowed years ago to never do social media

1209
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,020
or YouTube.

1210
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,680
And it's still holding out on it.

1211
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,880
If we had more time, a lot more

1212
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,140
time, I still wouldn't do it.

1213
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:50,040
I've even told someone that put some YouTubes

1214
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:50,400
up myself.

1215
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,660
I don't care if it goes up to

1216
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,820
Mr. Beast, I want nothing to do with

1217
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:53,960
it.

1218
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,220
And I don't, I don't say take it

1219
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:56,500
down.

1220
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,520
I don't want it on YouTube.

1221
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:57,840
Fine.

1222
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,400
If it gets there, fine, but I'm not

1223
00:33:59,400 --> 00:33:59,980
doing shit.

1224
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,260
So I'm not doing anything on any social

1225
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:04,400
media or YouTube or any platform like that.

1226
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,840
I put out what I put out, not

1227
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,340
to put out stuff and get something back.

1228
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,739
Like, Oh, I'm a media figure.

1229
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:12,179
I'm putting it out to get other people

1230
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:13,340
to say the same damn thing.

1231
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,360
I've said it many times.

1232
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,300
You can take a transcript of what I

1233
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,800
said, go out and repeat it and say,

1234
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,000
you came up with it.

1235
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,520
I'm totally cool with it.

1236
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:20,860
Why?

1237
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,020
Because the actual content, the meat, the bone

1238
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,560
and the meat and the skeleton and the

1239
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,420
meat of what I'm saying is getting out

1240
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,159
there and spreading.

1241
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:28,639
Right.

1242
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:31,500
So that's what I'm interested in.

1243
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:33,639
You know, again, I was, I'm not supposed

1244
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,120
to be here.

1245
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,600
Why should I act like I belong here?

1246
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:36,239
That's ridiculous.

1247
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,280
What a hypocrite, right?

1248
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:37,760
Yeah.

1249
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,179
And this way you can just get confused

1250
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,420
with the Greek from the wire.

1251
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:41,159
There you go.

1252
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:42,239
Yeah.

1253
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,739
So you can even say, you know, whatever.

1254
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,800
This just gets confusing.

1255
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,400
If then you say you're the Greek, well,

1256
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,000
who's the other Greek?

1257
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:47,739
I don't care.

1258
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,679
Spread the info, spread it.

1259
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:49,940
Right.

1260
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,800
It's kind of like, uh, I don't know.

1261
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,940
It's got, it's not, it's not, but it

1262
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,199
is working like years ago.

1263
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:57,440
For example, right now, if you just peruse

1264
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,600
YouTube, the other thing I wanted to mention,

1265
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,960
by the way, I'll get back perusing, uh,

1266
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,300
you know how everything is hidden from us,

1267
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,640
you know, like, you know, how a machine

1268
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,220
works, it's got all these covers, you just

1269
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,800
put this in, this happens and it's called

1270
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,360
disconnected and you get this rush when it's

1271
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:11,600
done.

1272
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:12,420
Okay.

1273
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,060
It's a goal of going to a computer.

1274
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,740
They call it an algorithm and it really

1275
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,160
looks at your previous searches and it suggests

1276
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,720
what you should want.

1277
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,140
Like you open a YouTube page and it's

1278
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,680
telling you what you should want.

1279
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,000
Right.

1280
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,360
So in other words, try to always ignore

1281
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,800
that because very often you'll follow this.

1282
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,640
Oh, this is in line.

1283
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,060
What do I do?

1284
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,600
And then you get caught in this spiral,

1285
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,420
a dopamine spiral.

1286
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,280
Like, look, I'm interested in this.

1287
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,940
I'm glad it came up and the search,

1288
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,400
they always ignore it by the way.

1289
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,060
So when I opened a YouTube page or

1290
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,360
whatever, I looked the other way.

1291
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,880
I kind of almost cover the screen where

1292
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,500
I just see the search box and put

1293
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:47,980
in what I want.

1294
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,720
Ignore anything they're putting up.

1295
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,940
Do that until you become strong enough in

1296
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,560
your own mind.

1297
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,320
Because years ago they asked people what you

1298
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:55,520
want.

1299
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,300
Now they're always telling you what you want.

1300
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,080
That's why they're getting away with.

1301
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,660
That's why they're getting away with the Epstein

1302
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:01,980
stuff.

1303
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,880
They're telling people you want to know.

1304
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,560
They even said, this is what you want

1305
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:05,940
to know.

1306
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,180
They even say that in some of the

1307
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:07,460
things.

1308
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:08,660
Oh my gosh.

1309
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,600
So you're pretty much finished right now as

1310
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,000
a society and as individuals.

1311
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,860
I see very few people of have any

1312
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:16,460
merit at all around me, wherever I go,

1313
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:16,840
whatever.

1314
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,580
And you have to make them.

1315
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,140
Here's the thing.

1316
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,980
If I want to do something or accomplish

1317
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,500
something, it's like, imagine you have a nation

1318
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,960
or country and you have no army, you

1319
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,560
have no soldiers.

1320
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,220
What do you do?

1321
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,800
You open a fucking boot camp and you

1322
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,500
start getting people who know how to make

1323
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,780
a soldier and you, you, you invite coerce,

1324
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:37,900
uh, whatever, recruit conscript people to come in

1325
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,460
and you train them.

1326
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,200
And now guess what?

1327
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:40,720
After what?

1328
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,940
30, 90 days a year.

1329
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,280
What?

1330
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,860
Get some uniforms.

1331
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,340
Now you got what?

1332
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,860
An army, an army, right?

1333
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,720
So you people say, Oh, who are you

1334
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,360
going to find Greek?

1335
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:49,680
No, no.

1336
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,680
I don't look to find someone to be

1337
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:51,980
able to do.

1338
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,700
I make who I need to do.

1339
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,980
If I need someone to do a thing,

1340
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:55,940
Hey, you, you want to do this?

1341
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,140
I'm going to make, I'm going to show

1342
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,540
you, I'm going to turn you into this.

1343
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,540
So for example, if I need a dentist,

1344
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,840
let's say I don't look for dentists.

1345
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,040
Hey, you, I'm going to turn you into

1346
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:04,500
a dentist.

1347
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,500
This is what teeth are.

1348
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,220
This is a few.

1349
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,500
Are you interested in that?

1350
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:08,320
Yeah.

1351
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:08,900
Okay.

1352
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,600
I want to, you know, I need a

1353
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,300
marketing person.

1354
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,300
Fuck the marketing people.

1355
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:12,720
They're idiots.

1356
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,180
You want to do marketing?

1357
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,220
I know nothing about perfect.

1358
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:15,720
All right, come here.

1359
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,960
I'm going to turn you into a marketing

1360
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,060
person in 90 days.

1361
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,700
How do you like that?

1362
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:19,980
You make them.

1363
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,880
So that's what gods do, by the way,

1364
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,960
they create different beings and they create, and

1365
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,540
we have the ability to do that right

1366
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:27,860
now.

1367
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,940
And perfect example is bootcamp.

1368
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:30,380
Yeah.

1369
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,120
Imagine a country, no army.

1370
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:32,740
What do they do?

1371
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,300
They bring in someone who knows how to

1372
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,080
start an army.

1373
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,220
They make bootcamp.

1374
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,140
You get the same people.

1375
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,400
And now you turn them into soldiers.

1376
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,980
This is how life works.

1377
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,580
This is the same thing about relationships.

1378
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,640
You need to, you need to have a

1379
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,340
relationship with someone.

1380
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,180
Just go pick someone.

1381
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:48,340
They have to be trainable and, um, they

1382
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:51,720
don't, they shouldn't have anything that's physically repulsive

1383
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,120
to you.

1384
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,320
So if you like big noses, don't pick

1385
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,440
someone with a small nose, right?

1386
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,800
It's because that's, that'll be repulsive to you.

1387
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,460
You can't change that.

1388
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,660
That is well, you know, things can be,

1389
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,200
it's funny how you can make things smaller,

1390
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,780
but you can't make them bigger, except to

1391
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,660
maybe, I don't know.

1392
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,140
Do they even have stuff to make a

1393
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,400
guy's schlongs bigger now?

1394
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:07,820
I don't know.

1395
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,540
Yeah, they do.

1396
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,720
But they do.

1397
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,000
Yeah.

1398
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,420
I think there's, someone told me they got

1399
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,340
the Nike pump even thing.

1400
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,560
They got all kinds of, yeah.

1401
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,640
Oh my gosh.

1402
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,420
I, you know, but anyway, so that's an

1403
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,060
idiocracy.

1404
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,680
You know, the medical was only interested in

1405
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,320
hair growth and penis erectile stuff.

1406
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,580
This is pretty much where you are.

1407
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,480
Um, so you learn to make people like,

1408
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:29,040
um, the head of the household years ago

1409
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,780
was important because the head of the household

1410
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:36,420
made everyone up or the TV did, or

1411
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,660
the school did, that's what they relied on.

1412
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,040
That's why we keep your children in there

1413
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:40,560
for so long.

1414
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:43,280
So you become like one of these degenerate

1415
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,920
educators, whatever.

1416
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,160
You know, it's not like when I was,

1417
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,600
when I was in school and.
