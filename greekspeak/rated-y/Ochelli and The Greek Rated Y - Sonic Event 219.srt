1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,640
And we're ready to roll.

2
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,600
Rated Y Sonic Event 219, I guess.

3
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,260
Anyway, how are you doing, Greek?

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:18,920
Doing okay.

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:19,840
Real busy.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,600
A lot of brain juice going.

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,080
A lot of stuff I'd like to one

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:25,940
day talk about.

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,220
More water devices.

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,360
Interesting stuff.

11
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,760
And other stuff, yeah.

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,980
You sound a little calmer today, I just

13
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:34,500
wanted to say.

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,580
I don't know what it is, but you

15
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,240
sound a little less juiced up.

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,520
I mean, you were like, extra level the

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,640
last couple of times you got together.

18
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,640
L-tryptophan from roasted chicken.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,800
If you guys ever make chicken.

20
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,880
Actually, any fresh chicken or whatever.

21
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,060
Soak it in, do a brine with salt,

22
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:53,860
ginger, and garlic.

23
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,480
And it helps if you put the ginger

24
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,360
and garlic in a blender so everything's liquefied.

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,260
For about three hours.

26
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,560
And then when you cook and undercook.

27
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,680
You think you're undercooking, it cuts the cooking

28
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,460
time by a third or cuts it in

29
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:06,720
half.

30
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,420
So like a three and a half pound

31
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,960
chicken, I was able to roast it outside

32
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,360
in under 25 minutes.

33
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,100
And it was done.

34
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,880
And never follow instructions about killing salmonella and

35
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,240
all that foodborne bacteria.

36
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,120
Because the heat doesn't kill it.

37
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,040
So you always want to use organic meat

38
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,360
that never has or typically doesn't have salmonella.

39
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,300
Oh, yeah.

40
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,620
Yeah, so when they tell you that you

41
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,960
have to cook it for food safety, you're

42
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,720
an idiot if you believe that.

43
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,900
It means it's diseased meat.

44
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,460
You should never eat anything diseased.

45
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,160
So, yeah, there's no guarantee because they say

46
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,740
it about everything.

47
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,460
But usually the only reason the salmonella and

48
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,540
all that stuff exists is because of farming

49
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,200
practices.

50
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,980
It's not even a real natural occurring thing.

51
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,360
It's kind of like how whores have STDs.

52
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,560
Right.

53
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,540
It's because usually that in a society where

54
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,320
that kind of lifestyle is put down, the

55
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,020
people don't take care of themselves.

56
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,360
It's not that all prostitutes or whores have

57
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,360
STDs.

58
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,280
Right.

59
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,639
It's because when they get pushed into a

60
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:12,600
certain category and certain people that are bad

61
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,120
at hygiene.

62
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:13,440
Right.

63
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,940
So it's the same thing.

64
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:15,660
It's true.

65
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:15,880
Yeah.

66
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,960
Chickens are whores now.

67
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,180
Right.

68
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,140
Anyway, chicken head.

69
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,980
But anyway, I just want to put that

70
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,400
out there.

71
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,180
That too.

72
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,660
Hey, listen, speaking of safety, a quick question

73
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,440
because they asked me about like BPA and

74
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,140
BPPF and all this stuff.

75
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,720
And we're wondering if your water devices do

76
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,180
anything about that kind of chemical influence in

77
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:33,560
the water.

78
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,820
Or do you have some suggestion regarding that?

79
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:37,860
Unknown.

80
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:38,680
Unknown.

81
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,540
The best thing for that, because they are

82
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,440
considered organics and VOCs and all that.

83
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,240
Charcoal.

84
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,180
Charcoal is an absorber.

85
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,260
And also learn to use adsorbers.

86
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,980
Absorber, adsorber.

87
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:54,460
It's absorber with a D like zeolite and

88
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,120
magnetite.

89
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,160
But carbon.

90
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,820
Carbon is the number one deal.

91
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,840
When they pulled all the coal out of,

92
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,760
you know, the coal mining in the Appalachians

93
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,360
and all that.

94
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,060
The spring people were getting sick from the

95
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,360
spring water because it pulled the carbon layer

96
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:09,760
out.

97
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,960
That was actually helping the water stay clean.

98
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,660
They were getting radiation in the water and

99
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,420
all kinds of stuff.

100
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:16,680
Yeah.

101
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,520
So you need carbon for absorption.

102
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:20,940
Fair enough.

103
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,000
And look, I mean, it does have standard

104
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,740
uses even among medical idiots.

105
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,500
Because, you know, if you get enough of

106
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,240
something toxic in your system, they stick a

107
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,520
bunch of charcoal in your gut.

108
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,520
It does help to soak up some stuff

109
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,380
and get it out of there.

110
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:33,940
Well, yeah.

111
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,540
The stuff in your gut doesn't stay there

112
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,420
very long unless it's like stuck there.

113
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:38,820
Yeah.

114
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:39,180
Yeah.

115
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,240
They're never, they're never.

116
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,380
The whole, the whole system, the medical needs

117
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,700
to be completely scrapped.

118
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,320
And the theories are all wrong.

119
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,480
What needs to be kept are the basic

120
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,380
procedures that have been adapted that work.

121
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,560
And the rest of it is just an

122
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,120
idiot's heaven or idiots.

123
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,700
It's actually the medical system is a heaven

124
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,980
for idiots and hell for anyone who has

125
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,440
got at least four brain cells.

126
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,640
Yeah, I understand that.

127
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,440
I'm just saying that it has a practical

128
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,760
use even in that system.

129
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,860
It's sort of like using sand or an

130
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,640
abrasive when you're cleaning stuff up.

131
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,720
And, you know, you got the soap and

132
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,220
you add a little extra grind to it.

133
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,640
It helps.

134
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,320
You know what I mean?

135
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,420
A lot of people don't think that.

136
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:16,399
But anyway.

137
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,200
Mechanic soap.

138
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:17,540
Yeah.

139
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:17,920
Yeah.

140
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,120
Yeah.

141
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:18,760
What was that?

142
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,079
They used to go, but it was lava.

143
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,540
Lava soap was the big thing.

144
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,000
Lava.

145
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,180
There was gojo.

146
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,160
There was a couple of them.

147
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:27,420
Yeah.

148
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,360
It's like abrasive.

149
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,880
Pumice is usually what they use.

150
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,220
It's not so sharp.

151
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:31,620
Yeah.

152
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,040
Well, that's, but, you know, you can do

153
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,480
that with a good sponge or a good,

154
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,300
or stone.

155
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:35,920
You know what I mean?

156
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,980
It just got a little bit of an

157
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,620
abrasive to it and it takes away a

158
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,120
little bit of skin, but all the rest

159
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,440
of the stuff that's on top of it.

160
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,640
Anyways, I read one time in a book.

161
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,800
This is from a listener.

162
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,040
I read one time in a book that

163
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,880
immortality is the continuation of memory, no matter

164
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,780
where you go after leaving the physical.

165
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,000
What do you think about that?

166
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,080
This is a question for you and they

167
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,800
have a follow up.

168
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,780
But what do you think about that?

169
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,880
Well, it seems it's interrupted now.

170
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,340
Yeah.

171
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:03,560
Right.

172
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,780
If you were, if there was a before

173
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,960
for you, it's been shut off and interrupted.

174
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,580
That's why I keep saying there's no school

175
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:10,880
here.

176
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,700
You know, like imagine someone go gets a

177
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,200
doctorate degree and then they wipe your brain

178
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,020
at the end of college.

179
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:16,320
Right.

180
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,360
What do they do anyway?

181
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,340
But you know what I mean?

182
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,120
Yeah.

183
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,800
So no, I don't know enough about that.

184
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,680
I think that's one of the things that

185
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,340
it's one of those first principle questions like,

186
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,780
you know, if you're on a TV screen,

187
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,120
you can't talk about the pixels.

188
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:30,960
Right.

189
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,520
I understand.

190
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,960
You know, but I look at it this

191
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,460
way too.

192
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,720
Just because you're in a library, you pick

193
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,360
up a book.

194
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,460
It doesn't mean that there isn't another book

195
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,120
that tells you about what happened before that

196
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,760
book was written.

197
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,040
So, you know, you may just be in

198
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,840
a certain book, but everything is in the

199
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,240
library.

200
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,200
You know what I'm saying?

201
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:48,440
Yeah.

202
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,360
But if you could consider immortal also being

203
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,720
there's two types of immortality, right?

204
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,300
One where you can't be killed and it's

205
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,600
a continuum, right?

206
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,360
Or the other one where you're killed and

207
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,180
you're brought back.

208
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,120
Right.

209
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,080
Well, and in that way, I think in

210
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,540
this one, it's definitely the latter.

211
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,220
Well, and in that way, the reaches of

212
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,100
people who are into like the transhumanism and

213
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,460
transferring your memory and your personality into stuff.

214
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,160
Yeah.

215
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,440
That new entity, that new machine language thing,

216
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,040
if they were able to actually pick up

217
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,480
the human brain and stick it onto a

218
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,300
computer, we'd think it was you.

219
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:19,840
Right.

220
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,560
Even though it's not.

221
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,600
Well, yeah, yeah.

222
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,340
Sure.

223
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,880
But the way it's being done now is

224
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,360
not because of anything with people.

225
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,480
They're at war with nature.

226
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,840
The entities that control mankind are not human,

227
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,500
but they use human agents to intervene or

228
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:40,960
as agents to interface.

229
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,100
They're at war with the natural world, the

230
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:44,900
way it's set up.

231
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,620
That's why you have the transgender and all

232
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,420
this other and the chemicals and all this

233
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,020
other stuff.

234
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,480
You know, in other words, they want to

235
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,620
change things.

236
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,540
It sounds like a commercial.

237
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,680
What nature intended.

238
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:58,900
Right.

239
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,780
What's a natural path like when a man

240
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,140
wants to be a woman or one wants

241
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,520
to be a man has nothing to do

242
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,480
with whatever it has to do with.

243
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,420
You've fallen for a narrative that is against

244
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,300
nature.

245
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,580
It's the same.

246
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,020
So someone who wants to be transgender is

247
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,900
no different than the people who want to

248
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,900
make synthetic whatever food or want to do

249
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,480
the transhuman agenda.

250
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,040
The transhumanism thing.

251
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:23,300
Yeah.

252
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,680
Their follow up fits in perfectly with the

253
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,480
chronology of what you're talking about right here,

254
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,260
because because if our memory can be completely

255
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,160
erased, this this listener asks, how can we

256
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,920
talk about the immortality of the spirit?

257
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:36,700
Question mark.

258
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,260
If we are if we are in mind,

259
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,260
then memory is the fuel that feeds the

260
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:43,600
mind.

261
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,540
Could acting on intuition be the proof that

262
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,820
we indeed have these memories stored, but we

263
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,800
access them through what you call the emotional

264
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,640
or the emo of the mind?

265
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:54,580
Yeah.

266
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,320
Very good.

267
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,100
The intent is formless.

268
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,900
Like, for example, when you have clay and

269
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,860
a pot is made out of the clay,

270
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,000
you can't say what is the essence of

271
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,360
the pot?

272
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:06,860
It's clay.

273
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,540
It's just clay in the form of a

274
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:08,800
pot.

275
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,520
Can you separate the pot from the clay?

276
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,520
No, because once the clay is gone, the

277
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,200
pot is gone.

278
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,960
So you have like a the spirit, the

279
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,140
realm of the mind, which is purely intangible.

280
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,740
I've always said that when I define spirit

281
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,260
and soul, soul is tangible.

282
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,820
It's a life force.

283
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,180
You know, you can put your soul into

284
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,560
somebody else's soul and revive them if you

285
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:30,900
could.

286
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,419
And, you know, CPR, for example, someone's not

287
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:34,720
breathing.

288
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,659
Your breath is your soul, but it's more

289
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:37,179
than the breath.

290
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,700
It's the vital signs.

291
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,179
So but it relies on the breath.

292
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,480
If you read a lot of the ancient

293
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,360
stuff, everything turns into breath.

294
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,990
So the spirit is completely intangible.

295
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:52,590
So speaking of it, because it's intangible, even

296
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:56,570
trying to apply an adjective or pronoun or

297
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,950
whatever of immortal to it is not appropriate

298
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:00,970
because it's intangible.

299
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,690
In other words, for something to be immortal

300
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:04,290
or mortal, it has to be tangible.

301
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:05,350
Right.

302
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:09,190
So like the pot is really what we

303
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:13,370
call something when clay is made into a

304
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:13,650
pot.

305
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:19,550
When we call it a pot, because it's

306
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,730
really still clay.

307
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:21,670
Right.

308
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,790
It's because you cannot separate.

309
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,350
Once you take the clay away, there's no

310
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:25,970
more pot.

311
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,610
So in essence, most of the things that

312
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,170
we describe through language and our notion can

313
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:35,650
be considered intangible once we consider the things

314
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,470
that they're made of.

315
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:40,490
So this is a very logical or philosophical

316
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:41,150
thing.

317
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,450
But I just right away break it down

318
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,450
to if we're discussing something that has tangibility

319
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:47,970
on its own or not.

320
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,270
But I'll tell you the mind and the

321
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,450
spirit has no tangibility on its own.

322
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:52,930
It has to be animated somehow.

323
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:55,950
At least in the way we can see

324
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:56,430
it now.

325
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:00,910
Yeah, but is the animation an evidence or

326
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:04,970
is it a resulting effect of the thing's

327
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:05,410
existence?

328
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,570
There's a difference there.

329
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,410
In other words, can you be a spirit

330
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:10,050
inanimate?

331
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:10,570
Yeah, sure.

332
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,930
For example, if you have a CD collection

333
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:16,990
or something on a computer chip, as long

334
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,450
as it doesn't get corrupted, you can animate

335
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,570
it at any time and then put it

336
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,610
back into spaces or storage, right?

337
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:23,350
Right, right.

338
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,350
That's what I was getting at.

339
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,950
Like pure information.

340
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:27,530
Right.

341
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,950
That's the thing.

342
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,990
Pure information is intangible.

343
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:34,130
That's why very often you have people say,

344
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,830
well, how am I supposed to use that

345
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,690
information, making it tangible?

346
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:38,790
It's a very big thing.

347
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,670
It's easier.

348
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:43,090
Okay, the way we're set up, the way

349
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,390
we're wired and all that, that's an easy

350
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:48,330
way to explain, is the only way we

351
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,010
can perceive it.

352
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,470
Again, it's a first principle thing.

353
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,230
Like the ether, very difficult to discuss.

354
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,610
And just like if your entire existence is

355
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:01,290
pixels on a television screen, you cannot discuss

356
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,110
the pixels no matter how you can try.

357
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,810
Fish have that same problem.

358
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,790
Like most fish, before they die, they realize

359
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:08,450
they're in water.

360
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:10,410
Then you've got these fish that go to

361
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,430
the other fish and say, do you know,

362
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,010
I think we're underwater, and they all laugh

363
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:13,430
at them, right?

364
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:14,990
Oh, yeah, of course.

365
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:15,450
Anyway.

366
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:16,910
No, that's interesting.

367
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,790
And the other thing is this started more

368
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,830
of a conversation, and basically I'm going to

369
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:23,430
condense this.

370
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,910
They're asking about, you know, look, they hear

371
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:28,630
ideas, right, and they have no technical knowledge,

372
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,350
not even a hint of what it is,

373
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,870
especially on the discussions that you and I

374
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:33,210
have here.

375
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:36,150
They say they hear stuff, and it resonates

376
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,070
with them somehow.

377
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,410
They know it's right, and they know it's

378
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:39,610
right.

379
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,270
It's not a matter of they're guessing it's

380
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:41,430
right.

381
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,370
It sounds good, but they know it's correct.

382
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:46,270
And it feels like they do have some

383
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,310
knowledge somewhere, but they can't access it.

384
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,670
They have no idea where it is.

385
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,170
And they're asking, you know, is this just

386
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,870
something where they're waiting for a button to

387
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:56,030
be hit, and that's going to lose that

388
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,050
knowledge, or they're going to do something, and

389
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,410
that's going to bring them that knowledge by

390
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:01,410
inspiration.

391
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,330
Yeah, it is, just like the pot and

392
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:04,630
the clay.

393
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:08,350
The clay is very easy to understand, and

394
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,250
so is the pot, because you've used a

395
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:10,430
pot.

396
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,470
If you've never seen a pot before, or

397
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,690
any purpose that you would suffice to need

398
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:17,470
a pot for, you would need some explanation,

399
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,410
and then you get it.

400
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,470
So it's the same thing.

401
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,530
But then again, you know, you could discover

402
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:23,090
that clay a long time from now.

403
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,790
It doesn't resemble a pot, and then you

404
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,450
take it and once again form it into

405
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:26,890
a cup.

406
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,710
Now, it's still the same clay, but it's

407
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:32,230
been reformed once again, and now it represents

408
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,230
something else that is finally tangible.

409
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:37,050
See, that again talks about the transition between

410
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,770
the inanimate and the animate, like you were

411
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,550
talking about before with the information on the

412
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,650
CD, right?

413
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:44,530
So the information on the CD is still

414
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,230
within the clay, but you have to do

415
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,890
something in order to bring it out, right?

416
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,090
Yeah, but there's another level to that.

417
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,050
Water shows that, like water has memory.

418
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,290
See, water's an exception.

419
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,210
See, water's a different thing.

420
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,670
That's what's weird to me.

421
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,230
Like, I don't know how to articulate this,

422
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:01,970
so I ask you.

423
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,530
You know, water seems to me to be,

424
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:08,510
yes, it obeys the majority of the laws,

425
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:12,030
right, of the physical, you know, circumstance here,

426
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,610
but it's got extra to it.

427
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:16,670
And it's not a profound, like, you know,

428
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,790
it glows or it makes noises.

429
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:22,130
It doesn't obviously present itself as extras, but

430
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,830
like you were talking about where it's got

431
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:26,150
that weird sink in the temperature.

432
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,770
Last time we talked about this.

433
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:31,150
And, you know, it's difficult to get it

434
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,790
out of the one temperature from, like, well,

435
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:33,730
you can get there easy.

436
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:37,210
In other words, it's quite the coincidence that

437
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:40,110
our blood temperature is at 98.6, and

438
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,690
that's where water likes to stay.

439
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:42,030
Right.

440
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,050
When it reaches that, yeah.

441
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,530
It's resistant to moving, you know, lower.

442
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,470
Yeah, it sits at 98.6. In other

443
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,170
words, you could take heat and cold.

444
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:52,550
It'll stay stable at 98.6 with variations

445
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,990
in external temperatures, yeah?

446
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:54,570
Right.

447
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,870
And that's an interesting thing, but that's where

448
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:00,070
water is different from other things in the,

449
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,170
you know, in the.

450
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:01,530
.

451
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:01,650
.

452
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,270
Yeah, it's got a lot of other interesting

453
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,250
things other than typical.

454
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:06,690
.

455
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:06,790
.

456
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,470
They call it a universal solvent, but it's

457
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:11,230
actually a universal oxidizer.

458
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,710
And because it's an oxidizer, water is actually

459
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,170
burning all the time.

460
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,490
That's more on the alchemic.

461
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:18,990
.

462
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:19,490
.

463
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,490
It's equivalent to fire.

464
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:24,130
Because fire as an oxidizer.

465
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:25,070
.

466
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:25,170
.

467
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,710
Like someone who's, you know, into the chemical,

468
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,990
control of the chemical world will always see

469
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:32,350
fire as an oxidizer, but most people see

470
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,270
it, oh, that's just fire.

471
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:33,690
It's hot.

472
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:34,910
Well, it's oxidizing.

473
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:35,710
Right.

474
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,830
And water is an oxidizer, so they're paired.

475
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,990
But most people take fire more seriously than

476
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,230
water for obvious reasons.

477
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:43,710
Right.

478
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,170
And, of course, I'm a little more simple

479
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,570
-minded, so I always say, you know, look,

480
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:47,950
don't laugh at the people that told you

481
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,290
that fire, water, and earth are elements, you

482
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:50,450
know.

483
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,530
They do the same thing.

484
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,550
As a matter of fact, you know, when

485
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,950
you put wood in fire, it gets darker

486
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:56,510
and darker.

487
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,450
And if you put wood in water, what

488
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:58,810
happens?

489
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,710
It gets darker and darker.

490
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:01,110
Right.

491
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,610
Look at the color of driftwood.

492
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:03,390
Right.

493
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,990
It gets darker and it changes.

494
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,630
It actually stains black.

495
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:07,030
Right.

496
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,370
So there's a whole level.

497
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:08,730
.

498
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:08,830
.

499
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:09,190
One day I'll .

500
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:09,290
.

501
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:09,390
.

502
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:09,750
One day.

503
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:12,650
One day we'll talk about the stuff I've

504
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,010
been looking at for a long time.

505
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,230
I've worked with some people.

506
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,950
We've done a bunch of transmutation.

507
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,430
Enough that will fetch a bunch of trouble

508
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,430
if you talked about it.

509
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:20,730
I have a .

510
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:20,830
.

511
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:20,930
.

512
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:21,630
I'm actually in the office.

513
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:22,530
I was moving things around.

514
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,470
I have a box full of samples.

515
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,610
There's about 250 samples in there of things

516
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:28,730
we've actually changed.

517
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,070
And we .

518
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:31,250
.

519
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:31,350
.

520
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,190
Yeah, based on the principle I just mentioned,

521
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,790
that water is actually always burning.

522
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,430
But you can't say it like that because,

523
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,030
well, burning is not hot.

524
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,510
Well, you know, I mean, it's an oxidizer.

525
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:43,510
Once you learn to judge fire always as

526
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,610
being an oxidizer.

527
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,450
So anyway, yeah, and the water does the

528
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,290
same but in a different way.

529
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:50,870
Fair enough.

530
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,730
Look, this is more focused on the questions

531
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:54,490
this time, and this one's a little different

532
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:56,730
but somehow falls into the same category.

533
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,550
It's weird the way this stuff comes together.

534
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,730
Anyway, could you ask the Greek because they're

535
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,010
addressing me in this one.

536
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,510
Could you ask the Greek about ways to

537
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,690
improve gas mileage, question mark?

538
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:07,290
Yeah, definitely.

539
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,610
Remember him saying it was possible to drive

540
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,650
across the country on a single tank of

541
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:11,950
gas.

542
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:14,310
I'm curious what it would take to make

543
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:17,390
that happen and whether it's still possible with

544
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:23,530
modern combustion engines, maybe modern governors and all

545
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:24,830
kinds of weird things on them.

546
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:25,690
Yeah, but here's the thing.

547
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,610
I doubt it because if you do the

548
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,190
math, I don't know about cross-country.

549
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,870
I don't know because there's the long way

550
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,450
and the short way, New York to Florida,

551
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,710
and then you've got New York to California.

552
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:37,030
But it depends on what some country.

553
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:38,250
Maybe it's a small country.

554
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:43,270
But typically automotive design, like sedans and things

555
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,150
that people, like a family would buy or

556
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:48,950
whatever, usually have a 300-mile range.

557
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:53,290
But increasing gas mileage, the newer the car,

558
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,850
the harder it is to do because they

559
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:59,370
have fuel injectors which are controlled by an

560
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:03,210
electronic control module, ECU, PCU, and there's a

561
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:05,089
whole bunch of them, and that will sabotage

562
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:05,569
the engine.

563
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:08,349
In other words, you could put a whole

564
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:12,630
bunch of fuel-efficient modifications on the engine.

565
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:14,569
Most of them, you don't have to buy

566
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:14,849
anything.

567
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:18,950
You just remodify what's there, and you'll get

568
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:21,670
good gas mileage for maybe 15, 20 minutes,

569
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,190
maybe a day, and then it will go

570
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,849
back to maybe making it worse.

571
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,890
This is all malevolent shit.

572
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:31,030
The only way you could do it is

573
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,710
if you have something with a carburetor.

574
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,290
That's why I tell people if you have

575
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:37,230
a lawnmower, usually they run about 20 minutes

576
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:37,990
or so.

577
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,190
I can very simply extend it so it

578
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,590
runs 40 to 50 minutes.

579
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:45,310
I'm sorry, about, yeah, 35 to 40 minutes,

580
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,330
usually almost double.

581
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:50,550
Somebody sent me a Honda generator.

582
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,310
I wanted the spark plug and the carburetor,

583
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:57,050
and he usually got, I don't know, 7

584
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:00,650
hours run time, something just under 6 or

585
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,230
7, between 6 and 7, and we got

586
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:03,230
it to over 12.

587
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,050
Simple modification, 15-minute modification.

588
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,810
It's got to have a carburetor, though, a

589
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:11,230
natural, not just naturally aspirated, but a carburetor,

590
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,550
not fuel injection, no electronics controls.

591
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:18,750
Some very rudimentary electronic controls, like pre-1990

592
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,770
cars, we can do it.

593
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:23,390
But after 1995, when the OBD-1, which

594
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:26,570
is the onboard diagnostic systems, came out, they

595
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:32,530
really started building in these, I call it,

596
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,330
sabotage protocols.

597
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:39,190
One thing, there was a bunch of group

598
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:42,750
of people that got around the sabotage protocols

599
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,870
and were building 100-mile-per-gallon Ford

600
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,490
Tauruses and stuff like that.

601
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,790
And that got out, and they were threatening

602
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:53,330
to make that knowledge worldwide, and that's when

603
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,630
Obama did the cash for clunkers.

604
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:58,510
Let's get all the old cars that potentially

605
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,410
benefit from this off the road and fill

606
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,850
the engines with cement, right?

607
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:06,250
So, yeah, there's always a reason, a very

608
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,910
nefarious reason behind all this stuff.

609
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:10,250
Very nefarious.

610
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,730
We're in a very...

611
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:17,550
All of the authorities, religious, financial, medical, they're

612
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,450
all at war with the population.

613
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:20,710
They're elements of war.

614
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,330
It's just like what they did with coins,

615
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:22,570
Greg.

616
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,810
The reason why they removed the precious metals

617
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,730
from the coins is because the precious metals

618
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,650
were worth more than what the coins represented.

619
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,250
So what did they do?

620
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,950
They either priced you out of it, or

621
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:34,230
they destroyed them, which is exactly what they

622
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,610
do with even the cars, right?

623
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:36,690
They either price you out.

624
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,330
It's now a classic car, so now it's

625
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:40,450
worth so much more that it's not even

626
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:43,010
close to affordable to get something that's 80

627
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:45,330
years old, or it's destroyed.

628
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,690
It's no longer available.

629
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,710
So you can make it unavailable or unattainable.

630
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,190
The two things you could do to improve

631
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:54,110
gas mileage real fast, but don't hope it'll

632
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,650
work if you have anything past 2000.

633
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:00,790
Actually, anything past 1998, really, it'll help.

634
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:05,270
It'll get more power and all that, but

635
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,290
the electrode on the spark plug should have

636
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,170
a tiny hole on it.

637
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,630
The J-strap, the part where the spark

638
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,650
hits, has a very small hole.

639
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,490
Recently, the past two years, I've discovered that

640
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:18,010
geometry of the hole is critical.

641
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,630
It has to be exponential, which looks like

642
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:22,030
a cone.

643
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,530
It's not a straight hole, so it's narrow

644
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:25,650
on the spark end and wider as it

645
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:26,750
goes out through the strap.

646
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,770
Is this the relative equivalent to boring out

647
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:33,390
the pieces on a dirt bike like they

648
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,970
used to do in order to make them...?

649
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,030
No, no, no.

650
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:37,310
This is just the spark plug.

651
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:40,970
So the spark, the forward motion of the

652
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:41,310
ignition...

653
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,370
Yeah, they used to do something to the

654
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:45,570
spark plug, plus drill a hole in the

655
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,350
carburetor, I thought, which was...

656
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,590
I didn't understand it, but these guys told

657
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,270
me something very interesting.

658
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:52,230
We have to be very strategic about it.

659
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,410
The other thing is there's something called a

660
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,490
gadget man groove by Ron Hatton.

661
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,110
You could look that up.

662
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,830
I offer that.

663
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,670
I offer my own version of it, which

664
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,270
is superior.

665
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:07,490
Yeah, grooving the throttle body.

666
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:08,290
You could look him up.

667
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,790
Now, Ron, I was in discussion with him

668
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:12,450
for many years, and he was always saying,

669
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:13,530
we're going to make the world a better

670
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:14,790
place, we're going to make the world...

671
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:15,890
He killed himself.

672
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:18,270
Well, basically, he took a bunch of drugs,

673
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,510
drove on a mountain pass, got into a

674
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,350
really bad accident.

675
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,290
They tore his arm and leg off or

676
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:23,590
something.

677
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,610
Yeah, not necessarily in that order, but yeah,

678
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:25,790
go ahead.

679
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,370
Yeah, and they sewed it back on.

680
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,210
He woke up and he pulled life support

681
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:32,670
off himself because he got really depressed that

682
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:33,550
no one really cared.

683
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:34,930
And I said, no one cares here, dude.

684
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,450
I kept telling him, dude, nobody cares.

685
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:37,710
Stop saying make the world a better place.

686
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:38,350
That's supposed to be.

687
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,030
You don't go to a fun house.

688
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:41,790
You don't go to a carnival and say

689
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,390
the house of horrors, let's paint it and

690
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:43,910
clean it up.

691
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:45,330
No, it's supposed to be a house of

692
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:45,650
horrors.

693
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,270
This place is supposed to be this way.

694
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:48,410
So anyway.

695
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,330
That's why the second that you actually have

696
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,450
a true solution to a problem, you're done.

697
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,090
You're over.

698
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,530
Because if you try to share it with

699
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:55,350
anybody, you're gone.

700
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,350
Anyways, last question here, and it's a weird

701
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,410
one because this person knows you well enough

702
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:01,830
to know that they really shouldn't ask you

703
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:02,630
about politics.

704
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:04,950
So I'm going to condense this, but they're

705
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,610
telling me, make sure he understands.

706
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,650
I'm not asking about the politics or the

707
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:08,970
news.

708
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:12,390
And the question is the core question.

709
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,670
What is Donald Trump?

710
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:15,630
Not who?

711
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:16,790
What?

712
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,710
Yeah, I would look into Donald Marshall cloning.

713
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:25,950
I think what's been going on is because

714
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,530
the reason why he brings this up.

715
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:28,550
Now, I want to tell you the reason

716
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:29,850
why he brings this up, because you might

717
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,510
have not caught this, but he started to

718
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,570
tell a weird story at an energy conference,

719
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:33,870
right?

720
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,890
And he started saying that his uncle, you

721
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,950
know about his uncle, he had some degrees.

722
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,910
Yeah, yeah, who emulated Tesla.

723
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,770
Well, okay, but he didn't bring up that

724
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:43,970
part at the Energy Summit.

725
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:45,950
What he brought up is that he said

726
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,170
my uncle taught Ted Kaczynski, you know, the

727
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:48,910
Unabomber guy?

728
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:49,770
Yeah, yeah.

729
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:52,310
And my uncle was the longest standing professor

730
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:54,490
at MIT, which, first of all, is incorrect.

731
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:57,510
Secondly, his uncle was a professor at MIT.

732
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,930
He said he had three degrees and Trump

733
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,250
didn't hit any of them correctly.

734
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:05,910
Dr. Trump's degrees, okay, on the record, were

735
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:09,770
in electrical engineering and in two other places.

736
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,530
And he had three degrees, but none of

737
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:12,390
the ones Trump mentioned.

738
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,810
Then he said that Kaczynski was one of

739
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:15,290
his students.

740
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:18,210
Now, problem is nobody knew who Kaczynski was

741
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:21,310
until 96, and John Trump died in 95.

742
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:24,350
So, you know, he told a weird story

743
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,510
that was totally screwed up.

744
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,350
And this is what inspired the question.

745
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,390
Again, very carefully I'm saying this for the

746
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,010
listeners more.

747
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,050
The Greeks got it already.

748
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,210
What is Donald Trump?

749
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:36,190
I don't know.

750
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,350
The only way I don't think Donald Trump

751
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,330
knows what he is.

752
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:39,870
Okay.

753
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,970
I've heard that he died already.

754
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:45,750
I've heard that, you know, here's the thing.

755
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,290
They're very bold.

756
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,530
They're putting out their, I think they're putting

757
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,330
out what I would call their best technology

758
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:54,370
for cloning and other things, facsimiles of humans.

759
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:57,170
They're doing a lot better with that than

760
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:58,890
they are with the AI, because there's something

761
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:00,310
I call AI aftertaste.

762
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:02,930
You know, when you see an AI thing,

763
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,190
you're like, it leaves an aftertaste.

764
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,310
Well, there's that, plus there's what they're calling

765
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:09,830
delusions now, or what's the other term they're

766
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,630
using for it?

767
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,010
Where you're imagining stuff.

768
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:15,170
What do you call that?

769
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:18,150
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

770
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:19,870
Hallucination.

771
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:20,590
That's what it is.

772
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:24,950
The AI is having a hallucination, according to

773
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,490
their terminology, and I'm cracking up.

774
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,570
It's like, no, it's not working right.

775
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,350
It's having a hallucination.

776
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:31,830
Yeah, but the thing is, it's all based

777
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:32,470
on their creator.

778
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:33,570
You know, when you go to a different

779
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:37,290
culture, like China or India, something is radically

780
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:39,250
different, or even Mexico or whatever.

781
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:42,430
Everything they have there has a certain version,

782
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:43,430
like a pot.

783
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:45,210
If you get a pot from China, you

784
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:47,450
can tell it's made in, not just American,

785
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:50,710
but it's a Chinese pot, or something from

786
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:51,150
India.

787
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:53,770
So the AI, it's because of that culture.

788
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:56,930
Okay, so the people, the culture that makes

789
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,470
the AI is a certain culture.

790
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:01,670
It's not just people taken from whatever willy

791
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,850
-nilly, and they do, initially, but they breed

792
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:06,010
them or groom them into this culture.

793
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:09,010
So if you understand that culture, of course

794
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:09,890
it puts that way.

795
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,370
It's the geekdom.

796
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:14,650
They're geeks, but not in a good way.

797
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:19,030
Their geekdom is put into their product, and

798
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:19,630
I see it.

799
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:20,770
I see right through it.

800
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,590
Well, that's the crap they do, even with

801
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:25,010
stuff that I try to access to accomplish

802
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:26,690
things like broadcasting or whatever.

803
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,790
Their geekdom is always built into the background

804
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,210
of it, and I have to sort of

805
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:33,190
learn the new language and logic of it

806
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:36,450
in order to operate their crap properly, to

807
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:38,470
do more than just the surface-level things

808
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,850
that simple people want to do.

809
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,850
You've got to know the geekdom.

810
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:43,750
Otherwise, you can't do it.

811
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,450
You can't touch it.

812
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:45,130
What does that mean?

813
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:46,650
That's right, and I don't like that.

814
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,210
That's why I said, what was it, the

815
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:52,710
phones, the phones, the stupid rectangles, the smartphones.

816
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:57,390
They're designed around what was hammered into the

817
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,570
geeks to make these a 9-year-old

818
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:01,470
girl or a 12-year-old girl or

819
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:03,610
a 14-year-old girl where the credit

820
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:06,270
card is the entire premise behind these things.

821
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:09,370
Now I hear from other people I've discussed

822
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:11,590
things with, people that worked in tech firms.

823
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,830
There's a whole other level to these things

824
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,470
where you have to completely scrap it.

825
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,270
It takes four hours to redo the phone,

826
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:18,790
so it acts more like a PC.

827
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:19,690
Yes.

828
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:20,050
Right?

829
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:20,670
Yes, yes.

830
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,410
Yeah, yeah, all that stuff.

831
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:24,490
So I'm not going that far because, you

832
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:25,710
know, like today there was a call that

833
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,290
I missed because when I was out, the

834
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:29,570
phone, like I said, like in the 1960s

835
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:31,150
and 70s, was hanging on the wall with

836
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,210
a long wire attached to it, in this

837
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:35,870
case the long wire being the charger.

838
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,550
Yeah, you just leave it on the charger

839
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,550
all day, and therefore it is now wired

840
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:40,990
to the wall because you've chosen it.

841
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,610
Yeah, that's how I roll.

842
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:44,210
When I go out, I know people, if

843
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,390
I have to make a phone call and

844
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,890
I'm out, I just ask someone, can I

845
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:47,450
use your phone?

846
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:48,610
I'm just making a local call.

847
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:48,890
Fine.

848
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,270
You know, sometimes they'll dial it or whatever,

849
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,150
and it works.

850
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:55,530
I mean, people are still, they're not bitching

851
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,870
about it, and, you know, you're not going

852
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:58,250
to find a pay phone.

853
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,550
And it doesn't cost, you know, in the

854
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,950
days when it used to cost, you know,

855
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,970
$50 to make a call, I understood, hey,

856
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,170
look, I ain't lending you my phone.

857
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,190
But now everybody's got, you know, it doesn't

858
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:07,770
cost me anything.

859
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:08,410
Yeah, sure.

860
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:09,850
Well, it does, actually.

861
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:12,310
If you call Canada, you get a long

862
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:12,990
-distance charge.

863
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:13,910
It was real funny.

864
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:16,250
Oh, you got an even dumber plan than

865
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,530
most people then because, to be honest with

866
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:21,170
you, most people in America, they got a

867
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:22,910
North American calling plan.

868
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:23,870
Oh, okay.

869
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,630
It must be the plan that's very old.

870
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:26,750
But I was told, you got a long

871
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,350
-distance call.

872
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,870
I was like, really?

873
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,970
You know, and they gave me the number.

874
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:32,210
I was like, who did I call in

875
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:32,650
Canada?

876
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,370
I don't have a girlfriend in Canada.

877
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,310
What are you talking about?

878
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:38,590
That's the thing, though, is, you know, and

879
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,190
there's the other funny part is if you

880
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:42,490
take a phone, right, you buy it in

881
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:42,770
Canada.

882
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,830
Now, that phone is based in Canada, allegedly,

883
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:45,550
the number is.

884
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:49,110
Now, you move to here, Georgia, you're making

885
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:51,090
your calls, your phone is still from Canada.

886
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:51,990
I mean, you know.

887
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,150
It's roaming and all that stuff they have.

888
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:57,770
Yeah, but they've, there's, yeah, it's just a

889
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:58,110
business.

890
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,870
Those bills, by the way, are checks written

891
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:00,910
out to you anyway.

892
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:03,790
One of these days I'm going to shorten.

893
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:07,110
Well, we'll do a talk about the financials.

894
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:09,470
And I've really been simplifying it in my

895
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:12,890
mind and how easy or much easier it

896
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:15,150
is and what's being put out online about

897
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:18,510
it and how to get moving on that

898
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:18,790
again.

899
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:21,770
But I won't do a, what do they

900
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:24,370
call it, a seminar or a private group,

901
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,250
but we'll just talk about it here because

902
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,290
the private groups don't really go anywhere.

903
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:31,190
I think just doing it on here is

904
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:32,630
better, if that makes any sense.

905
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:34,190
Well, you know what?

906
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:35,550
I know that we'll get a result.

907
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:37,790
If you give a very simplified version of

908
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:38,090
something.

909
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:38,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

910
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:41,350
Get more people onto what's going on and

911
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,170
stuff they could use.

912
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,890
Someone sent me an email recently.

913
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:46,610
It's akin to, you know, anything that could,

914
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:49,250
like, go against the fuckers that put together

915
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,630
this control system, you know.

916
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:51,790
And I'm like, great, you know.

917
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:53,470
I'm all for that.

918
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:56,470
It's not because I'm anti-control systems.

919
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,870
You have to have control systems.

920
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:03,070
But when they're malevolent and you know it,

921
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:06,830
going along with it makes you one of

922
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:07,070
them.

923
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:07,870
So, anyway.

924
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,130
And the other thing is that in any

925
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:12,030
system, look, no matter how big the beast

926
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,350
is, you always got to give it a

927
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,190
black eye once in a while anyway, even

928
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:15,710
if they call it.

929
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:16,250
They kick in the shins.

930
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:17,770
They kick in the shins?

931
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:18,230
Same thing.

932
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,370
Bush Jr., you're either with the terrorists or

933
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:22,350
you're with us, you know.

934
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,430
So with us or with the terrorists, right?

935
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:28,590
I'd rather be on the side that is

936
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,270
not malevolent.

937
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,250
How about I don't want to be with

938
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:31,610
either one of you, you bastard.

939
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:32,950
Anyway.

940
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:35,890
Any other final thoughts on this today or

941
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:36,730
what do you say?

942
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:38,610
Because I think Tuesday is going to be

943
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,190
different, interesting, et cetera.

944
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:42,750
There was a personal question for me.

945
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:45,370
I'll answer that on my show because nobody

946
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:46,210
cares about that here.

947
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,110
I know my lane.

948
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:48,490
All right.

949
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:48,970
Anyway.

950
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,690
I don't know about that, but that's fine.

951
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:53,010
Let's make it a short one then.

952
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:54,070
Yeah, let's do that.
