1
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:11,920
A Rated-Y Sonic Event 220, 220 this

2
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,240
time.

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,800
Anyways, kind of, you know, Greek, I'm going

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,240
to break with a little bit of news.

5
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:18,440
I don't know if you want to comment

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,940
on it, but people did ask us about

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,300
music recently and one of my childhood idols,

8
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,840
because I was a musician, Ozzy Osbourne, died

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,200
today.

10
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,400
I saw that.

11
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:29,160
I saw that.

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,060
And I rebooted the computer here.

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,780
I downloaded IObit and all that, and it

14
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,280
took me to some browser I don't use,

15
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,180
and that was on there.

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,840
Yeah, we brought, you brought up Ozzy Osbourne

17
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,760
when we were talking about them sacrificing their

18
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,120
children.

19
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,420
So how old is he?

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:44,720
80?

21
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:45,380
75?

22
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,060
Something like that?

23
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:47,260
76.

24
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,000
Yeah.

25
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,360
Yeah, they're all, they're all around 70-something.

26
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:50,720
Yeah.

27
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,420
Yeah, but it was kind of weird because

28
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,100
we had talked about him recently and he

29
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,240
did his farewell concert.

30
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,160
It really was a farewell concert this time,

31
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,540
and that was that, but man, oh man,

32
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,900
it's weird to watch the mainstream media behave

33
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,880
around this guy now, you know, as opposed

34
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,940
to the way they used to.

35
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,520
I mean, he was, you know, the Prince

36
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,800
of Darkness and all that.

37
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,520
Anyway, I just bring it up as a

38
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,020
light subject.

39
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,340
Yeah, the media, it's all controlled, you know,

40
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,840
the public perception, but you know, a good

41
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,700
wake-up call for what the media and

42
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,800
the politicians are doing, it's the same thing,

43
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,040
is study, it's very hard to find it.

44
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,900
If I find a YouTube, someone who covered

45
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,580
it, I'll put it in the Ocellian, the

46
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,020
Greek chatango, but look up what happened post

47
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,780
-war, between World War I and World War

48
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,820
II, Berlin, Germany.

49
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,720
What they did there for 15 years was

50
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,400
what they did here with the woke and

51
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,780
the Biden stuff and the this, that, and

52
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,140
the other, right, including, you know, characters that

53
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,640
were infamous now are okay and vice versa,

54
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:51,960
right?

55
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,580
So if you want to see an extreme

56
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:58,780
sort of what, it's more extreme when you

57
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,200
see it, exactly what you're living being done

58
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,880
in another era.

59
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,020
So yeah.

60
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,780
I think the study of Mussolini, to be

61
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,639
honest with you, is actually more interesting for

62
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:12,080
the media perspective, because remember, that was actually

63
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,200
his business to begin with, everybody forgets that.

64
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,640
He was in the newspaper business, and so

65
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,380
were the people behind him when they swept

66
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,800
him in and did all that, right?

67
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,360
And it was this whole media, it was

68
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,820
a complete media concoction.

69
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,500
I mean, maybe it's more akin to the

70
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,840
Obama thing, but then again, it's a similar

71
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,280
program to what's happening now.

72
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,020
It's all media.

73
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,360
The media is more important than people imagine.

74
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,820
You know, the laws, okay, laws have been

75
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,720
completely disregarded because this country, meaning the U

76
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,200
.S., U.S.A., U.S. of A,

77
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:50,420
was set up to be unencumbered the way

78
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,040
other monarchies and parliamentary or whatever democracies were,

79
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,720
you know, and because it was unencumbered, the

80
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,020
scumbags came over here and they took over

81
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,400
very craftily using the media again.

82
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,220
And what they did was they got people

83
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,080
out of their venue, which is a lawful

84
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,960
venue, and put them in these other political

85
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,880
venues of the political parties and, you know,

86
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,280
how great their life is as long as

87
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,240
they can afford to buy what's being offered

88
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,120
and, right, all this other stuff, always demonizing

89
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,600
those that don't want to get into, you

90
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,540
know, the mainstream.

91
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,160
You know, this has been going on for

92
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,700
a long time.

93
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,620
But one thing that people don't realize, and

94
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,560
you always have, by the way, I was

95
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,020
told this, I was sat down in the

96
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:35,900
80s, bunch of sort of ex-hippies, not

97
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,940
really full-on hippies more like the new

98
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,700
age type from the 60s, and it says,

99
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,920
listen, you're at war here, meaning not you,

100
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,920
everything is at war with you, the medical,

101
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,260
the banking, the religion, everything is at war

102
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,200
and the people don't see it, right?

103
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,860
So the war is over, you know, in

104
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,960
other words, people lost.

105
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:59,780
And give me examples, I heard a medical

106
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,540
person recently say, we were talking about medical

107
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,800
stuff and what's going on, and he's like,

108
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,120
oh, yeah, we're legally trying to get as

109
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,060
much money out of it as we can,

110
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,480
you know, basically while they're working.

111
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,500
So it tells you that the medical wants

112
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,579
to get as much money out of it,

113
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,279
but legally, so the medical, the legal, and

114
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,820
the financial are one thing, it's one institution,

115
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,300
really.

116
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,180
Don't look at, you could look at it

117
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,900
at separate branches, just like you look at

118
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,080
Kentucky Fried Chicken and Taco Bell, they're all

119
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,240
part of PepsiCo, right?

120
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,220
So it's all financial, and it's a financial

121
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,460
war, and you've lost, the population has lost,

122
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,340
you're done now, so in other words, typically

123
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,500
what happens, the losing side, what happens to

124
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,820
the population, they usually become enslaved, and they

125
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:54,800
get dumped, first of all, they lose their

126
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,400
money, right, the value of any currency, they

127
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,880
lose their education, and the thing is to

128
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,960
keep dumbing them down, a perfect example is

129
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,100
what the Ottomans did to, let's say, Albania

130
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,820
and Greece and all that, you know, that's

131
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,480
what's happened here, it's an old formula that's

132
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,360
been used, but the people have lost, they

133
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,960
will never recover, that's why it's good that

134
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,040
the whole thing will be destroyed apocalyptically, because

135
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,840
there's nothing, you can't, there's nothing to work

136
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,680
with, the substance that is here now is

137
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,220
unworkable.

138
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,120
There's a lot of people out there trying

139
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,600
to make headway, but they fall into guru

140
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,000
status, not enough common sense, right, they all

141
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,140
have a process, you know, whether it's medical,

142
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,720
financial, legal, they all raise, oh, you're gonna

143
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,400
study this guy's process, oh, this guy, it's

144
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,520
not about that at all, that's another failure,

145
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,600
right, it needs to be very simple, very

146
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,520
simply put, and it has to be a

147
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,900
very, very quote-unquote common sense attitude, you

148
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,540
know, you don't need to really learn too

149
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,960
much, other than the outline that I just

150
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,920
gave, you're at war and you've lost the

151
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,140
war, right, so what do you do then?

152
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,560
There's not a lot of talk about that,

153
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,860
there's a lot of talk in history and

154
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,040
whatever about how to fight a war, how

155
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,440
to be part of, what did they call

156
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,320
the French during the German occupation, National Socialist

157
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:18,880
Party, oh, the resistance, yeah, that's, yeah, would

158
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,840
you see, the French, I would say the

159
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,780
French lost, you know, to the National Socialist

160
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,240
Party, to Germany at the time, yeah, they

161
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,380
were losers, yeah, but the thing is, they

162
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,620
were sort of, would you say liberated, yeah,

163
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,040
you can call, because they couldn't do it

164
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,080
themselves, let's say, by the way, most people

165
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,900
think, the Americans did not go into Berlin,

166
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,280
they bombed the shit out of it, it

167
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,440
was taken over by the Russians, but anyway.

168
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,340
Yeah, of course, and the other thing to

169
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,120
remember is, look, just because the plantation owner

170
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,000
changes doesn't mean that the status of the

171
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,580
slave does.

172
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,360
That's very interesting, Mansa brings up, Mansa Mahata,

173
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,460
you know, you work at the, you left

174
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,080
the fields in the farm and now you

175
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,200
work at the plant, right?

176
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:00,740
Right.

177
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,100
Plant is short for plantation.

178
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:02,860
Yeah, of course.

179
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,260
Yeah, I didn't really have that in my

180
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,040
forward consciousness, of course it is, right?

181
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:07,340
Yeah.

182
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,520
But most people don't think, you know, he

183
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,120
works at the plant, you know, it's like,

184
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,440
wow, so you lost a lot, and when

185
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,080
did you lose?

186
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,600
You lost just before the Civil War, is

187
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,400
when you lost as a population.

188
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,420
So, but here, you still have unencumbered freedoms.

189
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,880
If you know your rights, if you know

190
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,540
what you can do in law, and legally,

191
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,200
and financially, you're not, you know, you're free

192
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,000
to move, I'm not saying that then they,

193
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,600
you can't do what you have to do,

194
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,080
you're free to move, but you're going to

195
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,880
be met with resistance from them, right?

196
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,400
So years ago, when he came up with

197
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,640
the stuff that cars run on water, or

198
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,140
financial stuff, you know, the, what was it,

199
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,220
the something river case, where he proved that

200
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,140
the banks don't lend anything, and the milkman

201
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,220
died, the judge died in that case, the

202
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,940
attorney died, you know, Credit River case.

203
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,060
That was back 40, 50 years ago, where

204
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,640
the courts ruled against the banks, because the

205
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,660
banks don't lend money, right?

206
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,900
Oh, is that the one where they gave

207
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,200
him the house and said, look, just take

208
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,160
the house and go away, and you don't

209
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,100
owe nothing, that one?

210
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,500
No, no, I think it was before that,

211
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,320
it was a pretty big ruling, and they

212
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,680
killed everyone in the case.

213
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,740
Yeah, well, here's the thing, you always own

214
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,400
the house, you give them security interest.

215
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,120
That's the thing, one of these days, we're

216
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,600
going to start talking about financial, I'll show

217
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,580
you how easy it is.

218
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,640
And just to interject, since we're on the

219
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,240
financial stuff, kind of like all over the

220
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,840
place here, like in a banana grove, but

221
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,220
everything financial has to do with the application,

222
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:39,539
about 99% dealings with financial institutions, which

223
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:43,520
means government agencies and utility companies are financial

224
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,920
institutions also, has to do with applications, everything

225
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,340
is around the application.

226
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,220
So let's say you're doing business with a

227
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:56,820
government agency, utility company, a credit card company

228
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,800
or bank, and you want to turn it

229
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,540
around, you can't start talking about, you can,

230
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,640
but you're not going to get very far,

231
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,660
just go right back to the application, go

232
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,480
right, and you deal with it at the

233
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,920
application, because everything comes off of the application,

234
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,780
just to give people an idea.

235
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,280
In the USA, when you, let's say you

236
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,740
move into an apartment or a house, and

237
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,220
you need to cut the lights on, right,

238
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,220
you need to put the, they say, put

239
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,840
the lights in your name, the electric in

240
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,040
your name is what they say, right?

241
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:22,360
Right.

242
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,540
So you call up, they ask for a

243
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,220
bunch of information, and they ask for the

244
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,640
last four digits of your social, because they

245
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,320
already have access to that terminal.

246
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,460
And once you give them that, they go,

247
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,620
on average, utility company, New York, it's more

248
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,280
than, let's say, where you are, or I

249
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:43,100
am, they pull at least 150 to 450

250
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,820
,000 from the treasury out under your name

251
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,180
right away, each house, right, each house, you

252
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:49,860
just count that.

253
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,060
That's why when you look at their open

254
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,960
spreadsheets, a little utility company in Tucson's got

255
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,060
like 70 billion pulled out of the account

256
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,120
and say, how do you do that?

257
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,080
You know, so, okay, so that monthly bill

258
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,440
that you get every month is an interest

259
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,860
payment on that original amount that they pulled

260
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,400
when you did the application.

261
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,340
And that original application and the terms of

262
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,700
service, you gave them full security interest.

263
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,460
In other words, anything that they have to

264
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,340
pay, what does that mean?

265
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,980
You gave the company full security interest.

266
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:26,980
That means like, for example, Chuck, if I

267
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:31,660
gave you full security interest, okay, of my

268
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,140
business, all of my business dealings, personal and

269
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:40,520
otherwise, that means that every bill you get,

270
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,740
I have to pay.

271
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,300
So you order pizza, I have to pay

272
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:44,480
it.

273
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,200
You go buy a new car, I have

274
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,700
to pay it.

275
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,500
You got to go to the doctor, right?

276
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,460
I got to pay it.

277
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,980
You got rent, I got to pay it.

278
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,580
All your bills get paid by me because

279
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,560
I gave you all my full security interest.

280
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,900
So when you take that back, what am

281
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,700
I getting for it?

282
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,320
Nothing.

283
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,380
It's just a bunch of words, right?

284
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,020
It sounds similar to when you put a

285
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,840
lawyer on retainer, you know, where it's like

286
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,960
you give them a certain amount.

287
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,480
Yeah, sort of.

288
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,580
Well, the retainer is for him to get

289
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:14,140
paid on a time schedule.

290
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:14,580
Yeah.

291
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,420
And then he's supposed to account for, look,

292
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,840
I spent it doing this.

293
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,400
It costs this much to write a letter.

294
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,920
It costs this much for me to go

295
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,140
and drive from here to court.

296
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,620
It costs this much for me to buy

297
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,260
you a new suit.

298
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,140
Yeah, but retainer, like I've done retainers before

299
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,920
with wealthy people and they just sent me

300
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,740
money every month.

301
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,740
And they were, you know, why am I

302
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,200
sending you money?

303
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,640
I'm in your phone contacts.

304
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,120
That's why.

305
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,340
But anyway, it just does it just as

306
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,960
a backup because I did help them out

307
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,580
quite a bit.

308
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,060
And they got a thousand times more than

309
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:43,840
what they ever gave me.

310
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,580
But here's the thing.

311
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,160
This sounds bizarre and it's so bizarre that

312
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,080
it's hard to rationalize.

313
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:49,940
That's what's going on.

314
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,820
All the credit card companies work that way.

315
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,460
That's why when you get an application from

316
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,160
a financial institution, it says that we have

317
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,040
the right to sell your information to the

318
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,800
Federal Reserve.

319
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,780
They're trading, buying and selling.

320
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,020
So anyway, there's a real easy.

321
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,740
Now, here's the other thing, you know, with

322
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,200
the bills.

323
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,820
A lot of a lot of people are

324
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,660
having success.

325
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,140
You know, you sign the bill, send it

326
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,060
in, you know, the Bill of Exchange Act.

327
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,740
But a lot of them are so or

328
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,040
not.

329
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,160
So so here's one way to look at

330
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,340
it.

331
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,620
Take control of the application.

332
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,040
Ask them all the information.

333
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,060
They have to give it to you because

334
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,280
they're a public company under under GATT, which

335
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:32,740
is GAP, sorry, G A A P, General

336
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,120
Accepted Accounting Principles.

337
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,340
But what you're really interested in more than

338
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,920
that is, um, you know what?

339
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,280
Let's just let's just save it.

340
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,620
But let's just save it for another talk,

341
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,860
because this is going to I said, well,

342
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,720
you really said that it's not one thing.

343
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,520
It's a whole bunch of stuff you got

344
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,200
to roll together.

345
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,740
But you taking control of.

346
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,140
OK, let me just make it simple so

347
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,400
I don't have to get into a process

348
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:57,700
here.

349
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,160
OK, find out all the details that they

350
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,280
have on the application and then look around

351
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:03,700
online.

352
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,600
Let's make it simple.

353
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,080
Claim forms.

354
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,760
Just look up claim forms for whatever, you

355
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,860
know, they got claim forms.

356
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,400
Greyhound Bus has claim forms, you know, if

357
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,880
you for the lost and found.

358
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,160
Right.

359
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,200
Just look up claim standard claim forms, how

360
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,100
they're laid out.

361
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,660
What what is a form or a claim

362
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,960
form and how many types of claim forms

363
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,920
are there?

364
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,580
Look that up, especially if you got the

365
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,680
the better AI, not the free one.

366
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,860
How many types of claim forms are there

367
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,380
and start seeing some of that?

368
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,800
They vary quite a bit, but see what

369
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,540
they all have in common.

370
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,420
And that's how you claim the account.

371
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,940
Once you have the account, then they're like,

372
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,680
well, what do you want me to do?

373
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,680
What do you want us to do?

374
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,560
Right.

375
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,980
Because it's your accounts.

376
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,360
It's there's what I'm trying to say is

377
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,700
like the average American has credit cards, loans

378
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,220
or whatever.

379
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,160
You know, those things are being traded in

380
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:55,800
accounts.

381
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,800
And when you look at those things for

382
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,880
each specific person, their name is on it.

383
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,740
Only their name.

384
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,300
So so what I mean by that, let's

385
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,780
say, Chuck, you're walking down the street, you

386
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,900
lost your wallet and you see someone over,

387
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,360
says, hey, you know, I just found a

388
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:09,620
wallet.

389
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,780
Hey, that's my that's my wallet.

390
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,980
Well, how do you know what's your name?

391
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,020
And you give your name.

392
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,880
Almost anybody's your wallet turns around, looks in

393
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,460
there, says, OK, does the name this guy

394
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,660
just gave me match the ID?

395
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,140
This I used to find them in the

396
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:22,860
store all the time.

397
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,520
I work stores.

398
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,500
Sure, sure.

399
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,680
I was looking at anyway, stuff like that.

400
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,720
So what I'm saying is that when you

401
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,100
start seeing around what financial instruments have been

402
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,660
created, only your name is on it.

403
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,700
They're just out there.

404
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,360
They're called negotiable instruments.

405
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,940
Anyone can pick them up and use them

406
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,080
because you should be doing it.

407
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:47,060
But because you're not, other people are entities.

408
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,280
And this is what's going on.

409
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:51,500
So basically, the three things are get all

410
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,340
the information you can on the application.

411
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,760
You really got to ring that out and

412
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,360
then learn how to do a claim form.

413
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,140
And even the IRS, you know, never use

414
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,140
an IRS form, by the way.

415
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,580
All the IRS form instructions.

416
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,100
There are very few that demand they use

417
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:06,460
their form.

418
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,320
If you read the instructions on how to

419
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,580
fill out the form, it says, blah, blah,

420
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,000
blah, blah, blah.

421
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,900
So you fill out the form or make

422
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,100
your make your own statement means basically you

423
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,280
write a concise letter, a sworn letter, affidavit

424
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,620
form of what you want us to do

425
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,000
that pertains to this subject.

426
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,320
The reason they have forms is so they

427
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,700
could be more efficient.

428
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,440
They get all the information they need where

429
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:26,860
they want.

430
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:27,640
It's easy to see.

431
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:27,960
Right.

432
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,140
And whatever.

433
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,200
And it's they're all sworn affidavits, by the

434
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:31,440
way.

435
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,820
So when you do that.

436
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,620
So anyway.

437
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,280
Yeah, this is this is very interesting.

438
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,500
It's very, very simple because the way they

439
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,160
rip rip off the population is very simple.

440
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,240
People don't know that all debts belong to

441
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:44,780
the United States.

442
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:48,100
The Treasury will will will actually satisfy any

443
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,040
debt that's out there.

444
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,720
It doesn't matter how much it is or

445
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,080
who it's for, but it has to be

446
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,920
an intermediary.

447
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:55,220
Right.

448
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:59,200
So once these things are done, let's say

449
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,940
and whether you're the debtor or not is

450
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:02,360
irrelevant.

451
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,020
There's a package of negotiable instruments, which is

452
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:10,140
as good as cash with your name on

453
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:10,480
it.

454
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,200
So anyone can use it.

455
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,520
But when you show up and say, hey,

456
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,940
this is the name that I you know,

457
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,260
the all caps name that I'm you have

458
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,380
precedent over.

459
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,260
So it's very simple.

460
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,780
So basically, look at what what they've done

461
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,220
when you applied and how to claim the

462
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:26,540
account.

463
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,780
Look up claim forms.

464
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,720
Did I say that?

465
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:28,980
Yes.

466
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,480
Yes, you did.

467
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,240
How many how many types of claim forms

468
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,540
are there and use a chat GPT or

469
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,180
whatever, whatever your favorite is just to organize

470
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,800
and take a couple of days and read

471
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,280
these things and it'll settle in.

472
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,020
It'll hit you in the it'll hit you

473
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,840
in the it requires.

474
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,200
Okay.

475
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,260
You know, people talk about, you know, I'm

476
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,120
a creative, you know, this person's creative.

477
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,020
You don't really there's you know what creativity

478
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,020
really is, you know, really what it really

479
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:53,240
is.

480
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:53,960
It's discovery.

481
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,420
It's just someone who's discovering stuff.

482
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,380
And when you speak to people who are

483
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,600
considered artists or creatives, you know, whatever.

484
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,119
And you get I mean, you know, a

485
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:05,980
bona fide explanation.

486
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,400
So how did you come up with this?

487
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,579
They know they don't know.

488
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,859
They'll say, well, this happened, I saw this,

489
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,480
and then I put this together with that.

490
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:14,140
It's always discovery.

491
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,000
You know, even in your mind, when you

492
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,260
have an idea, it just happened to, you

493
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,480
know, like you're sitting by the river and

494
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,000
something flows by, you reach out and grab

495
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,680
it, right?

496
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,380
It's always discovery.

497
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,099
So I like to replace the word creativity

498
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:25,920
with discovery.

499
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:26,940
Right?

500
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,740
So yeah, this process is financial stuff requires

501
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,320
creativity.

502
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,080
And you're not dealing, you know, a lot

503
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,260
of these gurus online with financial stuff, like

504
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:35,840
be honorable.

505
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

506
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,420
But you're dealing with thieves.

507
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,960
You're dealing with people that are going to

508
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,640
play ignorant, and they want to hurt you

509
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,520
legally.

510
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,520
Right?

511
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,880
But don't be afraid.

512
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,720
That's the whole thing.

513
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,340
So yeah, you're dealing and they're really scumbags,

514
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,960
you know, by the definition, it's a Navy

515
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,100
term, by the way, you know.

516
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,740
So all of them are, there's some exceptions,

517
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,720
there's some exceptions.

518
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,240
And those are the ones that realize that

519
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,580
they had enough, they don't want to do

520
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,140
this anymore.

521
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,200
So yeah, this is interesting.

522
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,540
And we'll, let's say in the near future,

523
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,180
go over the financial stuff, because it's good

524
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,240
to plant some good seeds.

525
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,420
Because it's not like we could do a

526
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,720
financial seminar or talk about what to do

527
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,420
with bills and things like that, and then

528
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,020
go do it.

529
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,820
You really got to settle in and think

530
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,000
about it and do your own thing.

531
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,140
Because when you make a standard template, and

532
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,120
they start seeing those templates, they change up

533
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,360
and they go against it, right?

534
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,340
Yeah, I was just thinking, I wonder if

535
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,620
there's a way to assemble a toolbox, you

536
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,200
know, with a couple of power tools in

537
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,040
it to, you know, like, most people are

538
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,120
too dumb to sit.

539
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,660
They're too dumb to be creative.

540
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,180
In other words, they're not really stupid.

541
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,440
But they're dumb, meaning you can't express yourself,

542
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:46,660
right?

543
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,800
That's what dumb means.

544
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,120
They can't communicate, right?

545
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,360
Remember years ago when someone was dumb.

546
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,160
So you were deaf and dumb, dumb meant

547
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,100
you couldn't speak.

548
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:58,700
That's right.

549
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,620
No communication.

550
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,680
So they feel like they want someone else,

551
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,680
you know, what should I write?

552
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,420
What should I say?

553
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,160
If you plan on what you want the

554
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,140
outcome to be, and you're confident on how

555
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,720
to get there, you'll come up with your

556
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,800
own way of saying it.

557
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,080
And of course, you know, there's standard grammar

558
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,640
that has to be followed, right?

559
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,280
When you're right.

560
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,720
And you know, you have to be, you

561
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,940
know, you have to convey a non emotional

562
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,220
thing, right?

563
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,680
Sometimes you do want to do emotional stuff.

564
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,020
Not often, you know, and you got to

565
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,860
figure you got to develop your own style.

566
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,140
Sorry, you know, and if you are type

567
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,240
of person that cannot develop it, this is

568
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,080
not for everyone, by the way, this is

569
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,500
not for everyone's very, very few.

570
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,680
But I'm just saying I bring up the

571
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,200
financial stuff often, because this society is based

572
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:41,740
on that.

573
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,360
You know, everything requires some kind of financial

574
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:45,580
stuff.

575
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,580
So anyway, I'm going to stop, I'm going

576
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,860
to just put the brakes on that right

577
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,800
now and stop.

578
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,060
Wait, what do you got, Chuck?

579
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,500
Okay, I got one here.

580
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,140
Let's see.

581
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,220
On one particular sonic, you explained how sometimes

582
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,300
you send messages to yourself in the past,

583
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,520
when you receive a message in a way

584
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,860
saying this will be okay.

585
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,500
As in just a signal that you survive

586
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,080
the event you think about in the present

587
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,500
and message yourself in the past question mark.

588
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,200
One, could you explain this again?

589
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:17,700
And wouldn't the entity that screws with your

590
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,380
sleep or gives you false inner voice also

591
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,320
play this game?

592
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,760
Well, no, this let me just reiterate, the

593
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,780
person didn't hear it.

594
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,100
Maybe I'll reconvey it.

595
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,040
Okay, let's just do it like we just

596
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,100
opened this subject.

597
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,100
And no, we're not malicious.

598
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,100
Hey, just clear the table.

599
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,780
We're not talking about anything right now.

600
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,840
But I'll bring this up.

601
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,280
Okay, you ever been in a you ever

602
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,640
been in a tight spot?

603
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,500
You know, tight spot, meaning like, you know,

604
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:48,760
potential physical harm, whatever, whatever, whatever, something bad

605
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,580
might happen to you or is happening to

606
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:51,800
you.

607
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,860
So whatever it is, yeah, so something's going

608
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,180
wrong.

609
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,780
And what I'm doing is I'm having anxiety

610
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,220
about it.

611
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:56,840
I'm getting worried.

612
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,820
Oh, man, this is gonna get.

613
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:58,400
Yeah.

614
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,020
While it's while you're perceiving and you're in

615
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,080
it, there's a little voice inside you that

616
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,820
says, Don't worry, everything's going to be all

617
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,140
right.

618
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,400
And you're like, Whoa, you may not give

619
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,780
it a lot of credence, you may not

620
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,260
pay a lot of attention to it.

621
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,560
But after you get out of that tight

622
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,000
spot, or bad situation, you're like, you know,

623
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,080
I knew I was going to be all

624
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:18,360
right.

625
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,900
And you may not even say because I

626
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,040
heard a little voice blah, blah, blah.

627
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,880
Okay, what that little voice is, while you're

628
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,000
in a tight spot is you remembering that

629
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,820
in the future.

630
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,260
You're not sending anything back with with that.

631
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,600
You can, right, you can modify that's another

632
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,580
going back in time is modifying Yeah, you

633
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,040
can modify but you can't change it.

634
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,020
So that's you remembering.

635
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,060
So here's, here's another, here's another way to

636
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,920
look at the structure.

637
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,640
If you're in a tight spot, that thing,

638
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,020
you're in the middle of a bad situation,

639
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,400
and you don't hear that little voice.

640
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,820
There's probably one or two things or both

641
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,120
that are going on one, you don't hear

642
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,620
that little voice, because you probably will forget

643
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,080
this.

644
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,160
Right?

645
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,620
So you never bring it up again in

646
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,720
the future, even in memory, so that, you

647
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,100
know, you don't connect back, or you really

648
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,320
are, this is your end.

649
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,160
It's one of those two.

650
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,840
So it doesn't mean panic, because, you know,

651
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,880
remember, Douglas Adams, don't panic, right?

652
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,900
So that's interesting.

653
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,760
Also, yes, you know, I've had a couple

654
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,880
of like, really, what other people would say

655
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,680
are near death, you know, situations.

656
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,240
And the fact is that some of the

657
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,880
best ones, and I say the best were

658
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,820
because I just simply relaxed.

659
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,100
Because something told me just don't worry about

660
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:41,260
it.

661
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,340
It's gonna be remembering it, it could be

662
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,540
any time in the future, which shows that

663
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,660
it's this loop.

664
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,340
It's kind of like, you know, how many

665
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:48,780
people?

666
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,900
Well, how many writers philosophers through the ages

667
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,720
have written that everything is scripted?

668
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:53,980
Yeah.

669
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,600
But when you have a script, you could

670
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,340
go to the back, you know, read, right,

671
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,500
go to the back of the book and

672
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,140
read the last page first, right?

673
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,160
I mean, that's the other thing.

674
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:01,340
Yeah.

675
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,420
Have you ever done any acting?

676
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,280
Like, you know, just creatively, like on a

677
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:04,860
stage somewhere?

678
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,480
You ever done that?

679
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,520
Yeah, I have actually Julius Caesar to Shakespeare.

680
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,840
I was Casca.

681
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,400
Speak hands for me.

682
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:13,660
Yeah.

683
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,360
I believe it or not, I did Hamlet.

684
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:15,840
Anyway.

685
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,340
It's it's very interesting.

686
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,360
Because during that, right, you go, Okay, I'm

687
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:21,900
in the middle of this.

688
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,580
And then you just stop and you go,

689
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,320
Alright, let me see.

690
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,920
Which way does this go next?

691
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:26,600
You know what I'm saying?

692
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,240
You go back over it, you prepare for

693
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,020
the next part of it.

694
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,160
It's not a big deal.

695
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:33,140
Because But here, we're talking a temporal, a

696
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,940
very large gap.

697
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,060
And you can be in a tight space,

698
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,700
like you're catching a weapon when you're eight

699
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,300
years old.

700
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,960
And a voice says you're going to be

701
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,320
fine.

702
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,700
And you don't recall that until you're 50.

703
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,860
Yeah, that's the thing is that I don't

704
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,480
might not even think about it, you know,

705
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,320
until I'm 50.

706
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,700
But it happened to me when I'm, you

707
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,160
know, like you said, eight, 10 years old.

708
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:51,560
Yeah.

709
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,100
But then you reach the point to remember,

710
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,960
this is how the structure works.

711
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,220
If you're in a tight spot, or some

712
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,320
bad shit's happening to you, and you don't

713
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,780
hear that voice, right?

714
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,620
That means that you probably will forget this,

715
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,960
and it will never come up again in

716
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,260
memory.

717
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,740
So there's no void, you know, there's no

718
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:09,580
connection to the future, or it's your end.

719
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,700
This is your end, right?

720
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,160
Right.

721
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,120
Because there's no future to feedback.

722
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,280
So, you know, that works.

723
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,820
And that works on instinct, by the way,

724
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,520
because a lot of people that don't hear

725
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,740
that little voice, very much know they're going

726
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,120
to die.

727
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,840
All right, but I think the second part

728
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,080
of the question still stands.

729
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,240
Okay, and here's why.

730
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,240
You know, what about the voice that does

731
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,120
screw with you, right?

732
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,320
You said a little voice, okay, I'm telling

733
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,780
you that I just get this feeling, just

734
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,600
let it go relax.

735
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,240
And a lot of times that makes things

736
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,400
just move away smoother, easier, things hurt less,

737
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:41,900
everything.

738
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:42,560
Cool.

739
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,440
But anyhow, the thing is, what about that,

740
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:45,660
though?

741
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,480
Because you know, that voice does screw with

742
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:47,660
you.

743
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:51,020
Let's let's Yeah, that's a broad topic.

744
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,180
Well, let's say this.

745
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,780
Oh, this is I'm not copying out.

746
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,700
But let's just say, okay, not with not

747
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,240
withdrawing.

748
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,900
But look out for Charlie, look out FA

749
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,180
Charlie channel.

750
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:04,580
And he's actually been recording and showing that

751
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,720
these little voices are not really in our

752
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,060
head.

753
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,220
They're actually real sonic events.

754
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,940
And one thing that he hasn't covered, which

755
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,760
he kind of did, back in 2002, or

756
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,060
so, between 2003, actually, in 2005, I was

757
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:23,140
interning and working at a TV station, right?

758
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,460
Okay, so to the point where I was

759
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,720
trained by people, they said, you know, we're

760
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,600
done training you, you can go into any

761
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,280
TV studio in the world and pretty much

762
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:31,900
run everything.

763
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,040
cameras, lights, production up, you know, broadcast, all

764
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:36,700
that stuff, right?

765
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,420
At that time, you were totally up to

766
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,360
speed for like, say, 80s technology.

767
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:40,780
Yeah.

768
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,500
Early 2000s.

769
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:42,940
Oh, okay.

770
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,240
Sorry.

771
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,660
It was early digital.

772
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,000
Yeah.

773
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:45,340
Okay.

774
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,860
It was no, it was already digital.

775
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:52,880
So anyway, they have a very high speed,

776
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:55,040
Bay, there's a lot of beta, whatever.

777
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,440
We're moving a real really, really fast.

778
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,240
And the voice, it was so fast, you

779
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,800
couldn't even see what was going on.

780
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,720
You shouldn't do that, because it could damage

781
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,620
the head and all that.

782
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,980
But all I heard was like digital, beep,

783
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,960
beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep,

784
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,260
right?

785
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:09,800
Right.

786
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,440
And that's the so entire sentences were just

787
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,340
became a little beat sound buzz sound, right?

788
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,840
So very often, or in the early days

789
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,320
here, I had cable TV, like everybody else,

790
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,020
you know, before the internet was for streaming

791
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,140
and other things like that.

792
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,400
And you'll be watching something or there'd be

793
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,620
these pulses and squeaks like that.

794
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,700
And I would turn around and say, Hey,

795
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,200
you hear that?

796
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,580
That's an entire phrase, that's an entire sentence

797
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:36,580
that they're sending out, people just hear it

798
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,640
as a bleep or an artifact, the sonic

799
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,380
artifact, but I'm telling you, there's an entire

800
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,960
verse, or a command in that right now.

801
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,380
And I said what I like, because I

802
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,780
witnessed it in the TV, you know, the

803
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:49,980
very rapid motion in the TV station.

804
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,840
So I said, Wow, no, this cable shit,

805
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,500
they're sending some crazy shit.

806
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,620
And then I went back and it was

807
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,040
his name was Eric the tall, he was

808
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,320
like six foot nine.

809
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,820
And he ran the station most of the

810
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,240
time.

811
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,980
And he says they send they send evil

812
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:04,360
stuff.

813
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,580
Kayla says, Oh, yeah, it's all evil.

814
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,800
They're sending stuff over.

815
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,740
He says they do it frames, you know,

816
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,860
like, he told me read this book called

817
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,540
subliminal seduction.

818
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:13,980
Oh, yeah.

819
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,240
Yeah, you know, in the movies, they would

820
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,080
put like every sort of Yeah, cocoa, you

821
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,500
know, right.

822
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,700
So insert a picture of popcorn all of

823
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,180
a sudden, gee, I want some popcorn.

824
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,960
Yeah, your conscious mind.

825
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,300
It's all in other words, you do not

826
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,620
acknowledge you know, they say it goes to

827
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,360
the subconscious, there really is no subconscious.

828
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,880
It's beyond the sensory limit, right?

829
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,500
That you can process it's your processing just

830
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,060
because it for example, when you have a

831
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:41,960
computer that only processes a certain amount, it

832
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,860
doesn't mean you can't get all the information

833
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,540
and processes as it can.

834
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,520
So they send all the information to you.

835
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,100
And then your body you process it be

836
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,400
but because you're so trained to rely on

837
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,640
your senses, which do nothing more than fool

838
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,800
you most of the time, back back to

839
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,780
what we said about being creative, those people

840
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:03,780
that are creative that are really discoverers have

841
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,680
let go of being fooled by their senses.

842
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,000
And that's why they pick up and do

843
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,200
things that other people can you know, so

844
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,920
it's also like a dog whistle too.

845
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,600
And I do mean a literal dog whistle

846
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,280
where you know, you can blow that thing

847
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,560
and you're like, it doesn't make a noise.

848
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,340
Yes, it is.

849
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,960
You just don't hear it because of the

850
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,100
quality of your receptor.

851
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,460
I mean, I remember years ago, we're going

852
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,400
hunting and stuff in upstate New York, they

853
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,300
had deer whistles, there's a little chrome thing,

854
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,640
you put it on your hood.

855
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,380
Yeah, you didn't hear anything.

856
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,840
And it's pretty loud to the deer.

857
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,980
You see them go to the road, turn

858
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,260
around and run.

859
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,320
Yep, they run away from the road when

860
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:36,760
you're coming.

861
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,160
Yeah.

862
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,240
So but it reacts like as if you're

863
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,240
shooing it away like that whistle works.

864
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,140
I can't hear a thing, the cheap ones,

865
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,080
you can maybe hear a little noise.

866
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,720
But you think to yourself, nobody's going to

867
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,160
hear that.

868
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,700
The deer hears it.

869
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,640
You know, yeah, because he was spooked.

870
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,300
You'd see them running to the road.

871
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,540
And they before they get to the road,

872
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,000
they turn around and run back, right?

873
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:56,380
Yeah.

874
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:59,260
And we're before they, you know, without that,

875
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,780
they usually just jump, you know, in the

876
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,480
road, whatever.

877
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,460
It's just like in the years when am

878
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,480
radio was big, and there was 100 channels,

879
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,800
right in a city.

880
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:11,300
And you're getting pummeled with basically microwaves from

881
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,640
these am radio stations.

882
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,140
But you're not hearing every radio station because

883
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,580
you're not on the right, you know, you're

884
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,900
not tuned into the right part of the

885
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,200
dial.

886
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,940
Your head is Yeah, it's the shorter.

887
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:24,060
Yeah, I mean, yeah, there's a lot of

888
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:27,560
stuff like the heroes would make a little

889
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:27,920
segue.

890
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,820
You ever noticed when it was about water,

891
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,760
I want to bring that up.

892
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,540
Also, it's someone in the chats been blowing

893
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,760
up the chat with it, which is a

894
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,720
good thing about water.

895
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,600
Well, I think because I added that water,

896
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,160
the water stuff to the rated.

897
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,120
Yeah, I got so I got someone said

898
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:42,800
it was very good.

899
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,460
Someone, a sub.

900
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:48,380
Someone that's been recent said that that was

901
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:48,880
really good.

902
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,100
And we did that more than a decade

903
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,040
ago, or about No, it's about eight years

904
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,900
ago, maybe right?

905
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:53,740
The little one.

906
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:53,900
Yeah.

907
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,400
The short one that we did on my

908
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,940
site was Yeah, maybe me.

909
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:57,360
Yeah.

910
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,980
Yeah, that's still holds.

911
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,660
But I'm working on something right now, you

912
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,500
notice that no matter how you treat tap

913
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,840
water, or whatever, things don't grow as well

914
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,380
as when it rains.

915
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,800
So what is it, you know, from a

916
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,680
chemical perspective, you can say, well, you know,

917
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,300
what, you know, you've heard me say, we're

918
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:18,280
not oxygen breathers, we're nitrogen breathers, because 70

919
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,720
% nitrogen, which is the majority of the

920
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,420
gas we breathe, but we need to see

921
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,720
it's not simple, as simple as that we

922
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,160
need some oxygen in there to stimulate the

923
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,260
process once it gets into the body, right?

924
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:33,080
They never talk about what nitrogen turns into

925
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,080
how it turns into oxygen in the body

926
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,540
and all these other things that it does.

927
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,400
It's a pulsing gas.

928
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:39,880
It's anyway.

929
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,020
But is it chemical?

930
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:42,780
That's the chemical.

931
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,240
So because the water is falling through 70

932
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,520
% nitrogen for such a distance.

933
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:51,620
Now, whether it's the UV from the sun,

934
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,060
or the infrared from the sun, or at

935
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,940
night, the stuff grows better, whether it rained

936
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,360
at night or day, I think the rainwater

937
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,880
is more effective for rains at night.

938
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,960
So, so is it chemical?

939
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:04,320
Yes, we can explore running water through a

940
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,740
nitrogen type system, something that mimics nitrogen via

941
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,980
induction, right?

942
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,160
Is it because there's no minerals in the

943
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:13,520
water?

944
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,400
Is that why things grow?

945
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,320
But that's not true.

946
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:20,320
Because once the water hits the dirt, boy,

947
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,720
it's pretty salty right away that before the

948
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,500
plant sees it.

949
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,060
So it's not really that it's distilled, or

950
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,180
there's nothing in the water.

951
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,640
Actually, that's not true.

952
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,960
I remember years ago, we were doing research

953
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,660
on water.

954
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,720
And we caught rainwater and it had it

955
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,760
had stuff in it.

956
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,600
I was just gonna say through the sky.

957
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,100
Yeah, I've caught rainwater and it is not,

958
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,220
you know, clean.

959
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,060
Yeah, it's not clean, as clean as one

960
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,020
would say, right?

961
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,020
Or think you would think that's like going

962
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,440
to be completely crystal clear.

963
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,100
It's not it's like a little foggy.

964
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:49,960
It's got something going.

965
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,340
I mean, depending on where you are, it

966
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,440
varies a little bit.

967
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,040
Yeah, so I'm doing agriculture.

968
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,300
And the thing is, I'm right at the

969
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,880
point right now where I could I have

970
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,620
a device that needs to be finished or

971
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,940
assembled a couple of them to mimic that.

972
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,200
And it's like the joke little thing.

973
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,700
If you do that, you're gonna get killed

974
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,140
for that.

975
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,220
Because it is, you know, make stuff grow

976
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:09,840
like rainwater.

977
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,400
But we're gonna try it on, you know,

978
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,220
carrots, when carrots are grown, they have to

979
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,560
get eight hours of irrigation every day for

980
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,400
about three months.

981
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,320
That uses more water carrot farm uses more

982
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,140
water than all the surrounding communities.

983
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:21,980
Right?

984
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,100
That's a tremendous amount of water, if we

985
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,360
cut that in half, let's say, right.

986
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,920
So anyway, I just want to bring that

987
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,300
up the sound stuff that comes through the

988
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:33,180
the implications and the things that we get.

989
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,420
I'm leaning more, just like I mentioned, how

990
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,080
do we make it?

991
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,100
Maybe we need to, because the water falls,

992
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:43,680
the rain falls to a majority of nitrogen

993
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,240
gas is what the air is, we need

994
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,820
to look at that very carefully, but not

995
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,240
from a chemical point of view.

996
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:49,920
Right.

997
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,620
So when we look at lookout for Charlie,

998
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,080
lookout for Charlie, his video show that he

999
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,580
actually records, puts out recordings, a quiet night

1000
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:01,180
in the country, right, and then plays it

1001
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:01,380
in here.

1002
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,520
And he speeds it up and modifies it.

1003
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,200
So you can hear what you normally don't

1004
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:05,360
hear.

1005
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,780
And there are voices in there.

1006
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,080
And it's not microwave or radio.

1007
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,140
It's sonic, you see.

1008
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,340
So there's that aspect, then there's the more

1009
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:16,980
spiritual side, which is a beyond microwave.

1010
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,220
No one talks about stuff in the terahertz,

1011
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:21,620
right?

1012
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,220
You notice that they go megahertz, you know,

1013
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,020
they go micro, they don't go into like,

1014
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,460
terahertz, even beyond but all sound.

1015
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,420
Here's the thing, though, Greek, and here's, here's

1016
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,920
the question I have for you about this,

1017
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,980
all sound is in waves anyway.

1018
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:36,660
So whether it's a microwave, it is the

1019
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:36,860
same.

1020
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,760
Yeah, the spectrum, and it goes to the

1021
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,600
visual, if you keep pushing it, it starts

1022
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,360
to glow, right?

1023
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,260
Yeah, exactly.

1024
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,840
But that's my point.

1025
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,200
All of these things are in waves.

1026
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,000
So whether it's a microwave, or a macro

1027
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,080
wave of sort, nobody uses that term.

1028
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,520
But you know what I'm getting at?

1029
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,600
The point is, is that it's on different

1030
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,460
parts of the spectrum.

1031
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,920
So all of it is actually sonic, even

1032
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:00,820
those microwaves, it's all perturbations of air and

1033
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,200
ether.

1034
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,540
By the way, people that are interested, shoot

1035
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,040
me an email.

1036
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,320
I have someone I know who is really

1037
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:11,860
interested and has made a significant contribution, I

1038
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:15,900
would consider about a seminar on the acoustic

1039
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:16,840
counter space.

1040
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,480
So if anybody wants that, we'll have a

1041
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,120
discussion, not a full seminar.

1042
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,980
And I'll do some sketches.

1043
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:27,040
And if you're into audio, we have a

1044
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,340
system now that deals so sound would be

1045
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,260
a movement of air, most people think, but

1046
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,159
there's an ethereal component to it.

1047
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,239
Just like light has an ethereal radio is

1048
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,699
the ether, you know, right?

1049
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,679
It's like, that's what they used to say

1050
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,320
years ago, it's in the ether, you know,

1051
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,600
it's a perturbation of the ether, because of

1052
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,880
quote, unquote, electromagnetic stimulation, right?

1053
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,780
So so the so anyone should in the

1054
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,800
I just want to see who, by show

1055
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,280
of hands or emails, who's interested in showing

1056
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:58,080
up for, let's say a team's short, like

1057
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:01,940
a one time meeting on acoustic counter space,

1058
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,320
and who's serious about it, because when you

1059
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,700
have space in, let's say, a loudspeaker enclosure,

1060
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,840
a loudspeaker box, a speaker box, right?

1061
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,940
Or a room, right?

1062
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,800
You know how you do acoustic treatment based

1063
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,060
on the room size, right?

1064
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,880
You know, they have voice booths, right, they

1065
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,100
walk into and all that.

1066
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:19,520
And you have acoustic treatment for larger rooms.

1067
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,300
If you go to a place like Carnegie

1068
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,680
Hall, you know, even right, yeah, they create

1069
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,280
everything from a bathroom to a cathedral in

1070
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,360
the studios, even, you know, in the early

1071
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:28,740
days.

1072
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,400
Yeah, what all these engineers are not considering

1073
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,060
at all, it's beyond them is there's an

1074
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,240
ether component there.

1075
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,400
And when you know how to manipulate that,

1076
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,580
it's a very simple device.

1077
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,380
You're tapping into counter space, which is the

1078
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,020
opposite of positive space.

1079
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:46,020
Now, it's kind of an oxymoron, because space

1080
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:46,780
has no attributes.

1081
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,880
That's why it's space.

1082
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,080
When you say this space is warm, it's

1083
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,060
really the air that's warm, not the space.

1084
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:52,720
Right?

1085
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,560
If you say this space is humid, it's

1086
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,260
not the space, it's the moisture.

1087
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,780
So space has no attributes, but there's a

1088
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,720
attribute to it in the ether.

1089
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,280
And now we have a counter attribute a

1090
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,020
way to without continuing people that are into

1091
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,840
sci fi, you know, they say, Oh, there's

1092
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,180
anti matter, we have the matter anti matter.

1093
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,440
And you know, when you put them together,

1094
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,720
they cancel each other out.

1095
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,860
But it's very violent in the sci fi

1096
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,180
usually, right?

1097
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,800
This is the explosion.

1098
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,140
But, you know, this is about the account.

1099
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:26,600
Okay, it's like a accommodation.

1100
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:31,000
It is a quantitative accommodation, as opposed to

1101
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,340
space, isn't it?

1102
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,220
No, okay.

1103
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,560
I thought it would be like geometric, but

1104
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,160
it's a quantity.

1105
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,140
It is geometric.

1106
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,620
It's a very thin, just to give people

1107
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,400
an idea when you have a box with

1108
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,200
drivers in front of you know, speakers, you

1109
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:46,900
know, you have a box.

1110
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:47,440
Okay.

1111
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,360
And imagine the profile is slice the box

1112
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,100
open, you got the front, the top, the

1113
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:55,300
bottom, left side, right side and the back.

1114
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,880
So you can just cut it open.

1115
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,240
We're just focusing on the back of the

1116
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,180
speaker box, right?

1117
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,720
You see, there's just a wall there, right?

1118
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,880
And what you do is, regardless of how

1119
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,820
thick the cabinet is, put another wall, a

1120
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:10,320
false wall in front of the back wall,

1121
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,000
right?

1122
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,140
And when you put that false wall there,

1123
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,480
leave only a quarter inch gap of airspace

1124
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:15,920
vertically.

1125
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:19,060
And on one side of the wall, you

1126
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:21,540
line it with what you might call a

1127
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:24,240
sound absorption type material, a felt, a foam,

1128
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,460
a weave of some type, and then it

1129
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,420
cuts the space in half.

1130
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,940
So now you have a you had started

1131
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,700
off with a quarter inch space, you have

1132
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,740
an eighth inch of this fabric on one

1133
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,000
side, and you have an eighth inch of

1134
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,880
air space on the other.

1135
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:41,240
And what you do there, it's completely sealed

1136
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,560
except for an aperture and opening in the

1137
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,260
center that allows the main speaker space to

1138
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:50,500
communicate with this very narrow space, an aperture

1139
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,960
meaning a hole, an opening.

1140
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,500
I'm just breaking this down to the simplest

1141
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:54,780
thing.

1142
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,180
So when the energy in the box sees

1143
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:02,160
that false wall, immediately it sees a volume

1144
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,800
that starts going to infinity minus because as

1145
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,480
it travels that narrow gap, it's like, when

1146
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,800
is this thing going to ever get bigger?

1147
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,460
It never does.

1148
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,960
And so the energy sees a volume that

1149
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,360
goes to infinity minus and you cannot have

1150
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,380
sound with no volume, you need a volume.

1151
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:22,120
And but it sees the surface area relative

1152
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:25,160
going to infinity plus and all that happens

1153
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,960
when you run sound across an infinitely large

1154
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,980
surface area, right?

1155
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:32,020
You have diffraction and, you know, absorption.

1156
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,520
So it has this weird play where the

1157
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,180
sound in the box thinks that the energy

1158
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:40,760
is going to, volume component is going to

1159
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,820
infinity minus and the surface area is going

1160
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,860
to infinity plus.

1161
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:47,200
And it takes away any distortion, the power

1162
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,820
handling goes up, you get incredible clarity.

1163
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:52,260
Now the driver starts to work without any

1164
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:55,000
forces or energy working against it.

1165
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,380
You can make the box smaller.

1166
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,360
If you have something called a woofer, it

1167
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,640
goes down really low.

1168
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,820
So you can have a four or five

1169
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,740
inch wide woofer put out the same low

1170
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,360
base output as a 10 inch or an

1171
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,960
eight inch woofer, right?

1172
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,620
Sorry, guys, I don't know if I can

1173
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,580
help you with that if you're anyway, but

1174
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:16,980
but but here's the thing.

1175
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,860
This is the most rudimentary.

1176
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,700
It's not that simple.

1177
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,120
The forms matter and all this.

1178
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,440
So right now we're taking it to the

1179
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,540
point where we can apply it to anything

1180
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:30,360
that makes sound perturbation, right?

1181
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,560
And there's also there's an active way to

1182
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,900
do it, which I'm working on.

1183
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:37,880
So this is how this all ties back

1184
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,780
and brought up sound the voices, okay?

1185
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,580
The voices that you hear the all this

1186
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,320
other stuff there.

1187
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,800
It's a very broad component.

1188
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,320
One thing that I brought up on a

1189
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,080
speak the sonic actually, I did with one

1190
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,420
of the guys from paranormies.

1191
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,120
He I don't know if he's published anything

1192
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:53,480
yet.

1193
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,280
But we've done about three or four several

1194
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,380
hour long ones.

1195
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,700
He's Brandon, I think from the paranormies.

1196
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:05,020
Yeah, anyway, we did a bunch of stuff.

1197
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,400
And he was speaking to me about, you

1198
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,600
know, input, you know, spiritual input, divine and

1199
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,120
all I said, Well, this is a real

1200
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,860
simple way to think about what's going on

1201
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:14,440
in this realm.

1202
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,260
All of the input that you get that

1203
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,520
comes like from the plane that we're in

1204
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,180
the realm that we're in is always going

1205
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:21,820
to be negative.

1206
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:22,800
Always.

1207
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,360
The what people and the mystics have spoke

1208
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,600
about, you know, coming from heaven or above,

1209
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,740
tends to be positive.

1210
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:33,440
And I said tends to be positive is

1211
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,860
not always positive, because it comes in a

1212
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,320
very raw form.

1213
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,500
And it depends, it's up to the individual

1214
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,320
to structure it to be positive, where the

1215
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,660
information that comes to people, humans, animals, all

1216
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:48,520
that from this realm from the earth itself,

1217
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:52,340
and whatever entities are fucking with us, let's

1218
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:55,820
say that is very well structured and very

1219
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,940
specific, very specific, the stuff that comes from

1220
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:02,480
the divine that could potentially be positive is

1221
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,620
in a raw form.

1222
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,600
So that means that it could also become

1223
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,400
negative depending on your mindset.

1224
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,200
And if you know how to take it

1225
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,300
in structure into something defensive or something positive.

1226
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:16,460
So in essence, do we get any finished

1227
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,060
raw any finished?

1228
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,720
Good vibe mess?

1229
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,400
No, we don't.

1230
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,520
It's all negative here.

1231
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,640
The potential to have good vibe and potential

1232
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,320
divine stuff.

1233
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,140
It does come in its raw form.

1234
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,380
So yeah, we are at a major disadvantage.

1235
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,260
And I don't know this is happening.

1236
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:35,280
I mean, I've heard there are societies underground

1237
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,240
that have been controlling the surface for forever.

1238
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,760
And they get unaffected by what happens on

1239
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,240
the surface.

1240
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,620
And there are a million years ahead, a

1241
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:45,300
million years ahead of where we are now

1242
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,300
a million years ago.

1243
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,240
Right?

1244
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,780
So you're screwed there, then you have the

1245
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:52,380
human interface of the non humans that run

1246
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:55,680
this realm that are playing around with their

1247
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,680
you know, like you've heard of fusion centers

1248
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,760
and stuff where they do targeted individual stuff.

1249
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,680
That's real, by the way, I've seen real

1250
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:06,140
paperwork on not not in person, but online

1251
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:09,320
suggesting that by the way, you know, targeting

1252
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,340
individuals, right?

1253
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:13,100
Now, the homeland security is always running, what

1254
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:16,380
do they call dry runs?

1255
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,120
What do you call it when you do

1256
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,460
a test or drill?

1257
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:20,500
A drill?

1258
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,220
Yeah, they run drills, and they and they're

1259
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:22,660
unlimited.

1260
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,720
Their drills are unlimited.

1261
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,600
They do everything.

1262
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,800
So you have the ones on that social

1263
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,080
level, then you've got the the freak, you

1264
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,120
know, the freaks and the personal ones like

1265
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,000
Lex Luthor.

1266
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,660
Like whenever watch Superman with Lex Luthor, he

1267
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,400
was not funded by any government or anything.

1268
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,180
He was just this crazy billionaire, right?

1269
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:39,560
Right?

1270
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:42,140
That's the private ones, you have that going

1271
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:44,280
on, then you have the spiritual ones that

1272
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:47,920
people typically call demonic, that are flooding society

1273
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,080
and people either individuals directly or society.

1274
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,100
So you got I could you could name,

1275
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,800
you can't prove any of this, but I

1276
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,520
could show or loosely discuss four or five

1277
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,040
different categories that are beaming everyone all the

1278
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,260
time with negative shit.

1279
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:06,140
And then like I mentioned, you have potentially

1280
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:09,260
positive raw material coming from the divine from

1281
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:12,500
above, let's say, but it's not in a

1282
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,980
finished form, which if you're a negative Nancy

1283
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,980
is not a term, you can easily turn

1284
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:19,240
that raw material into something, you know, get

1285
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,180
it sucked up into negative shit again.

1286
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,360
So yeah, so it has to be formed.

1287
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,560
That's why when you look at this is

1288
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,140
a big discussion that I haven't really thought

1289
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,580
about in a long time, but I used

1290
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:34,200
to meditate on this.

1291
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:37,000
And you when you understand that the stuff

1292
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,280
that's fixed on earth is all negative, and

1293
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,040
it's very highly specific, just like, look out

1294
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:42,760
for Charlie.

1295
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:46,120
He recorded where he walked on a wooden

1296
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,020
floor, and he went back as a 10

1297
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:49,480
steps flat footed, right?

1298
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:53,180
It's like, wow, so they're actually, you know,

1299
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:54,500
really specific.

1300
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,300
I was meditating on how specific the shit

1301
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:57,720
is here.

1302
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,300
I mean, negative, I mean, in every aspect,

1303
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:03,900
really, and then trying to dial in and

1304
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:07,100
get a feel for the raw material that's

1305
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:10,060
coming up that is potentially positive and forming

1306
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:11,880
it into something positive, right.

1307
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:16,400
So that's, that's what I have done for

1308
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,480
many years now.

1309
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:22,300
And I understand that it is participatory participatory,

1310
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:25,440
you have to take responsibility for the positive

1311
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,140
stuff, if you don't mind, then if you

1312
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,120
don't mind the negative stuff, you just got

1313
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,980
to sit back, you don't have to think

1314
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:34,160
about anything or doing anything or whatever, it's

1315
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,240
already taken care of, they got you pretty

1316
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:36,840
good, right.

1317
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,200
So it takes a lot of work to

1318
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:44,040
form that raw material into positive stuff, you

1319
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,260
know, and that's, there's an entire group, groupings

1320
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,920
of people, the sages, the mystics, the real

1321
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,800
holy men, you know, the creatives and all

1322
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,860
that that do that, very few, though.
