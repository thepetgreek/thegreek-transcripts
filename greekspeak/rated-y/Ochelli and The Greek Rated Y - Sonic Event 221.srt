1
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,780
Ah, Rated Y, 2-2-1, that's the

2
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,360
sonic event number, and anyhow, Greek, how are

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,380
you on this fine, what is it, Saturday,

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,160
or whatever?

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,520
Fine day, yeah, what they call Saturday, I

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,400
was having a conversation with someone recently, and

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,660
the more you use presumptive terms, the more

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,100
accurate you are, you know, like what they

9
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,820
call Monday, I remember once calling someone a

10
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:34,080
minor, and I said, I'll be there what

11
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,860
they call Friday, what do you mean what

12
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,420
they call Friday, Friday is Friday, right, and

13
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,580
so when you do stuff like that, you

14
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,020
get a reaction, you see if they're listening,

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,580
where they're at, you learn a lot about

16
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,060
people, but by the way, my thing about

17
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,760
learning about people is not asking questions, but

18
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,440
like recently, about four times this past week,

19
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,540
because I'm trying to expand into luxury business,

20
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,640
and I don't want to be the one

21
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,560
that does anything really, I want to be

22
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,020
the driving force behind it, right, so whoever

23
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:08,800
deals with whoever develops their own rapport, because

24
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,860
all the businesses I did before, people would

25
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,400
call, you know, someone answer is the Greek

26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:14,600
there?

27
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,640
No, he'll be in tomorrow.

28
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:15,980
All right.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,700
I'll call tomorrow.

30
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:17,920
Wait, what can I do for you?

31
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,060
No, no, no, no, I don't want to

32
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:19,420
talk to you.

33
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,180
I want to talk to him.

34
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:20,820
Right?

35
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:21,980
No, no, no, I don't want to do

36
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:22,220
that.

37
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:22,540
Right.

38
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,300
So I've been, and it's really hard to

39
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,420
get a feeling of what someone is about

40
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,620
on a basic conversation, but you can't by

41
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,200
using how the term they use, but you

42
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,520
can't condemn them for it, because words are

43
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,300
one of the easiest things to be changed,

44
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:38,680
right?

45
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,780
So yeah, you can change that in an

46
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,540
instant, really, once, let's say someone becomes aware,

47
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,380
you know, I've made people aware of lawful

48
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,700
timekeeping, real timekeeping, and most people don't care

49
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,000
but those that do it just kind of

50
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,940
like oh my gosh I got it no

51
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,180
more I got to do this you know

52
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,140
you know I got a really deadly right

53
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,520
so by the way who I'm looking for

54
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,280
to work with me on the various things

55
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,280
with the scalerator is when they see it

56
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,400
get the idea oh I'm gonna quit my

57
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,240
job I'm gonna leave my wife leave my

58
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,540
husband I'm gonna quit my job this is

59
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,960
what I want to do that's I feel

60
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,280
it okay great great great one thing you

61
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,900
are getting some electronic interference so watch whatever

62
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,900
it is you're going near yeah it's like

63
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,160
actually actually not much actually I just I

64
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,220
held up a metal device maybe that will

65
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,400
do it near the phone so anyway so

66
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,120
this is one of the things I do

67
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,640
for character you know I think I went

68
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,920
over a job interview a job interview right

69
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,440
yeah sorting out coins and you learn a

70
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,880
lot that way from people also especially when

71
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,580
they walk in they drop their resume and

72
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,320
tell them to sit down on this table

73
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,640
and sort out coins like oh I'm not

74
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,160
gonna do that I'm out of here my

75
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,740
favorite my very favorite little test of your

76
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,100
you know let's see if anybody's listening to

77
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,780
what the hell is being said was a

78
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,520
phone message you had for a little bit

79
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,100
where yeah you called a certain number this

80
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,600
message sounded very much like the usual numbers

81
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,020
you get this numbers been disconnected but that's

82
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,040
not what the message said that's it's a

83
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,940
lady's voice which I'd always used to be

84
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,720
I don't know what it is anymore but

85
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,020
you know you get a lady's voice that

86
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,580
used to tell you this number has been

87
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,600
disconnected anyway it sounded just like that except

88
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,760
the lady says you've reached the number that

89
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,840
you dialed if you believe you reached it

90
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,960
or hang up and dial it again yeah

91
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,220
and people kept hanging up and redialing basically

92
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,760
it says you have reached the number that

93
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,520
you have just dialed it's an English accent

94
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,900
you have reached the number that you have

95
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,560
just dialed if you believe you dialed in

96
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,140
an error hang up and dial it again

97
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,460
and people and so I see someone hang

98
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:45,000
up a delegate I'm like oh this never

99
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
never spoken before a referral or whatever oh

100
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,020
this guy's not paying attention so what do

101
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,260
I do should I fuck with him you

102
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,340
know I mean mess with him a little

103
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,460
bit I mean or they're easy to mess

104
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,680
with or to educate him or what I'm

105
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,840
just gonna watch this character yeah so most

106
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,540
people fail most people fail tests especially with

107
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,860
criticism I recently spoke to someone oh it's

108
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,600
hilarious oh it was hilarious oh because you

109
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,020
gave me the the number I called it

110
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,720
and then hooked back up with you and

111
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,160
I said that's the weirdest thing it says

112
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,940
I reached it's a psych test it's a

113
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,519
psyop it's an operation to psychologically look at

114
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,700
a distance you can only spiritually or psychologically

115
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,520
it's the same thing filter yeah of course

116
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,360
right that's the only way you can do

117
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,340
it but when we meet in person I'm

118
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,320
listening about criticism if you give criticism you

119
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,600
can't just say it sucks and stop a

120
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,620
five-year-old can do that right you

121
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,140
should prepare when you give criticism say what's

122
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,900
wrong with it and the to fix it

123
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,720
so you get three parts to a criticism

124
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,740
I've spoke to someone recently said oh this

125
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,180
sucks I'm like okay how do you fix

126
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,780
it looks they were silent I'm like okay

127
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,860
this person's eight years old so you know

128
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,440
basically it doesn't matter how old they are

129
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,900
but they stopped at around eight or nine

130
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,500
you know their function yeah so it's kind

131
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,620
of like you know I had an old

132
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:58,080
member of the early 2000s computers you try

133
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,700
to update them and it took like all

134
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,880
night and then you're like then you're like

135
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,580
hit fuck it cancel just hit the cancel

136
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,400
button no more but then it would still

137
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,940
be there but not do you want to

138
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,760
finish downloading it no yes yeah so it's

139
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,040
dumb stuff so I like the computer analogy

140
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,920
because it's supposed to be the mental mental

141
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,880
machine right there you go a mental machine

142
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,620
well they tell you the brain is the

143
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,260
body's computer or you know yeah they always

144
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,200
try and do that sort of yeah so

145
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,620
essentially what I do now it's sort of

146
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,380
the coin thing for an interview as I

147
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,080
hand someone a camera and there's something in

148
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,320
the room I say take a picture of

149
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,740
that object for me would you and then

150
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,260
when you think you've got a good picture

151
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,780
you can take as many as like just

152
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,580
present me with one right and when they

153
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,840
show me the picture I'm like it'll be

154
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,500
a flower with a vase and the lights

155
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,460
coming through the window and they show me

156
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,780
the picture and I'm like what's that big

157
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,620
black thing right there and that's the first

158
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,820
thing I see and I'm like oh that's

159
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,460
the shadow I'm like you know that because

160
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,760
you're in the room but if you show

161
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,400
this picture someone's gonna wonder what that big

162
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,300
black blob is right there first thing you

163
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,040
see right so you know the first thing

164
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,320
you see second thing you see so I

165
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,240
learn a lot about people by having them

166
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,580
take a photo and by the way I

167
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,580
have still to meet anyone who can take

168
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,360
photos up to where the photo is well

169
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,860
communicating right still I haven't seen anyone coaching

170
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,560
I coach people on it years ago there

171
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,200
was a photographer I'm not gonna mention his

172
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,520
name Chris Gimarae he used to photograph for

173
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,920
Buick General Motors and we go to the

174
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,000
football games giant stadium and anyway he hired

175
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,820
me says I want you to work in

176
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,280
my studio I was like but I don't

177
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,940
know anything about photography and he says you'll

178
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:39,100
do great you're smart I'm like what what

179
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,100
did he just say yeah so anyway so

180
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,540
I'm trying to focus where you know the

181
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,420
games are going right so I'm trying to

182
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,140
focus and take a shot focus take a

183
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,840
shot he grabs the camera he grabs my

184
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,900
camera and two cameras he holds him three

185
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,560
feet ahead of him he goes pop up

186
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,760
up up up up up up up up

187
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,180
up up up up unloads them it says

188
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,720
take the film out new film I'm like

189
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,380
holy shit you know so we put it

190
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,160
we went through 40 rolls of film and

191
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,600
then what you do you develop everything because

192
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,240
I was used to like everybody line up

193
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,680
say cheese okay right you know that's not

194
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,400
how you do photography it's all about timing

195
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,660
you take hundreds or thousands of pictures to

196
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,040
find one it's all about timing and it's

197
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,940
not timing that you create it's a timing

198
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,940
universe that whatever happens right you know how

199
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,840
that developed in the photographic industry that sort

200
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,060
of attitude which was correct where they just

201
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,040
threw a net and hope they captured the

202
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,980
great image is because two different photographers captured

203
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,960
Lee Harvey Oswald getting shot in the gut

204
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,360
by Jack Ruby and yeah I've seen that

205
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,300
and it's that action shot yeah and one

206
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,000
of them got the Pulitzer and the other

207
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,540
one got nothing and it was just a

208
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:45,080
very slight deviation in the photograph but it

209
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,820
was like hell this is like a split

210
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,220
-second difference in the photograph and one worked

211
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,880
one didn't because one conveyed the actual incident

212
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,300
and the other did not and it was

213
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,880
like a baffling thing it is 1963 folks

214
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,600
that this is when that changed and photography

215
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,760
is like that though yeah you know that's

216
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,120
why people and the worst thing it's like

217
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,380
you know I was talking to someone so

218
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,760
you know who really about financial business on

219
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,060
it so that's really messed up I didn't

220
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,500
know that so you know don't blame the

221
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,040
government or the schools it's your parents that

222
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,940
screwed you up they're the ones that made

223
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,020
you stand around on holidays says cheese for

224
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,940
photo they have no idea what's going on

225
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,520
it's your parents so if you're gonna blame

226
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,220
anyone it's your parents that messed you up

227
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,760
I don't care how you think they good

228
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,200
parents they were I could show you there

229
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,299
was pretty shitty 500 different ways and I'm

230
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:37,159
not saying go everybody go after their parents

231
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,799
no but you have to put them in

232
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,260
their proper perspective ones that messed you up

233
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,179
yeah but they may have indeed done with

234
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:45,180
the best intent they could and everything else

235
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,080
with their heart doesn't matter it doesn't matter

236
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,760
but the fact is they did the best

237
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,060
they could but don't forget they were screwed

238
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,540
up by their parents so yeah and so

239
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,300
and so so that's why people harkin on

240
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,580
the halcyon days I think we're better well

241
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,800
if they were so much better than they

242
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,380
wouldn't have allowed it they would have put

243
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,280
guidelines and enforced you know guidelines so we

244
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,040
wouldn't be where we are to people we're

245
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,260
actually better today believe it or not there

246
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,020
goes that electronic jump again whatever is in

247
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,700
common with the last time I said it

248
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,060
you're doing it okay you know by the

249
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,380
way this whole time you have a major

250
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,520
echo but I've learned how to deal with

251
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,580
that so if you have something like that

252
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,780
I can't really pick it up but I

253
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,580
sound pretty clear and you do pick up

254
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,300
a distortion every so often is what you're

255
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,800
saying no no no it's not just a

256
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,700
distortion though it's literally like I can hear

257
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,860
a break in the interference yeah it's it's

258
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,620
a different thing I'm talking about a little

259
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,620
distortion I could even factor out I wonder

260
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,260
if it's the whirlygig stay away from it

261
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,420
whirlygig anyway for those that did the weather

262
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,460
yes webinar know what that is so it's

263
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,840
amazing how completely passive device I've had several

264
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,460
people say do you know the weather devices

265
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,980
mess up a compass I'm like yeah is

266
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,840
that cool so and there's nothing you know

267
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,880
right electronic or magnets or anything so well

268
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,500
because it doesn't generate an electromagnetic field it

269
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,960
guides them so it actually messes with the

270
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,640
field that makes electric magnetic fields it's a

271
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,180
yeah so by the electric magnetic fields of

272
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,240
perturbation and the static it's so funny when

273
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,860
you talk about the ether you know how

274
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,300
it let me just go over this I

275
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,100
don't want to get in something you know

276
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,600
this thing is with a motor you see

277
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,100
it our construction sites emergencies and what is

278
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,200
that say it's an electrical generator right it's

279
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,540
a generator it generates electricity no it doesn't

280
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,940
generators right it does not generate any more

281
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,340
electricity than a water pump generates water go

282
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,420
out and buy a water pump leave it

283
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,800
in the box just plug it in you

284
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,780
expect water to start coming out of it

285
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,000
no no you have to connect it in

286
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,400
water pump is designed to take something that

287
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,780
is static static keyword yes and and depending

288
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,240
on the design of the pump to give

289
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,980
it a certain pressure and rate of flow

290
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,680
it's exactly what a winding and a generator

291
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,960
does and or the commutator however you want

292
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,280
to do it a magnet and a coil

293
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,740
let's say it's a simple one you can

294
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,160
use as many different ways to do it

295
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,000
when you start rotating rotating that it takes

296
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,020
the static body of electricity and then starts

297
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,360
magnetically pressurizing it just like the pump with

298
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,060
the impeller pressurizes the water and it make

299
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:20,320
that magnetic repressurized ether or static electricity likes

300
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,640
to run along metallic what we call conductors

301
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,500
and that's what electricity is has nothing to

302
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,240
do with electrons I've talked about it for

303
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,020
years I've done experiments with my very powerful

304
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,500
microscopes where I have a high current high

305
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,300
voltage wire and I have heavy rubber gloves

306
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,540
and I cut the wire and I pointed

307
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,000
towards the ground and I come back with

308
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,200
the microscope looking for the electrons to scoop

309
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,300
them up right right of course yeah that's

310
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,920
how you make fun of these or maybe

311
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,160
more and they're moronic the scientific people so

312
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,540
anyway yeah all these things it's like no

313
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,960
one is paying attention it seems like only

314
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,980
like the 15 subs that we have do

315
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,120
though when you go out into the world

316
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,400
and you see what's going on it's a

317
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,920
miracle you know I was speaking to an

318
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,720
engineer I said how many tens of millions

319
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,900
of people drive a car you know operate

320
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,580
you know machinery like that like oh you

321
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,660
know where they could put themselves in something

322
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,660
that looks like a projectile that's going down

323
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,760
across the surface of the earth at 50

324
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,480
or 70 miles an hour right that's what

325
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,280
I mean by that right a lot millions

326
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,320
like tens of millions maybe more no one

327
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,660
really knows but it's it's tens of millions

328
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,460
okay but if you talk to these people

329
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,260
and see where they're mentally at and their

330
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,380
perception what they know what they perceive it's

331
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,760
a miracle any of them return home alive

332
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,040
it's a miracle right there should be like

333
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,840
you know millions of fatalities every day just

334
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,340
from putting ones in itself in a heavy

335
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,840
metal object and projecting it at high speed

336
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,920
across the surface of the earth you know

337
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,620
known as a car or whatever well they're

338
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,760
based on their mental state they should be

339
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,680
half of them should not be coming back

340
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,060
alive but they do well there are there

341
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,260
are tens of thousands of accidents every day

342
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:03,800
anyway so I mean I'm talking about like

343
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,740
terminations you know yeah I mean so there's

344
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:11,440
something that's got like autopilot that's protecting people

345
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,600
keeping them going like someone working at a

346
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,660
quote-unquote job they hate it they're there

347
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,600
for 25 30 years they hate it the

348
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,460
whole time yeah and they're and they get

349
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,440
their retirement and then they hate the retirement

350
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,260
because they got nothing to do you know

351
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,960
it's but if at any point at that

352
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,860
in their lives if you tell them to

353
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,340
break away from this all you need is

354
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,280
food clothing shelter they don't want to hear

355
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,340
it at all but they'd rather be so

356
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,840
they're like this is autopilot protection kind of

357
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,460
thing where people normal normal and above normal

358
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,800
people are begging begging they're begging and asking

359
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,380
to be messed with guess what that's why

360
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,960
they are you ever heard of something called

361
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,540
a government agency you ever you ever you

362
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,400
heard of something called a you know a

363
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,580
large corporation you ever heard of a critter

364
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,820
called an attorney you ever a critter called

365
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,100
medical doctor those are all there to mess

366
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,480
with you because the state that you're in

367
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,460
you're in a stupor so this is the

368
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,120
majority of the people yes your parents are

369
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,420
like that too here's the thing and I

370
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,820
got a thing for parents so could they

371
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,880
got to stop messing I'm messing up their

372
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,800
children I'm really big when a child is

373
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,760
born to be taken away from the parents

374
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,500
and raised in a situation kind of like

375
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,380
what the dictators did in Thailand and Soviet

376
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:24,280
whatever they take the children away and they

377
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,420
raise them so they're raised according to the

378
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,700
narrative right right and the narrative here would

379
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,560
be perception reality real science real medicine real

380
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,760
education real language all this stuff and here's

381
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,880
the thing people you know I used to

382
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,740
say you know law like who decides what's

383
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,100
wrong and right I say you do it

384
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,820
has to be voluntary you decide what's wrong

385
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,000
and right all right so all this stuff

386
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,660
so anyway but one thing that I have

387
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,540
an itch on parents is you always hear

388
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,520
oh it's like how mom used to make

389
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,000
it tastes real good it's like my mom

390
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,140
used to make and I'm like oh I

391
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,100
don't want that I have never been to

392
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,040
anyone's house whose mom was even remotely a

393
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,100
good cook or grandma so you notice they

394
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,940
stopped doing those ads years ago in the

395
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,500
70s as I was five just like mom

396
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,900
used to make right oh my gosh terrible

397
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,460
terrible food I have never been to anyone's

398
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:18,080
house actually it's not true there was a

399
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,460
I remember a Japanese family that invited me

400
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,100
over it was food was very good and

401
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,960
a Persian family okay the food was very

402
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,540
good but there was only two occasions where

403
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,980
it was a family invite the food was

404
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:34,740
actually palatable so when I started documenting all

405
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,980
these events and what people say what they

406
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,620
say and think has nothing to do with

407
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,140
what's really going on that's what I mean

408
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,720
take the children away so what they say

409
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,020
and think has is tangible to reality right

410
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,200
like for example I'm studying the economic stuff

411
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,120
and you know mortgages are considered intent and

412
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,780
car loans and bank loans are considered intangible

413
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,960
debts because the bank never let you anything

414
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:00,800
it's actually in the paperwork intangible means what

415
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,280
you can't see it you can't smell it

416
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,480
you can't touch it right it's something for

417
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,420
you to touch tastes yeah it's intangible so

418
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:13,020
yeah it's it's amazing the stupidity so smart

419
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:16,000
question because you know somebody who is not

420
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,920
just looking to be on autopilot asked a

421
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,980
question in the chat and we'll start there

422
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,380
when do you switch from new moon eating

423
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:27,140
to more full moon light question mark is

424
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:30,100
this still new moon time for heavier and

425
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,760
baked items question just curious thanks that's the

426
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,100
full question there and what they're asking is

427
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,260
because you've talked about this before the timing

428
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,900
in which you eat if you are pay

429
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,380
attention to your you know lawful timekeeping you

430
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,280
will notice there is a difference of things

431
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,400
there are different cycles or different portions of

432
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,360
the cycle of the moon so yeah go

433
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,780
ahead don't take it so narrow though let

434
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,360
me just first make an adjustment to the

435
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,700
question let's call it dark moon full moon

436
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,420
okay dark and all the ancient texts the

437
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,460
new moon is the full moon right in

438
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,079
the Bible if you'd say I think it's

439
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:05,859
Psalms 81 the new moon is the full

440
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,859
moon should in the book of Enoch the

441
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:10,000
new moon is the full moon well you'd

442
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,839
figure that if something is brand new it's

443
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,400
still in one piece none of it has

444
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,180
been sliced away none of it is hidden

445
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,660
whatever you want to say so therefore that

446
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,819
makes the most sense doesn't it I've heard

447
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:22,420
pretty strong arguments against it because it's gone

448
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,540
and then it's back you know when the

449
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,020
moon is dark and the sliver comes back

450
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,460
that's a new moon so both argue so

451
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,800
let's just call it what it looks like

452
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,320
a dark moon and a full moon right

453
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,980
yeah but that's a sliver of the moon

454
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,340
as opposed to the moon so I would

455
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:39,420
argue yeah it's just for communication it's it's

456
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,360
better that way because when you say it

457
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,400
doesn't matter either way as long as you

458
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,700
know what you're talking about right the reference

459
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,320
for in terms of time here okay so

460
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,780
let's put the moon aside the reason I

461
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,960
brought that up is because it's a predominant

462
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,000
condition in your environment give you an example

463
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,640
you must always give you a way to

464
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,580
think about it it's always take consider consideration

465
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,340
the predominant forces in your environment okay so

466
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,860
what would be the predominant force would be

467
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:10,720
seasonality so when it's winter winter yes that

468
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,040
winter season takes predominance over day and night

469
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,880
and the moon because it's predominant then the

470
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,340
next thing most likely would be the moon

471
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,140
and then this and then the sun because

472
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,280
you see the moon changes very gradually but

473
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,740
the Sun changes twice a day right right

474
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,520
so right and and then there's in between

475
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,540
things like people who are prone to being

476
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,880
seasick or sick in an airplane yeah that

477
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,580
being on that ship or be airship or

478
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:40,740
naval ship or whatever you are that is

479
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,880
now the predominant influence in your environment for

480
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,660
you right being in an office cubicle with

481
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,980
fluorescent lights on eight hours a day that

482
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,040
might take predominance right messing you up right

483
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,380
so you have to decide especially again I

484
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,880
mentioned how dumb people are most people don't

485
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,800
even look up they don't even know what

486
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,940
what you know they just know it's light

487
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,620
or dark out they don't know the positions

488
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,560
of the Sun what it means they don't

489
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,340
know what the moon means at all just

490
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,400
like zero full moon people go crazy right

491
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:16,820
so yeah so it's not really about the

492
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:21,140
moon it's about assessing the predominant influence in

493
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:25,300
your environment right like the best example I

494
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,080
could give for the predominant influence of your

495
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,420
environment that is very personal would be being

496
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:32,900
seasick okay when you get seasick you don't

497
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,680
care what position the moon is if it's

498
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,840
day or night man you're see that ship

499
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,400
just rocked you you got rocked right I

500
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,060
get so I get carsick I don't give

501
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:45,540
a damn about anything about being familiar with

502
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:49,880
emotion helps by the way so so here's

503
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,640
the thing tell her that but anyway what

504
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,200
I would suggest is let's stick to the

505
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,100
question in the moon so the full moon

506
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,660
is the most expansive okay and the dark

507
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,840
moon the new moon here in the question

508
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,460
is the most contractive so you want to

509
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,040
be whenever you have a predominant influence on

510
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,680
your environment you want to be in sync

511
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,620
with it so back to the being seasick

512
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,420
the reason you get seasick is because you're

513
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,000
not paying attention to the motion of the

514
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,160
boat if you know you're prone to seasickness

515
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,060
pay attention to the motion of the boat

516
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,280
don't just fix yourself on the waves or

517
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,280
don't fix yourself on the boat you have

518
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,580
to look at how the boat is moving

519
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,580
contrary to the waves and all that get

520
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,340
her get that rhythm going in your mind

521
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,320
even if it's not smooth and you usually

522
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,520
don't get seasick you see what I mean

523
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,680
okay so pay attention to how that goes

524
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,600
so same with the moon so when the

525
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,200
moon is full or approaching full becomes fall

526
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,660
and then just after it was full that's

527
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,500
when everything is the most expansive on that

528
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,340
influence so you want to have foods that

529
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:49,460
are expansive so it would be salads light

530
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,180
foods not heavily cooked maybe more sweets than

531
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,180
usual not don't go for sweets but you

532
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,360
know save you know you want you craving

533
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,280
blueberry muffins save it for that week right

534
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,600
something sweet or whatever pancakes or whatever okay

535
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,120
so now as the as the moon starts

536
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,980
to contract and go towards what's called the

537
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,700
new moon or the dark moon that's most

538
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,660
contractive so that's when you would have a

539
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,000
little more salt that's when you would eat

540
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,600
have your meats let's say something more baked

541
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,720
that's when you have your beef stews your

542
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,400
barbecues blah blah blah blah blah okay and

543
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,200
then and you focus so you know a

544
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,140
few days the rule of thumb for me

545
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:30,020
is three days before three days after so

546
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:34,300
if you start transitioning into the moon three

547
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,180
days before and then it happens whether it's

548
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,040
full or dark and then three days after

549
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,320
and then you have like a neutral point

550
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,640
which is still a transition point so let's

551
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,100
say you the you know the new the

552
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,720
full moons be coming in three days you

553
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,580
start transitioning to lighter foods you may not

554
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,080
even have to eat when the full moon

555
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,900
is around you'll notice your appetite is lower

556
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,440
and then you will find go ahead and

557
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,900
eat yourselves for one or two or three

558
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,660
or the light foods two or three days

559
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,260
and then you could start introducing the slightly

560
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,600
heavier foods and I like between the dark

561
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,820
moon and the light moon that week you'll

562
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,740
probably be doing 50-50 so introduce the

563
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:14,120
upcoming change keep the existing status but it's

564
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,540
a transition you know because the moon doesn't

565
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,960
do it abruptly it's gradual so get her

566
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,860
feeling it has a rhythm right the same

567
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,320
with the same with the daylight when the

568
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,960
Sun is up it's very expanded and when

569
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,700
the Sun is down at night it's everything's

570
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,780
very contracted it just doesn't it's not like

571
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,780
hitting a light switch on the wall you

572
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,840
know the Sun is going down you know

573
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,960
it's sunset you know it's early evening and

574
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,640
then you know it's midnight right right everything

575
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,740
so the transitions are to be smooth now

576
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,200
that depends on what finesse you have what

577
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,240
planning you have what abilities you have so

578
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,040
and the same thing with the daytime the

579
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,220
night is the most contractive it's so contractive

580
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:00,280
that it knocks you out usually right so

581
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,600
you fall asleep in other words right right

582
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,860
and and the the daytime the Sun is

583
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,960
so expensive that you want to be up

584
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,320
and you want to be out right it

585
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,200
really has oh it's the sunlight Greek you

586
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,980
know it's the light rays well no there's

587
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,400
a lot more than that because you could

588
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,120
have someone that is not exposed to the

589
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,340
light indoors and they're more active during you

590
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,580
know noon than they are at midnight by

591
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,220
the clock let's say right no matter what

592
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,920
your sleeping schedule is people that work at

593
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,480
night I have a rough time like people

594
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,080
that have a career to work at night

595
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,620
have a rough time after 10 or 15

596
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,440
years you know they have health issues or

597
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,480
whatever mental issues fatigue issues you know fitness

598
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,380
issues I meant say not health issues and

599
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,160
they have to be very careful and have

600
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,740
to restructure themselves because they stay up all

601
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,100
night let's say on a job right or

602
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,820
a job right yeah you know you know

603
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,120
I would explain I need to go there's

604
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,340
a job and then there's a job but

605
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:03,460
anyway there's there's a finesse personal for this

606
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:07,180
but here's the thing this should have been

607
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,740
in your culture and I'm pointing a finger

608
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,080
at your culture man right this should have

609
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,440
been already implanted just like you know you

610
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,460
know bacon and eggs for breakfast you know

611
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,940
and yeah for lunch and dinners meat and

612
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,460
potatoes you know how they have these cultural

613
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,080
things they put in your face right why

614
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,740
didn't they put anything benevolent or useful why

615
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,720
do they always put malevolent stuff and harmful

616
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,940
things yeah so now you're good you're living

617
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,500
in a world that pretty much all your

618
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,280
cultural stuff is malevolent not outwardly completely but

619
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,940
if you do it you'll be it's not

620
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,400
not good and no matter what it is

621
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,400
that's in your culture usually the Western culture

622
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,660
especially you're gonna have to it's not just

623
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,680
how do I do it with the light

624
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,200
moon or the dark moon it's actually a

625
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,280
cultural thing because not only do you have

626
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,520
to figure it out and finesse it but

627
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,780
the people around you also how do you

628
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:02,180
deal with them right right so this stuff

629
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,640
that I'm bringing just to preface again I've

630
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,400
said many years ago this stuff that I

631
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,680
talk about is not for this society it's

632
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,880
for the next society or let's say it

633
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,600
is not for this society but if you

634
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,740
want to know I'll share it but I'm

635
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,620
just telling you how screwed up things are

636
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,480
over here but I'm not just gonna say

637
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,140
things are screwed up yeah they are okay

638
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,080
next subject an eight-year-old can do

639
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,700
that true I'm saying it's screwed up and

640
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,840
this is this is why it's screwed up

641
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,660
and this is how you can do it

642
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:33,000
so it's not screwed up right that's what

643
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,440
I'm all about I've been doing that since

644
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,580
at a very young age people didn't like

645
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,480
that they would say Greek I ask you

646
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,960
for the time and you tell me how

647
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,380
to build a watch I don't want to

648
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:45,000
know you know so there's those they're not

649
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,280
skeptics or naysayers there's a difference between a

650
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,600
skeptic and a naysayer right yes so skeptic

651
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,140
entertains the information sorts it out sees its

652
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:56,000
validity naysayers is that you're not saying what

653
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,820
I'm used to you know I mean Jack

654
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:01,100
Fresco had an analogy about a normie and

655
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,660
someone who is not a normie if you

656
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,400
have a little here a little tiny flashlight

657
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,140
says a million lumens and you bring it

658
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:12,420
to an army right but if you take

659
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,580
it to someone who's rational I say a

660
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,060
million lumens in that size well how do

661
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,660
you power it how do you keep the

662
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,880
temperature down how did you figure out how

663
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,200
to do that you know you know he'll

664
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,960
ask logical questions right right so you're not

665
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,660
gonna run into people like that I don't

666
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,640
care if it's your spouse your children your

667
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,100
parents your people at work do not expect

668
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,700
them to react favorably if you're listening to

669
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,260
me for more than what do we call

670
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,620
episodes or you have an episodic trip here

671
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,300
I guess where you've been with me for

672
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,040
a while you know this or tell people

673
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,480
right yeah this is you're not in a

674
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,920
good place it doesn't mean you're not right

675
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,060
but you're not gonna have a you won't

676
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:54,260
have the best make the best possible like

677
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:57,820
when I used to travel often especially working

678
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,840
with the mines and doing the engineering and

679
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,800
stuff for them you're on the road you

680
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,700
eat like highway food right yeah and after

681
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,360
a while you know I still had a

682
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,100
little camping set where I could pull off

683
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,060
and I made rice and beans you know

684
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,840
wherever I stopped you were like God this

685
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,840
guy's cooking smells good and but if you

686
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,100
go to a McDonald's yeah right get a

687
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,820
fish sandwich in an apple pie and a

688
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:25,360
sprite right that's the best choice you can

689
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,240
make right so you got some how are

690
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,540
they gonna screw up the fish all right

691
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:31,080
they might spray some chemicals or whatever and

692
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,960
then you got an apple pie right instead

693
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,900
of the French fries right well I always

694
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,760
roll the dice on the fries because depending

695
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,280
on where you're at even though it's supposed

696
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:43,440
to be universal and they are all McDonald's

697
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,980
is dog food I recently had it about

698
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,340
six months ago and I said this is

699
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,660
dog food man they don't really care about

700
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,400
that now it's real bad but the French

701
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,940
fries used to be take a roll of

702
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,460
the dice because most places would be okay

703
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,600
but a lot of them screwed it up

704
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,580
and if you had a dog well they

705
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,140
would eat them anyways that's why I mean

706
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,400
it's dog food I mean when I say

707
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,080
dog food literally I just said I gave

708
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:13,740
it to my dogs they'll fight you for

709
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,120
it they'll take the fry and growl you

710
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,520
know they will they'll fight each other for

711
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,720
them they'll get mad at each other for

712
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,840
snapping them yeah I got another one now

713
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,940
this is a combination between two people and

714
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,440
I'm gonna put them together and kind of

715
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,240
bring this so so you guys know this

716
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,980
came from two different people I had an

717
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,180
experience one time where a young man who

718
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:35,220
was staying at our land got possessed by

719
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,900
something his voice changed he was talking nonsense

720
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,460
he was referring to us as stupid humans

721
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,900
it was a very creepy experience I moved

722
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,200
away because I was feeling a sinking sensation

723
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,900
in my stomach while being next to him

724
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,980
really creepy stuff half an hour later though

725
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:54,380
the guy was normal again now hold on

726
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:57,540
the other question that goes along with this

727
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:01,000
is short how do you know if you've

728
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,380
been cursed and how can you get rid

729
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,960
of it now I think this opens up

730
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,760
a whole wide subject for you if I

731
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,960
give you both I think he just met

732
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,140
possession is real okay with with the spiritual

733
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:14,200
entity or an entity messing with you have

734
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,240
influence which 99% of the people I've

735
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,560
ever met are influenced then you have a

736
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:22,480
oppressed we hear these mental disorders schizophrenia depression

737
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,280
whatever that's called a spiritual oppression then you

738
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,480
have the first two that I just mentioned

739
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,600
the people still retain their personality and name

740
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,280
and all that identity let's say self-professed

741
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,760
identity the third one is possession and that's

742
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,400
where they that's not them like if the

743
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,100
episode is for a day they don't remember

744
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,360
it if it's for an hour they don't

745
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,960
remember it that's possession possession is where your

746
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,160
spirit is replaced with another which is very

747
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,760
rare by the way and what this person

748
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,440
laid out sounds like that the third the

749
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,120
third you know third degree there and I

750
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,780
have no answer other than you know it

751
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:59,180
is what it is and curses can be

752
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:02,360
lifted by appealing to your higher power to

753
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,880
do that for you or having the person

754
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,100
who put the curse on you amend it

755
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,560
now that's what I know about it I

756
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,240
mean yeah and some people have brought up

757
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,940
you know like this what they used to

758
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,340
call split personality it's now described as a

759
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:21,140
dissociative identity disorder where literally there are different

760
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,560
personalities that seem to present themselves from the

761
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,000
same you know corpus if you will yeah

762
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,600
I wonder sometimes if this is not being

763
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,120
confused for exactly what this guy's describing sometimes

764
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,760
that's but I would rather here's the thing

765
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,260
this is not related I've been really I

766
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,120
don't endorse him but I've been hammering a

767
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,820
lot on look out for Charlie F look

768
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:49,500
out FA Charlie yeah because he's showing you

769
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,660
how it's in tech it's sound it's not

770
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:55,620
intangible let's say or spiritual it's just sound

771
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,640
and who's one thing he doesn't get into

772
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,740
is who's doing it he says it's humans

773
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,420
or whatever but yeah it's always been going

774
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:03,800
on always that we were subject to this

775
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,460
stuff there's stuff underground up in the sky

776
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:09,540
or whatever that they're beaming us with and

777
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,240
it hasn't stopped it's been around since the

778
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,220
beginning or whatever you want to believe the

779
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:17,220
beginning is and rather because that's tangible and

780
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:20,720
that makes it seem a little more pulp

781
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,880
pulp how would you say you can do

782
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,940
you can deal with it better because literally

783
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,740
if you put yourself in a soundproof environment

784
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:30,340
you might be away from it who knows

785
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:33,180
but then we could work backwards from lookout

786
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,880
for Charlie and go back to the spiritual

787
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,300
stuff there's a lot of stuff in the

788
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,720
biblical narrative about that even with curses by

789
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,500
the way there's a lot of stuff in

790
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,160
any I mean you want to go the

791
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,100
pagan route you want to go the eastern

792
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,760
route Western route is the worst you could

793
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,280
do I consider the biblical narrative Eastern by

794
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,120
the way it would be South West East

795
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,440
so in other words it would be Southwest

796
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,500
Asia is what I consider the biblical narrative

797
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,720
once you come over to Europe let's say

798
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,420
or whatever you know you could go to

799
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:08,340
old druid stuff see what they say but

800
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:11,160
stay away from what's called psychology those guys

801
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,880
are morons even yield when recently I put

802
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,160
on an audio book by by you'll see

803
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,420
but wrote a bunch of stuff and I

804
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,800
was like this guy's a moron no wonder

805
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,020
they they made him popular you know Freud

806
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,960
was even more of a moron like oh

807
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,980
my gosh you're really as I'm getting older

808
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:28,760
I'd argue with you that's a race between

809
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,000
the two of them as to which one

810
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,500
is King moron because I mean it's yeah

811
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,540
yeah and the people just adore likely Einstein

812
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,760
is another one right I said wrote really

813
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,460
good personal letters I had a book personal

814
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,920
letters of Einstein that he sent to people

815
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,520
and stuff he had a pretty good mind

816
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:46,180
in a for communicating you know various things

817
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,900
but the way they put him up is

818
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,300
doing this who's plagiarized but anyway yeah you're

819
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,440
pretty much stuck and also by the way

820
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,720
people that are confused or not all the

821
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,880
classics they told us to read in elementary

822
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,140
school in high school that's all garbage most

823
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:04,120
if you read Emerson and O'Mellville and Mark

824
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,020
Twain you know all these guys they're idiots

825
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,640
they're not good writers I recently I picked

826
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,320
up Samuel Clemens book margins this is so

827
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,540
poorly written it can't be by him yes

828
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,200
it is oh my gosh we were so

829
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,960
hyped up told that this stuff we should

830
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,900
read they made us read garbage and yeah

831
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,280
so what do you read then well you

832
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,300
still have to read it because when you

833
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,300
come across something good you know what good

834
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:29,340
is right oh so yeah I was bored

835
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,300
to death by that book the the pearl

836
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,260
or whatever it was who wrote that was

837
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:36,840
that the Simpers are at the girth also

838
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,700
wasn't it a Steinbeck maybe it was another

839
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:43,040
idiot oh my gosh oh but by the

840
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,760
way I want to bring up to something

841
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,520
I was mentioning to someone these Ivy League

842
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,420
colleges you could look this up we're started

843
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,880
back in the 1600s or whatever 300 years

844
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,780
ago 250 years ago 180 years ago my

845
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:58,760
families who became mega wealthy during the opium

846
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,220
trade and they wanted to keep that going

847
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,460
so they said you know people might see

848
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,140
what this this does to people when they

849
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,659
use it habitually and they might come after

850
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:09,679
us so we need to make a cultural

851
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,620
change why don't we make these colleges and

852
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:14,520
start changing the culture their point of view

853
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,239
and the narrative about what we're doing right

854
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:19,920
and he could put out the rest so

855
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,920
you had a bunch of rich scumbags that

856
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:25,360
basically drug dealers that opened all these Ivy

857
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,320
Leagues and they're still do you right so

858
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,480
this is where this is when I say

859
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,659
you're in a bad place it's not because

860
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:35,500
who's a president who's who's the current occupant

861
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,800
of the White House or whatever pedophile you

862
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,219
have in the parliaments wherever you are or

863
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:44,380
whatever no it's always been this way since

864
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:47,380
ancient times and there were city-states and

865
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,179
groups back in ancient times that wanted to

866
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:51,400
fight to clear the air you know and

867
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,820
they always failed you know it's this is

868
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:57,000
a scumbag planet or realm whatever you want

869
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,620
to call it make the best out of

870
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,020
it just like when you go to McDonald's

871
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,780
don't order the greasy stuff or try to

872
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:05,460
make up the best decision or hold hold

873
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:08,000
out part of the thing about holding out

874
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,080
here is just focus on food clothing shelter

875
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,240
you know I'm not saying do what I

876
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,140
do I constantly remind myself look I was

877
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,660
sent here by accident right so I'm not

878
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:19,080
gonna act like I belong here right no

879
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,780
way in other words when it's cold I

880
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,300
just want to be warm when it's hot

881
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,860
I want to be cool when it's raining

882
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,040
I want to be dry if it's too

883
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,020
dry I need some moisture if I'm if

884
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,280
my belly's making noise and I need nutrition

885
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,500
I'd like some right that's it you know

886
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,380
if I don't want to be wearing rags

887
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:41,140
and tatters right I don't want it right

888
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,240
so but I really don't want anything here

889
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,060
it's the absolute minimum but if you're gonna

890
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,580
do the absolute minimum do it really well

891
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,700
do it really well so you know that

892
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,660
balances everything out and then you could point

893
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:55,740
the finger and say hey you know better

894
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,640
than that or you don't care or whatever

895
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:01,020
and you'll always be in the right fair

896
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,160
enough so uh what do you think I'm

897
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,240
changing this question a little bit because I

898
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,400
think they mean to ask you what do

899
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,380
you think about this substance they call beyond

900
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:12,980
meat like the vegan thing because okay okay

901
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:15,380
that because that's been I it's going away

902
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:18,780
thankfully yes it's it's really an unclean food

903
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,560
from a spiritual point of view what they're

904
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,200
doing is growing hemoglobin they're going blood in

905
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,080
a laboratory using algae that mimics that and

906
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,420
they're putting they're making this vegetarian blood it's

907
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,720
no longer vegetarian if you're making blood right

908
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:37,280
right so it's really a bad cocktail the

909
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,900
level of gmo and preservatives that are in

910
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,040
there is it's toxic you'll probably well there's

911
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,560
that but they want to know your liver

912
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,080
and kidneys with it yeah they want to

913
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,960
know if there's any human elements in it

914
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,140
like if it's uh yet another like sort

915
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:53,160
of cloaked cannibalism yeah they they could do

916
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,380
that just like I wouldn't be surprised if

917
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,280
they're using the cloning technology which has been

918
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,940
around since the 30s by the way yeah

919
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:01,080
the biggest problem with the clones was by

920
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,260
the 1950s they had them walking around but

921
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,080
they didn't have them in public because the

922
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:08,160
whites of their eyes were brown that's why

923
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,880
you hear the black eyed children and all

924
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,720
that that's they're not from outer space but

925
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,900
anyway true um no they're horrible uh horrible

926
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,920
people uh uh doing all this stuff and

927
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,800
I think those that support them are horrible

928
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,700
also um and eat a piece of meat

929
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,740
like for example right now it's dark moon

930
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,680
time and it's like well I'll roast a

931
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,480
chicken I'll do it uh I call it

932
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,140
the one two three one two three chicken

933
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:35,680
I get an organic chicken uh scotch babbit

934
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,340
or babscotch I forgot which one you cut

935
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,080
this cut it right down the spine yet

936
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,740
most people can't do that they don't have

937
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,800
the a sharp knife but you could use

938
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,780
a butcher a strong scissor also and make

939
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,920
sure that when you do that with a

940
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,720
chicken right about an inch or so above

941
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,680
where the pope's nose is the tail of

942
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,080
the chicken stick your thumb in there where

943
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,640
the kidneys are right by the spine and

944
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,280
you'll see a kidney pop out you can't

945
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,380
see it when the carcass is open but

946
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,800
stick your finger and you you want to

947
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,240
get all the organ meat out because organ

948
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,520
meat doesn't have a good flavor most people

949
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,660
don't know how to do that that's why

950
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,860
I can't eat chicken up because it's not

951
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,980
clean they don't know how to clean them

952
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:10,080
then what you do is you you blend

953
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,540
liquefy that this is why I call it

954
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,520
one two three water uh uh with a

955
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,740
mixture heavy salt like a brine very salty

956
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,540
not as salty as the ocean but really

957
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:23,060
salty with garlic and ginger if you don't

958
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,860
have fresh garlic or ginger you could use

959
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,220
a powder of each quite a bit of

960
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:29,480
it uh cover the chicken in a bowl

961
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,060
or a pot put a plate on it

962
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,540
with a weight or whatever three hours that's

963
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,360
okay and that's why I call it the

964
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,940
one two three one two three because the

965
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,920
brine is made of salt ginger and garlic

966
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,020
one two three and it's one two three

967
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,140
hours in other words one two three hour

968
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:47,840
brining marinate then you take the chicken and

969
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,820
you hang it up if you can't hang

970
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:51,880
it up outside put it in a colander

971
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,080
you know the one you use to drain

972
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,760
your pasta whatever and put you know a

973
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,740
towel or something over it and then you

974
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,100
got to wait for at least two or

975
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,140
three hours again for it to drip dry

976
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,440
you want the skin to be dry to

977
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,520
the touch almost to the where it looks

978
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,640
like it's sunburned on its own I hang

979
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,780
it up in 100 degree weather in 20

980
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,880
minutes the skin is crispy just hanging in

981
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,400
the sun and then we put it in

982
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,080
a 700 degree mesquite oven for about 20

983
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,620
minutes 25 minutes 30 minutes it's completely done

984
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:24,200
rested not an hour or whatever and and

985
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,540
it's it's delicious and okay when we did

986
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,980
this yesterday we do this in the middle

987
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,400
of the month typically let's say and it's

988
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:36,420
the dark moon it's just chicken so two

989
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,600
people sitting down ready to eat we got

990
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:42,180
lime and juice you know whatever just chicken

991
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:46,320
dig in chicken good you know it's just

992
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,020
chicken that's it no sides no salad no

993
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:52,040
you know yesterday we had a kimchi cucumber

994
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:55,420
side some kimchi from Trader Joe's and I

995
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:58,140
sliced some cucumbers with rice vinegar and sugar

996
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,620
and put that around the kimchi and I

997
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,680
did make rice but the majority of the

998
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,120
meal is just chicken typically when we do

999
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,340
this broiled chicken in the middle of the

1000
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,060
month it's just chicken we just sit down

1001
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:11,600
just chicken and a beer some wine or

1002
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,060
whatever just like you know when you have

1003
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,720
meat in the middle of the month don't

1004
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,280
worry about the sides you must have a

1005
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,720
condiment though to make it digestible in this

1006
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,500
case it's the kimchi and the lime right

1007
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,180
now quick question you know I appreciate all

1008
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,920
kinds of cucumbers but do you have a

1009
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,100
particular favorite or one that you would savor

1010
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,360
the standard I used to grow the Armenian

1011
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,400
ones which are like the skinless they look

1012
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,040
like they don't have a skin oh those

1013
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,060
are weird yeah yeah okay yeah they're really

1014
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,980
they grow really large you know cucumbers you

1015
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,040
don't want them growing too large because then

1016
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,800
they get air pockets where the seeds are

1017
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,840
they're not as flavorful as cucumbers are in

1018
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,040
the melon family yeah by the way so

1019
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,080
look at whatever is good for melons is

1020
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,900
good for cucumbers you know if you someone

1021
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,440
cuts a cantaloupe in a room and you

1022
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,300
walk in you can smell it someone cuts

1023
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,740
a cucumber in a room it smells just

1024
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,240
like a melon but it's not you know

1025
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,720
a cantaloupe it's a different right right just

1026
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,320
like onion and garlic you know if you're

1027
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,280
processing onion and garlic in the kitchen you

1028
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,040
know it's like one of those one of

1029
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,460
those right so yeah so it's a melon

1030
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,720
so consider that it should be eaten very

1031
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,180
sparingly should be treated because remember melons either

1032
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,840
eat it alone or leave it alone cucumber

1033
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,520
tends to be one of the exceptions that

1034
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,860
can be eaten in a salad and with

1035
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,720
foods with other things but always in minimal

1036
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,600
that's why when they when they you know

1037
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,620
when they serve burgers with a pickle that's

1038
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,300
a cucumber but no one ever asked for

1039
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,240
do you want a cucumber with your hamburger

1040
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,280
like hell no give me a pickle because

1041
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,460
it's changed because it's it's cured now it's

1042
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:34,200
a completely different animal just like whole milk

1043
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,920
and parmesan cheese is not the same thing

1044
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,620
it's completely different you know you can't even

1045
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:43,920
consider parmesan to be dairy anymore literally it's

1046
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,520
completely different just like that heavily processed cucumber

1047
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,020
sauce that they put on a lot of

1048
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,800
greek wraps is uh is is pretty good

1049
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,000
but it's because yeah but it's been processed

1050
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,140
with garlic and salt and pepper so it's

1051
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,580
and it's minimal yeah right it's called tzatziki

1052
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,940
yeah uh and they don't really make it

1053
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:02,500
anymore because it's gotten popular so they yeah

1054
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,980
it's mixed with mayo and all kinds of

1055
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,340
but it is good it is good it's

1056
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,520
uh there's also an there's an indian one

1057
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,180
similar with a very watery yogurt sauce some

1058
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,360
carrot and fennel but i just gave you

1059
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,840
the rest of that for people you want

1060
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,660
to dry your meat before you cook it

1061
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:19,080
doesn't matter what it is because when you

1062
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,560
put it in the flame if it has

1063
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,020
any water on it any moisture it will

1064
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:26,340
not go above 220 or 212 degrees until

1065
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:28,580
that moisture is gone so you're literally steaming

1066
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:31,360
the meat that you want a nice roast

1067
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,840
on right because i remember mostly white people

1068
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,180
when i tell them dry the meat or

1069
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,760
if it's a turkey a chicken a steak

1070
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,440
hang it up so it's dry to the

1071
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,600
touch when you touch it there is no

1072
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,880
moisture it's actually dry like a potato would

1073
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,420
be dry right or you know and they're

1074
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,160
like i want my meat to be moist

1075
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,300
i don't want oh my gosh they don't

1076
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,200
understand because when the meat is wet when

1077
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,380
you put it in the fire it will

1078
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,600
be dry when you're done because you're boiling

1079
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,640
it you're not roasting it or broasting it

1080
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,780
so uh the same goes with veggies if

1081
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,620
you're going to uh want to get a

1082
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,180
nice color i do like what i call

1083
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:05,820
a veggie roast with various sliced vegetables and

1084
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,460
uh i put a little salt on them

1085
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,680
and i put them in a colander to

1086
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,920
air dry so when they hit the pan

1087
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:14,500
and the pan is at 350 400 guess

1088
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:17,220
what the vegetable goes to 400 right away

1089
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:20,620
it gets a beautiful golden caramelization if the

1090
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:23,960
vegetables are wet they you know you can

1091
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,480
have a hot pan with one drop of

1092
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,360
water in it and it will not go

1093
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:30,100
above 200 degrees or 220 until that drop

1094
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,320
of water is gone it's a phenomenal thing

1095
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:35,640
about water also so learn how to dry

1096
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,880
your food if you want to roast broast

1097
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,880
saute years ago that's why when they did

1098
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,160
a roast in the oven you know uh

1099
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,120
you you rubbed butter or oil on it

1100
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:49,140
on the surface right yep so it wasn't

1101
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,920
water that was that hit the meat met

1102
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,620
the heat it was butter or oil to

1103
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:55,400
get that uh and when i cook these

1104
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,920
the stuff out on the mesquite grill there's

1105
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,500
nothing dripping on the grill there's it doesn't

1106
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,220
need maybe one drop of liquid you see

1107
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:05,280
white people grilling and the chicken is running

1108
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,060
all the juices are going into the fire

1109
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:08,840
everything's catching fire i'm like oh my gosh

1110
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,860
you're not doing that because if you're grilling

1111
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:15,100
properly nothing you don't have any drippings coming

1112
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,240
out of it so if you're used to

1113
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,120
grilling or roasting and drippings coming out you're

1114
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,940
not doing it right or i wouldn't say

1115
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:22,420
you're doing it wrong but you're definitely not

1116
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:24,000
doing it right you know if it's edible

1117
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,160
it's not wrong uh so
