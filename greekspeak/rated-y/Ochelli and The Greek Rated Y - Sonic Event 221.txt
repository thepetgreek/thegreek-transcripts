Ah, Rated Y, 2-2-1, that's the sonic event number, and anyhow, Greek, how are you on this fine, what is it, Saturday, or whatever? Fine day, yeah, what they call Saturday, I was having a conversation with someone recently, and the more you use presumptive terms, the more accurate you are, you know, like what they call Monday, I remember once calling someone a minor, and I said, I'll be there what they call Friday, what do you mean what they call Friday, Friday is Friday, right, and so when you do stuff like that, you get a reaction, you see if they're listening, where they're at, you learn a lot about people, but by the way, my thing about learning about people is not asking questions, but like recently, about four times this past week, because I'm trying to expand into luxury business, and I don't want to be the one that does anything really, I want to be the driving force behind it, right, so whoever deals with whoever develops their own rapport, because all the businesses I did before, people would call, you know, someone answer is the Greek there? No, he'll be in tomorrow. All right. I'll call tomorrow.

Wait, what can I do for you? No, no, no, no, I don't want to talk to you. I want to talk to him. Right? No, no, no, I don't want to do that.

Right. So I've been, and it's really hard to get a feeling of what someone is about on a basic conversation, but you can't by using how the term they use, but you can't condemn them for it, because words are one of the easiest things to be changed, right? So yeah, you can change that in an instant, really, once, let's say someone becomes aware, you know, I've made people aware of lawful timekeeping, real timekeeping, and most people don't care but those that do it just kind of like oh my gosh I got it no more I got to do this you know you know I got a really deadly right so by the way who I'm looking for to work with me on the various things with the scalerator is when they see it get the idea oh I'm gonna quit my job I'm gonna leave my wife leave my husband I'm gonna quit my job this is what I want to do that's I feel it okay great great great one thing you are getting some electronic interference so watch whatever it is you're going near yeah it's like actually actually not much actually I just I held up a metal device maybe that will do it near the phone so anyway so this is one of the things I do for character you know I think I went over a job interview a job interview right yeah sorting out coins and you learn a lot that way from people also especially when they walk in they drop their resume and tell them to sit down on this table and sort out coins like oh I'm not gonna do that I'm out of here my favorite my very favorite little test of your you know let's see if anybody's listening to what the hell is being said was a phone message you had for a little bit where yeah you called a certain number this message sounded very much like the usual numbers you get this numbers been disconnected but that's not what the message said that's it's a lady's voice which I'd always used to be I don't know what it is anymore but you know you get a lady's voice that used to tell you this number has been disconnected anyway it sounded just like that except the lady says you've reached the number that you dialed if you believe you reached it or hang up and dial it again yeah and people kept hanging up and redialing basically it says you have reached the number that you have just dialed it's an English accent you have reached the number that you have just dialed if you believe you dialed in an error hang up and dial it again and people and so I see someone hang up a delegate I'm like oh this never never spoken before a referral or whatever oh this guy's not paying attention so what do I do should I fuck with him you know I mean mess with him a little bit I mean or they're easy to mess with or to educate him or what I'm just gonna watch this character yeah so most people fail most people fail tests especially with criticism I recently spoke to someone oh it's hilarious oh it was hilarious oh because you gave me the the number I called it and then hooked back up with you and I said that's the weirdest thing it says I reached it's a psych test it's a psyop it's an operation to psychologically look at a distance you can only spiritually or psychologically it's the same thing filter yeah of course right that's the only way you can do it but when we meet in person I'm listening about criticism if you give criticism you can't just say it sucks and stop a five-year-old can do that right you should prepare when you give criticism say what's wrong with it and the to fix it so you get three parts to a criticism I've spoke to someone recently said oh this sucks I'm like okay how do you fix it looks they were silent I'm like okay this person's eight years old so you know basically it doesn't matter how old they are but they stopped at around eight or nine you know their function yeah so it's kind of like you know I had an old member of the early 2000s computers you try to update them and it took like all night and then you're like then you're like hit fuck it cancel just hit the cancel button no more but then it would still be there but not do you want to finish downloading it no yes yeah so it's dumb stuff so I like the computer analogy because it's supposed to be the mental mental machine right there you go a mental machine well they tell you the brain is the body's computer or you know yeah they always try and do that sort of yeah so essentially what I do now it's sort of the coin thing for an interview as I hand someone a camera and there's something in the room I say take a picture of that object for me would you and then when you think you've got a good picture you can take as many as like just present me with one right and when they show me the picture I'm like it'll be a flower with a vase and the lights coming through the window and they show me the picture and I'm like what's that big black thing right there and that's the first thing I see and I'm like oh that's the shadow I'm like you know that because you're in the room but if you show this picture someone's gonna wonder what that big black blob is right there first thing you see right so you know the first thing you see second thing you see so I learn a lot about people by having them take a photo and by the way I have still to meet anyone who can take photos up to where the photo is well communicating right still I haven't seen anyone coaching I coach people on it years ago there was a photographer I'm not gonna mention his name Chris Gimarae he used to photograph for Buick General Motors and we go to the football games giant stadium and anyway he hired me says I want you to work in my studio I was like but I don't know anything about photography and he says you'll do great you're smart I'm like what what did he just say yeah so anyway so I'm trying to focus where you know the games are going right so I'm trying to focus and take a shot focus take a shot he grabs the camera he grabs my camera and two cameras he holds him three feet ahead of him he goes pop up up up up up up up up up up up up up unloads them it says take the film out new film I'm like holy shit you know so we put it we went through 40 rolls of film and then what you do you develop everything because I was used to like everybody line up say cheese okay right you know that's not how you do photography it's all about timing you take hundreds or thousands of pictures to find one it's all about timing and it's not timing that you create it's a timing universe that whatever happens right you know how that developed in the photographic industry that sort of attitude which was correct where they just threw a net and hope they captured the great image is because two different photographers captured Lee Harvey Oswald getting shot in the gut by Jack Ruby and yeah I've seen that and it's that action shot yeah and one of them got the Pulitzer and the other one got nothing and it was just a very slight deviation in the photograph but it was like hell this is like a split-second difference in the photograph and one worked one didn't because one conveyed the actual incident and the other did not and it was like a baffling thing it is 1963 folks that this is when that changed and photography is like that though yeah you know that's why people and the worst thing it's like you know I was talking to someone so you know who really about financial business on it so that's really messed up I didn't know that so you know don't blame the government or the schools it's your parents that screwed you up they're the ones that made you stand around on holidays says cheese for photo they have no idea what's going on it's your parents so if you're gonna blame anyone it's your parents that messed you up I don't care how you think they good parents they were I could show you there was pretty shitty 500 different ways and I'm not saying go everybody go after their parents no but you have to put them in their proper perspective ones that messed you up yeah but they may have indeed done with the best intent they could and everything else with their heart doesn't matter it doesn't matter but the fact is they did the best they could but don't forget they were screwed up by their parents so yeah and so and so so that's why people harkin on the halcyon days I think we're better well if they were so much better than they wouldn't have allowed it they would have put guidelines and enforced you know guidelines so we wouldn't be where we are to people we're actually better today believe it or not there goes that electronic jump again whatever is in common with the last time I said it you're doing it okay you know by the way this whole time you have a major echo but I've learned how to deal with that so if you have something like that I can't really pick it up but I sound pretty clear and you do pick up a distortion every so often is what you're saying no no no it's not just a distortion though it's literally like I can hear a break in the interference yeah it's it's a different thing I'm talking about a little distortion I could even factor out I wonder if it's the whirlygig stay away from it whirlygig anyway for those that did the weather yes webinar know what that is so it's amazing how completely passive device I've had several people say do you know the weather devices mess up a compass I'm like yeah is that cool so and there's nothing you know right electronic or magnets or anything so well because it doesn't generate an electromagnetic field it guides them so it actually messes with the field that makes electric magnetic fields it's a yeah so by the electric magnetic fields of perturbation and the static it's so funny when you talk about the ether you know how it let me just go over this I don't want to get in something you know this thing is with a motor you see it our construction sites emergencies and what is that say it's an electrical generator right it's a generator it generates electricity no it doesn't generators right it does not generate any more electricity than a water pump generates water go out and buy a water pump leave it in the box just plug it in you expect water to start coming out of it no no you have to connect it in water pump is designed to take something that is static static keyword yes and and depending on the design of the pump to give it a certain pressure and rate of flow it's exactly what a winding and a generator does and or the commutator however you want to do it a magnet and a coil let's say it's a simple one you can use as many different ways to do it when you start rotating rotating that it takes the static body of electricity and then starts magnetically pressurizing it just like the pump with the impeller pressurizes the water and it make that magnetic repressurized ether or static electricity likes to run along metallic what we call conductors and that's what electricity is has nothing to do with electrons I've talked about it for years I've done experiments with my very powerful microscopes where I have a high current high voltage wire and I have heavy rubber gloves and I cut the wire and I pointed towards the ground and I come back with the microscope looking for the electrons to scoop them up right right of course yeah that's how you make fun of these or maybe more and they're moronic the scientific people so anyway yeah all these things it's like no one is paying attention it seems like only like the 15 subs that we have do though when you go out into the world and you see what's going on it's a miracle you know I was speaking to an engineer I said how many tens of millions of people drive a car you know operate you know machinery like that like oh you know where they could put themselves in something that looks like a projectile that's going down across the surface of the earth at 50 or 70 miles an hour right that's what I mean by that right a lot millions like tens of millions maybe more no one really knows but it's it's tens of millions okay but if you talk to these people and see where they're mentally at and their perception what they know what they perceive it's a miracle any of them return home alive it's a miracle right there should be like you know millions of fatalities every day just from putting ones in itself in a heavy metal object and projecting it at high speed across the surface of the earth you know known as a car or whatever well they're based on their mental state they should be half of them should not be coming back alive but they do well there are there are tens of thousands of accidents every day anyway so I mean I'm talking about like terminations you know yeah I mean so there's something that's got like autopilot that's protecting people keeping them going like someone working at a quote-unquote job they hate it they're there for 25 30 years they hate it the whole time yeah and they're and they get their retirement and then they hate the retirement because they got nothing to do you know it's but if at any point at that in their lives if you tell them to break away from this all you need is food clothing shelter they don't want to hear it at all but they'd rather be so they're like this is autopilot protection kind of thing where people normal normal and above normal people are begging begging they're begging and asking to be messed with guess what that's why they are you ever heard of something called a government agency you ever you ever you heard of something called a you know a large corporation you ever heard of a critter called an attorney you ever a critter called medical doctor those are all there to mess with you because the state that you're in you're in a stupor so this is the majority of the people yes your parents are like that too here's the thing and I got a thing for parents so could they got to stop messing I'm messing up their children I'm really big when a child is born to be taken away from the parents and raised in a situation kind of like what the dictators did in Thailand and Soviet whatever they take the children away and they raise them so they're raised according to the narrative right right and the narrative here would be perception reality real science real medicine real education real language all this stuff and here's the thing people you know I used to say you know law like who decides what's wrong and right I say you do it has to be voluntary you decide what's wrong and right all right so all this stuff so anyway but one thing that I have an itch on parents is you always hear oh it's like how mom used to make it tastes real good it's like my mom used to make and I'm like oh I don't want that I have never been to anyone's house whose mom was even remotely a good cook or grandma so you notice they stopped doing those ads years ago in the 70s as I was five just like mom used to make right oh my gosh terrible terrible food I have never been to anyone's house actually it's not true there was a I remember a Japanese family that invited me over it was food was very good and a Persian family okay the food was very good but there was only two occasions where it was a family invite the food was actually palatable so when I started documenting all these events and what people say what they say and think has nothing to do with what's really going on that's what I mean take the children away so what they say and think has is tangible to reality right like for example I'm studying the economic stuff and you know mortgages are considered intent and car loans and bank loans are considered intangible debts because the bank never let you anything it's actually in the paperwork intangible means what you can't see it you can't smell it you can't touch it right it's something for you to touch tastes yeah it's intangible so yeah it's it's amazing the stupidity so smart question because you know somebody who is not just looking to be on autopilot asked a question in the chat and we'll start there when do you switch from new moon eating to more full moon light question mark is this still new moon time for heavier and baked items question just curious thanks that's the full question there and what they're asking is because you've talked about this before the timing in which you eat if you are pay attention to your you know lawful timekeeping you will notice there is a difference of things there are different cycles or different portions of the cycle of the moon so yeah go ahead don't take it so narrow though let me just first make an adjustment to the question let's call it dark moon full moon okay dark and all the ancient texts the new moon is the full moon right in the Bible if you'd say I think it's Psalms 81 the new moon is the full moon should in the book of Enoch the new moon is the full moon well you'd figure that if something is brand new it's still in one piece none of it has been sliced away none of it is hidden whatever you want to say so therefore that makes the most sense doesn't it I've heard pretty strong arguments against it because it's gone and then it's back you know when the moon is dark and the sliver comes back that's a new moon so both argue so let's just call it what it looks like a dark moon and a full moon right yeah but that's a sliver of the moon as opposed to the moon so I would argue yeah it's just for communication it's it's better that way because when you say it doesn't matter either way as long as you know what you're talking about right the reference for in terms of time here okay so let's put the moon aside the reason I brought that up is because it's a predominant condition in your environment give you an example you must always give you a way to think about it it's always take consider consideration the predominant forces in your environment okay so what would be the predominant force would be seasonality so when it's winter winter yes that winter season takes predominance over day and night and the moon because it's predominant then the next thing most likely would be the moon and then this and then the sun because you see the moon changes very gradually but the Sun changes twice a day right right so right and and then there's in between things like people who are prone to being seasick or sick in an airplane yeah that being on that ship or be airship or naval ship or whatever you are that is now the predominant influence in your environment for you right being in an office cubicle with fluorescent lights on eight hours a day that might take predominance right messing you up right so you have to decide especially again I mentioned how dumb people are most people don't even look up they don't even know what what you know they just know it's light or dark out they don't know the positions of the Sun what it means they don't know what the moon means at all just like zero full moon people go crazy right so yeah so it's not really about the moon it's about assessing the predominant influence in your environment right like the best example I could give for the predominant influence of your environment that is very personal would be being seasick okay when you get seasick you don't care what position the moon is if it's day or night man you're see that ship just rocked you you got rocked right I get so I get carsick I don't give a damn about anything about being familiar with emotion helps by the way so so here's the thing tell her that but anyway what I would suggest is let's stick to the question in the moon so the full moon is the most expansive okay and the dark moon the new moon here in the question is the most contractive so you want to be whenever you have a predominant influence on your environment you want to be in sync with it so back to the being seasick the reason you get seasick is because you're not paying attention to the motion of the boat if you know you're prone to seasickness pay attention to the motion of the boat don't just fix yourself on the waves or don't fix yourself on the boat you have to look at how the boat is moving contrary to the waves and all that get her get that rhythm going in your mind even if it's not smooth and you usually don't get seasick you see what I mean okay so pay attention to how that goes so same with the moon so when the moon is full or approaching full becomes fall and then just after it was full that's when everything is the most expansive on that influence so you want to have foods that are expansive so it would be salads light foods not heavily cooked maybe more sweets than usual not don't go for sweets but you know save you know you want you craving blueberry muffins save it for that week right something sweet or whatever pancakes or whatever okay so now as the as the moon starts to contract and go towards what's called the new moon or the dark moon that's most contractive so that's when you would have a little more salt that's when you would eat have your meats let's say something more baked that's when you have your beef stews your barbecues blah blah blah blah blah okay and then and you focus so you know a few days the rule of thumb for me is three days before three days after so if you start transitioning into the moon three days before and then it happens whether it's full or dark and then three days after and then you have like a neutral point which is still a transition point so let's say you the you know the new the full moons be coming in three days you start transitioning to lighter foods you may not even have to eat when the full moon is around you'll notice your appetite is lower and then you will find go ahead and eat yourselves for one or two or three or the light foods two or three days and then you could start introducing the slightly heavier foods and I like between the dark moon and the light moon that week you'll probably be doing 50-50 so introduce the upcoming change keep the existing status but it's a transition you know because the moon doesn't do it abruptly it's gradual so get her feeling it has a rhythm right the same with the same with the daylight when the Sun is up it's very expanded and when the Sun is down at night it's everything's very contracted it just doesn't it's not like hitting a light switch on the wall you know the Sun is going down you know it's sunset you know it's early evening and then you know it's midnight right right everything so the transitions are to be smooth now that depends on what finesse you have what planning you have what abilities you have so and the same thing with the daytime the night is the most contractive it's so contractive that it knocks you out usually right so you fall asleep in other words right right and and the the daytime the Sun is so expensive that you want to be up and you want to be out right it really has oh it's the sunlight Greek you know it's the light rays well no there's a lot more than that because you could have someone that is not exposed to the light indoors and they're more active during you know noon than they are at midnight by the clock let's say right no matter what your sleeping schedule is people that work at night I have a rough time like people that have a career to work at night have a rough time after 10 or 15 years you know they have health issues or whatever mental issues fatigue issues you know fitness issues I meant say not health issues and they have to be very careful and have to restructure themselves because they stay up all night let's say on a job right or a job right yeah you know you know I would explain I need to go there's a job and then there's a job but anyway there's there's a finesse personal for this but here's the thing this should have been in your culture and I'm pointing a finger at your culture man right this should have been already implanted just like you know you know bacon and eggs for breakfast you know and yeah for lunch and dinners meat and potatoes you know how they have these cultural things they put in your face right why didn't they put anything benevolent or useful why do they always put malevolent stuff and harmful things yeah so now you're good you're living in a world that pretty much all your cultural stuff is malevolent not outwardly completely but if you do it you'll be it's not not good and no matter what it is that's in your culture usually the Western culture especially you're gonna have to it's not just how do I do it with the light moon or the dark moon it's actually a cultural thing because not only do you have to figure it out and finesse it but the people around you also how do you deal with them right right so this stuff that I'm bringing just to preface again I've said many years ago this stuff that I talk about is not for this society it's for the next society or let's say it is not for this society but if you want to know I'll share it but I'm just telling you how screwed up things are over here but I'm not just gonna say things are screwed up yeah they are okay next subject an eight-year-old can do that true I'm saying it's screwed up and this is this is why it's screwed up and this is how you can do it so it's not screwed up right that's what I'm all about I've been doing that since at a very young age people didn't like that they would say Greek I ask you for the time and you tell me how to build a watch I don't want to know you know so there's those they're not skeptics or naysayers there's a difference between a skeptic and a naysayer right yes so skeptic entertains the information sorts it out sees its validity naysayers is that you're not saying what I'm used to you know I mean Jack Fresco had an analogy about a normie and someone who is not a normie if you have a little here a little tiny flashlight says a million lumens and you bring it to an army right but if you take it to someone who's rational I say a million lumens in that size well how do you power it how do you keep the temperature down how did you figure out how to do that you know you know he'll ask logical questions right right so you're not gonna run into people like that I don't care if it's your spouse your children your parents your people at work do not expect them to react favorably if you're listening to me for more than what do we call episodes or you have an episodic trip here I guess where you've been with me for a while you know this or tell people right yeah this is you're not in a good place it doesn't mean you're not right but you're not gonna have a you won't have the best make the best possible like when I used to travel often especially working with the mines and doing the engineering and stuff for them you're on the road you eat like highway food right yeah and after a while you know I still had a little camping set where I could pull off and I made rice and beans you know wherever I stopped you were like God this guy's cooking smells good and but if you go to a McDonald's yeah right get a fish sandwich in an apple pie and a sprite right that's the best choice you can make right so you got some how are they gonna screw up the fish all right they might spray some chemicals or whatever and then you got an apple pie right instead of the French fries right well I always roll the dice on the fries because depending on where you're at even though it's supposed to be universal and they are all McDonald's is dog food I recently had it about six months ago and I said this is dog food man they don't really care about that now it's real bad but the French fries used to be take a roll of the dice because most places would be okay but a lot of them screwed it up and if you had a dog well they would eat them anyways that's why I mean it's dog food I mean when I say dog food literally I just said I gave it to my dogs they'll fight you for it they'll take the fry and growl you know they will they'll fight each other for them they'll get mad at each other for snapping them yeah I got another one now this is a combination between two people and I'm gonna put them together and kind of bring this so so you guys know this came from two different people I had an experience one time where a young man who was staying at our land got possessed by something his voice changed he was talking nonsense he was referring to us as stupid humans it was a very creepy experience I moved away because I was feeling a sinking sensation in my stomach while being next to him really creepy stuff half an hour later though the guy was normal again now hold on the other question that goes along with this is short how do you know if you've been cursed and how can you get rid of it now I think this opens up a whole wide subject for you if I give you both I think he just met possession is real okay with with the spiritual entity or an entity messing with you have influence which 99% of the people I've ever met are influenced then you have a oppressed we hear these mental disorders schizophrenia depression whatever that's called a spiritual oppression then you have the first two that I just mentioned the people still retain their personality and name and all that identity let's say self-professed identity the third one is possession and that's where they that's not them like if the episode is for a day they don't remember it if it's for an hour they don't remember it that's possession possession is where your spirit is replaced with another which is very rare by the way and what this person laid out sounds like that the third the third you know third degree there and I have no answer other than you know it is what it is and curses can be lifted by appealing to your higher power to do that for you or having the person who put the curse on you amend it now that's what I know about it I mean yeah and some people have brought up you know like this what they used to call split personality it's now described as a dissociative identity disorder where literally there are different personalities that seem to present themselves from the same you know corpus if you will yeah I wonder sometimes if this is not being confused for exactly what this guy's describing sometimes that's but I would rather here's the thing this is not related I've been really I don't endorse him but I've been hammering a lot on look out for Charlie F look out FA Charlie yeah because he's showing you how it's in tech it's sound it's not intangible let's say or spiritual it's just sound and who's one thing he doesn't get into is who's doing it he says it's humans or whatever but yeah it's always been going on always that we were subject to this stuff there's stuff underground up in the sky or whatever that they're beaming us with and it hasn't stopped it's been around since the beginning or whatever you want to believe the beginning is and rather because that's tangible and that makes it seem a little more pulp pulp how would you say you can do you can deal with it better because literally if you put yourself in a soundproof environment you might be away from it who knows but then we could work backwards from lookout for Charlie and go back to the spiritual stuff there's a lot of stuff in the biblical narrative about that even with curses by the way there's a lot of stuff in any I mean you want to go the pagan route you want to go the eastern route Western route is the worst you could do I consider the biblical narrative Eastern by the way it would be South West East so in other words it would be Southwest Asia is what I consider the biblical narrative once you come over to Europe let's say or whatever you know you could go to old druid stuff see what they say but stay away from what's called psychology those guys are morons even yield when recently I put on an audio book by by you'll see but wrote a bunch of stuff and I was like this guy's a moron no wonder they they made him popular you know Freud was even more of a moron like oh my gosh you're really as I'm getting older I'd argue with you that's a race between the two of them as to which one is King moron because I mean it's yeah yeah and the people just adore likely Einstein is another one right I said wrote really good personal letters I had a book personal letters of Einstein that he sent to people and stuff he had a pretty good mind in a for communicating you know various things but the way they put him up is doing this who's plagiarized but anyway yeah you're pretty much stuck and also by the way people that are confused or not all the classics they told us to read in elementary school in high school that's all garbage most if you read Emerson and O'Mellville and Mark Twain you know all these guys they're idiots they're not good writers I recently I picked up Samuel Clemens book margins this is so poorly written it can't be by him yes it is oh my gosh we were so hyped up told that this stuff we should read they made us read garbage and yeah so what do you read then well you still have to read it because when you come across something good you know what good is right oh so yeah I was bored to death by that book the the pearl or whatever it was who wrote that was that the Simpers are at the girth also wasn't it a Steinbeck maybe it was another idiot oh my gosh oh but by the way I want to bring up to something I was mentioning to someone these Ivy League colleges you could look this up we're started back in the 1600s or whatever 300 years ago 250 years ago 180 years ago my families who became mega wealthy during the opium trade and they wanted to keep that going so they said you know people might see what this this does to people when they use it habitually and they might come after us so we need to make a cultural change why don't we make these colleges and start changing the culture their point of view and the narrative about what we're doing right and he could put out the rest so you had a bunch of rich scumbags that basically drug dealers that opened all these Ivy Leagues and they're still do you right so this is where this is when I say you're in a bad place it's not because who's a president who's who's the current occupant of the White House or whatever pedophile you have in the parliaments wherever you are or whatever no it's always been this way since ancient times and there were city-states and groups back in ancient times that wanted to fight to clear the air you know and they always failed you know it's this is a scumbag planet or realm whatever you want to call it make the best out of it just like when you go to McDonald's don't order the greasy stuff or try to make up the best decision or hold hold out part of the thing about holding out here is just focus on food clothing shelter you know I'm not saying do what I do I constantly remind myself look I was sent here by accident right so I'm not gonna act like I belong here right no way in other words when it's cold I just want to be warm when it's hot I want to be cool when it's raining I want to be dry if it's too dry I need some moisture if I'm if my belly's making noise and I need nutrition I'd like some right that's it you know if I don't want to be wearing rags and tatters right I don't want it right so but I really don't want anything here it's the absolute minimum but if you're gonna do the absolute minimum do it really well do it really well so you know that balances everything out and then you could point the finger and say hey you know better than that or you don't care or whatever and you'll always be in the right fair enough so uh what do you think I'm changing this question a little bit because I think they mean to ask you what do you think about this substance they call beyond meat like the vegan thing because okay okay that because that's been I it's going away thankfully yes it's it's really an unclean food from a spiritual point of view what they're doing is growing hemoglobin they're going blood in a laboratory using algae that mimics that and they're putting they're making this vegetarian blood it's no longer vegetarian if you're making blood right right so it's really a bad cocktail the level of gmo and preservatives that are in there is it's toxic you'll probably well there's that but they want to know your liver and kidneys with it yeah they want to know if there's any human elements in it like if it's uh yet another like sort of cloaked cannibalism yeah they they could do that just like I wouldn't be surprised if they're using the cloning technology which has been around since the 30s by the way yeah the biggest problem with the clones was by the 1950s they had them walking around but they didn't have them in public because the whites of their eyes were brown that's why you hear the black eyed children and all that that's they're not from outer space but anyway true um no they're horrible uh horrible people uh uh doing all this stuff and I think those that support them are horrible also um and eat a piece of meat like for example right now it's dark moon time and it's like well I'll roast a chicken I'll do it uh I call it the one two three one two three chicken I get an organic chicken uh scotch babbit or babscotch I forgot which one you cut this cut it right down the spine yet most people can't do that they don't have the a sharp knife but you could use a butcher a strong scissor also and make sure that when you do that with a chicken right about an inch or so above where the pope's nose is the tail of the chicken stick your thumb in there where the kidneys are right by the spine and you'll see a kidney pop out you can't see it when the carcass is open but stick your finger and you you want to get all the organ meat out because organ meat doesn't have a good flavor most people don't know how to do that that's why I can't eat chicken up because it's not clean they don't know how to clean them then what you do is you you blend liquefy that this is why I call it one two three water uh uh with a mixture heavy salt like a brine very salty not as salty as the ocean but really salty with garlic and ginger if you don't have fresh garlic or ginger you could use a powder of each quite a bit of it uh cover the chicken in a bowl or a pot put a plate on it with a weight or whatever three hours that's okay and that's why I call it the one two three one two three because the brine is made of salt ginger and garlic one two three and it's one two three hours in other words one two three hour brining marinate then you take the chicken and you hang it up if you can't hang it up outside put it in a colander you know the one you use to drain your pasta whatever and put you know a towel or something over it and then you got to wait for at least two or three hours again for it to drip dry you want the skin to be dry to the touch almost to the where it looks like it's sunburned on its own I hang it up in 100 degree weather in 20 minutes the skin is crispy just hanging in the sun and then we put it in a 700 degree mesquite oven for about 20 minutes 25 minutes 30 minutes it's completely done rested not an hour or whatever and and it's it's delicious and okay when we did this yesterday we do this in the middle of the month typically let's say and it's the dark moon it's just chicken so two people sitting down ready to eat we got lime and juice you know whatever just chicken dig in chicken good you know it's just chicken that's it no sides no salad no you know yesterday we had a kimchi cucumber side some kimchi from Trader Joe's and I sliced some cucumbers with rice vinegar and sugar and put that around the kimchi and I did make rice but the majority of the meal is just chicken typically when we do this broiled chicken in the middle of the month it's just chicken we just sit down just chicken and a beer some wine or whatever just like you know when you have meat in the middle of the month don't worry about the sides you must have a condiment though to make it digestible in this case it's the kimchi and the lime right now quick question you know I appreciate all kinds of cucumbers but do you have a particular favorite or one that you would savor the standard I used to grow the Armenian ones which are like the skinless they look like they don't have a skin oh those are weird yeah yeah okay yeah they're really they grow really large you know cucumbers you don't want them growing too large because then they get air pockets where the seeds are they're not as flavorful as cucumbers are in the melon family yeah by the way so look at whatever is good for melons is good for cucumbers you know if you someone cuts a cantaloupe in a room and you walk in you can smell it someone cuts a cucumber in a room it smells just like a melon but it's not you know a cantaloupe it's a different right right just like onion and garlic you know if you're processing onion and garlic in the kitchen you know it's like one of those one of those right so yeah so it's a melon so consider that it should be eaten very sparingly should be treated because remember melons either eat it alone or leave it alone cucumber tends to be one of the exceptions that can be eaten in a salad and with foods with other things but always in minimal that's why when they when they you know when they serve burgers with a pickle that's a cucumber but no one ever asked for do you want a cucumber with your hamburger like hell no give me a pickle because it's changed because it's it's cured now it's a completely different animal just like whole milk and parmesan cheese is not the same thing it's completely different you know you can't even consider parmesan to be dairy anymore literally it's completely different just like that heavily processed cucumber sauce that they put on a lot of greek wraps is uh is is pretty good but it's because yeah but it's been processed with garlic and salt and pepper so it's and it's minimal yeah right it's called tzatziki yeah uh and they don't really make it anymore because it's gotten popular so they yeah it's mixed with mayo and all kinds of but it is good it is good it's uh there's also an there's an indian one similar with a very watery yogurt sauce some carrot and fennel but i just gave you the rest of that for people you want to dry your meat before you cook it doesn't matter what it is because when you put it in the flame if it has any water on it any moisture it will not go above 220 or 212 degrees until that moisture is gone so you're literally steaming the meat that you want a nice roast on right because i remember mostly white people when i tell them dry the meat or if it's a turkey a chicken a steak hang it up so it's dry to the touch when you touch it there is no moisture it's actually dry like a potato would be dry right or you know and they're like i want my meat to be moist i don't want oh my gosh they don't understand because when the meat is wet when you put it in the fire it will be dry when you're done because you're boiling it you're not roasting it or broasting it so uh the same goes with veggies if you're going to uh want to get a nice color i do like what i call a veggie roast with various sliced vegetables and uh i put a little salt on them and i put them in a colander to air dry so when they hit the pan and the pan is at 350 400 guess what the vegetable goes to 400 right away it gets a beautiful golden caramelization if the vegetables are wet they you know you can have a hot pan with one drop of water in it and it will not go above 200 degrees or 220 until that drop of water is gone it's a phenomenal thing about water also so learn how to dry your food if you want to roast broast saute years ago that's why when they did a roast in the oven you know uh you you rubbed butter or oil on it on the surface right yep so it wasn't water that was that hit the meat met the heat it was butter or oil to get that uh and when i cook these the stuff out on the mesquite grill there's nothing dripping on the grill there's it doesn't need maybe one drop of liquid you see white people grilling and the chicken is running all the juices are going into the fire everything's catching fire i'm like oh my gosh you're not doing that because if you're grilling properly nothing you don't have any drippings coming out of it so if you're used to grilling or roasting and drippings coming out you're not doing it right or i wouldn't say you're doing it wrong but you're definitely not doing it right you know if it's edible it's not wrong uh so
