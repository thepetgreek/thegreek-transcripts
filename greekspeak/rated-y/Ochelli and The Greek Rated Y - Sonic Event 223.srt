1
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,720
Rated Y, Sonic Advent 2.2.3, and

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,940
that's the way this is.

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:13,300
Okay.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,940
Anyway, Greek, how you doing today?

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,220
All right.

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,400
Kind of, yeah.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,280
You said we have a lot of questions.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,020
Let's get to it.

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,500
Yeah, we do have a ton of questions,

10
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,620
and just quickly, to make sure that people

11
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,400
understand this.

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,440
I'm not skipping anybody's question, but some things

13
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,900
are personal.

14
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,000
Why do I say that?

15
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,680
Because right at the top of the question

16
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,620
list, somebody asks about understanding their daughter, and

17
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,840
I'm not even going to bother to read

18
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,680
the rest of it, because it seems to

19
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,700
me like it's something where you would have

20
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,560
to talk to the Greek specifically, directly, because

21
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,340
it's something that would involve diagnosis, and I'm

22
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:49,620
sorry.

23
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,960
I don't want to do that on here,

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,940
because ...

25
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,420
Right, right, if it's too specific.

26
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,080
Some specifics are actually general.

27
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,860
We'll go to that.

28
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,340
And some specifics are too specific.

29
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:01,780
Got it.

30
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,739
Right, and I'm just covering that, because people

31
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:05,320
might wonder how it is I filter this

32
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:05,580
stuff.

33
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,320
I try to bring every single thing you

34
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,400
guys ask, but you've noted I've combined questions

35
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,780
for you guys, and there is a ton

36
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,740
of them this time, which we may break

37
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,500
into two Sonics.

38
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,120
There's so many.

39
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:15,500
Okay?

40
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,160
So I'm just letting you guys know that

41
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:17,880
at the top.

42
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,360
All right, anyway, next question.

43
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,300
What is the best way to deal with

44
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,380
an upset stomach?

45
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,280
See, that's general.

46
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,880
Upset to the point where you drink a

47
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,920
little water and feel like you're going to

48
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,440
throw up.

49
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,920
What they call stomach flu, in quotes.

50
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,860
This thing can last for days.

51
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,580
If there's a trick to recover quickly from

52
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,060
it, do you know of one, Greek?

53
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,660
Yeah, well, let me just preface by saying

54
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,640
there's more and more people in recent times

55
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,820
that are getting that, including myself to some

56
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,180
point.

57
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,000
Well, maybe it's because I'm being subjected to

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,080
a lot of heat, Arizona, in August is

59
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:02,220
every day over 105, 110, but no, that's

60
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:02,960
a common thing.

61
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,540
The stomach is a very interesting, it's like

62
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,020
a sensor.

63
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:10,880
You have sensor area in your mouth, in

64
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,000
your nose, and if it bypasses that, your

65
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,740
stomach will act like a sensor, right?

66
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,380
True, and anything in a container, including the

67
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,760
container of the human body, is subject to

68
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,540
its environment.

69
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,580
We must admit that, despite the fact that

70
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,020
the media lies to us all the time,

71
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,340
reports like this is the hottest day we've

72
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,100
ever recorded on the planet may be true.

73
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,740
Well, yeah, we know anything they report to

74
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,940
the public is already predetermined, right?

75
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,060
Oh, yeah, but I'm saying that they don't

76
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,620
lie 100% of the time.

77
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,280
And they may be reporting the high temperature,

78
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,160
because you dummies are going to notice it's

79
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,460
hot.

80
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,480
Well, yeah, the global warming is always in

81
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:50,860
the summer.

82
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:51,940
Yeah, right.

83
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,240
No, okay, so my point here with the

84
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,960
stomach is, let's take it from this point,

85
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,480
it's kind of like being a mechanic now.

86
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,460
You know, a good mechanic will hear a

87
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,680
car going down the street and say, oh,

88
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,760
that guy's power steering pump is bad, right,

89
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,200
versus it's making that noise, right?

90
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,260
Or they hear somebody turn a corner and

91
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,720
they go, you know what that is, brakes

92
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,260
and power steering fluid.

93
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,600
Or your axle if you're clicking somebody, okay,

94
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,460
so here that you have the sensors, which

95
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,980
are there, we have very poor senses, by

96
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,420
the way, you know, they we only see

97
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,440
a very tiny percentage of visible light only

98
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,200
hear a very small percentage of sound, small

99
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,340
percentage of and that goes also for taste

100
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,180
and smell.

101
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:30,700
Right.

102
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,860
And, right.

103
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,720
So like dogs can smell through concrete, pretty

104
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,060
much.

105
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,240
So right.

106
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,060
The way we sense what's coming into the

107
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,580
body is most likely through the nose, because

108
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,480
it'll usually pass the nose before it goes

109
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,200
into the mouth.

110
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,100
It's like a, it's like a hood, you

111
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,820
know, like a kitchen hood over your oven,

112
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:50,040
right?

113
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,400
You notice that the nose protrudes over the

114
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:53,780
mouth.

115
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:57,940
So you'll get the olfactory nostrils right over

116
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,000
what's right before it goes into the mouth.

117
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,820
If it passes the olfactory, it goes into

118
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,220
the mouth, then the mouth, you have taste

119
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,920
buds all over the place, their taste buds

120
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,560
in the back of the throat, right?

121
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,180
Some all years, we'll tell you that.

122
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,820
And then if it passes that, it gets

123
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,360
to the stomach.

124
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,519
And the stomach has a very interesting setup,

125
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:22,020
where there's something called a gag reflex, or

126
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,740
whatever, you know, or beyond the gag reflex,

127
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,480
what is it?

128
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,680
Is it a reflex when people see something

129
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,220
that actually makes them throw up?

130
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,580
What is that called?

131
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,400
Anyway, there's a term for it regurgitation, you

132
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,360
will anyway, so when it gets to the

133
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,680
stomach, if it passed the nose and the

134
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,740
taste, the stomach will eject it, right?

135
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,760
If it doesn't pass the stomach, right?

136
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,360
For you know, emotion, you know, years ago,

137
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,280
people saw a really something really gross, they

138
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,120
would throw up, right?

139
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,680
Just from visual.

140
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,640
So that's the stomach, because by visually throwing

141
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,980
up, you're not getting an olfactory and an

142
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,840
oral sensory pass.

143
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,060
I wonder...

144
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,580
Well, quickly, any one of the senses could

145
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,940
trigger that, because some people hear a sickening

146
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,640
noise, they tell you, it made me sick

147
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,400
to my stomach to hear that noise.

148
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,980
Yeah, it could be that as well.

149
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,200
Yeah.

150
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,060
So but the stomach will react to, yeah,

151
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,780
like, like, like you said, it will depend

152
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,220
on everything else and make its own decision,

153
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:21,740
let's say.

154
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,060
So let's keep that in mind, because we

155
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,800
don't consider the stomach to be, let's say

156
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,440
to have that kind of function, right?

157
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:29,960
It does.

158
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,040
So when it's when it's just the stomach,

159
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,340
and it's going to eject something, it's out

160
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:37,780
of tune.

161
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,860
In other words, if it passed the olfactory

162
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,140
and the oral taste, and it got into

163
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:47,840
the stomach, there's something probably that's odorless, but

164
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,520
the stomach senses it chemically, energetically and all

165
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,020
that, right?

166
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,260
The other thing that you could have is

167
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,180
a is a what they call an amoeba,

168
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,920
a bug, a parasite in the stomach, it

169
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,660
doesn't go past the stomach because it won't

170
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,180
survive.

171
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,320
By the way, if you go past the

172
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,480
duodenum or the duodenum, small intestine, large intestine

173
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,140
called those parts that I just mentioned in

174
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,120
the GI tract, the gastrointestinal tract don't have

175
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,900
that function that I just mentioned.

176
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,400
So be careful with your stomach.

177
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,380
In other words, be careful, because if you

178
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,200
can tune into it, it will actually save

179
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,480
you a lot of it actually, the feedback

180
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,280
from the stomach can be used to tune

181
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,340
the olfactory and the oral, right?

182
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,080
So things you normally wouldn't smell or taste

183
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,400
before, because you're tuned into how sensitive the

184
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,340
stomach can be for anyone, you can retune

185
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,540
your olfactory and your oral.

186
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,540
Now, give you an example, when I traveled

187
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,780
at one point, I drank some water from

188
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,580
a spring that wasn't really a good spring.

189
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,580
And I felt like someone kicked me in

190
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,980
the stomach for like two months in a

191
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:50,220
row.

192
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,700
And I told someone where I was, oh,

193
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,520
you got an amoeba, you know, it was

194
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,760
pond water, you know, and basically sat in

195
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,340
stomach, what I did was I took charcoal

196
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,280
pills for that, right?

197
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,140
And it was gone in two days.

198
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:06,580
And so I would say that having a

199
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,740
stomach issue can be actually two things.

200
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,300
One is it's rejecting because it's just out

201
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,760
of whack, like they say, or you have

202
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,640
an amoeba or something sitting in there that

203
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,660
is making anything that goes in there irritating

204
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,380
to the stomach.

205
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,900
Or it could be a toxification or something

206
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,000
that landed there and is coating the stomach

207
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,540
or whatever.

208
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,960
Typically, if it's a short, whenever you have

209
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,800
a short onset of something, doing nothing is

210
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,700
the best thing and doing what's known to

211
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,640
be good for you.

212
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,200
Typically, if you have a cure-all or

213
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,760
whatever, like typically teas, right?

214
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:47,120
Don't dehydrate or starve yourself, what will be

215
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,800
your favorite tea?

216
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,780
Stay away from teas.

217
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,340
When I say teas, by the way, tannin,

218
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,260
teas with tannin, you know, that look dark

219
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,040
are not medicinal.

220
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,680
They can be very rarely, that's a whole

221
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,460
other subject, where when do tannin, tannic acids

222
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,200
become medicinal.

223
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,460
But an herbal tea, a light tannin like

224
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,020
a chamomile or ginger or whatever, usually to

225
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:11,300
soothe that and see how that results for

226
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:11,460
you.

227
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,320
Because typically, most stomach issues are a sensory

228
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:14,820
problem.

229
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,480
It takes a lot to really mess up

230
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:17,940
your stomach.

231
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,260
So yeah, and do whatever, see, there's so

232
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,560
many things, like for example, I was speaking

233
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,740
to someone the other day about discomfort, is

234
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,120
they always give a chemical or physical reason.

235
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:34,720
But ultimately, because nothing goes in and out

236
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,820
of our body, it's all by induction, it

237
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,919
gets teleported to the inside and teleported to

238
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,260
the outside as waste product.

239
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,900
It's induction, it's about tuning the field.

240
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,220
It's like a radio device that's out of

241
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,880
whack, again, you have to tune it.

242
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,040
So typically, when you're not feeling well, or

243
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,100
you have an infirm condition coming on, you

244
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,600
will have, for most people, the craving could

245
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,440
be so short that you don't notice it.

246
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,740
You can crave something unusual that you tend

247
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,420
to like anyway, for half a second.

248
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,720
And that's what's going to fix you very

249
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,060
much like the bladder produces the anti-venom

250
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,760
when you have a venom, the body subject

251
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,240
to a venom.

252
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,640
Like if you're bit by a poisonous snake,

253
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,500
typically, I'm doing what Grey's Anatomy does, typically

254
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,280
most likely, presumptive language here.

255
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,840
The antidote of the venom is produced in

256
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,520
the bladder, but you only got 30 seconds

257
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,520
to a minute to apply it, a little

258
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,360
bit in your orally and then on the

259
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:32,700
area.

260
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,420
The bladder produces it.

261
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,940
So typically, when the body is infirm, it

262
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,740
will give you a signal, a mental signal,

263
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,640
eat this dummy.

264
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,440
That's where I did the, what I had

265
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,120
the circus flu, long story, it's in a

266
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,880
previous sonic, it's been brought up many times

267
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,160
over a year ago, a piece of a

268
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:55,240
really fine chocolate or finer chocolate and some

269
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:55,560
wine.

270
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,000
And I went to bed and three hours

271
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,580
later, I woke up and I was fine

272
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,440
as if nothing happened.

273
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,940
I was wrestling this thing for like five

274
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,240
days.

275
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,060
So it could be something odd.

276
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,280
Like if you're craving a pickle, a cucumber

277
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,480
pickle, a sour pickle, you're not feeling just

278
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,360
take a bite of that and it'll retune

279
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:12,820
the body.

280
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,560
This is, again, where when you have a

281
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,100
research, real research being done on the induction

282
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,460
side of the body, we can figure out

283
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,760
things where you can actually in the future

284
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,480
take a pill.

285
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:24,480
Right.

286
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,300
But the pill has a little dial on

287
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:26,440
it.

288
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:26,960
You tune it.

289
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,260
Right.

290
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,960
I mean, you can imagine what can be

291
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,200
done.

292
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:29,520
Right.

293
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,420
So.

294
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:31,740
Yeah.

295
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,320
But anyway, that's that's what I have to

296
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,740
say about stomach stuff.

297
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,700
Well, and a universal basic apothecary could be

298
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,000
developed, like you mentioned charcoal, which is another

299
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,500
funny thing.

300
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,260
Call back to an earlier sonic.

301
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,140
We don't usually put charcoal.

302
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:48,160
But if you eat some charcoal in there,

303
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,300
you might have an allergy.

304
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,300
Calories have no effect unless you're pooping charcoal

305
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,840
because it has to be reduced to charcoal

306
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,860
to have any caloric measurement.

307
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:57,220
That's.

308
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,220
Yeah, that's the joke.

309
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,120
So anyways.

310
00:10:59,460 --> 00:10:59,900
Yeah.

311
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,540
So I think that's that's excellent.

312
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,520
Thank you for that.

313
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:03,580
OK.

314
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,580
If the gods created the reality we live

315
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,720
in, how did these dark entities take over

316
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,300
the whole thing?

317
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:08,680
All right.

318
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,700
I'm going to.

319
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,080
Well, who says they're dark?

320
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,940
That's how they're labeled.

321
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,260
Right.

322
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,620
Well, they appear to be malevolent to most

323
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:15,980
people.

324
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,580
And a lot of people have this idea

325
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,840
that the gods aren't.

326
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:19,640
Which.

327
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,020
Yeah.

328
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,260
Well, here's the thing.

329
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,740
Like, for example, give me an example.

330
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,760
I recently was out and I started talking

331
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,540
about the financial stuff and some people got

332
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,680
really pissed off.

333
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,360
Oh, yeah.

334
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,760
Deb, it pisses them off when you break

335
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,260
their paradigms.

336
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,440
Really, really.

337
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:31,820
Yeah.

338
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:32,760
Sorry.

339
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,940
Really quick consolidation to this question, though, is

340
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,980
they want to know if this is some

341
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:37,860
sort of game here.

342
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,220
Like if we're actually just game pieces on

343
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,660
a board and that's all there is to

344
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:41,960
this.

345
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,400
So go ahead.

346
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,220
Well, a game.

347
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:44,900
What is a game?

348
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,100
Most of the games are a reflection of

349
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,620
activities, opportunities or conditions that you have every

350
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:50,860
day.

351
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,120
Social, cultural, whatever.

352
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,580
Like, for example, the Monopoly game board.

353
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,840
What was that was based during the Depression,

354
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,340
you know, acquiring property seemed useless and hopeless

355
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,060
at the time.

356
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,560
So they made a game board to so

357
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,240
you can experience, you know, the passion was

358
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,420
no longer a serious thing.

359
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:06,820
Yeah.

360
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,520
I put Atlantic City in the mix.

361
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,400
I mean, those are literally the streets there

362
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,080
and everything else.

363
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,120
We have the risk.

364
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,120
You have all these game boards.

365
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,040
What are they?

366
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,060
They always represent.

367
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,760
Battleship is another one.

368
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,340
Oh, right.

369
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:18,640
Right.

370
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,460
Chess, checkers, bridge, all these things represent a

371
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:26,160
lot of people speak on, you know, international

372
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,320
politics is a chess game.

373
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:27,680
It's not.

374
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,940
It's actually a bridge game because chess, you

375
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,040
have one versus the other.

376
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,640
And always when you have international conflict or,

377
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,340
let's say, incidents, it's always a partnership.

378
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,720
Allies are involved.

379
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,160
So well, there's more like bridge.

380
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,180
Well, there's a guarantee of a triangulation.

381
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,860
And then there's partnerships where you have teams,

382
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,060
which would be bridge more than chess.

383
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,000
You hear a lot of people say, oh,

384
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,280
yeah, they're playing 3D chess.

385
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,180
No, it's not.

386
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,920
Very rarely do you see chess in the

387
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,060
open political scene.

388
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,200
It's always a game of bridge.

389
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:55,980
But so.

390
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,920
So, again, I'm giving the game analogy.

391
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:58,380
Yes.

392
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,480
Only if you take the game analogy the

393
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,880
way we just mentioned, because if you say

394
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,160
it's a game, it sounds like children's whatever.

395
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:05,860
Right.

396
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,000
It's not.

397
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,280
It's games are.

398
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,500
What would you say?

399
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,980
Would they be a reflection, a representation of

400
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:16,960
real things or scenarios or events or incidents

401
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,480
or whatever?

402
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,680
So, yes, in that context, it's a game.

403
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:20,860
Yeah.

404
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:24,880
There's simplified methodologies for representation of real world

405
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,280
things.

406
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:25,980
Right.

407
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:26,700
I mean, that would be.

408
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,420
But what I'm trying to like overshadow and

409
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,820
get away from is when you say game,

410
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,580
are you playing games?

411
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,220
It means like it's frivolous and whatever.

412
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,820
No, games are not frivolous or whatever.

413
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,480
But that's how the language is used.

414
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,040
Right.

415
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,860
Just like the word nice is used to

416
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,540
connote something and it means something else.

417
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,460
I would suggest here the meaning of a

418
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,640
game is to represent larger, bigger events and

419
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,060
things that are very serious.

420
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,580
So it's a serious game.

421
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,300
And then they got things like you play

422
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,220
stupid games, you win stupid prizes, you know,

423
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,920
saying things like that, cliche stuff.

424
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,620
So, yeah, it would be a game in

425
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,280
that context.

426
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,820
But who's malevolent?

427
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,720
You know, when a bank is robbed, the

428
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,760
robbers are considered malevolent.

429
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,680
But when the robbers get busted by the

430
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,900
cops, the cops are malevolent to them.

431
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:12,580
Right.

432
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:12,920
Right.

433
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,600
You can see how religions battle it out.

434
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,420
One one venerated God on one side is

435
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,580
the enemy of the other.

436
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,780
And yeah, that's really difficult.

437
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,780
Well, you know, here's the thing.

438
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,740
In the large scheme of things, there's no

439
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,080
good and bad openly.

440
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,820
It's about things making balance.

441
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,820
Give another example.

442
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,240
In Star Wars, people think it's the dark

443
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,740
side of the force versus the light versus

444
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,840
the light kind of force.

445
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,540
No, it's not.

446
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,100
If you even study the lore that the

447
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,000
writ of Star Wars, not just the film

448
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,820
or listen carefully.

449
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,700
It's not about light versus dark in Star

450
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:49,980
Wars.

451
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,040
It's the it's out of what out of

452
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,640
balance.

453
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:53,600
Right.

454
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,260
The light, the Jedi, the good Jedi never

455
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,640
wanted to get rid of the Sith or

456
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,200
all these other.

457
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,100
It's about putting it in balance.

458
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,680
It's when the dark side started overcoming.

459
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,280
I was out of balance.

460
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,180
So when you say malevolent or good or

461
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:14,360
bad, it's it's not good when it goes

462
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:14,960
out of balance.

463
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,020
Let's just put it that way.

464
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,020
It's a balancing act.

465
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,260
So what's good or bad is what you

466
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:18,580
pick.

467
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,700
Like, you know, if you go to the

468
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,860
Bible Belt or the buckle of the Bible

469
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,920
Belt, Muslims are bad.

470
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:25,340
Oh, yeah.

471
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:25,580
Right.

472
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,280
So and if you read so.

473
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,680
But if you go to a country that

474
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,060
is Islamic, by the way, Persia is not

475
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:32,480
Islamic.

476
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,700
And I've been watching what they're doing there.

477
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,940
And it would be quite good to eliminate

478
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,560
Islam out of Persia or Iran because it's

479
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,760
not an Islamic country.

480
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,380
Never was.

481
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,160
Never will be.

482
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,560
The people there, they just whatever.

483
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,740
So, you know, get your your sights on

484
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,900
how things are viewed internally and from the

485
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,580
inside out and from the outside in.

486
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,160
And you'll see there is no malevolent, really.

487
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,740
It's just a matter of is there a

488
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,220
balance.

489
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:02,740
Right.

490
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,480
So is death malevolent or benevolent?

491
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:05,900
Right.

492
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:06,920
Well, it's neither.

493
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,340
In my mind, it's it would be viewed

494
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,620
very much as malevolent.

495
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,160
She didn't even accept accepted as a fact

496
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:13,860
of life.

497
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,180
Yes.

498
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,820
If you want to understand these things, you

499
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,460
need to remove sentimentality from it.

500
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,660
Very simply, like if you stand facing another

501
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,020
person, ask them to hold up their left

502
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:23,380
hand.

503
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,420
Now, when they do that, that is on

504
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,660
the right hand side of the image you

505
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,300
are viewing.

506
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,960
The person you are.

507
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:30,540
Yeah.

508
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,440
I get it.

509
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:31,640
Right.

510
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,140
If one side's right is another appears to

511
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:34,860
be someone's left.

512
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,240
Yes.

513
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,260
That's just as simple as you can make

514
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:37,820
it, I think.

515
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:38,960
Yeah.

516
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,080
But let's let's say even from the biblical

517
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,560
thing, let's just go in.

518
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,980
In Job, Satan is walking around in a

519
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,760
heavenly court or a heavenly council.

520
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,300
Yeah.

521
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,980
And he's like, what are you doing?

522
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,840
Hey, I'll go down and mess with this.

523
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,860
This character is brought up and he's OK.

524
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,800
Go mess with him.

525
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,780
Well, if he's so malevolent, so bad, what's

526
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,060
he doing in the heavenly council?

527
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,380
Satan with.

528
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:58,640
Right.

529
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,320
You see what I mean?

530
00:16:59,420 --> 00:16:59,780
Of course.

531
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,180
So it's not this.

532
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,319
The public has been over cheap dip, let's

533
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:08,680
say, or indoctrinated in the concept of it's

534
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,000
either good guys, bad guys, black and white.

535
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,200
You know, the winner loser.

536
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:12,839
There's this.

537
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:13,720
Right.

538
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,980
Cowboys who wear black hats, cowboys who wear

539
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:17,579
white hats.

540
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,060
You know what?

541
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:18,920
They're both cowboys.

542
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:19,560
Period.

543
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,440
There you go.

544
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,060
And black hats.

545
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,980
So that's a meme in the alternative media

546
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,380
and all that.

547
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,960
But yeah, when you get over that, then

548
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,940
you tend to accept the not.

549
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,160
Here's the thing.

550
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,300
I was going to say fear.

551
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,460
You know, a lot of people say don't

552
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:34,700
fear.

553
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,560
That's bullshit.

554
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:41,100
Everyone will always sense fear in certain conditions.

555
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,660
The real thing.

556
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,600
You know, you hear that.

557
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,140
Don't fear.

558
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:44,380
Right.

559
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,720
That's that's like having someone sit in one

560
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,300
place, like in a meditational lotus position position

561
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,960
and having them quiet their mind.

562
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,080
It's impossible because when the body is still,

563
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,080
the mind is racing.

564
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:54,440
Right.

565
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,840
So when someone says, well, when there's a

566
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,500
meme, no fear, that's total bullshit and that's

567
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,600
very disabling and it makes people crazy.

568
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,820
The real thing is, even with fear, can

569
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,760
you still function?

570
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,000
Right.

571
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,280
Because most people, what does fear do?

572
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,100
It disables you.

573
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:09,620
Right.

574
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:13,500
So can you remain able and as able

575
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,100
as you were, if you're not, you're under

576
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:15,440
fear.

577
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,380
That's the point.

578
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,580
So can you stay on the path and

579
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,980
the covenants and the things that you agree

580
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,920
to do, want to do, aspire to do,

581
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,400
live to do in the face of adversity,

582
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,180
which would be considered malevolent?

583
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,000
That's the point.

584
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,940
Can you function with how much malevolence?

585
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,820
For example, I see in the public, everything

586
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,620
is malevolent, coat sugar coated.

587
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:38,660
Right.

588
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,980
Does that mean that?

589
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:40,260
Right.

590
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,740
So what does that mean?

591
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,020
Well, I am so, let's say, planted and

592
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,340
firm.

593
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,100
I'm standing on what I know these things

594
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:49,460
are.

595
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,420
And you just go about, however, don't let

596
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,140
them affect you.

597
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:53,600
Right.

598
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,300
Right.

599
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:55,680
OK.

600
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,800
So from a previous Sonic on menopause for

601
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,560
women, it is good to increase quality yin.

602
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,560
Quality is young, but I read it depletes

603
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,780
yin long term.

604
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,100
Do you recommend saying that again?

605
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,400
What is your coffee?

606
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,380
OK, let me, let me begin again in

607
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,240
case I'm OK, in case I much mouthed

608
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:14,700
it a little bit.

609
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:14,980
Sorry.

610
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,300
OK.

611
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,240
Previous Sonic menopause for women.

612
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,500
It is good to increase quality yin period.

613
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:27,360
Coffee is young, but I read it depletes

614
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,040
yin long term.

615
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,400
Do you recommend to eliminate coffee in this

616
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:32,740
case?

617
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,600
Like in somebody who's menopausal, I guess.

618
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,260
Very personal.

619
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,260
Are you an upper or a downer person?

620
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,700
In other words, do you when you take

621
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,160
a downer like wine or any other chemical

622
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,060
downer, does it satisfy you more than an

623
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,020
upper or it doesn't matter either way?

624
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,680
That is, in other words, are you a

625
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,100
stimulant or a relaxant?

626
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:52,320
Right.

627
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,020
What would the opposite of a sedative?

628
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,340
It would be stimulant and sedative.

629
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:55,660
Right.

630
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,860
Well, yeah, that would be the there's another

631
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,580
term for it.

632
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,620
But yeah, it's a yes, sedative, sedative.

633
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,580
That's how they put it.

634
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,380
All right.

635
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,200
Sedative, sedative.

636
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:04,460
Yeah.

637
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,480
Which one are you?

638
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,440
Upper or downer?

639
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,360
Right.

640
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,800
So that's the first thing in your character.

641
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,180
Right.

642
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,720
And then the second thing would be the

643
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,680
quality of the coffee.

644
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,360
Give you an example.

645
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,300
I cannot drink inorganic coffee.

646
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,120
If I do, I have like this chemical

647
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,520
rush and I'm jittery and whatever.

648
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,760
For some reason, it's what they're spraying on

649
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,180
the coffee.

650
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,800
Maybe it's overharvesting.

651
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,420
When coffee is overharvested, it produces a lower

652
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:32,900
quality caffeine, kind of like the growers that

653
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,880
grow the cannabis.

654
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,380
They pick on the plant because it irritates

655
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:36,780
the plant.

656
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,080
When the plant is irritated, it makes a

657
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,940
higher supposedly THC content.

658
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:41,260
Right.

659
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,360
When coffee is overharvested, it does something similar.

660
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,340
So there's so many factors here.

661
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,660
Like, for example, if I were just to

662
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:53,300
drink non-organic coffee, I would probably not.

663
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,940
I would cut back on coffee to the

664
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,320
point where it was an irrelevant thought.

665
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,080
Right.

666
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,860
And so it all these things matters.

667
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,140
That's the fine point.

668
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,320
I wouldn't think coffee is such a big

669
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,960
issue unless you're like me that drinks like

670
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,140
ten cups of coffee a day, right?

671
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,440
So if you're a serious coffee drinker and

672
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,440
you consume a lot of it, switch to

673
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,540
a higher quality coffee and then throttle back,

674
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,380
see how you feel.

675
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,660
But things like menopause, a quality yin.

676
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:26,800
But remember, that part of the body, as

677
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,240
you go lower, that's more of the yin

678
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,280
part of the body.

679
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,000
As you go lower, where the feet are

680
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,700
the most yin.

681
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,460
So in order to attract an energy to

682
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,760
that part of the body, it has to

683
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,420
be yang, right?

684
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,580
So meat products and salts and minerals go

685
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,440
downward, right?

686
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,760
And the yin stuff, which goes upward towards

687
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,260
the yang part of the body, which is

688
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,000
the top of the head.

689
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,240
So it depends on what you want to

690
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:51,520
do.

691
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,520
Do you want to nourish that part of

692
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,620
the body and meaning the reproductive organs, right?

693
00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:00,920
Then you would need something balanced, vegetable, grain,

694
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,160
whole grains, beans, fish, things like that.

695
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,680
So it depends on what you want to

696
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,580
do at the quote-unquote menopause stage.

697
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,780
Is it you're looking for nourishment?

698
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,280
Are you looking to counteract a condition?

699
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,720
We can get more personal on this, like

700
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:20,220
lubricity for women is an issue at that

701
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:20,860
point, right?

702
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,240
And sensitivity because of that, right?

703
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,180
So do you want to, you know, there's

704
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,800
so many factors, boy, oh boy.

705
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,820
And you know what?

706
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,480
If I was doing a consult with 10

707
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,960
different women, it would be almost five or

708
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,580
I assure you five to seven different remedies

709
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,660
and approaches.

710
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,060
So this is, but at least we brought

711
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,560
this up and give you a little more

712
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,020
of a concept of how to think about

713
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:42,320
it.

714
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,280
Yeah, no, fair enough.

715
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,340
And it's a big point.

716
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,840
Like, like, okay.

717
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,860
So when I took painkillers, they used to

718
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,500
give me energy.

719
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,660
I've seen other people turn into zombies.

720
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,260
Exactly.

721
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:56,140
Like, yeah, it's, it's like we said earlier,

722
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,560
if it's your character, right, right.

723
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,020
The first thing we mentioned is, are you

724
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,900
upper or a downer, you know, person, you

725
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,800
know, which, which, which suits you better, right?

726
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,060
Right.

727
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,380
So you've seen the depressed person drinking versus

728
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,580
the, you know, guys running around screaming and

729
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:08,860
yelling.

730
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:09,800
He's all energetic.

731
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,100
If they're drunk, even in a drunken state,

732
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,060
you have different types of people, you know

733
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:14,380
what I mean?

734
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,500
And yeah, alcohol is pretty universal.

735
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:17,480
Anyways.

736
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,160
All right.

737
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,320
In a, let's see, can we, oh, can

738
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,800
we get a sonic or segment of the

739
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,620
sonic dedicated to better understanding the cosmic ether?

740
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,080
Also would like to know the Greeks take

741
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,320
on the Trinity the Christians are always talking

742
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:31,680
about.

743
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,240
You could skip that one.

744
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,180
But yeah, the Trinity is something that's better.

745
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,860
Let's go backwards, because it is backwards.

746
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,160
There's no Trinity in the Bible.

747
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,540
It was injected later in one of the

748
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,480
New Testament books.

749
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,720
The Trinity, there's nothing wrong with that.

750
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,520
But if you study, let's say, let's say

751
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,700
the biblical Trinity, it's not father, son, Holy

752
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,540
Spirit, because the spirit is, is not, it's

753
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,120
not tangible.

754
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,780
It's the mind of the Godhead, right?

755
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,620
Spirit is mind.

756
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,160
So the real Trinity, believe it or not,

757
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,900
if you were to make it tangible and

758
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,320
have a real Trinity from a religious perspective,

759
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,160
theological perspective, let's say, by the way, religion

760
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,400
and theology are not the same.

761
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,320
And right.

762
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,440
So think about that for a minute.

763
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,220
You could pause and think about that and

764
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,320
in three hours, hit play again.

765
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,080
But anyway, yeah, religion and theology are not

766
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,400
the same.

767
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,740
The real Trinity is, you're ready, father, son

768
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,760
and man.

769
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,800
That's the real Trinity.

770
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,620
Right in the middle.

771
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,780
So yeah.

772
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,240
Anyway.

773
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,860
So OK, let's put that one aside.

774
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,320
What was the first part of the question?

775
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:33,980
Oh, yeah.

776
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,480
Back on the first part of the question

777
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,540
was they'd like to get a sonic dedicated

778
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,500
to better understanding the ether.

779
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,200
Oh, my gosh.

780
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,300
OK, what I would like to say on

781
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,600
that is, can you use something when you

782
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,180
don't really fully understand it?

783
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:47,920
Answer is yes.

784
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,360
Forget about all the mumbo jumbo and academic

785
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:51,800
bullshit.

786
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:55,480
Ask any physicist or electrical engineer or electrician,

787
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,920
electrical engineer, electronics engineer, what electricity is.

788
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,300
And you're going to get if you ask

789
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,160
100 people, you're going to get 100 variations

790
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:03,820
of something.

791
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:08,180
And you're going to say basically the the

792
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:11,560
most technical term to describe what all these

793
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,180
people that I asked what electricity was, was

794
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:14,740
bullshit.

795
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,500
None of them know.

796
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,300
But do we still use it?

797
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,280
Because we don't fully understand it, does it

798
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,760
mean we can't use it?

799
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,280
No.

800
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,440
And we do use it.

801
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,560
So and by the way, I mentioned electricity

802
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,420
is because you cannot understand electricity without comprehending

803
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:31,880
the ether.

804
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:35,940
And the electricity that we use is pressurized,

805
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:40,520
magnetically pressurized ether, static electricity.

806
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,680
And what makes the static electricity is the

807
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:45,960
ether.

808
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,200
The ether is not purely electric as there's

809
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,440
the five ethers you could look it up.

810
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,440
What are the five ethers?

811
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,840
You know, there's the life ether, chemical ether,

812
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,460
the heat ether, the light ether.

813
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:57,440
Right.

814
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,660
I think I left one out.

815
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,320
Yes, you did.

816
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,660
Yeah, they have different colors associated.

817
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,640
This was like a very much a Rudolf

818
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,040
Steiner.

819
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,920
Rudolf Steiner had a secretary and he wrote

820
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,760
the book after Steiner died, because Steiner was

821
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,340
such an asshole.

822
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,220
Oops, did I just say that?

823
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:15,000
He was afraid of over over criticism, you

824
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,560
know, Steiner would step on him so hard.

825
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:19,860
But anyway, I don't remember the name of

826
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:20,280
the book.

827
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,820
It's Man or Matter is something similar to

828
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,280
that.

829
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,400
Man or Matter, M A T T E

830
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:28,580
R.

831
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:32,060
You can get into ethereal experiments.

832
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,660
There's ethereal experiments that were done that were

833
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,580
supposedly debunked and whatever.

834
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,180
But they they redid them.

835
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,580
And there is an ether shift.

836
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,820
So that's all I'm saying.

837
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,540
All this stuff, it's like who who knows

838
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,360
what it is.

839
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,000
And I've mentioned before, we may never know

840
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,940
in this state that we're in because it's

841
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:54,040
really like a primary thing.

842
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,500
Like if you are a video game or

843
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,980
a video character, it's really hard to discuss

844
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,640
the pixels.

845
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:03,180
We cannot objectify it, but we can use

846
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:03,600
it.

847
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,320
And anyone who's been around for the weather

848
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:12,800
work webinar that I did can attest to

849
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,340
the fact that it is accessible.

850
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:15,260
Right.

851
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,760
I don't know.

852
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,600
Cosmic ether.

853
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,520
When you say cosmic, typically meaning all the

854
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,200
stuff out there.

855
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,820
When we say cosmos is a Greek word,

856
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,660
just means world.

857
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,220
But cosmic from the if you grew up

858
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,760
in the 70s, wherever billions and billions and

859
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,400
billions of.

860
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,120
Right.

861
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,360
So that was the Carl Sagan joke out

862
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,380
there.

863
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,080
I'll tell you what, though.

864
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:40,660
Tesla, the writings, which are very few of

865
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,880
his writings are on the Internet.

866
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,520
But I remember reading a bunch of Tesla

867
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,660
from Joe Blankenship's notes, whom he met Tesla

868
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,600
when he was a young man and then

869
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,680
people that were around Tesla and Tesla pretty

870
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,620
much figured out in his mind, he had

871
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:58,760
a very good mind that as you go

872
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,320
further up, like vertically in elevation and out

873
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,800
of atmosphere and so on and so forth,

874
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,620
the ether is more dense and more dense

875
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:08,300
and more dense to the point where, for

876
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,840
example, let's say you were able to go

877
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,520
to the moon.

878
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,840
It would be like walking through mud or

879
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,420
eventually it would be so dense to you

880
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,260
that it would be try to burrow through

881
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,140
a piece of steel.

882
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:20,580
You couldn't move.

883
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,280
And but you can see right through it.

884
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,380
See, that's also what makes gravity.

885
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,760
The ether is dense out there.

886
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,980
The earth is in a vacuum and it's

887
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:30,080
rushing in, pushing everything down.

888
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,280
So, oh, my gosh, I just had like

889
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,720
a whatever explosion.

890
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,640
What is the ether?

891
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,920
I can go on for four hours.

892
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:36,500
Stop it.

893
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,840
Where's the pause button on me?

894
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,760
OK, let's pause that because you did bring

895
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,280
up weather work and somebody did ask something

896
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,680
about they wanted to get their eight year

897
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,980
old involved in weather work.

898
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,640
And I thought that was kind of an

899
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,680
interesting thought.

900
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,100
But how would you start an eight year

901
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,320
old off on weather work?

902
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,700
The concept.

903
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:58,560
Well, eight year olds love seeing moving pictures.

904
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,540
So go go to YouTube or whatever and

905
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:07,740
type in Trevor James Constable weather engineering or

906
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,940
you don't have you've put in weather engineering.

907
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:10,740
Scroll down.

908
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,580
There's a couple of forty five minute one

909
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,200
hour videos.

910
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,400
Sit and watch that.

911
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,380
And Trevor is a very explanatory.

912
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,220
And he brings up the ether.

913
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,700
And that would be a good place to

914
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,000
start.

915
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,320
OK, but about weather work, though, for me.

916
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,200
Yeah, that's weather work.

917
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:24,900
OK, OK.

918
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,140
I just want to make sure I understood

919
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,840
in a recent lookout for Charlie.

920
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,100
He says that the Shuman and I'm thinking

921
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:32,980
he means shaman.

922
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:37,160
But anyway, residence residence has been hijacked.

923
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:40,000
So any psychic readings these days are not

924
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,500
trustworthy.

925
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,740
Do you agree?

926
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,000
No.

927
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:49,100
Let's just say early German, let's say post

928
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,320
World War one, the Nazis, right?

929
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,340
The Germans.

930
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:57,280
They did a lot of stuff, even with

931
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:01,120
experimentation, let's say, of all sorts, natural frequencies,

932
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,080
electrical stuff, microwave stuff, time machines, on and

933
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:04,560
on and on.

934
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:08,000
And they found there's nothing to be found

935
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,160
in their writings of any significance of the

936
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:10,940
Shuman frequency.

937
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:11,800
And I agree.

938
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,280
The Shuman frequency is not is not relevant

939
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,560
that much.

940
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,120
And psychic, I believe, is when you're being

941
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:22,700
the ethereal beings or non-physical entities don't

942
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,360
know what to do with you anymore, what

943
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,520
kind of mind to give you.

944
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,180
So they send someone to you that makes

945
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,300
you opens up the psychic part of you.

946
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,340
And so then you could see what's going

947
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:32,900
on before.

948
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,000
Yeah, but it's possible everyone is the same

949
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,420
psychic ability, by the way.

950
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,540
Yeah, I think we talked about our previous

951
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,180
sonics, right?

952
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,360
When they can't anticipate you anymore, they send

953
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,980
someone that helps you become psychic.

954
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,220
So it's external, again, being psychic.

955
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,120
So I wouldn't it would be a no

956
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,680
and no on both of those aspects of

957
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,260
that question.

958
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,800
OK, fair enough.

959
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,840
Look, here's probably one of the last things

960
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,160
we're going to get to maybe today.

961
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,480
But the predominant force in the environment in

962
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:03,180
cold weather when organizing your eating through the

963
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,280
dark and this and that.

964
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,060
OK, hold on.

965
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,060
The reason I'm going to condense this to

966
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,640
touch, because there's basically saying, look, when it's

967
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,280
cold outside, you know, but it's warm inside.

968
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:15,440
That's two different environments that you're dealing with.

969
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,520
Which one really counts or do they both

970
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:17,900
count?

971
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,540
OK, good answer.

972
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,000
He answered the same thing, which.

973
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:24,280
OK, let's just take this really slow, because

974
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,220
this is the kind of reasoning we need

975
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:26,760
to apply.

976
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,860
And it's so basic.

977
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,080
Remember, we're mid-level, mid-range thinkers.

978
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,420
We don't comprehend the simple or the complex.

979
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,160
Either end of the spectrum eludes us.

980
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,960
What's bigger in mass and size the inside

981
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,040
of your space or the outside?

982
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,140
That's obvious.

983
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,660
OK, so what's going on outside?

984
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:52,200
What's going on inside is the immediate comfort

985
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,440
point, like scratching your nose.

986
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,420
Oh, that feels better.

987
00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:00,000
So when it's wintertime, that is the predominant

988
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,520
environmental condition.

989
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,720
And you go inside of your dwelling for

990
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,860
some comfort, right?

991
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,220
Right.

992
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:11,200
And that's that's really minimal compared to the

993
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,480
overbearing environmental condition.

994
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:18,920
And a good example is getting acclimated for

995
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,820
submariners.

996
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,660
Submariners think of the conditions.

997
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,560
Yeah, well, they're fine in the boat.

998
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,540
They call it a boat.

999
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,980
It's called the boat and they're fine in

1000
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:28,160
there.

1001
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,640
But their bodies change very much according to

1002
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,320
where they are in the depths of the

1003
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,920
of the water and how they're trying to

1004
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,900
how fast it's traveling.

1005
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,260
A lot of health issues, by the way,

1006
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,500
with submariners because of that.

1007
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,760
And it's never really been addressed.

1008
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,020
Well, they address the symptoms, right?

1009
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:47,220
Remember, all the pharmaceuticals address symptoms, not causes.

1010
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,120
Yeah, so well, that's always the purpose to

1011
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,420
mask the symptom as opposed to addressing the

1012
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,580
issue, which, by the way, somebody asked about

1013
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:57,080
parasites and look what kind of parasite.

1014
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,680
You got to be more specific.

1015
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:01,380
And also, if you don't understand the parasite,

1016
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,680
how are you going to understand how to

1017
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,200
kick it out?

1018
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,500
It was too tight.

1019
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,040
There's one that you that goes in through

1020
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,700
the GI tract, which is the mouth to

1021
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,120
the anus.

1022
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:09,820
Right.

1023
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,580
It goes in.

1024
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:13,220
It actually could go, but either way, it's

1025
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:13,680
external.

1026
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,520
And it's just like a choo-choo train

1027
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,280
going through the tunnel.

1028
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,260
Just like that.

1029
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:18,460
Right.

1030
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,980
And there's the other type of parasite that

1031
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:23,080
the body creates internally, just like in Star

1032
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:23,340
Trek.

1033
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:23,580
Right.

1034
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,740
They push the button, get on the what

1035
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,920
do they call the thing where they beam

1036
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,860
you the transporter pad?

1037
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,120
Yep.

1038
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:29,920
Yep.

1039
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,220
And they transport it.

1040
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,660
Actually, your body actually creates some of them.

1041
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,100
Yeah, that's a really bad signal.

1042
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,360
You know, just like in Star Trek, the

1043
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,620
transporter, whatever is on one side can be

1044
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,280
if it's broken down.

1045
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:42,540
Right.

1046
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,520
And then the signal is sent to the

1047
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,320
other side and it's reassembled.

1048
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:46,720
Right.

1049
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,040
Right.

1050
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,400
And it's an emergent.

1051
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,020
There's a lot of stuff, by the way.

1052
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,260
I've been speaking to some people in the

1053
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,560
media about emergence.

1054
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,940
Like they don't know how, for example, a

1055
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:00,600
very high quality stainless steel water bottle.

1056
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,020
You know, the you know, the big water

1057
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:02,540
bottle fad.

1058
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,040
People carry water bottles around.

1059
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,040
They protect it more than maybe, you know,

1060
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,540
years ago.

1061
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,719
That was more popular, maybe.

1062
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,159
Right.

1063
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,500
And all the stainless steel ones developed a

1064
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,800
real nasty fungus and mold and bacteria in

1065
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:13,920
them.

1066
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,980
And you're like, you know, why the glass

1067
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:17,860
doesn't do that.

1068
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:18,620
Right.

1069
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,560
It's because it's an emergent.

1070
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,440
In other words, it actually forms in the

1071
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,040
water because of the stainless steel.

1072
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,080
This is commonly known.

1073
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:28,580
And that's the only steel bottles develop that.

1074
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:29,699
Where does it come from?

1075
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,120
It's the same water that we put in

1076
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:32,920
plastic and glass.

1077
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:36,040
It doesn't form in those same condition because

1078
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:36,659
it's an emergent.

1079
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:38,820
You have emergence, things that just appear like

1080
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,300
biogenesis would be an idea.

1081
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,360
This is way this sounds so freaky, you

1082
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,340
know, to people.

1083
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,980
But it's you can experiment with it and

1084
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:47,840
see how it happens.
