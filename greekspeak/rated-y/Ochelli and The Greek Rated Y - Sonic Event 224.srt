1
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:10,600
Hey, here we are, Rated Y, once again,

2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,060
and we're going to continue with some other

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,700
questions, but hey, Greek, how are you?

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,740
I'm doing how I should be doing, being

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,440
the Greek, as they say, I'm always looking

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,620
for another thing to be called, whatever, just

7
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:24,980
don't call me late for dinner, as they

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:25,220
say.

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,340
I had a few thoughts I want to

10
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,460
bring up, because every so often, my interactions

11
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,540
with the humans gets to a point where

12
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,900
I have to relay stuff back, and here's

13
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,580
the thing, like, even in my relationship, you

14
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,540
know how people get heated and mad and

15
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,540
all that, say, I'm sorry, or whatever?

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,880
You've heard of that before, right?

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,500
You know, I didn't mean it, I even

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,980
tell, you know, my wife, I said, everything

19
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,980
I've ever told you is written in stone,

20
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,220
and I meant every word of it.

21
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,740
Maybe, the way I said it, I would

22
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,360
do it over again, but the message, yeah,

23
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,240
I wouldn't take that one thing back, never,

24
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,040
you know, the apology, the explanation is, it's

25
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,360
written in stone, if I say it, whatever,

26
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,760
unless it's information that I find that counters

27
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,680
previous information, then I have to edit, right?

28
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,820
But in personal situations with people, it's never

29
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,960
like, oh, I should have said, no, everything

30
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,740
I've ever said to anyone holds.

31
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,240
Maybe the delivery, right, because, you know, but

32
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,780
the actual content, like, for example, I had

33
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,260
someone that was interested in doing something with

34
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,880
me and then had a negative criticism, I

35
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,400
said, and?

36
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,840
And nothing, they were silent, so I was

37
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,000
like, OK, you know, I can't use that,

38
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,300
can't use you, because when you give a

39
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:44,540
criticism, the proper way is to give the

40
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,680
criticism and then why you're giving the criticism

41
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,060
and then how to fix it.

42
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,520
Well, we don't live in that kind of

43
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:49,800
society.

44
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,140
I'll tell you what kind of a society

45
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,120
we live in, especially 99 percent of the

46
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,300
people are probably Westerners, even in Europe, whatever

47
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,360
the Western culture.

48
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,580
So let me just imply it this way.

49
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,060
Let's use a couple of cliches that people

50
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:07,000
come to become to them, cultural norms and

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,180
things that they look down on.

52
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:09,460
Right.

53
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,360
Let me give you an example.

54
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,920
He's thirty five and he still lives with

55
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,760
his parents.

56
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,360
Right.

57
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,240
You've heard that before.

58
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,520
Right.

59
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,580
Or whatever.

60
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,300
And everyone's like, oh, that's so bad.

61
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:19,880
No, no, no.

62
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,720
In a culture that's not meant to be

63
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,780
divided, the strong culture, you will have two,

64
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,020
three, four generations living under one roof their

65
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:34,400
entire lives or the estate, the same property.

66
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,060
Right.

67
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,420
But what they do to weaken the culture,

68
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,920
the Western culture, you got to move out

69
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,680
when you're an adult.

70
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,500
And what does that do?

71
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,740
Are they usually ready?

72
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,680
Very few people are that are, you know,

73
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,780
that aren't well suited, still have to go

74
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,160
out because reputation being funny and you have

75
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,700
accepted the Western culture, because right now I

76
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,160
recently heard someone say, you know, I still

77
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,660
there's a high percentage of thirty five year

78
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,000
olds still live with their parents, you know,

79
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,700
and it's higher than ever been.

80
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,920
I said in certain Middle East cultures, let's

81
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,020
say, let's just use an example.

82
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:11,800
You'll have the newlyweds with the wife being

83
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,820
pregnant, living with the parents either side and

84
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,180
the grandma and the great grandma.

85
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,620
And that's it.

86
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,620
That they all stay together.

87
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:22,380
Right.

88
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,480
That's the idea to stay together.

89
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:24,840
Right.

90
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,380
So in the Western culture, they're like spread

91
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,020
them out thin.

92
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,060
Right.

93
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,340
And anything that they do normally or did

94
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,180
through the past that was supposed to be

95
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,640
a symbol of unity and strength, we're going

96
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,240
to turn it into something that they should

97
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,200
be ashamed of.

98
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,460
Give you another one.

99
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,120
Oh, he support or she supports him.

100
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:50,320
She does whatever cultures that were really strong

101
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,680
and held together had a thing that when

102
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,940
a couple got together and married, it's called

103
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:55,700
a dowry.

104
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,840
So when the man accepted the woman, a

105
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,880
woman's family accepted the woman's family gave the

106
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,440
man a dowry, which was either property or

107
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,160
money or animals, livestock, jewelry, whatever, of usually

108
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,700
of high net of high worth.

109
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,120
It was very expensive to marry off a

110
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,360
daughter.

111
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,100
That's why the remnant of all these old

112
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,100
cultures was, oh, no, you got all these

113
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:19,440
daughters.

114
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,680
How can we afford it?

115
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,200
A Westerner will think, well, do you feed

116
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,880
them just like the sons?

117
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:26,160
Right.

118
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,280
No, because in order to have them married,

119
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,040
you have to provide a dowry to have

120
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,900
a proper suitor.

121
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,760
Otherwise, you're going to marry them probably down

122
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,360
below your social level.

123
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,160
If you want to marry above your social

124
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,720
level, you have to be able to provide

125
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,020
a dowry.

126
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:41,620
It was a house.

127
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,820
You've heard of the term.

128
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,800
Obviously, most people that have studied any history

129
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,480
know about this, but I'm shocked to see

130
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,900
how many people don't know it.

131
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,340
So sadly, it's even in the poor versions

132
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,480
of the biblical text where you see dowries

133
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,740
being exchanged.

134
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,720
And, you know, in this case, that's right.

135
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,600
And usually when you marry, when the male

136
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,060
marries below his level, the dowry is even

137
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:02,400
bigger.

138
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,840
It's like a tribute.

139
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,340
Yeah, because now he's taking on something that's

140
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,920
even worse into his family, actually.

141
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:09,420
Right.

142
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,040
And usually it's the female.

143
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,600
The woman has the better of the even

144
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,380
though her family provided the male with all

145
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,500
this small fortune.

146
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,760
She is better off because now she's married

147
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,120
up into a higher whatever.

148
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:23,740
Right.

149
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,040
So they're elevated and then their children then

150
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,840
hopefully go a little high.

151
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,820
OK, that's why when I used to mentor

152
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:33,020
young men, I used to say you never

153
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,360
meet a woman or a girl in a

154
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,140
laundromat.

155
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,240
And they're like, why is this?

156
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,960
Because if she can't afford a washer and

157
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,320
dryer, how the fuck is she going to

158
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:42,940
support you?

159
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,940
But anyway, I use the medical term there.

160
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:46,080
Right.

161
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,520
And that shocks people.

162
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,020
Right.

163
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,800
I have to support after World War Two.

164
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,360
Oh, you could work a regular job like

165
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,180
a postman after World War Two in the

166
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,820
1950s or a garbage man or a schoolteacher

167
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,380
and afford to buy a house and put

168
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,500
your kids through college one.

169
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,620
And the woman didn't have to work or

170
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:05,860
whatever.

171
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,200
There's nothing to do with that.

172
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,940
There's nothing to do with the woman working.

173
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,640
It has to do how she brought enough

174
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,580
to keep to create a small fortune so

175
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,660
the household can continue.

176
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,300
This was, by the way, in ancient and

177
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,080
and with the young people, by the way,

178
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,160
when I speak to young people, I like

179
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,100
to give them like these antidotes, like you

180
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,940
never meet a woman in a laundromat.

181
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:26,400
Why?

182
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,180
Because how is she going to support you

183
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,420
if she can't afford a washer and a

184
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:30,680
dryer?

185
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:31,580
Right.

186
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,500
That shocks them.

187
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,980
You wouldn't believe the shock that they get

188
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,440
from that.

189
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:35,720
Right.

190
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,480
Nowadays, they would call it a life hack,

191
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,060
actually.

192
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:38,440
Right.

193
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,840
It's one of those things that cut the

194
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,820
shortcut to get to the right result.

195
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:42,720
Yeah.

196
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,680
And all these things come from the weight

197
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,560
when I say, OK, cultures that did this

198
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,540
with all the things that I've mentioned live

199
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,680
with their parents their whole lives and grandparents.

200
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,220
By the way, I remember even from the

201
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,900
Greek traditional, you had a three family house

202
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,020
and the the youngest family lived on the

203
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:00,620
bottom floor.

204
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,620
The oldest family live on the bottom floor.

205
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:03,920
And as you got up to the same

206
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,780
family, as you got up to the top

207
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,780
of the house, it was the younger.

208
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,060
Right.

209
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,460
Because of the rate, the younger people lived

210
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:09,960
upstairs.

211
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:10,540
Right.

212
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,280
And it was it was a friend of

213
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:13,380
mine.

214
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,960
It was his parents, him and his sister.

215
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,900
Below that was the aunt, his sister also

216
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,620
living in the house, his aunt, the aunt

217
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,600
of the father and the grandparents and great

218
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,960
grandparents living together.

219
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:26,360
Right.

220
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,180
And sometimes it was mixed.

221
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,560
And that was not good when you had

222
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,980
like her parents and your parents together.

223
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,960
Oh, that was usually a bad situation.

224
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,420
Yeah.

225
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,040
For some reason, for some reason.

226
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,680
So these things and also, you know, the

227
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,960
woman providing a dowry or small fortune to

228
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,920
be all these things were norms and something

229
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,900
called you ready?

230
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,780
The Ottoman Empire, which lasted how many centuries?

231
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,160
Conservatively, four or five centuries.

232
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,460
Conservatively, it was common.

233
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,060
And have you ever heard of these epochs

234
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,920
and eras where these empires lasted for centuries?

235
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,140
That's what they did.

236
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,320
That's what they did.

237
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:04,820
Right.

238
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,620
So right now you're in Europe where everything

239
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,460
they put out is to weaken you culturally,

240
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,540
socially, mentally or need to say anymore.

241
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,120
The Internet.

242
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:13,600
Right.

243
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,860
The Internet, the heyday, the Internet, what would

244
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,760
you say ended about 2013, roughly?

245
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,580
Or maybe.

246
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,220
Yeah.

247
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:19,540
Yeah.

248
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,740
So right now it's not a tool.

249
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,960
Archaic's did a video recently and it promised

250
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,880
you as information, but it's really a surveillance

251
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,580
and power trip.

252
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,200
They're power tripping with the Internet now.

253
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:29,480
Right.

254
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,039
So, you know, so that was a decent

255
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,919
video, Jason, I caught recently.

256
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:36,020
Not the recent one, but I don't know,

257
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,100
recent like week or so.

258
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,679
So kudos to that.

259
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,460
He was it was like a ranty video.

260
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,179
And I like it when people rant, because,

261
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,800
for example, you know, you can't prescript a

262
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,100
rant.

263
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:46,620
A rant.

264
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,480
You ever notice that?

265
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,320
Oh, I know.

266
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,220
I don't prescript any of my shows, actually.

267
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,200
No, I mean, a good rant can't be

268
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,900
prescripted.

269
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,060
Imagine you gave someone a script.

270
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,360
So I want you to rant that it's

271
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,600
not going to come out like a rant.

272
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,740
No, it's under something natural that has to

273
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,780
be there or unscripted.

274
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,340
And like I say, from the heart.

275
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,620
So I just wanted to bring up those

276
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:04,840
points.

277
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,260
I could keep going for I could do

278
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,960
hundreds of points on this and what's going

279
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,300
on.

280
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,160
Another.

281
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,580
Well, let me do one more, because I've

282
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,480
been dealing a lot with the engineering side.

283
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,060
A lot of people always say it'll say

284
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,020
if you do this or whatever, improve, it'll

285
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:17,900
save you money.

286
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,320
Never do anything for the economic reason alone.

287
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,260
That's how you get in trouble.

288
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:24,660
Right.

289
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:25,860
Ask the mob.

290
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,720
You know, everyone thinks the mob is wealthy.

291
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,620
They might have a fancy house and a

292
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:34,560
car, but they're they're barely eking by general

293
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,040
consensus.

294
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,380
There are some of them that were making

295
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,280
a million dollars a day in the eighties.

296
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:39,920
Right.

297
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,900
But, you know, there is a difference between

298
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,820
the mob that people know and the real

299
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,120
thing.

300
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,520
And, you know, like like the truth is

301
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,520
La Cosa Nostra, right?

302
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,240
They go because that's the mafia.

303
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,580
Now, because that thing, first of all, you're

304
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,300
pronouncing it wrong.

305
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:57,140
But secondly, because I do understand Sicilian when

306
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,380
it's spoken to me, usually if it's done

307
00:09:59,380 --> 00:09:59,840
properly.

308
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,580
But here's the thing.

309
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,300
That's not those are street guys.

310
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,500
You see the names, you know, these are

311
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,340
the ignorant, illiterate guys that they bring in

312
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,920
because they're useful as foot soldiers.

313
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,560
And that's it.

314
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,380
The people that control stuff.

315
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,800
There's eight organizations in Italy alone and their

316
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,480
fraternities.

317
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,020
Think of them as the Freemasons who act.

318
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,000
They're slow moving their fraternities.

319
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,020
And yeah, and the poor and the guys

320
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,000
that you see getting busted.

321
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,660
I don't care if it's John Gotti or

322
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,980
Sammy the Bull or freaking.

323
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:28,720
Yeah, I don't know.

324
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:28,920
Yeah.

325
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,880
They are the lowest.

326
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:30,840
Yeah.

327
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,520
When we say if you heard their name,

328
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,240
seen their face and know that they're not

329
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:35,740
that they're not.

330
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,600
They're not the guys.

331
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,760
And there's eight organizations over there that I

332
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,220
know of.

333
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,880
And look, the one that everybody thinks is

334
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,420
the mafia is not has never even in

335
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,700
its entire history been in the top three

336
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,320
of those organizations size wise, riches wise, army

337
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:50,660
wise.

338
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:50,980
Nothing.

339
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:51,600
Yeah.

340
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,500
And it's not an Italian organization, by the

341
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:54,760
way.

342
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,820
It's an international.

343
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,080
It's just like intelligence agencies.

344
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,280
It's not CIA.

345
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,260
And here, by the way, Korea has the

346
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,340
CIA also.

347
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,140
It's called the CIA.

348
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,060
No, but there is one specifically based in

349
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:05,400
Sicily.

350
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,060
I'll tell you that.

351
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,020
Yeah.

352
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,560
But what I mean is they all have

353
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,840
an international grouping, just like all the religions

354
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,900
kiss the Pope's ring.

355
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,140
Right.

356
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,200
Well, of course, just like the brilliance of

357
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,640
BlackRock.

358
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,660
What is the point of owning everything on

359
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,000
the planet?

360
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,260
You don't need to just own a piece

361
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:18,740
of everything.

362
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,280
Well, that's the whole thing.

363
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,940
Well, you own what controls it.

364
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,460
They're holding the control of it.

365
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:24,700
Yeah.

366
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,840
So it's interesting.

367
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,940
And that's you know, here's one thing in

368
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,260
one's life I would suggest.

369
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,400
And I want to just it's are you

370
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,180
in control?

371
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,140
And, you know, when you're in control, two

372
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,260
ways, the two things, when you know what

373
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,880
your needs are and what your wants are,

374
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,480
if you can stop mixing what you need

375
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,080
and what you want and see the difference,

376
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,760
you're going to have full control over your

377
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,100
life.

378
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:47,800
Right.

379
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,480
So, for example, like one thing, what do

380
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:50,820
you want?

381
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,760
I don't want anything.

382
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,540
I have needs.

383
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,760
And what are your needs?

384
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,620
Well, first of all, if you can tell

385
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,500
me like this thing here, my midsection called

386
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,100
a stomach, when it starts growling and feeling

387
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,920
painful, do you have something I can do

388
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,400
for that other than getting food?

389
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,420
They're like, no, you need food for that.

390
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:05,640
Yeah.

391
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,440
Well, OK, then that there's one of my

392
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:07,820
needs.

393
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:08,680
All right.

394
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,760
Because I can't stand it when it's right.

395
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,060
Food is a need.

396
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,000
Yes, it is.

397
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,180
Yeah.

398
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,500
So that's a need, isn't it?

399
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:14,780
Yeah.

400
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,940
When it's raining outside, I'll catch pneumonia and

401
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,380
die if it's raining for a couple of

402
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,160
days and it's cold.

403
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,860
We have a fix for that.

404
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,660
Yeah, it's called shelter.

405
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,260
OK, there is my need.

406
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,840
You're going to pass out.

407
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,100
Yeah.

408
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,040
So shelter, no matter what the condition is,

409
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,220
when it's really cold outside, really cold, I

410
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,900
might get frozen and die of frostbite.

411
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,100
Do you have a fix for that?

412
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:35,660
Right.

413
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,740
It's called shelter.

414
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:37,120
Right.

415
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,380
OK, so let's see our needs now.

416
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,820
Now, first of all, if I walk down

417
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,220
the street naked, I'll probably get it'll be

418
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,460
a public nuisance, right?

419
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,100
Indecency.

420
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,000
So you have a fix for that.

421
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:46,700
Yeah, you need clothes.

422
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,940
It's a public nuisance.

423
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,840
It's not exactly the most efficient way to

424
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,700
travel either, because, you know, clothing is just

425
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,780
a good idea because skin just gets banged

426
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,560
up against the wall.

427
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,260
But what I'm saying is if you don't

428
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,300
know the difference between your wants and your

429
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,920
needs, start asking people about things that you're

430
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,180
experiencing and what their solution would be.

431
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,320
And if you get three people saying the

432
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,360
same thing, like this midsection near my stomach,

433
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,480
when it growls and it feels painful, it's

434
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,000
called hunger.

435
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,940
Do you have a fix for that?

436
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,580
Yeah, it's called food.

437
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,800
And they all say you need food for

438
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,040
that.

439
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:14,960
Guess what?

440
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:15,920
That's a need.

441
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,080
But if you have a want, like what

442
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,820
color Camaro can they get?

443
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,120
Hey, Benny, get the Iraq.

444
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,440
Which color Camaro?

445
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,920
And you get three different colors.

446
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:25,440
Guess what?

447
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:26,960
That's not a need.

448
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,040
Right.

449
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:32,200
When the options when things become optional, it's

450
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,900
not a need.

451
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,700
It's a want.

452
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,140
Now, what is that?

453
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:35,360
Right.

454
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,840
Let me just bring this one more thing

455
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,740
before we continue.

456
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,040
As the relationship keeps coming over, I have

457
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,560
a someone that messages me and I said

458
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,560
I'll address what you're saying.

459
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,820
The email was not that long, but it

460
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,920
was basically kind of like maybe a mixed

461
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,800
relationship where one person they're in a relationship,

462
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,120
but one person hasn't fully legally left the

463
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,480
other one, even though they're they're estranged.

464
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,180
Right.

465
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,800
Like, you know, for example, there are people

466
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,620
that go into legal matrimony for for many

467
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:06,380
reasons, become estranged, you know, for many reasons.

468
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,540
So how does that deal?

469
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,440
Well, first of all, I want to mention

470
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,820
any legal marriage that is going on today.

471
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,080
And I think they've adopted this in other

472
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,660
cultures besides the Western culture is a business.

473
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,580
It's a three way business.

474
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,920
So when the when the marriage, for example,

475
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:26,020
the legal marriage is separated, that three way

476
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,540
business is no longer a three way.

477
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,620
So the third party, meaning the state or

478
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,940
the authority that married you now wants to

479
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,600
pull out all of their shares.

480
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,420
So they take a third in the form

481
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,100
of a tax, however they can.

482
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:37,380
Right.

483
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,540
Because remember, it's a three way third, third

484
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:39,920
and third.

485
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:44,420
Right now, that's that's all that is.

486
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:48,920
There is nothing honorable about being legally married.

487
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,020
Actually, it's the opposite.

488
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:50,600
I like Brandon.

489
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,060
Joe Williams says one of the most evil

490
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,420
things anyone can do is get a legal

491
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,000
thing.

492
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,720
But even Jordan Maxwell, even Jordan Maxwell used

493
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,180
to talk about this, how that's just a

494
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:00,900
legal construct.

495
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,280
That's your business between the two of you.

496
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:03,660
It's a business.

497
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,300
It's a business arrangement.

498
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,220
And that's all it is.

499
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,540
And that's why when you affect that arrangement,

500
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,220
the state wants its third out of it,

501
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,300
however it can get it.

502
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:13,520
Right.

503
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,120
Oh, yeah.

504
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:14,900
Yeah.

505
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,400
So but here's the other part of it.

506
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,620
And when you produce children, according to that

507
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:23,000
legal situation, it is a product of the

508
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,300
marriage.

509
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,820
Literally, that's the wording used.

510
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,160
And I know that because that's right.

511
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,700
And the state has a third of that

512
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,020
child.

513
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,660
But you like in Solomon, you can't cut

514
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,460
the baby in half.

515
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,740
So they take the whole thing whole.

516
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,520
You see what I mean?

517
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:32,800
Right.

518
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:34,660
They right.

519
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,920
So and also they look at you as

520
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,280
one.

521
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,080
And right.

522
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,460
So anyway, that whole thing with the legal

523
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:45,280
side of it is actually an abomination on

524
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,180
many levels, unless you accept servitude and slavery.

525
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,860
Because remember, when you're a slave, you automatically

526
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,740
take on the religion of your owner.

527
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,620
Number one.

528
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,920
Number two, you have to have permissions and

529
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,100
licenses for everything.

530
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,680
And I used to do research.

531
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:03,460
What's called the slave codes of 1750.

532
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,080
Cannot find them on the Internet, no matter

533
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,980
how hard you try.

534
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,260
They were very prominent when you searched for

535
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,640
the uniform slave codes of 1750, because all

536
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,520
of the different states, by the way, the

537
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,940
slave trade has always been illegal.

538
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,280
Right.

539
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,000
And so basically having slaves and trading them

540
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,300
was the black market.

541
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,980
It's like what the cartels and the sheriffs

542
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,880
do now, for example.

543
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:23,360
Yes.

544
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,640
But anyway, that was that.

545
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,600
Let me give you an example.

546
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,860
Like Diogenes, the philosopher, he says.

547
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,980
Anyone want to buy in ancient Greece, just

548
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,440
like today, when you were convicted of a

549
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,240
crime, you were a slave and sold this

550
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:39,460
one.

551
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:39,700
Right.

552
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,980
And today it's in the Constitution.

553
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,300
You know, slavery, unless you're convicted of a

554
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:43,580
crime.

555
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,980
So technically and legally, everyone in prison that's

556
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,960
supposedly convicted with a crime, which is not

557
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,160
even legal anyway, they can't do it legally.

558
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,700
They just convince you that it is.

559
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,560
They're all actually technically slaves.

560
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,280
But Diogenes says, you know, you can buy

561
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:57,820
a master.

562
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,840
He told someone, hey, why don't you why

563
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,500
don't you buy and say if you can't

564
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,319
afford it, if you don't want to buy

565
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:06,520
a slave, why don't you buy being a

566
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:06,859
master?

567
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,819
And he says, how do I do this

568
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,540
is when you buy a slave, you're actually

569
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,000
now a master, aren't you?

570
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,160
So I convinced him back again because he

571
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,680
wanted to decide who bought him.

572
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:15,980
Right.

573
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,960
Because you anyway, it sounds better in Greek.

574
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,180
I understand, though.

575
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:20,579
Yeah.

576
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:21,660
You can buy a slave or you could

577
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,599
buy being a master.

578
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,140
And it's the same process.

579
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,240
You do both by buying a slave.

580
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,700
So, yeah.

581
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,960
So anyway, this this is without getting too

582
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,860
much into relationships again and all that the

583
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,820
legal stuff is actually abominable in many.

584
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,240
But again, just like it's the opposite.

585
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,980
If you tell people he's thirty five and

586
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,400
lives with his parents, that's abominable.

587
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,840
And I'm telling you, it's they should that's

588
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,700
not abominable.

589
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,860
That's actually how you build a strong society.

590
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,480
So everything is backwards.

591
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,340
The other thing I would mention about relationships

592
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,520
is like even in my relationship, I would

593
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,300
say I'm learning I'm going to learn to

594
00:17:59,300 --> 00:17:59,700
love you.

595
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,320
And she's like, what do you mean you're

596
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,240
going to learn to love me?

597
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,340
What does that mean?

598
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,920
Well, then I've gone over this right.

599
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,080
Like falling in love.

600
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:06,340
Right.

601
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,400
Actually, it's backwards.

602
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,280
You fall in the ditch, fall in love,

603
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:09,980
fall for that.

604
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:10,780
You fell for that.

605
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,040
Right.

606
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,060
Doesn't sound good.

607
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,180
But you fall in love is good.

608
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,600
And it starts off high on the curve.

609
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,680
And then what happens as time goes down

610
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,640
on the curve goes down, down, down, down,

611
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,000
down, and you hear people say, oh, we

612
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,560
want to rekindle our marriage.

613
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,780
We want to rekindle.

614
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,440
We're going on this where we went to

615
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,200
rekindle, make things more exciting.

616
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:29,560
Why?

617
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,560
Why do you need these external stimuluses?

618
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,980
Why don't you decide to constantly make it

619
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,280
better?

620
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,020
Right.

621
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:38,860
So the other thing is find someone who's

622
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,260
trainable and who works both ways.

623
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,820
If you have a set of ways that

624
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,340
are better.

625
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:43,820
Right.

626
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,100
Find someone who will accept that because they're

627
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,140
objectively better.

628
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,300
They objectify better.

629
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,720
Like when they have a cold in the

630
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,940
winter, they don't know what to do.

631
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,080
But you do every time your ways are

632
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:53,400
better.

633
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,020
Right.

634
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:54,780
Very simple.

635
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,620
They're very objective.

636
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,020
So and then see if they're trainable.

637
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,960
But again, these things are changeable.

638
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,440
If someone is trainable, it means that you

639
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,120
can change them.

640
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:04,620
Right.

641
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,580
But if you find something personally repulsive, like

642
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:12,220
let's say you don't like you want guys

643
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,800
with a big nose, don't get a guy

644
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,660
with a small nose.

645
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,760
If you like women with small feet, don't

646
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,240
get a woman big feet because you can't

647
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:19,800
change that.

648
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,440
And it's going to be detestable to you.

649
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,540
And eventually it's going to come out and

650
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,680
you're going to be unhappy.

651
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:30,620
So very basically, whoever you're in a relationship

652
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,680
with, make sure I'm not saying that they're

653
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,100
attractive.

654
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,620
I'm just saying nothing repugnant to you.

655
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,140
Remember, I didn't say fine, beautiful, but nothing

656
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:42,120
that's repulsive to you, which is different.

657
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,580
So if it's not repulsive, it's acceptable.

658
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:45,260
Right.

659
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:45,540
Right.

660
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,920
And then when you learn to love that

661
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,420
person and the training goes back and forth,

662
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,400
guess what happens?

663
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,600
Everything about them is beautiful and lovely.

664
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,360
Right.

665
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,140
So this is basically it's so basic.

666
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,380
It's beyond imagination.

667
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,480
That's why I assure you anyone who thinks

668
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,240
they're going to go to a modern psychologist,

669
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,880
marriage therapy, none of that works.

670
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,960
And now you feel like it works because

671
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,800
you get like a dopamine thing when you

672
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,460
talk about it.

673
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,300
We talked about psychological issues, spiritual issues are

674
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,460
never resolved by talking about them at all.

675
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,400
So that's another discussion.

676
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,820
We've gone into that in the previous Sonics

677
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,680
we might revisit, but that might have been

678
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,560
a little ranty.

679
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:26,840
Right.

680
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,720
The past time I've been speaking, let's stop

681
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,540
and go back to the questions continued from

682
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,160
the last time.

683
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,500
OK, that's where you want to go.

684
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,540
That's where we'll go.

685
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:35,940
Let's see.

686
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,340
This is a part of a series of

687
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:39,740
questions.

688
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,420
So they said question number two, where's it

689
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:42,640
at?

690
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:42,960
Oops.

691
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,700
Hold on a second.

692
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,940
I got to get my little screen shot

693
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,280
and that's fine because I want to read

694
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,200
it directly and make sure I don't skip

695
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,740
anything that they were trying to put in.

696
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,160
Let's see.

697
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:52,620
Oh, OK.

698
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,780
This is about crap.

699
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,240
Crap.

700
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,280
I always mispronounce that that that crap stuff

701
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,160
that you like.

702
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,340
Yeah.

703
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,660
A lot of people like it.

704
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,760
It's actually quite effective.

705
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,380
It's an opioid, by the way.

706
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,600
For those that don't know, look it up.

707
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:04,900
K.

708
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:05,660
R.

709
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:05,900
A.

710
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,120
T.

711
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:06,300
U.

712
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:06,460
M.

713
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,680
Do you have any good recipe to make

714
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,700
it more tasty?

715
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,420
They're asking.

716
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,980
One time I was at a bar in

717
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,400
Thailand where they mix it with ginger, lemon

718
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,380
and sparkling water and it tasted very delicious.

719
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,280
But they were wondering if you had a

720
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:19,940
particular recipe.

721
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:20,440
Yes.

722
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,340
Yes.

723
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,880
And the recipe is more of a method.

724
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,920
Now, if you have something that doesn't taste

725
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,700
good, why dilute it in something where it

726
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,560
takes longer to get it into your body?

727
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:30,300
Right.

728
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,500
So do you know why, like a hard

729
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,960
liquor is in a shot glass and you

730
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,800
shoot it down right away?

731
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,940
You don't sip it, do you?

732
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,260
No.

733
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:36,600
Right.

734
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,780
OK, because it's the effect that you're going

735
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,140
after.

736
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:39,400
Right.

737
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:42,580
And then eventually afterwards, the actual downing a

738
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,620
shot is in itself a thing that you

739
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:45,960
enjoy.

740
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,740
But in the beginning, you want to get

741
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,380
it right down.

742
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,000
So what I do is I have a

743
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,800
very small spoon.

744
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,180
It's literally an eighth of a teaspoon.

745
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,000
It's actually a little tiny wooden spoon.

746
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,200
And I scoop that up and I put

747
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,380
it right on the tongue and follow it

748
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,520
with a warm drink, non acidic coffee or

749
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,640
tea and not cold.

750
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,720
Boom down.

751
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:07,380
So the whole event of being exposed, olfactory

752
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:10,480
and taste to the kratom is no more

753
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,000
than a second and a half.

754
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,080
You start putting that stuff in drinks and

755
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,060
not only have you diluted it, any acidity

756
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,060
counters it.

757
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,020
Do you remember there was the baking soda

758
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,560
cure for people a while back, 10, 15

759
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,060
years ago?

760
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,980
And then I got a lot of trouble

761
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,680
for the whole cancer cure with baking.

762
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,760
So, yeah, well, the cancer is actually a

763
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,000
blessing.

764
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,280
We talked about it because if you didn't

765
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,640
get cancer, that means you would have died

766
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,440
in your sleep.

767
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,660
Cancer means it's a roadblock to prevent more

768
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,200
accidents.

769
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:36,980
Yeah, I get it.

770
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,220
I was just referencing the.

771
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:38,760
Yeah.

772
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,820
But what they did was said, mix it

773
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,240
with maple syrup and other stuff that maple

774
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,420
syrup cancels out the effects of the baking

775
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:45,780
soda.

776
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,020
By the way, the reason you want the

777
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,820
baking soda is it's an alkaline which will

778
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,560
throw the body into induction to produce acid,

779
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,560
to balance it out.

780
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:55,360
Right.

781
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,520
And people think of the outcome.

782
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,760
They think it's alkaline water and alkaline.

783
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,800
Your body is good because you want to

784
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,220
be alkaline.

785
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,520
No, your body wants to be neutral.

786
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,800
So produces acid in order for it to

787
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,500
produce acid.

788
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,640
It will pull from the acidic nature that

789
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,260
it already has and deplete it.

790
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,500
You see how it works.

791
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,860
But anyway, that's OK.

792
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,400
If they want to keep it simple and

793
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,440
they want to be alkaline, that's fine.

794
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,900
But they don't understand the mechanism.

795
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,900
Now, the same thing with the kratom.

796
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:19,700
It's an alkaline.

797
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,120
So the moment you mix it with.

798
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,040
Any kind of anything that has even the

799
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,380
slightest acidity, you need more of it, because

800
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,960
what happens when you neutralize something?

801
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,260
It's neutral.

802
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,180
You need more of it now to do

803
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,360
what you could have done with a little

804
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,100
bit in the beginning.

805
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,260
So that is the method slash.

806
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:35,960
You want to call it.

807
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:36,800
Is that a recipe?

808
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:37,880
Yeah.

809
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,780
Recipes have techniques and methods, don't they?

810
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,240
It's a methodology.

811
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,800
It's a methodology to make your own recipe,

812
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,780
which is probably better than giving somebody just

813
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,260
a recipe.

814
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,520
So the recipe would be take a straight

815
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,040
shot, put it in the mouth and the

816
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,840
very small spoon, slam it in here and

817
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,400
then slam it.

818
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,780
Have your drink ready first.

819
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,860
Couple of times I thought I had my

820
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,320
drink ready.

821
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,420
I slammed the powder and I was like,

822
00:23:59,460 --> 00:23:59,920
no drink.

823
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,220
Oh, this sucks.

824
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:02,580
This is terrible.

825
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,360
Now you got a mouthful of powder.

826
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,940
Yeah, that's bad.

827
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,620
So have your drink ready for.

828
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,920
And that's how I do it.

829
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,260
And that's all.

830
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,100
And I could extol the virtues of it

831
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,060
for those that enjoy it.

832
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,940
Some people cannot handle it at all.

833
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,160
If you can work with it, try it.

834
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,580
I'm not saying I'm not not endorsing it

835
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,400
as like is any.

836
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,660
You know, I'll never say this one thing

837
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,840
does everything right.

838
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,060
Yeah.

839
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,120
So for everyone, right.

840
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:29,760
There's no one.

841
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,960
I'll never have a one size fits all.

842
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,760
Yeah, there's no one size fits all for

843
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,480
everybody.

844
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,700
That's not possible.

845
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:38,000
So that's what I consider the method slash

846
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,380
recipe.

847
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,140
There you go.

848
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,220
OK.

849
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,720
If someone was to get a loan from

850
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,400
a private trust, would the holder of that

851
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,020
trust be able to access the borrower's line

852
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:48,640
of credit?

853
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,700
That was asked before it was.

854
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:52,720
Yeah.

855
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,580
Something similar might be a similar mindset.

856
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,100
I think it's a very complex question there

857
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,200
because new question.

858
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:02,040
Yeah, there really is no loan.

859
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,840
If you're lending, if you're borrowing from a

860
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,700
trust, you always you have to show proof

861
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,380
of funds.

862
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,180
OK, this is an easy way to do

863
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:10,400
it.

864
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,380
Think of money as if you're talking about

865
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,940
substance money, you know, like money and accounts

866
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:16,660
and stuff like that.

867
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,300
When you go to the store and you

868
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,560
want to acquire some oranges, don't you want

869
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,360
to look at them first?

870
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,940
I know now they do home delivery and

871
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,220
whatever, but you don't look at it.

872
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,900
But you want to look at the product

873
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,180
first.

874
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,700
So whenever you're going to go into business

875
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:32,000
with someone, someone like that person, legal entity,

876
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,120
ask them for proof of funds to show

877
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,840
they have in the account.

878
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,640
And then when they give you the loan,

879
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,500
show that that amount has been debited from

880
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,040
that account.

881
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,100
Banks can't do that, by the way, because

882
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,960
banks don't have any money to lend.

883
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,240
They just negotiate your instrument and it's in

884
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:45,860
the contract.

885
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,500
So a trust is a bank, but you're

886
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,920
not really borrowing ever from anyone.

887
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:56,120
They're an intermediary because Title 12, Section 1431

888
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:00,120
states powers and duties of banks is to

889
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,620
borrow money and pay interest and off issued

890
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,300
debentures.

891
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:07,460
And what I just say, the powers and

892
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,420
duties of the bank is to borrow money

893
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,080
and pay interest.

894
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,560
Where does it say they lend anything?

895
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,540
As a matter of fact, there's a bunch

896
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,320
of other codes that say that they can't

897
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,620
lend money on deposit from depositors accounts and

898
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,680
they can't lend credit.

899
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,020
So you're the one that puts you in

900
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,660
that situation when you're dealing with banks, by

901
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,120
the way, it's Halloween every day.

902
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,480
What Matt, what character are you playing today?

903
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,600
It's Halloween every day.

904
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,920
So a trust, I'm taking it.

905
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,780
That is not using is not banks are

906
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,600
intermediaries.

907
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:37,500
They're supposed to take your instrument, go to

908
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,500
the Treasury and come back for a fee,

909
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,200
give you the amount and it's done.

910
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,720
They don't do that.

911
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,340
They've been playing on your ignorance.

912
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,520
If you're going to a trust, like, for

913
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,980
example, I have a trust and it has

914
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:48,520
funds in it.

915
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,460
If someone says, can you lend me money

916
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,260
from the trust the way I would present,

917
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,700
have a trustee present an account, I would

918
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,080
put that money that they want in account,

919
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:57,740
show it there.

920
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,900
And then when I give it to them,

921
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,400
I would show that it's been transferred out

922
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,240
of the account and the balance that's left.

923
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,040
That's how people do business or whatever.

924
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,220
I always let when I did banking, let

925
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:11,280
the banks do my accounting so I didn't

926
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,640
have to write.

927
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,440
For example, when I had a client I

928
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,760
did consulting with and let's say I had

929
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,800
a 30 K fee.

930
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,220
I said, what are you going to do

931
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,060
is you're going to go open a bank

932
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,840
account and give me the card, put the

933
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,760
30 K in it.

934
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,580
So it's like escrow.

935
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,820
And I will let you know when I

936
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,840
pull funds out.

937
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,200
And when I do, because it's on a

938
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,860
bank card, you could look up online what

939
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,780
I pulled that day and for what and

940
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,280
for who.

941
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,000
Right.

942
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,260
Circle K, right.

943
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:39,920
Twenty eight bucks.

944
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,880
It'll show Circle K on the bank statement.

945
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,160
Right.

946
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,240
It'll show I went to this building supply.

947
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,880
It'll show I went to this or I

948
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,320
had to pay the architect to dupe the

949
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,020
cop, dupe the plans again.

950
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,300
So there's I don't have to tell you

951
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,020
what you know what I'm paying.

952
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,200
And then you know that everything that I

953
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,900
spend and what we agreed on, it's 15

954
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,020
percent on top of that.

955
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,960
So you can see in real time what

956
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,500
I'm spending.

957
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,880
And also, do I have to sit down

958
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,500
and do bookkeeping or accounting or I just

959
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,000
wait for the bank statement, actually do a

960
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,780
screenshot online?

961
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:09,980
Right.

962
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:10,380
Easy.

963
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,000
Right.

964
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,780
So that's just I've given this example to

965
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,760
someone who worked in Hollywood and stuff.

966
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,040
So that's a great idea because they did

967
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,080
like procurement and all that.

968
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,760
So you just you just open a bank

969
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,080
account.

970
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,200
I mean, bank accounts are open like, I

971
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,480
don't know, like movie tickets.

972
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,920
They're very easy.

973
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,480
And I'm not talking about doing it the

974
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,160
right way.

975
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,360
The right way is where you take control

976
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:29,660
of it.

977
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,660
But anyway, that's a very loaded, complex question,

978
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,300
because I need to know all trusts are

979
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:36,600
private.

980
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,300
So since you said a trust, by the

981
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:38,840
way, the banks.

982
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,720
Everything they do is the retail facade and

983
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,020
they have a trust in the background that

984
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,000
you never deal with.

985
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,780
You're only dealing with the retail side of

986
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:46,900
it.

987
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:47,160
Right.

988
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,480
So when you said trust, I'm presuming that

989
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,060
you're dealing with someone who has a trust

990
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,300
and that would be the way that it

991
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:52,840
would be done.

992
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,240
Proof of funds and then show the funds,

993
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,760
you know, the date and all that and

994
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,540
then whatever terms you have.

995
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,620
But if you're if you're trying to say

996
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,460
that a bank is a trust, it is.

997
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,140
But you'll never deal with that trust unless

998
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,320
you go through it directly.

999
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,880
And then they're going to tell you, what

1000
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,560
are you doing here?

1001
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,060
The entrance is that way.

1002
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:09,880
Right.

1003
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,140
Employees only kind of thing.

1004
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,060
So anyway, next question.

1005
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:15,880
Fair enough.

1006
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,100
All right.

1007
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,560
This one's going to get a little weird.

1008
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,860
Let me finish it because it goes back

1009
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,240
and forth and it's not my fault.

1010
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,640
You can skip it.

1011
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,540
You could paraphrase.

1012
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,360
Yeah, I'm going to.

1013
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,640
But still, this is going to be a

1014
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,040
little weird.

1015
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:30,560
OK.

1016
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,720
On the Pope's work schedule, you know, birthdays.

1017
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,120
Right.

1018
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,780
We don't have a lawful birthday because the

1019
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,100
Pope's work schedule is not long.

1020
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,100
You do.

1021
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,100
But it's not on the Pope's work schedule.

1022
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,920
You have to figure out using the moons

1023
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,720
and other things.

1024
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:44,220
OK.

1025
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,280
Which leads me to what time of day?

1026
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,920
Because remember, the day starts at noon.

1027
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,720
So if you were born at 10 p

1028
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,980
.m., they count you it as a certain

1029
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,260
day.

1030
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,120
But that day actually started at noon and

1031
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:53,580
at midnight.

1032
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,000
Right.

1033
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,160
Yeah.

1034
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,700
Did we answer the question?

1035
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:57,640
Almost.

1036
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:58,760
OK, cool.

1037
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,180
Next thing, my astrology hobby is based on

1038
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:04,640
using unlawful birthdays of folks.

1039
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,660
Hence, it is all crap.

1040
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,600
Got it.

1041
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,020
Got it.

1042
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,820
It's not all crap because their astrology is

1043
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,920
based around that.

1044
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,740
So you get it.

1045
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,020
So the only time it's messed up is

1046
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,400
if you're holding a map, you know, all

1047
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,100
maps oriented.

1048
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,140
So north is up.

1049
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,720
But if you hold the map upside down

1050
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,440
and you think you're use your compass now

1051
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,800
and you think the south side is north,

1052
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,780
you're going to be going in the wrong

1053
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,280
direction.

1054
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:29,660
Right.

1055
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,840
So the the current astrology has taken the

1056
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,380
Pope's work schedule into account.

1057
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,060
That the day starts at midnight.

1058
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,880
The months are according to the Pope's work

1059
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,280
schedule.

1060
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,760
So it's it's what do you call it?

1061
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,680
A closed system.

1062
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,720
It's a closed system.

1063
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:43,960
Right.

1064
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,080
It actually you're OK.

1065
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,500
It makes it makes sense within itself.

1066
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:48,540
Yeah, that's right.

1067
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,460
It's a closed system.

1068
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:49,680
Right.

1069
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,880
Just like we can have our own measurement

1070
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,860
system instead of inches or centimeters and stuff

1071
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,820
and call it whatever.

1072
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,660
As long as you use our scale, we're

1073
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:58,980
OK.

1074
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:00,240
Yeah.

1075
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,020
If we were both agreed on the same

1076
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:02,340
schedule.

1077
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:02,640
Yeah.

1078
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,400
The same scale.

1079
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:03,640
Yeah.

1080
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,560
And by the way, when we were selling

1081
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,260
tape measures that you normally get for five

1082
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,440
or 10 bucks at the dollar store, I

1083
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,780
went and bought a bunch and I tested

1084
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:13,680
them against the machinists reference that I have.

1085
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,320
And guess what?

1086
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,360
They were just as good as the big

1087
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,420
brand names.

1088
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:17,880
Of course.

1089
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,040
The hell, you know.

1090
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,080
So in other words, even they know even

1091
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,400
the dollar store knows you can't mess with

1092
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,420
that standards.

1093
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:24,900
Right.

1094
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,860
So standards and practices.

1095
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,080
Anyways, did I answer it without getting weird?

1096
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,040
Yeah, you did.

1097
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:31,560
Oh, cool.

1098
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:31,840
All right.

1099
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,720
I cut it down.

1100
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,440
You cut it down.

1101
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,540
It worked perfect, I think.

1102
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,940
We'll we'll get feedback otherwise.

1103
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,580
Well, if we're perfect means we're not good.

1104
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,520
So you're sure about that?

1105
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,480
Anyway, I think I think we did the

1106
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:44,800
job.

1107
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,600
OK, how about that?

1108
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:45,820
OK.

1109
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:46,740
You know what?

1110
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,360
OK.

1111
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,720
Just to clarify our diagnosis, such as pneumonia,

1112
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,180
bronchitis and blah, blah, blah.

1113
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:55,460
OK.

1114
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,660
Loss of vacuum issues.

1115
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,700
Typically they are a virus or bacteria, but

1116
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,120
I want to understand it from biological vacuum

1117
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,520
understanding now.

1118
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,960
Sounds like the answer is an oxymoron.

1119
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,140
It's an oxymoron.

1120
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,360
Yeah, they answer their own question.

1121
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,620
It almost sounds like here.

1122
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,020
It's like, yeah, it's the biological vacuum.

1123
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,060
What about the bacteria and viruses?

1124
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,060
What they're asking here?

1125
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:16,720
Exactly.

1126
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:17,340
Hold on.

1127
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,000
Your body created those if they're in your

1128
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,540
bloodstream.

1129
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:19,920
Right.

1130
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,080
Or you were unless you're injected hypodermic into

1131
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,380
the subdermal matrix.

1132
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:25,840
Right.

1133
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,100
How else do you want to say it?

1134
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,400
Well, there's someone sneezing on you and you

1135
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,240
drinking a glass of it is not going

1136
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,300
to get into your blood.

1137
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,360
Unless you are injected or your body makes

1138
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:37,520
it.

1139
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,500
And ninety nine percent of the time, I'm

1140
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:39,640
good.

1141
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,500
There are people have been injected with diseases,

1142
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,380
I'm sure, but typically not.

1143
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,700
And your body created that because of the

1144
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,900
conditions that you're in.

1145
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,360
Well, we know you can introduce things into

1146
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,800
the body by injection, right?

1147
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,060
So in this case, we're going to rule

1148
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:55,500
that out.

1149
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,640
But but then that changes up the process

1150
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,260
because now the body has to deal with

1151
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,500
it and it's going to create a waste

1152
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,460
product from something that is immediately.

1153
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,820
So if they inject you with a disease

1154
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,580
where there was studies done in the 50s

1155
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,620
where they did actually there's you've heard of

1156
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:12,540
the studies where Clinton apologized for injecting people

1157
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,400
with radiation and syphilis and all that.

1158
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,220
Yeah, right.

1159
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:15,540
Yeah.

1160
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,140
OK.

1161
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,200
That's always going on, by the way.

1162
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:18,640
Yeah.

1163
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,340
And it has been going on.

1164
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,400
And they wondering why we inject someone who's

1165
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,960
like the worst stage of TB.

1166
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,220
We injected ten of these guys with TB

1167
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,000
and no one's coming down with it.

1168
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,000
What's wrong with us?

1169
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:30,380
Right.

1170
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,560
You know what?

1171
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,800
What's wrong with our system?

1172
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,300
Let's say so.

1173
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,600
They keep giving you the bullshit and they

1174
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,600
have no proof for it.

1175
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,740
Your body produces that internally.

1176
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,640
Now, here's the thing.

1177
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,960
This is really hard for people to imagine.

1178
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,060
If you were really taught what's going on

1179
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:49,180
biologically, there is nothing in your mind that

1180
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:52,040
you would think you were limited by because

1181
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,340
everything physically possible is being created by your

1182
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:57,500
body out of nothing, out of the vacuum

1183
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,840
induction, the energy, you know, the prana, the

1184
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,740
chi that you have.

1185
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:01,420
Right.

1186
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,400
It'll get to the point where could you

1187
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,480
imagine children, a society growing up or just

1188
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,840
the whole society already that has instilled in

1189
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:14,179
them the concepts of biogenesis, induction, vacuum and

1190
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:14,659
all that?

1191
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,460
Do you know that you could go to

1192
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,040
the dollar store and buy a device allows

1193
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,080
you to walk through walls?

1194
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:20,400
Right.

1195
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,620
You want to see how you're going to

1196
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,460
control these people.

1197
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:23,780
Right.

1198
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,159
It's a control system.

1199
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,900
So it's really, really.

1200
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,080
Imagine the most incredible magic, quote, unquote, trick.

1201
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:32,040
Your body's even beyond that.

1202
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,179
It's real.

1203
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,659
And I'm not saying it's magic, but it's

1204
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:36,900
doing things that are so foreign to you.

1205
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,300
I'll tell you what's going on right now

1206
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,239
with the mindset.

1207
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:42,100
And this is no stain on who wrote

1208
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:42,639
the message.

1209
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,780
Have you heard of in the early days

1210
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,340
of Polaroid or wherever they would go to

1211
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,620
these islands in the Pacific Rim and the

1212
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,719
natives and they take a picture and show

1213
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,239
it to the natives and they freaked out

1214
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:55,520
because you put my soul in that you're

1215
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,040
putting me.

1216
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,500
You're doing some kind of magic.

1217
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,400
Right.

1218
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:01,440
They didn't understand you were exposing light to

1219
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:01,740
film.

1220
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,560
And it was a reflection.

1221
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,360
Right.

1222
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,840
They thought you were you were ready.

1223
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,300
You shrunk them in there or something.

1224
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:06,600
Right.

1225
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,160
Lots of things that they don't understand.

1226
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,540
They describe as magic.

1227
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,000
Yeah.

1228
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,840
I mean, that's that's what you've been taught.

1229
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,840
But in the opposite.

1230
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,740
So the real magic or whatever, the real

1231
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,900
incredible stuff has been hidden.

1232
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,980
And you've been given this materialistic bullshit.

1233
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,500
In other words, if you can't put it,

1234
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,060
pour it into a beaker and put it

1235
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,900
on a slide under the microscope, it doesn't

1236
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,280
exist.

1237
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,060
And this is in their own paperwork, starting

1238
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,320
with the Flexner report.

1239
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,880
All medical research is an oxymoron because the

1240
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,700
Flexner report around 1912 or something, whatever, later

1241
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:43,620
states that only accepted medical practices will be

1242
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:44,020
used.

1243
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,780
So what does that mean?

1244
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:49,160
That means only what was developed till 1912

1245
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,080
or whatever will be.

1246
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,860
And they did have vaccines, by the way,

1247
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,240
which were accepted.

1248
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,040
It didn't say positive healing, curing, accepted.

1249
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:57,700
Right.

1250
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,020
Right.

1251
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,660
So, yeah.

1252
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,720
And these this is the group that's controlling

1253
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,720
our knowledge base.

1254
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,660
Now, if you want to understand the vacuum

1255
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,240
a little bit more, for example, stuff with

1256
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,040
pulmonary stuff, the diaphragm is actually moved by

1257
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,040
the plera, which is a vacuum area.

1258
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:12,540
Yeah.

1259
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:12,780
Right.

1260
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:13,920
Pleurisy pneumonia.

1261
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,340
That's it's and when that has to go

1262
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,220
sour before everything else does.

1263
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,820
When the biological vacuum generally goes down low,

1264
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:24,540
your muscle reflexes go down low.

1265
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:27,100
And how many things rely on muscle reflexes,

1266
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,640
your heart, you know, everything pretty much.

1267
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:30,660
So that goes down low.

1268
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,300
So a general well-being.

1269
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,060
Let me just put it this way.

1270
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,840
Let's go back to the basics.

1271
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,600
It sounds like back to the basics, the

1272
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,100
same thing.

1273
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,500
If you go look up a cross-section

1274
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,960
anatomy of a pregnant woman where they show

1275
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,940
cross-section, the belly and the uterus and

1276
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:50,300
the child.

1277
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,720
OK, if you look at the bottom of

1278
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,660
the cervix, what keeps the baby and all

1279
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,780
the fluids from falling out?

1280
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,640
What's that called there?

1281
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,360
Mucus.

1282
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:01,040
It's it's called the mucus plug, because what

1283
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,260
is mucus do do?

1284
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,080
It makes a good what plug.

1285
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:04,520
Yeah.

1286
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,300
When you when you have a system that's

1287
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,480
supposed to maintain a certain pressure, positive or

1288
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:14,020
negative, and that that that system surface or

1289
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,340
boundary layer is breached.

1290
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,540
What do intelligent beings do?

1291
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,540
They put what a plug in it.

1292
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:21,060
They plug it.

1293
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:21,280
Yeah.

1294
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,180
Whether it's a dam or a tire or

1295
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,920
anything else, you know, when your body starts

1296
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,880
to develop mucus, it's telling you, hey, dummy,

1297
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,020
whatever you just did, don't do it again.

1298
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,220
And by the way, you compromise the vacuum.

1299
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,560
So now we're making mucus.

1300
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,020
Yeah.

1301
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,020
Do you know how many babies I've heard

1302
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:37,280
this?

1303
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,880
I know you're going to say yes.

1304
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,020
The parents are wondering why the baby is

1305
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:41,780
all clogged up.

1306
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,800
He's got mucus up until five, six, seven

1307
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,240
years old.

1308
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:44,980
Mucus problems.

1309
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:45,320
Right.

1310
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,260
I mean, it's runny nose, sinuses, can't breathe,

1311
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:47,600
cough.

1312
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,760
What you're doing is is is tamp is

1313
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,120
is messing with the body.

1314
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:53,740
Right.

1315
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,080
You know, and babies can recover very quickly.

1316
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,860
So they're going to have a very immediate

1317
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:58,900
mucus response.

1318
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,000
And it's severe sometimes.

1319
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:00,440
Right.

1320
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:00,840
Yes.

1321
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:01,080
Very.

1322
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,080
Yeah.

1323
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,940
And what do they do?

1324
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,120
They go get things right.

1325
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:05,960
Go to the doctor.

1326
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,960
He doesn't know anything, because if he knew

1327
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,500
anything and try to practice it, they would

1328
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,800
throw his ass in jail, pretty much guaranteed.

1329
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,580
So and this is where we're at.

1330
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,140
Just like, you know, I don't know if

1331
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,540
the 35 year old still lived at home

1332
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:22,360
and was married and had the baby, maybe.

1333
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:22,820
I don't know.

1334
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,260
You see how everything's tied together?

1335
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:24,660
Yeah.

1336
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,220
You might have a couple of people who

1337
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,060
have already been through the experience of raising

1338
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,940
child children around them that might know a

1339
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,380
few things that go, look, just do this

1340
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,200
and it'll be fine.

1341
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:32,620
Yeah.

1342
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:33,920
Here's the thing.

1343
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,760
There's many signals like we know when you

1344
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,800
eat and get flatulence or you burp.

1345
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,040
Yeah.

1346
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:38,340
Right.

1347
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,660
That's the that's the body.

1348
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,560
Body's very intelligent, has its own intelligence.

1349
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,360
It's like, hey, whatever you just did, don't

1350
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:44,920
do it again.

1351
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,460
Right, because it's not it doesn't work with

1352
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:51,420
our the system that we have very lightly,

1353
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,060
mildly.

1354
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,880
That would be flatulence and abrupt.

1355
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,140
The next level is mucus.

1356
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,440
People eat something that made me really mukey,

1357
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:57,800
right?

1358
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,680
Because I got mucus, that congestion from eating

1359
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,000
that.

1360
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,080
The next level from that is a skin

1361
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:03,940
manifestation.

1362
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,200
Mm hmm.

1363
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,620
And the next level from that is a

1364
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,700
blood manifestation.

1365
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,700
The next level from that is to block

1366
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,540
where the blood manifestation is in that part

1367
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:14,040
of the body.

1368
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,160
And how do we block it with a

1369
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,820
tumor or very swollen, soft tissue?

1370
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:23,160
So tell me, you know, what's the cure

1371
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:23,800
for cancer?

1372
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,420
Be thankful that you.

1373
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,120
Well, if you didn't have cancer, you would

1374
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:29,840
die in your sleep.

1375
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,060
And I give you an example, places like

1376
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,500
Mexico, Indonesia, whatever.

1377
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,640
You know, there's plenty of people go to

1378
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,440
bed and wake up dead.

1379
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:35,620
Right.

1380
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,080
In other words, they wake up and they're

1381
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:37,360
dead.

1382
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:37,980
Right.

1383
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,280
In bed of all ages.

1384
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:40,620
Right.

1385
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,380
Well, that's because their body did not produce

1386
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:44,900
a cancer.

1387
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,060
In other words, whatever was going on was

1388
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,040
allowed to happen.

1389
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,600
And it ended.

1390
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,740
It terminated the vacuum overnight while they were

1391
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:54,100
sleeping.

1392
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:54,840
Right.

1393
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,540
The people that get the tumors and the

1394
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,100
cancers and stuff, the body's like, no, I

1395
00:39:59,100 --> 00:39:59,700
want to live.

1396
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,380
We're going to put up roadblocks.

1397
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:02,220
Right.

1398
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:02,920
OK.

1399
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,700
So all right, this is the complete opposite.

1400
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:08,820
We got to fight cancer.

1401
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:09,500
Yeah, sure.

1402
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,800
We got to fight roadblocks.

1403
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,760
We have to fight directing traffic.

1404
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,160
Now, it's very sure it's very difficult to

1405
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,680
understand sometimes, though, because because of the long

1406
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,560
term programming previously, because they probably thought it

1407
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,900
was a bad thing to not be living

1408
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,020
with their parents at 35.

1409
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,340
You see how it all ties together.

1410
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,740
And they probably met their girlfriend or wife

1411
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:27,900
at a laundromat.

1412
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,200
But anyway, yeah, it would be so.

1413
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:30,800
Look, I got it.

1414
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,380
I got a closer on this one, which

1415
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,420
I thought would be entertaining.

1416
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,960
And they want both of us to answer

1417
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,240
this.

1418
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,940
But I definitely want you to go first.

1419
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,900
What was the most ridiculous thing you saw

1420
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,180
during the pandemic?

1421
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,500
My favorite is big guys, grown up men

1422
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,980
in their 40s wearing a face diaper while

1423
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,440
driving alone in their cars.

1424
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,100
What is your personal favorites?

1425
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,500
They want it from both of us.

1426
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,360
So for me, it would be that the

1427
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:57,920
Treasury and the Federal Reserve chairman announced the

1428
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,920
restrictions and no one made no one reported

1429
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,180
it.

1430
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,660
No one made a big deal about it.

1431
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,820
No one said, why is this being announced

1432
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:07,440
by the Federal Reserve chairman and the treasurer?

1433
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,320
That was the most ridiculous thing that no

1434
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,380
one reported on it.

1435
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,380
Well, we all are monetized things out there

1436
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,440
being traded, aren't we?

1437
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:22,040
According to our serial numbers, yes, can be

1438
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:22,840
if you let it.

1439
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,660
OK, there you go.

1440
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,100
Well, look, my favorite ridiculous thing was this.

1441
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,640
I went to and I and I'd love

1442
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,640
for you to comment on this.

1443
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,120
I went to a store totally oblivious because

1444
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:32,760
I'm in Georgia.

1445
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:33,760
And you know what?

1446
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:36,400
We weren't exactly the most, you know, worried

1447
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,500
about the pandemic issue here, as most places

1448
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,620
it appeared.

1449
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,880
And mindlessly, I went down to a store

1450
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,520
with my with my.

1451
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,440
Well, with the boy and neither one of

1452
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,380
us had a mask on.

1453
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:52,140
We didn't expect to encounter mess.

1454
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,200
I gave it no thought.

1455
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,000
It wasn't like I was resistant or anything

1456
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:55,280
else.

1457
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,400
I just didn't think of it.

1458
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,740
Yeah, I was casual about it.

1459
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,100
And I went down there to go into

1460
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,040
a store and I'm standing on line and

1461
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,660
I did not realize that people were looking

1462
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,280
at me funny.

1463
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,340
And then I turned around to address somebody

1464
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,580
and they jumped out of the way like

1465
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,900
it was a freaking I don't know, like

1466
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:14,140
a circus move or a WWF move trying

1467
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,720
to avoid getting kicked in the face when

1468
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,780
I turned around to say something to somebody

1469
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,120
and immediately it snapped to me.

1470
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:20,620
Holy crap.

1471
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,960
There are some people around me that actually

1472
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,680
believe in this whole masking issue.

1473
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:29,540
And yeah, well, here's the thing that Barnum

1474
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:32,440
and Bailey said, a sucker's born every minute

1475
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:35,180
and you could never lose money by underestimating

1476
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,980
the intelligence of the American public.

1477
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,300
But it's also worldwide.

1478
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,860
Some places worse than others.

1479
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,880
But the thing is, the first thing when

1480
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,220
they said they're doing a pandemic, I said,

1481
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,200
we still have running water and running sewer.

1482
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,080
Why is there there?

1483
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:49,620
Can't you cannot have a pandemic with running

1484
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:52,380
water, clean running water and sewage and garbage

1485
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:52,800
removal?

1486
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,180
It's impossible, literally impossible.

1487
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:58,400
I would suggest the opposite.

1488
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,240
In other words, if the infrastructure went down

1489
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,880
and you had no more running water and

1490
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,640
the sewer wasn't working and you did have

1491
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,240
some water, but it was mixed with sewer

1492
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,120
water and the garbage wasn't collected, you're going

1493
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,500
to have a pandemic in about a month.

1494
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,520
So the next moon, in other words, it'll

1495
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,980
start right before the full moon.

1496
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,260
I'll even give you the time.

1497
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,320
So you see how it works.
