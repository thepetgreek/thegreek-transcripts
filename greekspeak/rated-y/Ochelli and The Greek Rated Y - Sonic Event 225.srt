1
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:11,420
Hey, here we are again, and Rated Y,

2
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,300
that's what's happening.

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,520
And Greek, first, how you doing?

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,340
But second, I know you got comments from

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,840
the chat, so we'll start there, but again,

6
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:19,480
how you doing?

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,700
I'm doing okay, and I'm hearing double, you

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:24,480
know, seeing double.

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,940
It's really difficult.

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,000
I have to figure out if someone knows

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,880
anything about Jitsi.

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,320
Why is it, on my end, I hear

13
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,040
everything repeated twice?

14
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,020
It's worse than an echo.

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,700
It's actually duplexing at full dynamics, all right?

16
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,020
An echo tends to be lower in volume,

17
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,800
but this is just as loud, and it's

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,200
twice.

19
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,340
So hearing you once is bad enough, Chuck.

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,080
Twice now?

21
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,240
God damn it, man.

22
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,620
What the hell is going on here?

23
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,000
My apologies, double.

24
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:51,560
Sorry.

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,940
Yeah, no, that's fine.

26
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,740
You know, I just had to say, you

27
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,720
know, the setup was perfect for that.

28
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,220
So on the comments, yeah, on the chat,

29
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,680
a lot of people are having weird stuff.

30
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:05,320
I'll tell you, talking about why it's weird,

31
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,980
and you know, I talked to those two

32
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:07,420
weeks ago.

33
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,480
There was something that happened in our reality,

34
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,600
like a soft edit, soft reset, Mandela effect

35
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,180
for everyone, but not a Mandela effect where

36
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,000
everyone gets together and says, remember when this

37
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,120
was this, and now it's that?

38
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:18,420
No.

39
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,000
Certain things change.

40
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,400
People, a lot of people are reporting strange

41
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,680
behavior in people they know, kind of like

42
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,720
invasion of the body snatchers or watch the

43
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,360
old film was better than the new one.

44
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,520
But the new one with Don, I think

45
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,360
it was Donald Southerman in the 70s was

46
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,160
pretty good, too.

47
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:33,420
Right?

48
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:33,820
Remember that?

49
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,580
Yeah, that was great.

50
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:39,200
So I would say that this is a

51
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,400
similar situation, but let me just tell you

52
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:41,980
what happened today.

53
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,040
This is happening every day.

54
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,680
All the cool kids wear black, right?

55
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,360
When you go out or whatever, you know.

56
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,580
So I looked at my wardrobe and I

57
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,700
said, I don't have any black shirts, you

58
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:54,900
know?

59
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,300
And so I said, OK, I'm going to

60
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,720
go to my favorite store, which is called

61
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,260
Speedway Outlet in Tucson.

62
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,040
And the reason I like that, it's near

63
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,240
the Golden Ghetto, where all the wealthy people

64
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,140
live in the foothills.

65
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,580
I used to live up there, by the

66
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:06,760
way.

67
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,340
And when they die, all their father, you

68
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,560
know, I've mentioned this many times before, usually

69
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,700
around giving background away, I go to the

70
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,640
specific ones better than a Goodwill or anything

71
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,220
like that.

72
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,580
When these old people, they're alone in these

73
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,560
million dollar mansions, not million dollar millions is

74
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,680
not much anymore, but very big homes retired

75
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,820
from being in industry in Chicago.

76
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,280
They have nothing to do here.

77
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,740
No one wants to visit them.

78
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,740
So they walk the malls.

79
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,020
Right.

80
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,180
They even open the malls early at 7

81
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,720
a.m. for the old people to walk.

82
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,240
Right.

83
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,340
I mean, you've heard of that.

84
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,300
There's even a short documentary on that.

85
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,040
I mean, because that's like extinct in most

86
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,980
parts of the country, the mall walking thing.

87
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,520
But they still do that in Arizona.

88
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:51,460
Yeah.

89
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,300
Yeah, they do.

90
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:52,700
Uh huh.

91
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,000
Yeah.

92
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,840
So anyway, when the old bastard dies, the

93
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,180
people come over from the East Coast, Chicago,

94
00:02:59,320 --> 00:02:59,980
New York, whatever.

95
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:00,760
Like, oh, yeah.

96
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,800
Look in their chops.

97
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,860
Let's sell this house.

98
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,660
It's worth five million bucks.

99
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,520
And, you know, they do an estate sale

100
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:07,780
or whatever.

101
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,940
What about his wardrobe?

102
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,560
Now, here's the thing about his wardrobe.

103
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,340
They walk around the malls and they go

104
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,380
to dealers and places like that or Nordstrom's

105
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,660
and they buy a bunch of stuff and

106
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,300
they go home and hang it up and

107
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,300
they never wear it.

108
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,900
So I like going there because typically, you

109
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,640
know who died because you'll see four or

110
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,440
five shirts with the Nordstrom Brooks Brothers with

111
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,040
the tag still on it and they're all

112
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,900
the same size.

113
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,300
So I'm like, wow, you know, this guy

114
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,420
has the same build as I do wherever.

115
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,940
And this guy just definitely someone just passed

116
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,600
away.

117
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:37,940
Right.

118
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,340
Is what I say when I see the

119
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,120
rack full of, you know, so anyway, I

120
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,540
go there to get some black shirts today

121
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,500
and there's two high end black shirts, like

122
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,000
a Nordstrom and a Claiborne with the tags

123
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,460
on it.

124
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,560
Nine bucks, six bucks or like 50, you

125
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,780
know, really expensive shirts, let's say, here to

126
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,280
buy shirts.

127
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,480
And I was like, this is too easy.

128
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,940
It's like I put an order in.

129
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,720
Since when do you put an order in

130
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,040
for something, you know, out out there, you

131
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,180
know, make a wish, let's say go out

132
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,940
to a second hand store.

133
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,820
And the items that you wished before you

134
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,380
left your house are in a second hand

135
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:11,740
store.

136
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,720
Now, this is not unusual.

137
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,519
This happens to me quite often when I

138
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,279
use Craigslist on that way.

139
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:22,280
I need some wood shutters.

140
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,120
I don't need the shutter.

141
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,200
I just need the slats.

142
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,600
So I think about it and I go

143
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,620
to Craigslist in two days.

144
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,060
Guess what?

145
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,400
Someone's throwing out a wood shutter.

146
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:29,820
Right.

147
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,180
On and on and on and on.

148
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,240
Some people would call it a manifestation.

149
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:33,580
Yeah.

150
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,020
Some people call it manifestation.

151
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,080
But manifestation.

152
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,080
That's right.

153
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,500
But I think it's more than manifestation or

154
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,100
very different because I already have selected these

155
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,920
two places.

156
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:45,820
Manifestation is true.

157
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,120
Like, you know, you'd be driving on the

158
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,160
road and see it on the side of

159
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:49,500
the road.

160
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:49,780
Right.

161
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,220
You just fell out of the sky.

162
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,820
But what's unusual about this time is it's

163
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,020
not in season.

164
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,080
In other words, picking up these two black

165
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,280
shirts.

166
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,640
And I got some other stuff also.

167
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,180
And also other things that I've been doing.

168
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,440
I put a man I've been manifesting things,

169
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,480
but not in the way when when these

170
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,980
things were mounted, the black shirts and a

171
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,760
few other things manifested recently.

172
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,660
It wasn't in the way where you're amazed

173
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,180
or this feeling like, look how fortunate this

174
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:19,400
is.

175
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,960
And wow, isn't the universe a cool place?

176
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,880
You know, nothing like that this time.

177
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,740
When I got the black shirts and a

178
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,840
few other things, it was like, of course,

179
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,200
of course, of course.

180
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,480
None of this amazement and look how fortunate,

181
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,020
you know what I mean?

182
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,780
There's a certain feeling you get when things

183
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,460
manifest like, isn't it a coincidence?

184
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,740
None of that.

185
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,980
It was like, of course, you know, there

186
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,120
was no other way.

187
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:45,560
Yeah.

188
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,760
So I'm getting this thing that, you know,

189
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,000
people say you ask for things and they

190
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,960
manifest or whatever.

191
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,240
It's almost in a way now like you

192
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,320
just ordered your lunch and they tell you

193
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,540
to sit down and I'll bring it to

194
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,220
you when it's ready.

195
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,280
Kind of different when they bring you your

196
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:02,560
lunch.

197
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,540
You're not surprised because you just ordered a

198
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:04,780
dummy.

199
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,000
They said that we're going to bring it.

200
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:06,220
Right.

201
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,200
It's very different.

202
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:07,800
Yeah.

203
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,180
It was a general manifestation.

204
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,340
I was just thinking, I think to yourself,

205
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,100
you're hungry and somebody hands you the sandwich

206
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:13,680
you wanted.

207
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,920
You go, great, thanks.

208
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,680
That's what I wanted.

209
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,080
And you move along with no with no

210
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,900
previous communication.

211
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,340
Right.

212
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,240
Yeah.

213
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,540
But this time it's different.

214
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,780
What's been happening the past week and things

215
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,220
I've been coming up with, by the way,

216
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,780
I'm always coming up with new inventions.

217
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,800
And it's like, of course, it's not like,

218
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,660
oh, wow, you get this feeling, you know,

219
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,100
like this lofty feeling, you know, when you

220
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,980
get really good news, how you feel.

221
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:38,640
Right.

222
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,440
The reason it's good news.

223
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,000
The reason it's news is because you didn't

224
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,040
know about it till then.

225
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:43,340
Right.

226
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,380
And it makes you feel in a certain

227
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:46,620
way.

228
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,660
So none of that anymore.

229
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,340
Now it's like, of course, I mean, this

230
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,060
is I knew this was going to happen.

231
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,500
I knew this was so it's a very

232
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,120
different it's a very fine adjustment in what's

233
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,800
going on.

234
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,480
The other thing that I've noticed is that

235
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,760
people that normally wouldn't speak on these things

236
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,900
are speaking on them now.

237
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,960
That's the other main thing that I've noticed,

238
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,020
you know, the manifestations or whatever.

239
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,000
But there's a few things the chat's been

240
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,720
hopping lately.

241
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,360
And when I say the chat, it's the

242
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,500
what is the chat again, Chuck, please.

243
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,800
Oh, it's the chat angle.

244
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,200
It's really in the Greek.

245
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,440
Yes, that's right.

246
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,380
Which, by the way, because I don't have.

247
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,060
Yes.

248
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,720
Just really quickly for you listening on the

249
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,800
Patreon, there is a link in the description

250
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,540
to the Patreon to go straight to the

251
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,680
chat if you're not familiar.

252
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,680
So, you know, there you go.

253
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,040
Yeah, I've never been to the Patreon one.

254
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,840
As a matter of fact, I'm not a

255
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,340
sub and I don't have access.

256
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,200
That's just fine.

257
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:41,860
It's just fine.

258
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,600
Keeps me neutral.

259
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,060
And I don't know what's going on there.

260
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,460
But the Chitango one, Ocelli and the Greek

261
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,860
Chitango dot com, I believe.

262
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,640
Yeah, this is the chat I'm speaking on.

263
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,680
Few other things going on there, things we

264
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,660
brought up before.

265
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,500
There was a video from Middle Nation Shaheed

266
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,300
that Ed posted.

267
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,560
I haven't looked at that video.

268
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,020
I really like Shaheed.

269
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,240
I'm glad I'm glad people are enjoying his

270
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:04,520
stuff.

271
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:05,960
He's always too political.

272
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,940
I don't think he understands fundamentally how the

273
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,560
economic system works, which I'd like to inject.

274
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,340
What people don't know is the significance of

275
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:19,860
the Federal Reserve Act, Section 16, Part 1,

276
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,720
Chapter 1, 2 and so on.

277
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,400
That is the fundamental.

278
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,080
That means that if you go to the

279
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,420
central bank to get their money, their private

280
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,400
money, you have to provide collateral.

281
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,780
And when you hear that word collateral, people

282
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,440
think I got to go hawk my ring

283
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,299
or, you know, they own the car till

284
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:37,720
I pay it off.

285
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,039
No, no.

286
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,460
Collateral for the central bank is the application

287
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,500
that you fill out.

288
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,760
This is so hard.

289
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,340
This is the basis of the entire financial

290
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:50,380
system, other than the monetization of unconditional promises

291
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:54,320
to pay the actual funds themselves, you know,

292
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,440
with numbers on them come from the application.

293
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,420
That was so hard for people to understand

294
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,840
that because they don't want to admit how

295
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,840
shitty things are, because how many times how

296
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,180
many people have applied for something and gotten

297
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:09,320
denied or applied or said you're approved and

298
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,480
then they continue like business as usual and

299
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,040
they don't even know that what they applied

300
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,220
for had a dollar value and whoever whatever

301
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,740
financial institution was handling that application got all

302
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,700
of that and you got nothing, which is

303
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,660
one thing I want to mention.

304
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:28,340
Slavery today through the credit system quantitatively and

305
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,800
qualitatively is a thousand times worse than it

306
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,400
was when you had a shackle on your

307
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,460
neck and you were working in the fields

308
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,000
all day.

309
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,140
Now, on the on the sheet, I'll tell

310
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,820
you what, on the balance sheet, because if

311
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,900
you have a shackle on your neck and

312
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,800
all you know is yes, no, sir, whatever,

313
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:53,120
and you're picking cotton, sugarcane, bananas, working blacksmithing

314
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,700
or whatever, you could figure whatever a blue

315
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,120
collar salary would be today for an entire

316
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,200
lifetime is the value of that slave.

317
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:01,500
Right.

318
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,600
How could that slave generate any more than

319
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:03,820
that?

320
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,140
Right.

321
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:04,500
Right.

322
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,880
So when I say because blue collars are

323
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,100
doing labor and that kind of stuff, there

324
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,240
are a lot of slaves, by the way,

325
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,220
that lived in splendor.

326
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,740
They wore tuxedos, by the way, you know,

327
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,260
and further because whatever task they performed demanded

328
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:20,240
that attire and they ate really well and

329
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:20,740
this and that.

330
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,660
But let's look at a typical.

331
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,020
Yeah.

332
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,360
You're right.

333
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,260
Gloved house guys and stuff like that.

334
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:26,660
Yeah.

335
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,080
Yeah.

336
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:30,680
A carriage, trains, houses, homes, mansions, estates, all

337
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,020
the way.

338
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,480
So ships.

339
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,720
So when you look at what a blue

340
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,380
collar worker does for a lifetime, whatever, a

341
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,760
million bucks, that would be what the slave

342
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,660
would generate in capital their entire lifetime.

343
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:47,160
Right now, I assure you, whatever you've earned,

344
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,380
whatever you've done in life or accumulated, if

345
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,220
you've ever dealt with the credit system with

346
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,320
corporations that have OC-10 and OC-7

347
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,840
access, which is the Federal Reserve window, right,

348
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,420
which is not really a window.

349
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,620
It's just someone who's authorized for the Federal

350
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,580
Reserve to do this.

351
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,620
If anything, you've signed applications for schools, for

352
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:13,720
college that generated the full amount plus interest

353
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,660
over and over and over and over and

354
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,100
over.

355
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,880
I've heard people going and applying for five

356
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,020
or recently five or six jobs, professional jobs

357
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,560
that pay over one hundred fifty, two hundred

358
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,280
thousand a year.

359
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,320
And they all got denied.

360
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,800
She got denied for all of them.

361
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,760
I said, you generated a minimum of two

362
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,940
million dollars and had to explain it to

363
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,080
her.

364
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,760
And it was really hard for her to

365
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,360
get it, even though I had her all

366
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:41,900
defined.

367
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,340
So imagine someone who's job hunting, quote unquote,

368
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,480
I don't know, a hundred thousand median median

369
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,300
salary, let's say, and they apply for five

370
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:51,640
jobs.

371
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,860
It's not unusual for someone over a period

372
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,580
of several months to apply for 10 jobs

373
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,340
online or whatever or in person.

374
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:57,640
Right.

375
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,400
It's not unusual.

376
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,480
I've heard that.

377
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,360
Yeah, that's that's a big amount.

378
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,980
Yeah, they've generated millions for whoever did this

379
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,220
thing called job fairs.

380
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,920
I've been talking about this since way back

381
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,180
when I got a revolution radio about all

382
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,460
these job fairs lately, right after the financial

383
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:13,900
crash.

384
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,380
This is after 2008, 2009.

385
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,800
What they're doing is they're trying to suck

386
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,320
out, wring out the towel.

387
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,620
They create these job fairs and all the

388
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,320
big companies go there and they have thousands

389
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,360
of people applying.

390
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,160
How many are hired?

391
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:24,980
None.

392
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:25,440
Ever.

393
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,020
Why?

394
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,600
Because they need the applications.

395
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:28,360
Right.

396
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,620
And they go to the Federal Reserve and

397
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,700
they monetize it to make it even worse.

398
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,820
The Federal Reserve says that once your application

399
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,840
is collateralized, you can come back anytime and

400
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,860
get some more.

401
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,120
Wow.

402
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:41,540
Right.

403
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:45,100
So this is so the on the balance

404
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,740
sheet, a typical citizen, resident, whatever you want

405
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,720
to call yourself, human man, woman that deals

406
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,700
with the credit system via applications.

407
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,460
It doesn't matter what you're applying for.

408
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,860
Even an Ace Hardware rewards card, right, is

409
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,540
an application.

410
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,760
If you multiply that, how many times you've

411
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,160
done that in your life and how much

412
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,040
has been extracted?

413
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,140
It's way more than somebody picking cotton or

414
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,120
picking sugarcane.

415
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,000
Right.

416
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,820
I mean, you have generated most people have

417
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:19,020
generated more money via this process, the application

418
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,240
process than they ever will make or have

419
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,160
in their entire life.

420
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,980
So for the benefit of who?

421
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,240
So slaves are receiving the application.

422
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:26,680
Yes.

423
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,280
So slaves have gone up in value.

424
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,200
But who's collecting it is the question.

425
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:31,760
Yeah.

426
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:36,440
The greatest value is you don't understand how

427
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,180
this works because what's beautiful about it now

428
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,760
from to benefit the bankers.

429
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,620
The beauty is it's been going on for

430
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,700
so long that if you explained it, even

431
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,260
on the radio or TV and show people

432
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,560
would still not want to believe it.

433
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,880
Just like I mentioned years ago, I spoke

434
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,140
to a college professor about somebody else was

435
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,120
arguing about the moon landings.

436
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,260
And I said, what if the astronauts came

437
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,360
out and told you they never go to

438
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:00,600
the moon?

439
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,680
They never went to the moon.

440
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,080
I would still think they went to the

441
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:04,560
moon.

442
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,040
Right.

443
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,700
So most people would think an application is

444
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,660
just an application.

445
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,480
So that's why for 20 years I've been

446
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,440
saying the population is toast.

447
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,360
They're they're toast.

448
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,600
Don't even consider it.

449
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,860
It's what you're going to do.

450
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,360
So anyway, I wanted to bring that up

451
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,240
in terms of because that that's going to

452
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,020
get even worse.

453
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,620
And just to tie that in, you know,

454
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,020
that Doge thing that Musk was doing.

455
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:27,720
Oh, yeah.

456
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,600
I when I first heard that, I said,

457
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,440
he's just going in there perfectly pilfering people's

458
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,940
QCIP numbers, which is the Convention of Universal

459
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:41,640
Security, whatever investment protocols, because they could everyone

460
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,060
anything.

461
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,820
Look, how difficult is it really if you're

462
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,400
in the in crowd with, you know, the

463
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,340
cool kids to get Social Security numbers from

464
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:48,600
people?

465
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,680
Very easy, actually.

466
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,100
If you get a ticket, a traffic ticket

467
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,880
has a Social Security number right on top.

468
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:54,460
Right.

469
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,320
Of the ticket.

470
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,120
So it's not that Musk needed the Social

471
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,800
Security numbers.

472
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,200
He needed the QCIP numbers at the Treasury

473
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,960
issues for the transactions on how those Social

474
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,360
Security numbers were used.

475
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,920
So now he can go in showing security

476
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,340
interest.

477
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,880
So, you know, I must go in and

478
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,420
pilfered another like 15 or 20 trillion.

479
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,440
And how do you know he was doing

480
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:15,680
that?

481
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,240
Because there's this thing called a guilty conscious.

482
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,220
What was he exposing?

483
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,820
All this financial fraud while he's pulling the

484
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,920
biggest fraud.

485
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,980
You see now there's a lot under your

486
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:27,360
eyes.

487
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,300
There's a funny thing.

488
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,900
A question I forgot from last time was

489
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,720
somebody was, you know, looking at the Epstein

490
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,100
stuff because it's been in the news.

491
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,400
You know what I'm talking about, right?

492
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,520
The Jeffrey Epstein stuff.

493
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,020
Oh, that distraction, that's really bad.

494
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,860
They really that's really tasteless.

495
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,240
It is.

496
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,020
But they were looking at something different here

497
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,580
because there is a part in his history

498
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,920
where he ends up being a billionaire.

499
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,760
And before that, he was not.

500
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,760
And the funny thing is, nobody seems to

501
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,160
be able to know where it is he

502
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,080
came up with this.

503
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,220
So somebody including a mansion on Park Avenue,

504
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,840
a duplex or something like that is what

505
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,380
you're referring to.

506
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,000
Like he was a New York socialite.

507
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,540
Yeah, but he had a little bit of

508
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,400
money.

509
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,120
But then all of a sudden he's able

510
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,640
to buy islands and his islands go up

511
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,360
and like all of a sudden he goes

512
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,560
to a whole other level, even if he

513
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,860
robbed, you know, Lex Westler all the way

514
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,380
through.

515
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,460
Yeah, yeah.

516
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,260
He's what he's what you call a straw

517
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:25,620
man.

518
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,620
In other words, he had people behind.

519
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,440
Straw man is an entity that you have

520
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,440
to transfer property and show wealth, but it's

521
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,320
not really their wealth.

522
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,680
It's very similar to do you remember about

523
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,360
a decade ago, a whole string of rappers

524
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,760
came out and said, oh, that all those

525
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,660
cars and cash and houses, you see, we

526
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,340
rent all that.

527
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,200
We don't own anything.

528
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:45,860
We don't.

529
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:46,820
We're really broke.

530
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,940
Remember that?

531
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,420
Oh, yeah.

532
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,960
Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but yeah.

533
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,260
Yeah.

534
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,780
Well, correct me if even better than that,

535
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,680
though, was when Prince went on The Tonight

536
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,120
Show or whatever and they go, oh, isn't

537
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,500
this great?

538
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,520
Mariah Carey made twenty million dollars and Prince

539
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,560
went, yeah, Mariah Carey, you want me to

540
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,800
really break this down for you?

541
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:05,079
And Leno or whoever's like, yeah, go ahead.

542
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,000
If I sell 20 million albums, how much

543
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,960
are you going to give me out of

544
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,500
each album?

545
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,720
And the guy, you know, Leno's knows nothing.

546
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:13,700
He goes, I have.

547
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,920
Oh, you're going to give me half.

548
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,579
OK, so if you were able to do

549
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,099
that, you know, because obviously you see the

550
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:20,700
look on his face.

551
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,180
He's like, that's awfully generous.

552
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,480
But OK, we'll work with it.

553
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,579
So imagine how many I got to sell

554
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:26,880
in order to make that money.

555
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:30,540
And if I've already sold 100 million and,

556
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,260
you know, that's what they're showing on the

557
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,080
books, even Mariah Carey got ripped off, didn't

558
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:35,300
she?

559
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,380
And like you hear this stunned silence among

560
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:38,760
everybody.

561
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,320
It's like, but everybody forgot about it.

562
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,640
It's like Prince told you that the money.

563
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,600
Well, here's the thing.

564
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,620
Following the money and all that stuff doesn't

565
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,840
work anymore because of the straw man concept.

566
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,020
You put a front man up.

567
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:52,300
Right.

568
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:52,980
Right.

569
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,520
And by the way, I just went through

570
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,560
the whole application.

571
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,400
For example, Chuck, if you went out right

572
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,560
now and applied real estate to and applied

573
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,700
to buy five, 10 million dollar mansions for

574
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,080
50 million total.

575
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:08,520
Right.

576
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,080
And you're going to get denied for all

577
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,200
of them.

578
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,940
You know, you just created 50 million for

579
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,400
the for the financial companies.

580
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,900
That's the thing that I have a hard

581
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,400
time wrapping my mind around, because I know

582
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,580
most people do.

583
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,120
Yeah, I mean, I'm being honest with you.

584
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,020
I've listened to you talk about this and

585
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,060
I go, how did the point is, I

586
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,340
don't know how to access it.

587
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,560
See, I can imagine how that works.

588
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,840
But no, no, no.

589
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,560
You don't understand.

590
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,900
You're going to say you got a homeless

591
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,280
person that has access.

592
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,400
Let me put it in perspective.

593
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,260
Yeah, there's a homeless person.

594
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,180
I haven't talked about some interesting for the

595
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:40,500
mob.

596
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,300
They needed a front man when the popular

597
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,720
cordless tools were green before they went red

598
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,780
and before they went yellow.

599
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,740
Well, right.

600
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,800
Because when you when you were in the

601
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,820
black market, when you have a truck load

602
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,080
of cordless tools, that's where the yellow ones,

603
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,000
you know, that's the D wall, whatever is

604
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,540
in vogue.

605
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,260
This is in the day when the green

606
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,640
ones were invoked, the Makita.

607
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,520
So I needed a front guy.

608
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,800
And I and they were like, you know,

609
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,020
this is real.

610
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,760
He's got a chiseled chin.

611
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:06,840
He's a homeless guy.

612
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,420
Hangs up from the bodega on Vanderbilt Park.

613
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,240
And I'll go talk to him.

614
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,340
And all he did, this guy needed was

615
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,940
like a couple of good meals, a shower

616
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,420
and a shave.

617
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,360
And you put him in a suit.

618
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,660
You could go sit down and, you know,

619
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:17,980
whatever.

620
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,300
Right.

621
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,620
Like a Gary, a Cary Grant or whatever

622
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,560
kind of face, literally looked a lot like

623
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:23,700
them.

624
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:23,960
Right.

625
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,500
So I talked to him and he says,

626
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,500
you know, I used to be one of

627
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,920
the best pilots for American Airlines.

628
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,760
He pulled out his wallet.

629
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,400
He has photographs.

630
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,640
He had his he had his American Airlines

631
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,080
pilot license, everything in there, you know, legit.

632
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,180
This is my house in Nevada, you know,

633
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,340
with a kidney shaped pool.

634
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,620
This is my wife and children, you know.

635
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:44,080
And I'm like, holy crap.

636
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:44,820
Right.

637
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,700
So when I say homeless people, I know

638
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,520
when someone tells me they met a homeless

639
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,800
person, my accounts are very different because I've

640
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,080
always run into homeless people that had one

641
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,180
hell of a back story.

642
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:57,600
Right.

643
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,400
But let's say right now you run into

644
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,840
a homeless person that's just down and out,

645
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,660
never had any money, but they have access

646
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,360
to their social security number.

647
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,380
They can go to any clean them up,

648
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,840
stick them in a real estate office.

649
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,900
And the moment they apply for a 10

650
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:17,140
million dollar house and get denied, the financial

651
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:20,740
company that got the application has conditions is

652
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,740
by filling out this application.

653
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:26,600
You give us a right to sell this

654
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,500
information.

655
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:28,880
Right.

656
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,880
And use it any way we want to

657
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,640
benefit us.

658
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,480
That's some of the common verbs that you

659
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,240
see in there.

660
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,300
They take that application.

661
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,060
It doesn't matter if you're has nothing.

662
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,600
See, they got everyone brainwashed that what's your

663
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,160
income to credit ratio, that your income is

664
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:45,580
irrelevant.

665
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,100
They take the application and they get 10

666
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:49,460
million.

667
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,060
It backs up the finances of the financial

668
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:52,500
company.

669
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,260
That's why when you look at this goes

670
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,960
on the pro form, does not go on

671
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,320
pro forma accounting, which means forward accounting.

672
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,820
This stays in their assets.

673
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,240
Like, let me give you another example on

674
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,780
how to how to think about this.

675
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,040
Right.

676
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,260
When you say you have a hard time

677
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:09,600
with it.

678
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,320
And I'll just say this publicly, it's because

679
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,060
you don't think about finance, financial stuff or

680
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,460
the financial world often.

681
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,340
Just like, for example, if I start getting

682
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:22,480
into right now automotive, what's the timing on

683
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,140
this particular engine?

684
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,040
And should we really do it at Top

685
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,000
Dead Center or should we not?

686
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,800
You'd be like, I really don't get that.

687
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,000
Right.

688
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,420
Because you don't do mechanics talk.

689
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:32,700
Right.

690
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:33,900
Or many subjects.

691
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,640
So the financial stuff is a subject that

692
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,240
is not popular to discuss.

693
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,580
But once you understand the financial subject and

694
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,760
you see what's going on, it's way beyond

695
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,060
any horror movie or what would you call

696
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:49,300
it?

697
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,580
Sci-fi movie.

698
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,100
It's way beyond sci-fi, way beyond it,

699
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,560
because it's not discussed.

700
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,340
It's actually frowned upon to discuss.

701
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,240
There's an old thing I'm trying to old

702
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,920
saying that, you know, when you're around wealthy

703
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,220
people, never talk about money.

704
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:04,520
Right.

705
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,320
I think you understand that they never talk

706
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:07,720
about money.

707
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,620
Only poor people do.

708
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,060
Right.

709
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,640
So, yeah.

710
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,680
So but the workings of the financial is

711
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,000
very different because I'll tell you what, I

712
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,720
have never met a billionaire and I've met

713
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,800
quite a few that know how this works.

714
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,120
Not not a one of them.

715
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,180
So and that's why, for example, when you

716
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,700
go on television and I'm just giving a

717
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,100
broad thing on what's going on that you're

718
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,080
not going to hear anywhere else.

719
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,720
When you go on television, they got these

720
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,440
little short and long documentaries on these very

721
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,320
wealthy people and they give they tell you

722
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,680
a story on how they got there.

723
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,020
Bullshit.

724
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,820
They're all bullshit stories.

725
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,560
They don't even.

726
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,080
Why?

727
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,780
Because they're making up a bullshit story.

728
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,480
No, they don't even know how they got

729
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:45,920
there.

730
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,300
They don't know.

731
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:50,000
They have some kind of foggy idea that

732
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,180
I was working hard trying to sell books.

733
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,540
You know, I'm going right with that one.

734
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,800
I'm working hard.

735
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,840
And then we said, yeah, or whatever.

736
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,700
Or we were working on software.

737
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,840
And then suddenly the story falls apart because

738
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,820
it's like there's no way.

739
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,600
How did you get from here that no

740
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,540
one knows?

741
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,840
It's like they're living their life in the

742
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,480
fog and so is everyone else.

743
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,380
Right now, the thing is, when you start

744
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,180
clearing the fog so you can still see

745
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,860
through a fog, the visibility is limited.

746
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,800
But when you clear through the fog, you

747
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,560
are able to see great distances and see

748
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,220
more detail.

749
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:24,020
And that's what that's where rated Y comes

750
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,460
in, basically, because right now I could tell

751
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,600
all the subscribers here, you, me, everybody you've

752
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,160
ever met is living in a fog.

753
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,440
There's ancient talks, you know, we're living in

754
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:33,800
illusion.

755
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,220
We see through a dark glass.

756
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:39,000
So to say it's totally fair to say

757
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,260
to everyone that you're all living in a

758
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,040
fog.

759
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,600
So but the key point here is what

760
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,200
is a fog?

761
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:46,840
It's a cover.

762
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,400
It's something that obscures.

763
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,240
How do we mitigate that?

764
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,440
How do we get around that?

765
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,440
How do we fix that?

766
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:52,700
Right.

767
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,560
There's many ways to do it, but no

768
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,640
one seems to do it.

769
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:56,340
Right.

770
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:00,200
So again, with the financial stuff, it's very

771
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,040
hard for you to believe.

772
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,180
First of all, I'll tell you why it's

773
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:02,780
hard for you to believe.

774
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,240
First of all, you haven't looked into it.

775
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,560
And even when I looked into it 25

776
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,160
years ago, I was like, this is crazy.

777
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,880
This is worse than any horror movie or

778
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,400
sci fi.

779
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,200
And I've been I've on the record on

780
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,920
conference calls since the early 2000s and on

781
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,880
Revolution Radio and American Freedom Radio back back

782
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,320
in that time.

783
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,020
You know, your application is where all the

784
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:22,660
money comes from.

785
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,240
First one, by the way, saying this publicly

786
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,400
over and over and over.

787
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,200
And it was like, oh, right.

788
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,120
So where I want to go with the

789
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:31,840
financial stuff.

790
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,360
First of all, it's hard for you to

791
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,700
get it, because when you look into it,

792
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,760
even if it's written in stone and you

793
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,400
have someone from the Federal Reserve explain it

794
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,820
to you three different ways, you're still not

795
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,760
going to get it because it has to

796
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,280
sink in.

797
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,820
The second thing is it's hard for anyone

798
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,840
to get it is because who are you

799
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,500
going to go tell?

800
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,400
Who are you going to talk to people

801
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,100
around you?

802
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,480
They're going to think you're crazy because I

803
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,720
filled out many applications.

804
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:56,340
I got filled out applications for the worst

805
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:56,800
one.

806
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,840
You know how I've talked about if you

807
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,280
haven't dropped out of school by the eighth

808
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,040
grade, you're a sucker, really.

809
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:02,820
You really are.

810
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,720
I mean, let's say you skated through high

811
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,040
school.

812
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:08,540
You better have been cussing out being there

813
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,480
and damning that you were there.

814
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,740
But if you believed anything past really the

815
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,320
sixth grade or the eighth grade, you're an

816
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:14,580
idiot.

817
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,740
And they know that.

818
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,100
And what they do is they make you

819
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,060
go to secondary school, college.

820
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,920
And what a fucked up mess that is,

821
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,320
because you go to college.

822
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:24,840
What do you do?

823
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,540
You apply to go to the college.

824
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,060
The college sends that application.

825
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,520
It has the same verbiage that I told

826
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:30,640
you.

827
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,020
They're going to use it and they send

828
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,480
it over, even though it's against the law,

829
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,700
because the 1974 Privacy Act says anything has

830
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,440
to do with education.

831
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,340
They're not allowed to share.

832
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:38,600
Right.

833
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,700
So you go to Harvard.

834
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,220
It's that was at 50 grand a semester

835
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,500
now or something like that.

836
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,220
Seventy five.

837
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,960
I think it's more like a year or

838
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,100
so.

839
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,060
Yeah, we're good.

840
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,160
Yeah.

841
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:50,880
All right.

842
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,620
So it's a hundred.

843
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,220
Right.

844
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,480
So let's say they ask you on the

845
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,300
application specifically, how long do you want to

846
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:55,720
attend for?

847
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,620
Two years, four years.

848
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:56,920
Masters.

849
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:57,720
Why?

850
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:58,600
Why?

851
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,680
Because attending here, you're a sucker anyway.

852
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:01,460
But why?

853
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,080
Because they want to know how much to

854
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,420
ask the Federal Reserve for.

855
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,400
So if you go apply for Harvard, they're

856
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,400
going to go four hundred thousand dollars, pull

857
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,320
that out of the Federal Reserve.

858
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,000
And then when they got it, they're going

859
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,940
to say, how are you going to pay

860
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:12,600
for education?

861
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,580
Going to get a loan?

862
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,360
They've already gotten paid.

863
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,620
Everyone who's ever gone to college used to

864
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,080
go back and subpoena and do a forensic

865
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,300
audit on their application.

866
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,080
And they will see the full amount plus

867
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,620
interest was pulled.

868
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:27,360
So you are a sucker if you did

869
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:27,700
that.

870
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:28,880
Now, you didn't know.

871
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,740
It doesn't matter.

872
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:30,620
Right.

873
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,440
It doesn't matter if you knew or not.

874
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:32,720
Right.

875
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:35,080
It's just like it didn't matter if if

876
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,460
if they peed in the punch bowl.

877
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:36,760
Right.

878
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,660
Did you drink it?

879
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,800
Is the is the issue?

880
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,260
No, I don't want to know.

881
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:40,640
Right.

882
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,040
I don't want to know that someone peed

883
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:42,780
in the punch bowl.

884
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,860
But what are those creatures called attorneys always

885
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,140
say?

886
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:46,380
Right.

887
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,240
Ignorance of the law is not an excuse.

888
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,120
Is that what they say?

889
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,340
Well, and they're the most.

890
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,160
Yeah.

891
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,120
And they are the most ignorant of all.

892
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,440
Of course, I'm still haven't met any attorneys

893
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,820
that know any law at all.

894
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,220
Right.

895
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:58,880
Even Supreme.

896
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,400
I recently posted in the chat that Senator

897
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:07,140
Kennedy was grilling Supreme Court justice candidates and

898
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,280
none of them knew any law.

899
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,500
And whatever they thought they knew was really,

900
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,580
really almost irrelevant to the question.

901
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,440
He really like Jonah Bases put put as

902
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,640
the senator put his foot up their asses,

903
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,200
you know, deservingly so.

904
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,080
And I posted in the chat.

905
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,160
See, they don't know any law because I've

906
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,080
I've been in graced or disgraced being in

907
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,060
the company of a Supreme Court judge twice,

908
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,240
not once, but twice.

909
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,320
Right.

910
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,240
At lunch.

911
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,760
And to prove it, to prove it, I

912
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,680
invited people.

913
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,860
I said, I asked him, is it all

914
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:38,200
right if I bring some friends over?

915
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:38,500
Sure.

916
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,120
Bring them over.

917
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,980
Because he was 93 years old and I

918
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,460
invited deliberately everybody I knew just to witness.

919
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,620
If I say I had lunch with a

920
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:51,760
Supreme Court judge that not once, but twice.

921
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:52,880
Can't catch your breath there.

922
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,000
Excuse me.

923
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:54,280
Yeah.

924
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:54,980
All right.

925
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,120
I'm fine.

926
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,840
Choking on a piece of tobacco.

927
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:58,240
OK.

928
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,280
Witnesses.

929
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,120
So take a second to take a drink.

930
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,240
Let's say this.

931
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,840
You know, the closest thing I ever came

932
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,380
to that is I interviewed Henry Reid, you

933
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,140
know, from the Roe v.

934
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,600
Wade decision.

935
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,460
So I've only ever been in the presence

936
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,460
of somebody argued in front of the Supreme

937
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,360
Court, not a Supreme Court justice.

938
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,380
But you've been in front of quite an

939
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,520
interesting group of people.

940
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,280
But what I'm saying is that even that

941
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,460
sounds crazy, too, because people that are around

942
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,260
those types of people say, oh, how wonderful

943
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:29,660
they are.

944
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,960
And I'm telling you, this guy didn't know

945
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,240
any law at all.

946
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,080
One of the people asked him, what about

947
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,640
jurisdiction?

948
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,860
He said, well, if you're in my courtroom,

949
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,820
I have jurisdiction.

950
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,980
And a bunch of questions about law.

951
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,080
And he says, I don't go about the

952
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,100
law, about the law.

953
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:44,820
I make decisions.

954
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,940
This is purely.

955
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:46,300
All right.

956
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,040
So what I'm saying, the financial people are

957
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,400
going to be doing the same stuff to

958
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:49,680
you.

959
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,700
Like, what do you think this application is

960
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,000
worth?

961
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,160
Anything are you talking?

962
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,560
You still have to pay for it.

963
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,440
You want it for free.

964
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,000
You know, all these distractions.

965
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:58,420
Right.

966
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,060
The only thing I can say about Henry

967
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,360
Reid is that he was able to recount

968
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,100
exactly.

969
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,800
And he did this because I saw a

970
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,700
recording of somebody else asking him the same

971
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,360
question word for word, exactly the same rehearsed

972
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,480
response is what he gave to somebody else

973
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,860
like a year later, because apparently that's what

974
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,520
he was good at.

975
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,160
And that's just a district attorney, by the

976
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:19,400
way.

977
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,760
Yeah, they specialize.

978
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,660
They specialize.

979
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,180
Yes.

980
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,000
That's why they ask you get an accident

981
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,060
lawyer, get this kind of trial lawyer, get

982
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:28,660
this whatever.

983
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,880
But overall, you know what the crux of

984
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,040
the law is in America is that there

985
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,700
will be the government or legislature will make

986
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,640
no law that will interfere with the agreements

987
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,520
and contracts.

988
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,560
That's why it's always you agree, you agree,

989
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,140
you agree.

990
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,780
And they get stuck on that.

991
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,780
You know, the Ninth Amendment is the best

992
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,620
amendment because it says they can't infringe on

993
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:50,260
any right that you already have as long

994
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,400
as it doesn't hurt anyone.

995
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,180
Right.

996
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:52,440
Right.

997
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,080
The Ninth Amendment is the amendment, by the

998
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:55,320
way.

999
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,540
Forget about the other ones.

1000
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,520
The ninth means you have all the other

1001
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,480
ones plus ones that you haven't even figured

1002
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,080
out yet.

1003
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:01,760
Right.

1004
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,740
In other words, the Ninth Amendment allows you

1005
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,720
to extend, let's say, cell phone use.

1006
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:05,980
Right.

1007
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,500
There were no cell phones back then.

1008
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,580
It allows you to apply the Ninth Amendment

1009
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,000
to the use of a cell phone in

1010
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,020
certain situations where you would be banned to

1011
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:14,680
now, let's say.

1012
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:14,980
Right.

1013
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,680
I'm not saying be belligerent.

1014
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,060
But you need to be at this point.

1015
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,160
Another thing that I'm mentioning is that the

1016
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,420
police are completely.

1017
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,360
Let me just say it this way.

1018
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,380
You know, people.

1019
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,760
Oh, I was arrested by the police.

1020
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,880
So the police came to my house.

1021
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,240
I thought, you know, the police is not

1022
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:28,580
a noun.

1023
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,180
It's a verb.

1024
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:30,640
Yeah.

1025
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:31,740
Do you know that?

1026
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,960
Well, it's not a noun.

1027
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,660
And now we've turned it into a noun.

1028
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,960
The way I understood policing, by the way,

1029
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:40,540
was to clean up an area of refuse

1030
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,200
is to police an area.

1031
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,720
That's one of the police.

1032
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:45,720
Yeah.

1033
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,220
The history of the police has two two

1034
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:48,920
deep histories.

1035
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:52,680
New York, Massachusetts, New Jersey is Jersey again

1036
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,120
in the mix.

1037
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,540
Why do they have to throw Jersey in

1038
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,620
the mix every time in the old history?

1039
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,080
Right.

1040
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,140
But it's in there.

1041
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,920
And so anyway, a lot of immigrants.

1042
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,600
I think a lot of immigrants landed there

1043
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,620
because they looked at the city.

1044
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,740
They said too many people.

1045
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,100
So they just drifted away from the city

1046
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,400
and said, OK, there's less.

1047
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,440
This is better.

1048
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:12,820
It is.

1049
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,820
But, you know, it's in New York.

1050
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,020
When you're on the West Side, you see

1051
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:16,940
the Palisades, right?

1052
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,520
That's Jersey.

1053
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,040
True.

1054
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:18,540
Right.

1055
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:23,800
So anyway, they were looking for what they

1056
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,840
already had a police force set up private.

1057
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,120
By the way, slave trade has always been

1058
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:28,460
illegal.

1059
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,640
I think I mentioned that.

1060
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:29,860
Right.

1061
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,940
But for runaway slaves that were in North,

1062
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,280
that's what they're originally for.

1063
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,200
They were like these gangs, like just like

1064
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:35,960
bail bondsmen.

1065
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,680
You know, a bail bondsman can break into

1066
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,040
your apartment, wait for you to come home,

1067
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,600
hit you with a stun gun, put cuffs

1068
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,580
on you and bring you to jail.

1069
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:42,840
Right.

1070
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,380
If you try to skip bail.

1071
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:44,700
Right.

1072
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,540
Or whatever.

1073
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,820
So, yeah.

1074
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,700
So got that from Jackie Brown, by the

1075
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:49,900
way.

1076
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,400
By the way, that's what they were around

1077
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:54,780
for.

1078
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,220
And they were loose, loose knit groups.

1079
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:00,040
Very similar to what was that group before

1080
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:00,720
the FBI?

1081
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,600
The pill was a pill kit.

1082
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,440
What were they called?

1083
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,940
A tip security.

1084
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,000
Pinkerton.

1085
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:07,560
Pinkerton.

1086
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:07,920
Yeah.

1087
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,000
Very much like that.

1088
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,220
Yes.

1089
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:09,620
Pinkerton.

1090
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,180
Thank you.

1091
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,500
So when the banks are becoming popular and

1092
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,640
lending money to the states and the cities

1093
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,900
and they started owning everything in the city,

1094
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,740
they were like, if there's a riot, this

1095
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,680
is our property now because you agreed to

1096
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:21,900
it.

1097
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,260
We need to protect it.

1098
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,320
So they gave money to these slave hunters

1099
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:29,380
like Pinkerton types and local police that were

1100
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:32,500
there to really go after melanated people, really.

1101
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:35,100
And they still are today, by the way.

1102
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,860
And and they funded them by the banks.

1103
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:41,320
So it's a completely illegal operation all the

1104
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,100
way through and through.

1105
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,680
It's kind of like saying like churches are

1106
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,340
pagan, right?

1107
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,680
People don't understand that.

1108
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:46,900
Right.

1109
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,260
But when the more you look into it,

1110
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,640
the more you see how true it is.

1111
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,300
But my point here is it's really shocking

1112
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,240
to bring to bring out what's going on

1113
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:59,600
to the lady, the common people, because they'll

1114
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,620
see it as being uncommon.

1115
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,360
Right.

1116
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:01,820
Knowledge.

1117
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,840
And they can't handle it.

1118
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,140
That's why I've always said in Sonics, always

1119
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,620
forget about the masses.

1120
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,180
They're done.

1121
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,840
They were they were born to be done.

1122
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:10,680
They're filler.

1123
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,260
It's kind of like when you go to

1124
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,580
the pet shop and they got the feeder

1125
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,440
fish and the feeder mice on one end.

1126
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:16,700
Right.

1127
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,700
That you're supposed to buy those little animals

1128
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,720
to feed to the other animals.

1129
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:20,940
Right.

1130
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:21,720
They're not pets.

1131
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,000
Right.

1132
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:22,560
You know what I mean?

1133
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,640
This is what the masses are.

1134
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,700
And it's it's gotten to that point.

1135
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,340
But anyway, I just want to express these

1136
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:33,240
these things, because these two things, the legal

1137
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,220
aspect of how things are run is all

1138
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:39,000
by agreement, not by a contract, basically not

1139
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,520
by law.

1140
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,820
They could use the word law as much

1141
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,480
as they want.

1142
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,880
And when they say law enforcement, they mean

1143
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,140
they were telling you that because you agreed

1144
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,340
to it, the law says that nothing can

1145
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,780
get in between the agreement.

1146
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:51,200
Right.

1147
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:54,280
So but things are going to get weird

1148
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,420
with the financial stuff.

1149
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,680
They're not going to be repeating crashes, by

1150
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:57,960
the way.

1151
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,540
You know how they had the crash of

1152
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,840
twenty nine, the one in eighty seven and

1153
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,780
then the 2008.

1154
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,360
Notice how different they all are.

1155
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:04,840
Right.

1156
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,580
You know, when people start making comparisons to

1157
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,480
the crash of the Wall Street, which was

1158
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,360
not actually in the twenty nine and they

1159
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,120
don't make comparisons to eighty seven and 2008.

1160
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,520
So the next financial pinch is what's what

1161
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,080
it's going to do.

1162
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,719
It's going to break this bubble that exists

1163
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,800
and there's going to be a redistribution and

1164
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,920
a devaluation of whatever.

1165
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:29,380
Do you remember when we were speaking after

1166
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:29,739
Covid?

1167
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,920
I said, if you're not doubling what you're

1168
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,560
taking in, let's say you rely on what's

1169
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,139
called income.

1170
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,960
You better double it as fast as possible

1171
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,840
to be where you were before that.

1172
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,780
And it's not going to go back.

1173
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,300
In other words, certain prices are going down.

1174
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:46,179
But the the getting the idea of things

1175
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:46,960
are more expensive.

1176
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,980
And I went through that in between the

1177
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,060
70s and the 80s.

1178
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,380
Remember, there was a time in the late

1179
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,840
70s when everything got expensive.

1180
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:53,260
Right.

1181
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:53,580
Yeah.

1182
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,480
Let's say that way.

1183
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,639
That was stagflation.

1184
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,520
And I'll tell you something.

1185
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,440
That's one of the most relevant things you

1186
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,140
ever said, quite honestly, is if you don't

1187
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:04,080
have double very soon, you're done and you're

1188
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,760
right, because that's exactly where we find ourselves

1189
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,440
today with the prices of everything backed up.

1190
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,660
And, you know, quite honestly, if you're trying

1191
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:15,960
to exchange, you know what they call currency

1192
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,760
to, you know, take care of the things

1193
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,020
you need, your actual needs.

1194
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:21,760
Yeah.

1195
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,340
Double double is right.

1196
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:26,300
And real quick, I wonder if we're looking

1197
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,420
at a financial crash, by the way, in

1198
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,920
twenty twenty nine, like we saw in nineteen.

1199
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,620
But yeah, you can't crash.

1200
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,920
OK, it already crashed.

1201
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,900
It already crashed.

1202
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,920
So what you're looking at is credit.

1203
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,760
It's so you can't crash credit.

1204
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,180
All you could do, like Greenspan said this,

1205
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,740
what you could do is restrict its flow.

1206
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,280
But when you restrict the flow of credit,

1207
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,000
just like the black market, you know, if

1208
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,740
you want to increase the black market, you

1209
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,580
make regulation.

1210
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,640
You want to kill the black market deregulate.

1211
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:55,000
Right.

1212
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,460
So when they when they the way they're

1213
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,460
going to decrease the flow of credit is

1214
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,620
by denying people access to credit, but keeping

1215
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,660
the application and they themselves are going to

1216
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,320
get the front end loaded, all this tons

1217
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,760
and tons of credit, but they're not going

1218
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,620
to give it to the people.

1219
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,900
And the reason they're going to do that,

1220
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,500
you're ready, is because when it's not distributed,

1221
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,020
you don't have inflation.

1222
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,940
So you're going to see financial companies becoming

1223
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,140
if you think they have a lot.

1224
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,140
Now you're going to watch, let's say, banks

1225
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,520
or financial institutions or balance sheet for the

1226
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,880
next few years is going to double and

1227
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,140
triple.

1228
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,640
So let's say this company is worth 500

1229
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,140
billion.

1230
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,300
By next year, it'll be 800 billion and

1231
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,460
then a trillion and a half as the

1232
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:36,280
credit is being restricted to the people.

1233
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,980
And what that's going to do, it's going

1234
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,520
to because there's less credit, the prices are

1235
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,800
not going to go up as much and

1236
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,240
they're going to have access to a lot

1237
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:43,440
more.

1238
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,720
So they're going to be able to be

1239
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,700
very, very extravagant.

1240
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,240
This is how you hear that people get

1241
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,940
wealthy during hard times.

1242
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,080
This is how they do it now with

1243
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:52,520
the credit.

1244
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:52,800
Right.

1245
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,660
So one thing to do, I suggest to

1246
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,160
people is when you do applications, you have

1247
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,580
three days to send them a letter that

1248
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,820
you're retaining security interest and you want to

1249
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,340
have a meeting of the minds on it.

1250
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,200
Number one.

1251
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:03,840
Right.

1252
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,020
Number two, you give them an outline on

1253
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,620
how you want to divide the application.

1254
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,960
Doesn't matter if you denied me.

1255
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,620
There's no look.

1256
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,080
What's the basis of denial credit report?

1257
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:14,220
You know, credit reporting agencies were started by

1258
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,380
a bunch of mom and pop.

1259
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,740
I think one of them was a mop

1260
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:19,280
company, MLP, that we close with.

1261
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:19,720
Yes.

1262
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:20,540
Yeah.

1263
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:23,000
And what they noticed, what they noticed is

1264
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,420
back in the days, they're all people.

1265
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,000
This is a while back.

1266
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:26,460
They started.

1267
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,220
But in the 60s, civil rights movements, when

1268
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,440
they bought the credit agency agencies and said,

1269
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,740
I got to keep these niggas from getting

1270
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:32,540
access to credit.

1271
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,480
You know, that's how they that's how they

1272
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:34,920
think.

1273
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,660
Big middle aged white guys.

1274
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,520
So what they did was they studied the

1275
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:41,880
history.

1276
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,520
And years ago, when there was silver and

1277
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,860
gold back money before the bank lent you

1278
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,880
money, they actually sent a foot soldier, a

1279
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,860
bank person, like a scout to go out

1280
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,380
into the neighborhood and ask the neighbors about

1281
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,020
your character.

1282
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,840
Do you remember hearing about that?

1283
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,260
Oh, yeah.

1284
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:56,720
Yeah.

1285
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,180
Back in the day, we're talking about back

1286
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:58,600
in the day.

1287
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,760
Now, they used to have a clipboard.

1288
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,800
He's from the bank.

1289
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,600
Don't talk to him.

1290
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:01,820
Right.

1291
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,820
You know, and the stuff like that.

1292
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,940
So now what they did is, well, now

1293
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:08,580
with the credit, everybody's going to get access

1294
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,100
to credit.

1295
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:09,760
This is crazy.

1296
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:12,060
So let's create these credit agencies.

1297
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,660
And yeah, one of them was a mop

1298
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,080
company.

1299
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,540
The other one was just mom and pop.

1300
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:18,300
And they're and they and the financial institutions

1301
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,900
give you that as an excuse.

1302
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:21,020
I said, that's fine.

1303
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,760
You can deny me all you want.

1304
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,500
My my I'll return the denial back to

1305
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:26,680
you.

1306
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,380
I'll sign that monetize that.

1307
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,460
And the other thing is, let's just talk

1308
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,120
about the collateral that you're holding.

1309
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,600
Unjust enrichment is the case.

1310
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:38,160
So I'm kind of like overtaking the sonic

1311
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,000
this time talking about.

1312
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:39,840
It's not about money.

1313
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,800
It's about knowing how things work, which can

1314
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,100
easily lead into the body, the human body.

1315
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,540
Let me just mention another thing.

1316
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,580
I've been looking up some people recently that

1317
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,520
I went to high school with.

1318
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:49,740
Right.

1319
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,620
Put someone's name in.

1320
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,620
And they most likely have a social media

1321
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,860
page, believe it or not.

1322
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,140
Right.

1323
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:54,560
Yeah, true.

1324
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,220
And you look at it and then and

1325
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,920
then and then you see a fucking obituary

1326
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,540
for them, you know, heart disease.

1327
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,920
Are you ready for this one?

1328
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,120
Diabetes.

1329
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,260
Right.

1330
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,820
I'm like, oh, my gosh, I went to

1331
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,120
sixth grade with this guy.

1332
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,560
And he's dead because he trusted the medical

1333
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,520
establishments.

1334
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,400
And just like the financial people, I assure

1335
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,900
you, you go to any bank or whatever

1336
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,520
manager you talk to, they don't know any

1337
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:17,900
of this.

1338
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,020
When you go talk to those medical idiots

1339
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:22,120
that your company tells you to go to

1340
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,300
or whatever, they don't know what's going on.

1341
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,520
They don't know there's no such thing as

1342
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,280
all these diseases.

1343
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,660
And the treatment is actually the part of

1344
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,500
the mass poisoning.

1345
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:29,840
Right.

1346
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:30,820
They don't know.

1347
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,100
But if you go, I can tell you

1348
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:36,020
who does know each hospital, you have the

1349
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,200
administrative staff.

1350
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:37,500
Right.

1351
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,120
And the administrative staff, based on the size

1352
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,060
of the hospital, has, you know, how many

1353
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,920
people there's always at least one or two

1354
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,040
people in the administrative part of the hospital.

1355
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,920
I know exactly what I'm talking about, how

1356
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,560
the treatment, how they're killing people there.

1357
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,920
And that actually expanded during the covid time.

1358
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,920
A lot of the nurses and people that

1359
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,360
were working in hospitals when they were killing

1360
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,540
people in the hospitals with all these ventilators

1361
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:03,820
and drugs and sedations and all that there

1362
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:07,720
were to prevent a nurse rebellion or what

1363
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,380
you call a mutiny.

1364
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:11,060
The administrative people came out and started breaking

1365
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,300
the news to all of the nurses saying,

1366
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,560
hey, if you like your job here and

1367
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,560
you want to make a lot of money,

1368
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,540
just do what we say.

1369
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,160
And guess what?

1370
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,040
A lot of them did.

1371
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,180
A lot of nurses quit also, by the

1372
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:21,440
way.

1373
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:25,740
But but the majority, let's say 51 percent

1374
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:28,440
stayed, which is very dangerous.

1375
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,960
You know, when you think about 51 percent

1376
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,840
of the staff that works with people in

1377
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,740
the hospital are willing to kill you for

1378
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,180
an increase on their paycheck.

1379
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,440
Wow.

1380
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,400
You are living in one hell of a

1381
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,720
society, I should tell you.
