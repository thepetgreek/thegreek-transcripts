1
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,340
I don't know if that's got anything to

2
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,700
do with anything, but uh maybe it does,

3
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:19,480
maybe it doesn't.

4
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,800
Greek you talked about some glitches recently um

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,060
first off though, how you doing?

6
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,580
Uh glitching.

7
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,100
You're glitching, like right now.

8
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:29,360
Glitchy.

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,960
The jitsy.

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:31,940
Well, not really, no.

11
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,620
When you put stuff in people's minds, you

12
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,960
know, it gets more whatever.

13
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,440
For me, the existence here is always glitchy

14
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,560
and incorrect ever since as far back as

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,240
I can remember.

16
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,840
So I'm not really the best person to

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,380
ask, but I am very good at objectifying

18
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,680
stuff, so maybe I am.

19
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,240
I don't know.

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,100
Well, I was thinking about something objectively, and

21
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:55,120
we got a question recently regarding induction.

22
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,640
And you talked about this early on.

23
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,240
They went way back in the Sonics and

24
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,180
started listening to you when you talked about

25
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,540
the Transporter and Star Trek and all that.

26
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,160
And I pulled that into two different pieces

27
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,780
myself, and so did this listener.

28
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,880
And they said, you know, it seems to

29
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,320
me as though the key to being able

30
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,540
to do anything in this entire universe or

31
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,660
matrix or what did they also call it?

32
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,800
Let me look real fast.

33
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:23,340
Simulation.

34
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:23,740
Simulation.

35
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,320
Construct is another good word.

36
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,980
They didn't use that, but they said simulation,

37
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,340
whatever it is you want to call it.

38
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:33,000
The Transporter would be a great everything, not

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,220
just a weapon or a way to cure

40
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:35,680
things.

41
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,160
I mean, look, if you wanted to factor

42
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,740
something out of the body completely or if

43
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,380
you wanted to change the age of somebody,

44
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,960
all you would need is the patterns, right?

45
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,340
And, like, I'm thinking about it because I'm

46
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,040
familiar with the Star Trek canon, and I'm

47
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,860
saying to myself, yeah, induction in that way,

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,560
but that's also transportation.

49
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,340
But I guess induction is transportation, too, just

50
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,620
over a short – you know, like if

51
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,460
we think about food going in, right, and

52
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,560
then it creates induction.

53
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,080
It creates a reaction which creates something else

54
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,039
in the blood, whatever, but that's the body

55
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:10,039
creating it because it had this other material

56
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,680
to work with.

57
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,460
By the way, in terms of creation, the

58
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,460
echo just stopped.

59
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,420
Whatever you just did, did you lean forward

60
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,220
or touch something?

61
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,740
I did touch something, yes.

62
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,500
I will leave it that way if it'll

63
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:19,600
stop.

64
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,360
Okay, whatever that was, that's the echo.

65
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,580
Yeah, that was the echo.

66
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,140
Now it's gone.

67
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:23,700
Excellent.

68
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,180
Okay.

69
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,760
Okay, that's cool.

70
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,940
So I get it.

71
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,660
Well, here's the – this is the primer

72
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,340
on induction.

73
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,120
We have monsoon season here in Tucson.

74
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,160
If you have a rainy season right now,

75
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:34,980
this is what you do.

76
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,560
When you see rain – okay, when you

77
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,900
understand how water is formed in the atmosphere,

78
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:47,600
specifically rainwater, you'll get a handle on, let's

79
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,480
just say, witnessing induction firsthand.

80
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,020
Now, that sounds kind of stupid.

81
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:58,140
It really is because you're witnessing induction firsthand,

82
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,840
first principle inside your body constantly, but you

83
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,780
can't perceive it because it's a first principle

84
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,140
thing.

85
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,380
If you could perceive all the functions in

86
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,820
your body, even some of them, you'd go

87
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,440
mad, right?

88
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,260
So I used to like – when I

89
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,440
was a child, I used to cover –

90
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,360
press my hands over my ears real hard

91
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,280
and you could hear your heartbeat if you've

92
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,160
ever tried that, right?

93
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,220
So there's a lot going on, but okay.

94
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,880
Take a sip of that coffee.

95
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,780
Let's get started.

96
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,780
Rain, if you understand – also rain has

97
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,780
a strong spiritual implication in many ancient rites,

98
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,100
right?

99
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,580
So they're trying to tell you why does

100
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,620
rain always show up in ancient rites, but

101
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,100
okay.

102
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,900
So this is what you do.

103
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,140
Well, okay.

104
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,320
Let's just say what you do.

105
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,280
All right, so you go outside and you

106
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:53,160
find a cloud that's – typically they're very

107
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,840
thick, cumulus clouds, white fluffy.

108
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,060
They might turn gray and they get a

109
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,020
very flat bottom, like a very flat bottom.

110
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,880
You could actually – if you're not aware

111
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,180
of cloud formations, just be aware that thunderstorms

112
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,340
typically – not always.

113
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,540
When it's fully charged, it will get a

114
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,040
very flat bottom as if it's being pressed

115
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,320
up against something, right?

116
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:20,880
Now go get yourself some binoculars, telescope or

117
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,120
whatever if you've got good vision.

118
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,000
Focus on the edge of the cloud or

119
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,680
the bottom of the cloud and then watch

120
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,160
the rain appear.

121
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,920
It'll start falling or when it falls.

122
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,660
And watch the entire rainfall.

123
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,040
Stand underneath a soffit or an overhang or

124
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,380
something.

125
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,420
So you're not in the rain, an umbrella

126
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,400
even or whatever.

127
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,680
Don't get hit by lightning.

128
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,260
And just watch the rainfall.

129
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,900
Now you don't have to do this for

130
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,340
hours.

131
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,020
Sometimes the rain goes on for hours, but

132
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:51,100
just watch pre-formation and you'll get a

133
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:51,420
feeling.

134
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,400
Your mind – and understand that the rainwater

135
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,540
itself, the droplets that are falling to the

136
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:00,280
Earth, are formed underneath that flat layer of

137
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:00,700
the cloud.

138
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,300
Now not always because sometimes if you go

139
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,760
out in a storm and you look up

140
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,120
at the clouds, you kind of see them,

141
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,200
but then there's like this fog under the

142
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:08,440
clouds.

143
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,340
They're very undefined and you can't really see

144
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:11,600
much.

145
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,360
Your best, let's say, visual experience would be

146
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,180
when the cloud forms that flat bottom.

147
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:23,180
Now what they tell you – OK, so

148
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,640
you're going to witness induction.

149
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,600
You say, well, Greg, I don't see anything.

150
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,920
It's just typical rain.

151
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,120
I see the flat bottom and I see

152
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,080
the cloud and then I hear some thunder

153
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,480
maybe or I hear the rain.

154
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,260
I see the rain, but what?

155
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,920
OK, well, you just witnessed it.

156
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,860
Whether you saw it or not or noticed

157
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,520
it or not, whatever.

158
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,640
I remember when I was really young riding

159
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,400
the public transit, the bus sometimes, and I

160
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,120
see all the people run to one side

161
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,300
of the bus and look out the window

162
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,560
because there was a car accident.

163
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,840
I didn't see the car accident.

164
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,380
All I saw was the people running to

165
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,740
the side of the bus to look at

166
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,500
the car accident.

167
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,920
So it might be like that for you

168
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,340
even though you were there.

169
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,260
You see the result, but not the process.

170
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,660
Yeah, they saw enough of it to know

171
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,960
that they want to go see more, and

172
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,000
I saw them looking at something and then

173
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,140
I went to go see what they were

174
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:14,700
looking at.

175
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,220
So either way.

176
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,460
OK, so this is what the idiots, the

177
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,340
morons, the academics, the scientists tell you happens.

178
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,760
You have humidity in the air and it

179
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,580
clings on to dust particles, forms droplets and

180
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,020
falls.

181
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,800
OK, that's so stupid.

182
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,900
OK, now you could use their own science

183
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,440
to disprove that because their own science uses

184
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,780
conservation of mass.

185
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,520
So if you have a given humidity, let's

186
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,760
say 35 percent, because that's typically required, which

187
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,420
is 15 grams of water per cubic meter.

188
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,960
And when you have 35 percent humidity and

189
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,520
the humidity is now clinging to the dust

190
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,400
particle to form water, a form of condensate,

191
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,320
you should have some kind of a humidity

192
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:07,860
meter.

193
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,780
There's several varieties of them.

194
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,060
And you will see that the humidity in

195
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,780
the air is decreasing now because it's leaving

196
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,200
the air and condensating like a dehumidifier almost

197
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,240
on the dust to form a water droplet.

198
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,680
That's not how it happens at all.

199
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,580
Right before the rainfall, we see the humidity

200
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,160
climb.

201
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,060
So where is that water coming from?

202
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,540
Where is that humidity coming from?

203
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,660
So their conservation of matter falls apart.

204
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,380
To give you bullshit like conservation of energy

205
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:42,040
and conservation of matter, that's only true in

206
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,140
a closed system to a degree.

207
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,920
But all closed systems are in open systems.

208
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,800
Like a closed system would be, let's say,

209
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,140
your automobile car.

210
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,980
It's a closed system because you have a

211
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:56,380
gas tank, you have the engine, the cabin

212
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,320
and all that stuff.

213
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,420
But at one point it has to dump

214
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,360
out into an open system, the exhaust, and

215
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,640
at one point it has to suck in

216
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,580
air from the outside.

217
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,380
So it's not really a closed system.

218
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,180
It's semi-closed.

219
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,500
So there's no such thing as a closed

220
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:08,840
system.

221
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,920
No, there's just cooperative subsystems that combine to

222
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,260
create an effect or not.

223
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,600
That's all there is.

224
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:15,960
Right.

225
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:16,760
Yeah.

226
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,320
Yeah, so their thing about humidity clinging to

227
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,820
dust particles is total bullshit.

228
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,780
And if you want to be paid to

229
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,640
be lied to, go to university, go to

230
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,280
eighth grade and beyond or whatever, and you'll

231
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,520
be lied to really well.

232
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,220
And that's what this reality is about.

233
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,159
One of the best ones is go get

234
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,320
yourself a degree in psychiatry.

235
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:35,679
That one's beautiful.

236
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,940
I've been looking at that lately.

237
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:37,760
Oh, yeah.

238
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,799
Oh, gosh, they are so screwed up.

239
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,120
I'll tell you a story about it.

240
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,320
We'll stop right here.

241
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:43,760
OK.

242
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,320
I dated someone who was trying to get

243
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,540
their – or they were getting their doctorate.

244
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,420
Like they tell you you got it but

245
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,360
you don't have it.

246
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,320
It was like a curing period, you know,

247
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,400
after the peer review and your recitation or

248
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,000
dissertation or whatever, bullshit, and your paper and

249
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,660
your thesis.

250
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,780
Yeah, you write your thesis, which basically ends

251
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,440
up being a book that you wrote during

252
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,120
your time, and it's supposed to encompass everything

253
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,220
that you're supposed to have known.

254
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,780
So it's this big book-length manuscript that

255
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,420
they call whatever, and that has to be

256
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:14,740
reviewed.

257
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,980
Yeah, so anyway, so let's go back to

258
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,420
the thing I was talking about psychiatrists.

259
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:26,680
And back in the early 2000s in Jerusalem,

260
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,600
there was a lab that was experimenting.

261
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,640
They didn't buy – these were academics and

262
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,900
scientists, but they were on the fringe.

263
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:36,240
They didn't buy the dust particles forming on

264
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,380
water – humidity forming on dust particles, accumulating

265
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,100
to form raindrops, and that will never happen.

266
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,360
It doesn't work that way.

267
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,140
So they fired these lasers as a form

268
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:52,220
of inforometry where they could measure the quantity

269
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,500
of water based on spectrum analysis and all

270
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:54,720
that.

271
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:55,320
OK.

272
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,640
And they found that every time they did

273
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,700
that with a successive rainstorm, that it took

274
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,840
a few nanoseconds from no rain, no water

275
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,920
present, to lots of water present.

276
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,440
Nanoseconds, billionths of a second, right?

277
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,060
So you're trying to tell me, idiot, moron

278
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,040
scientist, that in billionth of a second, all

279
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,080
that humidity forms on a dust particle?

280
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,020
In a billionth of a second?

281
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,780
That would be so much momentum, it would

282
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:26,020
be almost like a sub-nuclear detonation.

283
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,740
It would be like a capacitive discharge.

284
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,300
It would look a thousand times brighter than

285
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,600
any Fourth of July fireworks show up there,

286
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,600
if that were true, what they're saying, again,

287
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,780
with the humidity forming.

288
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,200
So it's actually forming out of thin air,

289
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,120
literally out of the ether.

290
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:47,580
The ether collapses through the programming, no different

291
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:52,440
than Photoshop, or no different than, well, what

292
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,720
are computer programs where you generate things, right?

293
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,760
There's an outline, right?

294
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,120
It gives you an outline, then you have

295
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,540
different fills, different shapes, right?

296
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,960
There's some control network somewhere that is pumping

297
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,620
us what we need.

298
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,940
Like, for example, Charles Fort, Fortian stuff in

299
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,120
Book of the Damned, and the other book,

300
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:14,820
Lowe, I think.

301
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,020
I was reading Fort in the 80s, and

302
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,180
by the way, when I was at the

303
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,520
New York Public Library, one of the librarians

304
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,500
came to me and says, you know, this

305
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,100
is where Nikola Tesla sat, and I'm just

306
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,200
going to tell you that, because you're reading

307
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,660
some of the same books that he did,

308
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,160
you know, reportedly.

309
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,080
So the books that Tesla was reading, I

310
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,800
was reading, and sitting where he was, unknowingly.

311
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,820
And also Charles Fort.

312
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,220
Okay, so Charles Fort talks about how things

313
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:49,040
were unusual appearances, where people thought about certain

314
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,320
things.

315
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,120
Like, for example, all the insects went missing

316
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,080
in England in the 1800s, and they were

317
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,840
reporting on it.

318
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,080
Hey, you notice there's no flies or beetles

319
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,260
or butterflies or dragons?

320
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,640
Yeah, I was like, what happened?

321
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,820
And then suddenly one day, thousands of, you

322
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,640
know, tons of insects started falling from the

323
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,780
sky, live and dead.

324
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,600
Yeah, enough that the people could shovel off

325
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,000
the street, because the constructor or the programmer

326
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,040
kind of like, what's that, Hunger Games?

327
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,280
Hunger Games where they're running around, or they

328
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,880
could program your reality, right?

329
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,260
These controllers, you remember that?

330
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,760
I don't remember if there was a Hunger

331
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,160
Games.

332
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,400
Hunger Games was more like a competition, because,

333
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,120
you know, the rich people wanted the poor

334
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,920
people to compete so they could feed their

335
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,480
sick.

336
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,200
Sure, but during the competition, they had a

337
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,720
control center where they could make it rain

338
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,580
where you were or give you a weapon.

339
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,900
Oh, well, climate control.

340
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,420
And it would just appear.

341
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,380
Yeah, climate control stuff and things like manifestation

342
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,540
have been in a lot of...

343
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,840
See, that's why I wanted to go back

344
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,760
to the Star Trek thing real quick, because

345
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,940
the thing that the subscriber gets to here

346
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,400
is that, look, you're talking about all sorts

347
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,640
of natural observations of induction.

348
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,020
And indeed, we need to know about it,

349
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,420
we need to know how it works, but

350
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,540
what he's saying is, or she, I'm not

351
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:03,300
sure, is saying, is that if you had

352
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,700
control of that, if you actually knew how

353
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,020
to direct that...

354
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,560
Yeah, that's a good point.

355
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,260
Okay, look, let's just say it's involuntary, but

356
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,720
when we do, for example, when we do

357
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,440
the weather work, we do have a certain

358
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,160
amount of control.

359
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,640
And when you say control, you're implying there's

360
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,640
some form of planning or engineering in the

361
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,340
background, right?

362
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,660
So, like, for example, a simplest form would

363
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,940
be the room is dark, you know there's

364
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,280
a light switch, and you say, I'm going

365
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,600
to go in and turn on the light.

366
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,980
There's a sense of planning, there's a sense

367
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,260
of engineering that's in place already, and you're

368
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,460
confident that you can apply that planning and

369
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,040
engineering because everything's in place, and you have

370
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,040
control that way, right?

371
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:43,920
On and off, right?

372
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,780
So we can do that with weather, pretty

373
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,920
much, at a rate of anywhere between 50

374
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,280
% to 90% success, which is very

375
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:51,660
high.

376
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,400
In terms of baseball statistics, there's no one

377
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,720
who's ever had a record like that on

378
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,220
basic weather stuff that we do.

379
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,140
So the control aspect of it, yeah, you

380
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,820
may not fully understand it, but you know

381
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,760
enough about it to control it.

382
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,280
That's fine, and we do.

383
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,880
That's why I speak on, in terms of

384
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,920
the human body, universal principles.

385
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,060
I speak to people often, and they say

386
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,120
that they have a sore on their leg,

387
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,460
and they say, well, what do you eat?

388
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,260
I say, oh, the sore's on the front

389
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,000
of your left leg.

390
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,100
They say, well, how did you know that?

391
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,460
How could you know that?

392
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,240
Well, I just asked you a few questions,

393
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,660
and the things that you intake into your

394
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,440
body and the way you age and all

395
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,340
that stuff, it would have to go on

396
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,540
the front of the body and on the

397
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,240
left-hand side, right?

398
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,980
They're like, how did you know that?

399
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,460
99% of the time, people explain they

400
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,600
want to speak to me about a condition.

401
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,020
Don't tell me anything about it.

402
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,180
After I do an interview, I tell them

403
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,740
exactly where it is and how long it's

404
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,100
been there.

405
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,760
They're like, how did you know that?

406
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,840
And I ask them, don't tell me specifically.

407
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,120
I just want to ask you some questions

408
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,700
first, because I'm piecing together what they're telling

409
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,900
me, right?

410
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,580
Now, do I know any more than that?

411
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,400
No, I don't.

412
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:08,640
But it's simply being able to ask people

413
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:15,000
questions about their lifestyle and what they eat

414
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,800
and mentioning against them is pretty amazing.

415
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,980
Do I understand all of it?

416
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,460
Sorry, something just disrupted you during that last

417
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,240
sentence and a half.

418
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,580
You must have passed by.

419
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,020
Oh, okay.

420
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:26,940
Sorry, go ahead.

421
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,560
No, no, I'm not moving.

422
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,240
I'm not moving at all.

423
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,320
What I'm saying is simply asking just a

424
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,400
query about certain conditions and lifestyle of someone

425
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,420
and then telling them where the sore is

426
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,040
or the tumor or they're having the affliction.

427
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,540
They're amazed by it, right?

428
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:47,000
Because I've pieced together enough controls and enough

429
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,920
of the engineering of how the body works,

430
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,760
that it can be applied.

431
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,340
So you could say directly you can reverse.

432
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,980
You know how many times I've said the

433
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:00,420
current establishment has done tons of grunt work

434
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,220
just because they're morons, don't throw it all

435
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,160
away, right?

436
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,980
So like in other words, ditches have to

437
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,740
be dug, right?

438
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,420
If you had most of people digging ditches,

439
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,600
that's all they did, and they didn't know

440
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,560
why they were digging them.

441
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,600
It doesn't mean just go fill them up

442
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:14,820
again.

443
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,460
They're useful.

444
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,820
You could throw things in there, right, or

445
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,440
whatever, build a foundation.

446
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,360
For instance, anatomical maps in the medical industry

447
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,240
are useful because they show you things that

448
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:27,840
are under the skin.

449
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,700
This is where this is.

450
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,620
This is where that is.

451
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,380
I'll tell you what though.

452
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,200
They are useful if you're dealing with dead

453
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:36,520
people.

454
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,380
They're not very useful when you're dealing with

455
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:38,620
living.

456
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,760
Remember, when you die, the body changes very

457
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,960
radically within minutes.

458
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,260
Do you remember we were talking about thyroid

459
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,840
and all that, and they show anatomy of

460
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,320
a thyroid?

461
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,600
That's not really what the thyroid looks like.

462
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,280
That's what the thyroid looks like when you're

463
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,140
dead, right?

464
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,880
What the thyroid looks like when you're alive

465
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,700
is very different but similar.

466
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,240
Like a live fish in an aquarium will

467
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,240
look very similar to a dead fish at

468
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,079
the fish market, the same fish, let's say

469
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,079
whatever trout, let's say, or whatever, right?

470
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,500
Very similar, but they're actually very different.

471
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,480
They appear very different because they're alive.

472
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,359
They're in motion.

473
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,900
If it's still, it's still in motion.

474
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,260
Yeah, even the color changes.

475
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,240
Like I've actually seen an open head wound

476
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,579
and it's still a living brain.

477
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,920
It does not look like the anatomical examples

478
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,940
that are photographed after autopsies.

479
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,760
It is a totally different looking thing.

480
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,340
It looks like purple and brown, and then

481
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,480
you see a very light spot where the

482
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,040
brain would be, almost white.

483
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,920
Yes, when it's alive.

484
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,340
When it's alive, yeah.

485
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,700
It's not gray matter.

486
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,280
It's gray matter when it's dead, yeah.

487
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,380
Right, that's what I was going to say.

488
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:49,460
Think of dry flowers and live flowers.

489
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,260
Anything living and anything dead is not a

490
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,100
direct comparison.

491
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,460
It's just one thing's alive, one thing's dead.

492
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,120
But what I'm trying to say here, these

493
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,000
morons, the medics, the medical people, the academics,

494
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,140
the scientists and all that, now they are

495
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:06,300
morons because there's an exception.

496
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,900
When I say they're idiots or morons, the

497
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,860
exceptions are those who figure out that it's

498
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,580
all bullshit and politics.

499
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,000
They're still there, but they're like, how do

500
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,740
I get out of here?

501
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,320
I need to do something else.

502
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,820
Those are the exceptions.

503
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,280
The ones that stay in there are morons,

504
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,260
for sure.

505
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,700
There's no doubt about that.

506
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:29,000
So take what they give and try to

507
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,080
use it and apply it with universal principles,

508
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,500
living versus dead, up versus down.

509
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,160
Here's the thing.

510
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,580
Everything has an electrical – it's not fair

511
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,240
to say electrical because you think of battery

512
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,900
cells and the power in your wall and

513
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,200
all that.

514
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,960
If all living things were not electrical in

515
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,000
some capacity, no pun intended for you electrical

516
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,360
heads, you couldn't kill something alive with electricity,

517
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,520
right?

518
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,140
Because it has to be a parity.

519
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,800
So if you can kill something that's alive

520
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,360
with electricity, it's because it has electricity keeping

521
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,060
it alive.

522
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,500
You get it?

523
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,400
So where is the study in that?

524
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,820
Now there used to be – you used

525
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,980
to interview – I remember a long time

526
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,620
ago this doctor that came around and talked

527
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,220
about Iraq where they did have weapons of

528
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,360
mass destruction or whatever, and he was a

529
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,560
gastrointestinologist or something like that, working medical stuff.

530
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,440
And I asked him a question.

531
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,460
I don't know if it was – yeah,

532
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,620
I don't know if it was on air

533
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,040
or off air.

534
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,780
How would you explain the impulses or what

535
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,360
keeps the digestive system going?

536
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,400
He says, it's electrical.

537
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,840
And I'm like, where's your electric medicine then?

538
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,940
Why are you putting chemicals in there?

539
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,980
And drugs, right?

540
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,960
So yeah, OK.

541
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,580
Take what they – it's a very broad,

542
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,680
broad field, but you have to learn it

543
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,080
on your own.

544
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:59,420
And unfortunately, the universal principle stuff, I don't

545
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,540
know where you're going to learn it now.

546
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,220
We would have been better off without a

547
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,160
computer in the 1970s or 1980s and tell

548
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,440
people just go run to some good libraries

549
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,320
or good old bookstores, and you'd have a

550
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,620
much better chance when things like macrobiotics and

551
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,660
Taoism and Qigong and things like that were

552
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,240
taught openly, right?

553
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,680
You could always find a place.

554
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,920
OK, now you think with the advent of

555
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,040
the Internet, you'd have access to that information.

556
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,200
Yeah, you do, and it's so watered down

557
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,520
it's almost not worth even looking at, right?

558
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:32,140
So anyway, the induction thing, yeah, you do

559
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:32,920
have control.

560
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:33,740
You do have control.

561
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,100
You have to understand the universal principles.

562
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,840
We do this all the time.

563
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,460
We speak about that all the time here.

564
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,960
Right, absolutely.

565
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,340
Well, OK, so another one is another input

566
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:49,020
from a subscriber is this guy always asks

567
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,100
about stuff that has to do with what's

568
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,040
coming next, that kind of thing.

569
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,440
Anyway, do you think things will get better

570
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,000
as a type of deception?

571
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,620
OK, I know what he's asking here.

572
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,560
In other words, are we going to have

573
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,100
sort of a false nice time here where

574
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,280
everything's going to get really, really good before?

575
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,040
Absolutely.

576
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:08,660
Yeah.

577
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:13,700
Yeah, I wonder, that's one of the things

578
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,060
I spoke about in Sonics.

579
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,760
It'll appear real and you'll benefit from it

580
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,680
because it's real.

581
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,120
Like, for example, with the finance, again, you

582
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,480
go to buy a house or a car

583
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,780
with a loan from the bank.

584
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,360
Oh, thank you, God, for getting me a

585
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:26,780
loan.

586
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,420
Actually, they didn't lend you anything.

587
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,400
They took your note.

588
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,060
They have permission to run your note and

589
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,140
get money from the Federal Reserve.

590
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,180
You don't know what's going on, but if

591
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,300
you really needed that loan to make a

592
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,000
business move or buy something that you couldn't

593
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,780
have without the loan, is that a benefit

594
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,240
to you?

595
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,180
Yes, it is.

596
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,200
But what you think it is, it really

597
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,700
isn't, right?

598
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,840
So you're going to get a very conservative

599
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,380
state.

600
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,700
Archaics talks about this also, but I spoke

601
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,500
about this 20 years ago or 15 years

602
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,860
ago with you, or 10 years ago, that

603
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,000
you're going to get into a very classic

604
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,540
Old Testament type, what do you call it?

605
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,180
Culture, mindset, lawful kind of conservative.

606
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,360
That would be conservative for sure, right?

607
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,780
Well, conservative kind of outlook.

608
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:13,300
Yes.

609
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:17,100
Yes, definitely by today's standards, conservative, yeah.

610
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,480
Yeah, and everything that comes along with it.

611
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,840
And by the way, when there was that

612
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,580
very conservative mindset where, like, the white people

613
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,760
ruled, if you were not white, you didn't

614
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,120
count.

615
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,080
By the way, by law, you still don't.

616
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:36,700
If you read the slaughterhouse cases, only white

617
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,800
men can function in law and all that

618
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,340
other stuff.

619
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,100
It hasn't been repealed.

620
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,680
I'm not saying that I'm for that, because

621
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,120
actually the white men is actually...

622
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,180
Anyway, I've talked about it.

623
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,500
You know what I say?

624
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,540
Think about white people.

625
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:56,200
So not the white people, the color of

626
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,820
your skin, because you could be any color

627
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,620
and act like a white.

628
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,360
It's the culture.

629
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,300
It's so watered down and lost, and I

630
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,080
don't know what happened.

631
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,560
But actually I do, but it's another discussion.

632
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,740
You need some European flavor.

633
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,820
Yes, I'm borrowing that for a public presentation

634
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,160
I'm planning on doing, by the way.

635
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:16,960
So just to let you know, there's going

636
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,800
to be a serious influence where I'm basically

637
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,120
going to explain to a room full of

638
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,260
white people that they're stupid.

639
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,120
Well, it's not stupid.

640
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,740
Something happened to their culture.

641
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,440
Give me an example.

642
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,740
You go to any multi-ethnic, multicultural, hip

643
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:33,060
cultural place like New York City, San Francisco,

644
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,180
whatever, you're going to get Thai food, Chinese

645
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,420
food, Greek food, Italian food, Spanish food, Peruvian

646
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,820
food, on and on and on, Ethiopian food,

647
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,060
right?

648
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,060
You're not going to see English food from

649
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,500
England or Dutch food from Holland.

650
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,700
Never, never, ever, ever, ever.

651
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,380
As a matter of fact, the British...

652
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,540
Yeah, and the fish and chips are terrible

653
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:54,900
there too.

654
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,780
They supposedly are the king of fish and

655
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,360
chips and they cook it in beef tallow.

656
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,140
It's soaked in oil.

657
00:23:59,240 --> 00:23:59,660
It's lousy.

658
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,300
You want good fish and chips, go to

659
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,320
the east coast of the U.S., the

660
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,520
seafaring states like Massachusetts and Maine or whatever,

661
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,300
even New York.

662
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,580
They got better fish and chips at Wendy's

663
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,280
when they had it than anywhere in England.

664
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,600
So something happened to that culture.

665
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,200
Any boardwalk will give you better fish and

666
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:20,300
chips.

667
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:24,000
Any boardwalk venue will give you...

668
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,200
Yeah, will give you better fish and chips

669
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,820
than anything you'll get in England or the

670
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,480
U.K. or whatever.

671
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,820
So something happened to the culture and the

672
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,120
people have been walking around with their head

673
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,960
up their ass for a long time and

674
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,160
they don't have to.

675
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,880
Yeah, I talk about white people food all

676
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,500
the time.

677
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:40,940
Oh, yeah.

678
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,380
My whole presentation is going to be about

679
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,500
how these people have this perception of what

680
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,920
life, you know, the mafia is.

681
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,780
And you know zero is what the problem

682
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,060
is.

683
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,040
Oh, the mafia again.

684
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,340
Well, here's the thing.

685
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,180
I spoke to an engineer.

686
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,260
He designed most of the...

687
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,660
He's kind of damned for it.

688
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,100
You know, everything has to go through Atlanta,

689
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:01,380
right?

690
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,900
With I-10 and the highways and all

691
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,080
that.

692
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,900
They made it some kind of hub.

693
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,640
He didn't agree to that, but he worked

694
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,560
on it, designed it.

695
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,940
He's a melanated or black guy who studied

696
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,700
in the 1940s engineering, got a doctorate in

697
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,280
engineering, civil engineering and all that.

698
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,780
And when all these civil rights...

699
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:23,320
No, when the affirmative action came out, he

700
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,780
was in on the writing of it or

701
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,500
the consulting of it before it was even

702
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,160
made public.

703
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:29,120
Right?

704
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,860
Like in other words, when they do...

705
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,320
They have these...

706
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,760
What do they call these groups that work

707
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,400
with the government?

708
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,040
They're NGOs like RAND.

709
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,340
They consult...

710
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:37,940
What are they called?

711
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,660
Like think tanks?

712
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,700
You can call them think tanks.

713
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,520
There are think tanks.

714
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,720
There's also the NGOs like you were talking

715
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,520
about which may be a think tank or

716
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:44,860
not.

717
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,880
Sometimes they have a think tank as part

718
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,100
of it.

719
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,320
They call them an institute, etc.

720
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,980
But they're really just these organizations that operate

721
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,820
within and around governments that are not governments.

722
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,100
That's all they are.

723
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,080
Yeah, so by the end of the 50s,

724
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,900
he found out they were doing this affirmative

725
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,280
action program and it had nothing to do

726
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,380
with a lot of people the way they

727
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,900
get it politically and through the media.

728
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,840
It's all you're giving people that, you know,

729
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,340
without merit, a position where they should...

730
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:16,020
Not meritoriously positioned, you know.

731
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,000
It's just because of their ethnicity or skin

732
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,840
color and a lot of people griping about

733
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,340
that, right?

734
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,640
But the real reason it was done, he

735
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,860
explained to me, was because by the late

736
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:29,320
50s, the industry of America realized it was

737
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:34,300
all populated almost exclusively by middle-aged white

738
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:34,620
men.

739
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,280
And the creativity, the design factors, the engineering,

740
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,220
all that was getting really stale and inbred.

741
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,800
They couldn't come up with new ideas.

742
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,760
Stuff they were building was...

743
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,660
There was no progress.

744
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,880
It was not very good.

745
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,560
And they figured, like, why are we falling

746
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,600
so far behind?

747
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,500
And we can't see how we can get

748
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:52,980
anything better.

749
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,780
And then the idea came out, because it

750
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,220
has nothing to do with your education.

751
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,740
It has to do with you need cultural

752
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:57,970
influence.

753
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,820
You need other ethnic culture.

754
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,640
You need geographic culture.

755
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,580
You need ethnic culture, different culture culture to

756
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:09,620
come in and that acts like...

757
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,380
It cross-pollinates indirectly flavor.

758
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,060
Adds flavor, let's say, right?

759
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:17,360
And that's why they did it, is because

760
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,980
the middle-aged white, which was all exclusive,

761
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,580
all the above middle-level management up was

762
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:28,540
all white, middle-aged, whatever, and exclusively, no

763
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,360
women, right?

764
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,300
So they said, you have to integrate.

765
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,480
You have to bring in other cultures, ethnicities,

766
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:36,980
all that.

767
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:40,080
Even though they may not be specialists in

768
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,760
the field, they will bring something that will

769
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,380
allow the...

770
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,720
It's like fertilizer, in a way, in a

771
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,100
good way.

772
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,160
It'll enrich.

773
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,360
It's like bringing in new nutrients, right?

774
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,400
And that was the reason why they did

775
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,220
it, but they never went public with that.

776
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,160
They just said, okay, we got this thing,

777
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,220
affirmative action, because a lot of people are

778
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,300
disenfranchised, and if you get federal money, you

779
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,860
have to comply.

780
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,460
That's all they said.

781
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,280
They didn't really give you the history of

782
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:06,380
it.

783
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,220
When I heard that, I was like, oh,

784
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,180
that makes total sense.

785
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,360
And actually, not only does it make total

786
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,200
sense, it makes too much sense, because I've

787
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,900
been talking about shit like that for years.

788
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,180
Thank you for telling me.

789
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,200
Right?

790
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,460
And actually, no one's ever heard of what

791
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,440
I just told you, because it was very

792
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,840
private at the time.

793
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,680
That would be an insult and a slap

794
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,200
in the face to white America if they

795
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,460
came out and said the reason why we're

796
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:30,420
doing this is because you guys are inbred,

797
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:35,700
and now conscious or mentally inbred, professionally inbred.

798
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,220
You need some external genes, right?

799
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,420
Let's say, right?

800
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,680
And to your industry, they couldn't tell the

801
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,160
people that.

802
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,120
And when I heard that, I was like,

803
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:43,620
wow.

804
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,520
Thank you for sharing that.

805
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,120
You know what's funny about that is that

806
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,920
very recently, a couple of, like, very, let's

807
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:54,900
call them Afrocentric bloggers or very, like, you

808
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:59,800
know, black sort of bloggers have actually started

809
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,660
talking about this.

810
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,160
And I thought it was the wildest thing,

811
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,460
because I've heard about it from you a

812
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,420
few years ago already.

813
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,500
But these guys started going, you know what

814
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,540
the real problem is?

815
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,640
Is, you know, because they're arguing about DEI

816
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,300
and all this, right?

817
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,620
Diversity, whatever.

818
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,540
The point is, is that diversity.

819
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,960
Well, they're calling diversity now is something different.

820
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,700
They want men to dress like women.

821
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,580
But anyway, go ahead.

822
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,340
But no, but that's not the whole thing.

823
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:24,040
The whole thing was meant to bring everybody

824
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,620
in.

825
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,980
So it got perverted, and now we're going

826
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,600
to bring in the whole, you know, transgender

827
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,560
and all that nonsense.

828
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,460
But the truth is.

829
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,760
Yeah, that's what the new stuff is.

830
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,600
But to bring everybody in is not the

831
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:34,820
point.

832
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,900
The point was to cross-pollinate and bring

833
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,900
in, instead of having this monoculture that is

834
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,700
dying, right?

835
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,560
Like brother and sister having babies over generation

836
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,220
after generation.

837
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,000
They needed to, what do you call it

838
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,400
when you, it's incestuous almost.

839
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:54,420
Intellectual incestuous kind of degrading thing.

840
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,600
Yeah, they needed to bring in.

841
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,340
Yeah, intellectual incest.

842
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:58,700
Perfect.

843
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,820
But that's the thing.

844
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:02,780
You have to diversify things a bit in

845
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:05,080
order to strengthen the product.

846
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,300
It's that simple.

847
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,860
And as time goes on, yeah, it's going

848
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,340
to get stale.

849
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,220
And this is how these guys are starting

850
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:11,880
to talk about it.

851
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,700
And I was like, are these guys listening

852
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,520
to the Greek?

853
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,960
Because it's almost exactly the same thing, except,

854
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:21,120
you know, they kind of go, you know.

855
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,820
Well, the thing is, well, ask them for

856
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,920
their source on the info.

857
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,300
Did they intuit it?

858
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,340
Is it intuitive?

859
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,760
That would be good.

860
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,900
You're picking it up from the field, right?

861
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,440
Yeah, I have written to a couple.

862
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,640
It could be intuitive, but I could give

863
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,360
you my source.

864
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,580
I just gave you my source.

865
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,320
No, I know.

866
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,320
So it was an engineer, yeah.

867
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,480
I didn't mention him by name.

868
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,220
No, no, no problem.

869
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,360
But I wrote to them and asked them,

870
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,560
and I didn't get many responses.

871
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,140
But I did get one response, and the

872
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,980
guy said it is just what makes sense

873
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,980
and is obvious.

874
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:53,660
And I said, okay.

875
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,560
Oh, so they intuited.

876
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,640
Good, very good.

877
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,140
So they're picking up from the intuition.

878
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,400
Yeah, absolutely.

879
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,540
This guy Ken Yeta out there, if anybody

880
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,820
runs across him on, like, Substack or I

881
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,240
think he might even have a YouTube channel.

882
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,460
But he talks about this kind of stuff

883
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:11,000
and goes, look, this is the truth about,

884
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,920
you know, a bunch of different things.

885
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,760
But it just so happened, and he said

886
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,920
almost exactly what you said, about how diversity

887
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,880
is not what it is.

888
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:24,940
But his source essentially was a thought experiment

889
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:25,660
or intuition.

890
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:26,320
Yeah.

891
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,600
See, I wouldn't have picked this up.

892
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,360
Well, maybe I would have, but I'm telling

893
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,220
you, I had a conversation more than a

894
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,460
decade ago with someone who was directly involved

895
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,500
with this.

896
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,760
You can look up who designed the –

897
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,680
it's called the Atlanta Interchange or all the

898
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,060
highways that go through Atlanta, whatever, all the

899
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:44,480
engineers.

900
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,480
And his name is there.

901
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,180
He's given credit.

902
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,700
They put his name on a bronze plaque

903
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,160
or whatever.

904
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,920
But anyway, I thought that was really cool.

905
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,460
And, like I said, they couldn't come out

906
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:57,480
with that kind of deep, let's say, intel

907
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,140
back in the late 50s publicly.

908
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,580
Not even now they're doing it.

909
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,460
They're not even talking about it now.

910
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,980
Anyway, and by the way, a lot of

911
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:08,960
wealthy, melanated or black people were very upset

912
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,940
about the Civil Rights Movement because they knew

913
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,040
where it was going to lead to.

914
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,940
They knew that they were going to give

915
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,200
this false sense of, quote-unquote, civil rights,

916
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,700
which are not constitutional rights.

917
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,040
They're not lawful, by the way.

918
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:24,120
It's all statutory and has to do with

919
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:24,640
economics.

920
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,340
If you receive federal money, you have to

921
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:26,980
do this, right?

922
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:30,460
What I heard from them, this is from

923
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:33,460
one of the inventors, his dad, the super

924
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,660
soaker, he's worth like $150 million.

925
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,580
I forgot his name.

926
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,360
Somebody that was working with him, and I

927
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,320
was in that group, but indirectly I never

928
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:47,300
crossed over and had direct conversations with him.

929
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:52,060
But a lot of people that were prominent,

930
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,600
they were like, this is bad because the

931
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,080
Civil Rights Movement is just a bait.

932
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,840
They're doing that so they could beef up

933
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,320
their police force, and then they're going to

934
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:05,300
bring the police in and start predating on

935
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,080
people, which is what happened.

936
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:11,380
There's more to the story, but the idea

937
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:15,020
of a, quote-unquote, black neighborhood is a

938
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:18,020
ghetto was not prevalent until after the Civil

939
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,140
Rights Movement, right?

940
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,360
The ghetto concept, right?

941
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,840
And so, yeah, what it did was the

942
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,200
opposite.

943
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:28,900
It actually brought slavery back.

944
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:32,300
If you brought the concept of, let's say,

945
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:36,440
black slavery and how that was administered, it's

946
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:40,500
very much administered, black, quote-unquote, neighborhoods are

947
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,680
administered the same way today.

948
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:48,040
So anyway, they saw it as a very

949
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:48,720
negative thing.

950
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,160
No one ever speaks about all of the

951
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,260
affluent black neighborhoods in the country.

952
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,180
When you say black neighborhood, they go, boom,

953
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:55,520
ghetto.

954
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,080
Where did these rappers or basketball players come

955
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:58,580
from, right?

956
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,680
So it's still going on.

957
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,820
I mean, it's just sick.

958
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,340
I mean, you're being deceived about everything.

959
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,900
Well, go figure.

960
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:09,980
So anyway, any more questions?

961
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,300
No, those are the only two I have.

962
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,960
Yeah, and also it was like what's coming.

963
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,320
Yeah, it's going to be false, but you're

964
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,380
going to benefit from it, just like most

965
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:24,219
people feel like they benefit from whatever, going

966
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:26,719
to medical or going to attorneys or going

967
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,659
to doctors.

968
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,840
It doesn't work that way.

969
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,760
It's a short term.

970
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,699
It doesn't last long.

971
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,780
Anyway, what I want to bring up was

972
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,920
someone we've been in contact for a long

973
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:39,580
time, and regarding healing modalities, we tried certain

974
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:39,960
things.

975
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,860
This was a skin condition, and he emailed

976
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:43,040
me.

977
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:43,639
He says, guess what?

978
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:45,179
You know, I tried eggs, and eggs really

979
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:46,440
worked out well for me, even though we

980
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,400
were talking about no meat, no oils, and

981
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,600
things like that, no animal.

982
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,060
I don't like to say meat.

983
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:52,719
I just say animal, right?

984
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,940
That covers it a little better.

985
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,940
And then there's, by the way, with animal,

986
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,140
you have typically when I say animal means

987
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,680
where you have the flesh of a dead

988
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:05,980
animal.

989
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,060
But you can have animal products where the

990
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,480
animal stays alive, like eggs and milk, for

991
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,860
example, except fish eggs.

992
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,080
Fish eggs, they usually kill the fish.

993
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,020
They have to get it out of the

994
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:20,680
corpse of the fish.

995
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:24,940
But typically, eggs from fowl and milk from

996
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:29,160
milk goats, milk sheep, cows, the animal retains

997
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:29,980
its life, right?

998
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,740
And it's putting out that product anyway.

999
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,120
So that is a different class when I

1000
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:35,700
say animal.

1001
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,580
But I include those in there typically because

1002
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,720
that's more conservative.

1003
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,320
But he found that eggs were very regenerative

1004
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:42,860
and helpful.

1005
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:48,960
Now, if you know anyone from Asia, and

1006
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,400
you know how Americans eat two eggs and

1007
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,780
bacon and all that for breakfast, right?

1008
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,960
In Asia, if you eat an egg, they're

1009
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,420
like, oh, wow, you're eating an egg.

1010
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,200
And you're like, yeah, I usually have two.

1011
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:58,840
They're like, wow.

1012
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,280
It's a big deal to eat an egg

1013
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,380
in Asian culture because they understand that if

1014
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,640
you ask them why this is such a

1015
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,860
big deal, they can't tell you directly.

1016
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:10,740
But in their culture, which uses a lot

1017
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:13,100
more, they're more considerate about the energy of

1018
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:13,380
things.

1019
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:16,140
When you eat an egg, right?

1020
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,920
Remember, when a chick hatches, the shell is

1021
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,560
left behind.

1022
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,100
You're not eating the shell.

1023
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,900
You're eating everything that makes that chick, right?

1024
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,640
So essentially, when you're eating an egg, whether

1025
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,980
you eat chicken or not, let's say you

1026
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,520
eat chicken.

1027
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,000
I had chicken for lunch or dinner or

1028
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,520
whatever, right?

1029
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,380
You had the muscle.

1030
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,380
You probably didn't eat gizzard or liver or

1031
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,420
the feet, whatever, right?

1032
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:40,540
Actually, fried gizzards and stuff are delicious, and

1033
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,880
the feet are delicious too.

1034
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,100
Most people can't handle it.

1035
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,800
It's very sweet, almost like white corn in

1036
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,160
sweetness.

1037
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,140
So you probably just ate the muscle tissue,

1038
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,360
dark or white meat, right?

1039
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,840
But when you eat an egg, remember, when

1040
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,280
the chick is born, it leaves the shell

1041
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:55,660
behind.

1042
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,880
So we're not talking about the shell, just

1043
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,420
the inside.

1044
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,020
It's the same thing as eating a chicken,

1045
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,480
all of the internals, the beak, all the

1046
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,720
feathers, the claws, the feet, everything.

1047
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:06,840
You get it?

1048
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:09,280
Because everything that, all the energy, all the

1049
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,800
substance that it took to form that chicken,

1050
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,080
the entire chicken, feathers and all, let's say

1051
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,200
when you say feathers and all, it means

1052
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,720
the whole chicken, is in that egg that

1053
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,140
you're eating.

1054
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,760
Remember, the shell is left behind either way,

1055
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,120
right?

1056
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,660
So it's pretty powerful.

1057
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,360
Now, typically, I think chickens, they just get

1058
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,440
fertilized once, right?

1059
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,300
And they make fertile eggs.

1060
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,120
They just get inseminated once by a rooster,

1061
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:38,640
and all the eggs continue being fertile, I

1062
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:38,980
believe.

1063
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,700
Or is it every year or two they

1064
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,380
have to do it?

1065
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,520
I'm not sure.

1066
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,260
Yeah, I think it's something like that.

1067
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,060
It's more than I'm getting.

1068
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:53,380
But anyway, so the idea here is this.

1069
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,580
This is one thing I didn't clarify with

1070
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,160
him, and I said, I'll talk about eggs.

1071
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:00,280
So you're eating the entire chicken, but you're

1072
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:04,340
only eating the entire chicken if the egg

1073
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,480
is a fertilized egg.

1074
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:09,000
Most eggs that you buy, even if you

1075
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,980
go to a farmer's market, if they were

1076
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,520
ever refrigerated and you took them home and

1077
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,240
put them under an incubator, they would never

1078
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,840
form and hatch because they're not fertile.

1079
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,580
Fertile eggs, right?

1080
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,100
You get it?

1081
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,640
So most of the eggs that we eat

1082
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,340
are not fertile eggs, for several reasons, obviously.

1083
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:29,060
So that will remain as this basic albumin,

1084
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:36,440
yolk-type protein, almost like stem cells, right?

1085
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,500
Stem cells, remember, you've heard of all the

1086
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,120
– what was it, 10, 15 years ago?

1087
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,200
Oh, stem cell therapy.

1088
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,780
Remember, it went away now, right?

1089
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:49,360
But in that vein of thought, it's like

1090
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,440
a pre-cell, so whatever you need, those

1091
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,100
stem cells actually latch on and grow and

1092
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,560
help the body develop what it needs, let's

1093
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:56,960
say, right?

1094
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,180
The idea is that further down, you have

1095
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,380
cells that are sort of blanks, that can

1096
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,860
become something else.

1097
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,480
They don't have a nucleus or mitochondria, let's

1098
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:06,680
say.

1099
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:09,000
So therefore, the egg is sort of like

1100
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,380
that because this doesn't necessarily have to become

1101
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,580
a chicken, but it could.

1102
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:15,980
Only if it's a non-fertile egg.

1103
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:19,860
A fertile egg has everything necessary energetically to

1104
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,560
form that chicken.

1105
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,680
When you eat a fertile egg, you're essentially

1106
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,340
eating the chicken feathers, beak, and all.

1107
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:28,060
So when it's a non-fertile egg, it's

1108
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:30,860
essentially the same kind of folklore that you

1109
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,700
have in a stem cell.

1110
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,040
Now, I'm not saying that eating non-fertile

1111
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,180
eggs, which is a typical egg that you

1112
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:39,860
buy, is like having stem cells.

1113
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,240
No, but I'm giving the comparison.

1114
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:42,820
It's not the same.

1115
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,860
And actually, under any testing, it would be

1116
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,660
very strenuous testing to see if it was

1117
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,640
a fertile egg or not.

1118
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,240
They have to actually do what everybody else

1119
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,600
does, wait and see, or get the history

1120
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,340
of the hen.

1121
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,960
So that's an interesting point.

1122
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,040
And I brought this up.

1123
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,260
It's interesting because the eggs came up again

1124
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,060
because I did a short talk with someone

1125
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,320
about this about a year ago.

1126
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,200
And I mentioned in the email, I'll speak

1127
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,080
about it on a sonic, and I want

1128
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:13,720
to because I thought about this, that having

1129
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,760
not so much the eggs, it's that the

1130
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,500
eggs are not fertile or fertilized, or the

1131
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,600
hen hasn't been fertilized.

1132
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,060
I'm not up to my chicken lingo, guys.

1133
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:25,420
Sorry, I'm not being precise enough.

1134
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,420
Maybe I should look up some zoology or

1135
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:32,260
the fauna of the fowl and see how

1136
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:32,740
they operate.

1137
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,240
Now, I wouldn't be surprised if different breeds

1138
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,260
or species of fowl had different characteristics as

1139
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:38,540
well.

1140
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:41,040
Well, they do make slightly different eggs, different

1141
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,060
types of chickens.

1142
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,460
They have different breeds and whatnot.

1143
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,540
Oh, there's a hundred varieties of chickens.

1144
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,940
You know, like what came first, the chicken

1145
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:48,400
or the egg?

1146
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,660
I used to tell people, the chicken farmer.

1147
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,120
The chicken farmer came first because the chicken,

1148
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,880
as you know it today, did not exist

1149
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,120
more than 300 years ago.

1150
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,580
As a matter of fact, if you go

1151
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,420
look at— No, I was just going to

1152
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:01,200
ask because another strange thing that happened with

1153
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,020
the eggs that I noticed changed over the

1154
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,780
past few years because I don't eat that

1155
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:07,280
many of them.

1156
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,940
But, you know, they used to—sometimes I would

1157
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,460
crack one open and there would be this

1158
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,960
little chunk in there.

1159
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:14,840
Yeah, a red dot.

1160
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,220
Well, sometimes a red dot, but sometimes it

1161
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,580
was a white thing that was just kind

1162
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,420
of there, and it almost seemed like, well,

1163
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,800
gee, that kind of egg has tried to

1164
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,580
form into a chicken.

1165
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,640
It's the end of the albumin.

1166
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,140
Yeah, well, typically—well, a chicken egg, by the

1167
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,800
way, a fertile one, is a good example

1168
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,280
to show how the blood is pumped without

1169
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,020
a heart because when the capillaries form around

1170
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,920
the yolk, you flash a light and you

1171
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,060
can look closely and the capillaries are pulsating.

1172
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:42,740
And there's just capillaries forming around the yolk.

1173
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:46,400
There's no evidence of any animal at all,

1174
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,800
and forget about even looking for a heart

1175
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,240
because there's just capillaries wrapping.

1176
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,300
Like the capillaries, it almost appears like the

1177
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,660
capillaries on the white of your eye around

1178
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,000
a yolk.

1179
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,740
That's all there is, and they're pulsing.

1180
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,800
This is an experiment, a very crude experiment,

1181
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,260
and they don't discuss this.

1182
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:05,800
That's why they literally used to pay people

1183
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,660
to hold the eggs.

1184
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,400
They used to literally pay people to hold

1185
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,860
the eggs up to light to be able

1186
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:10,480
to see that.

1187
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,160
If they saw that, the egg was rejected

1188
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,500
for consumption.

1189
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:19,380
Sure, there's many old egg tricks about spinning

1190
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:21,700
them on a table, all kinds of stuff.

1191
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,940
But I just want to say that the

1192
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:26,160
chicken that is popular today was not a

1193
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,360
popular bird to eat.

1194
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,820
Back in the day, more than 200 or

1195
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:32,100
300 years ago, there were other fowl that

1196
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:35,000
were more popular because it wasn't worth killing

1197
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,360
a chicken because it didn't have enough meat.

1198
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,820
They were used for eggs, but they were

1199
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:40,880
not good for meat.

1200
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,720
So what they did was they started breeding

1201
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,080
them for meat.

1202
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,480
Just like, for example, if you buy...

1203
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,560
Go look at some sketches.

1204
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,360
They're around 1,600, 1,500.

1205
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:53,600
They're surviving sketches where you look for the

1206
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,480
oldest sketch or drawing of a chicken, and

1207
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,460
you look at it, and you're like, wow,

1208
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,400
that's a really skinny bird.

1209
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:59,020
That chicken doesn't even look like a chicken.

1210
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:01,240
It's so skinny, it's unbelievable.

1211
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,460
You wouldn't recognize it as a chicken.

1212
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,880
It almost looks like a dove or even

1213
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:06,800
skinnier than a dove.

1214
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,400
That's why, for example, if you're in the

1215
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,740
market for goats, they ask you, do you

1216
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:13,300
want a meat goat or a milk goat?

1217
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:14,360
Different breed.

1218
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:16,220
I mean, they breed them for...

1219
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:19,640
One is bred for having a sizable udder

1220
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:22,460
for milk, and the other one is bred

1221
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:26,040
for a sizable mass of muscle, right, for

1222
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:26,300
meat.

1223
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,140
So this has been...

1224
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,440
We've been messing around with this stuff for

1225
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,740
hundreds of years now, and when we think

1226
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:36,100
we bring up animals, it's not really in

1227
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:36,260
the...

1228
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:37,480
It's only recent culture.

1229
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:40,760
But, yeah, so anyway, the moral of the

1230
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:44,840
egg story is rationalizing that if the egg

1231
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,240
is not fertile, it will be more of

1232
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:47,880
a distemper.
