1
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,100
Colds and naps and medical malpractice aside, here

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,020
we are, Rated Y, once again.

3
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,260
Greek, how are you?

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,080
Oh, much better on the laptop.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,360
I'm using an old wireless Logitech wireless headset,

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,620
chilling in front of the laptop.

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,580
Can't run away, it's too far, but yeah,

8
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,800
just telling you, it's funny, they do an

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,820
article once in a while that Hulk Hogan

10
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,580
might have died because of malpractice, they didn't

11
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,020
even use that term, but yeah, him and

12
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,100
like 4,000 other people in the USA

13
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:39,980
that day.

14
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,440
This is common, this is so common, and

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,480
Ozzy Osbourne and all these guys, so you

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,540
could live to 100 pretty simply here if

17
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:49,220
you're like them.

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,800
In other words, if you feel you belong

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,120
here, you're part of this system, I saw

20
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,500
someone where trust the science means trust the

21
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,180
system, right?

22
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,960
You could live pretty long, but the problem

23
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,640
is you won't be much better off than

24
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,519
you were in the 19th century, you will

25
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:05,200
be, because you want to avoid all the

26
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,600
stuff that everyone else is taking in, including

27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,140
the food they eat, very, very important.

28
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,720
Years ago, even in the film, it's shown

29
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,200
in art, you go to a weird town,

30
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,000
and people say, must be something in the

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,320
water, right, oh hell yeah.

32
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,880
You notice that's never making it anywhere, even

33
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,740
the alternative, alternative is a waste of time

34
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:31,580
too, they're not talking about what's in the

35
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,740
water, right, at all, anymore?

36
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,820
Well we have, I mean, over the years,

37
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,780
there's been a lot of people like myself

38
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,480
who've talked about the water and how people

39
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,180
don't understand it, and of course, but the

40
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,880
crap they're pumping into the water is a

41
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,240
problem, and the containers they're putting the water

42
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,220
in is a problem, I mean, it took

43
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,580
some of us a little longer to figure

44
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,120
that out, but I mean, it's just obvious,

45
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,160
and now there's so much plastic in everybody's

46
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,440
body, I don't know if that's, you know,

47
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,520
I don't know what your view is on

48
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,400
the plastic situation.

49
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,020
Plastic is not an issue, well, there's seven

50
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,260
types of plastic generally used in industry, and

51
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,880
we'll go through it really, really fast, so

52
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,320
fast I'll be done before I even say

53
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,580
what the plastics are, one of the plastics,

54
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,260
if not two of the plastics, have these

55
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,860
things called plasticizers, and one is a BPA,

56
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,500
the other one is a phthalate, I like

57
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,300
that word phthalate, it's spelled P-T-H

58
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,520
-A-L-A-T-E, and those two

59
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,820
plastics, yeah, yeah, those, one is PVC, the

60
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,240
other one is polycarbonate, so with the BPAs,

61
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,400
it's funny when you see like a polyethylene

62
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,260
and it says no BPA, I'm like, of

63
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:41,700
course, it's polyethylene, but those things are gender

64
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,520
-bender chemicals first, they dump them in the

65
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,000
river, you know, the factories that have the

66
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,920
BPAs and the phthalates, when they have a

67
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,880
runoff, the fish, all the fish are female,

68
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,180
regardless of how many male fish were there

69
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,540
a month ago, right, and then you have,

70
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,420
and then what it does is it does

71
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:03,900
accumulate more like toxify the liver and the

72
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,880
kidneys, and now 99% of what people

73
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,800
complain about being lack of fitness or health

74
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,140
is liver issues, and there's no discussion, but

75
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,140
by the way, I was driving here in

76
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,580
Tucson recently and it said center for liver,

77
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,740
medical center for the liver, I think it

78
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,340
was something like that, I was laughing, like

79
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,440
you're gonna go there and these morons know

80
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,100
anything about the liver, right, I wanna go

81
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,620
in there and ask these morons, if you

82
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,280
go into surgery and you have a procedure

83
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,440
where half of the liver is removed, how

84
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,700
long does it take for it to grow

85
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,940
back, and half of them say, oh my

86
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,500
gosh, oh, I don't know, I'm serious, right,

87
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,820
I think we went over this, I don't

88
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,580
know if anyone looked it up, there's maybe

89
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,040
some scant information, it'll grow back in like

90
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,520
two weeks, yeah, so I don't know, but

91
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,140
anyway, you're in really bad shape, people, humans,

92
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,440
you know, it's still a fact, not really

93
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,720
well reported, they shut down major funding, by

94
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,600
the way, in the 80s for Red Cross

95
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,120
medical research across the world, like doing profiles

96
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,620
of societies and all over the world, they

97
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,660
used to go to, you know, as many

98
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,560
countries as they could, spend time there and

99
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,800
document what, you know, quote, unquote, the health

100
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,899
of the people, and they shut that down,

101
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,980
you know why, because they found out the

102
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,920
more, quote, unquote, poor the country was, the

103
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,900
lower the infant mortality rate was, for example,

104
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,680
the lowest infant mortality rate on the western

105
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,540
hemisphere is Cuba, most likely today, they found

106
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,200
out that the people lived an average, you're

107
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,700
ready, 17 years more, not five or 10

108
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,840
or two, right, that's a lot, right, so

109
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,740
if you live to 100, 17 years is

110
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,940
17% more, if you live to 80,

111
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,500
it's 23% more, and so on and

112
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,480
so forth, so they lived 20 double digit

113
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:59,980
plus times longer, infant mortality was down, quote,

114
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,980
unquote, health issues, disease, cancer was non-existent,

115
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:07,620
right, non-existent, yeah, and yeah, this is

116
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,160
what's great, this isn't, in other words, go

117
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,940
to the pot, everyone knows, has heard of

118
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,100
someone that's got some ailment, I see them,

119
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,080
I'm in a neighborhood, I haven't moved from

120
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,100
this place in 25 years now, almost 24,

121
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,660
and I've seen people just a year or

122
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,340
two older than me walking with a cane

123
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,920
in this neighborhood, right, right, and they're being

124
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,540
killed slowly by the medics, you watch it,

125
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,180
you know, they go, how do I know

126
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,120
they're being killed by the medics, well, they

127
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,140
have a job, or a job, not a

128
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,940
yob, a job, I think I've explained the

129
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,420
difference between a job and a yob, right,

130
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,300
like, hey man, I got a yob, that's

131
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,780
different than, hey man, I got a job,

132
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,540
so anyway, when they have these jobs, they

133
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,540
have to get what's called a yearly or

134
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,520
biannual, what do you call it, medical exam,

135
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,400
a physical, they always call it, physical, yeah,

136
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,640
yeah, and guess what, they fall for the

137
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,280
high blood pressure, they fall for this, the

138
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,540
cancer screening, I've read cancer screening stuff, and

139
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,040
I said, go back to the doctor that

140
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,220
tells you you have cancer, and have him

141
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,020
sign an affidavit swearing that you have cancer,

142
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,360
he said, I wouldn't do it, he won't

143
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,480
do it, I called him, hey, they won't

144
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,440
do it, of course, none of them will

145
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,560
ever do it, because you don't have it,

146
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,940
do you know how rare cancer is, by

147
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,840
the way, it's extremely rare, well, it used

148
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,880
to be, you know, yeah, no, no, in

149
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,740
other words, people are dying from, they're dying,

150
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,840
in other words, right now, one out of

151
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,780
two people will die of cancer, just like

152
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,280
one out of two people who are married,

153
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,900
one out of two couples that are married

154
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,080
are going to divorce, that still holds, in

155
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,260
other words, half the people, more than half

156
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,120
the people are dying of so-called cancer,

157
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,400
right, so, but there's no such thing, really,

158
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,080
as they portray it, that, no, my gosh,

159
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,180
have I confused everyone right now, so, anyway,

160
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:51,520
yeah, probably, yeah, what is the thing, as

161
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,700
you thinketh so you are, and your beliefs

162
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,160
become your reality, right, oh, yeah, there's so

163
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,240
on and so forth, many different philosophical stripes

164
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,280
that basically say that, you know, you create

165
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,420
your own reality by your own perception, and

166
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:08,300
how you interpret things is exactly the way

167
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,700
they are, so, the Agregor thing, well, enough

168
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,080
people believe in something, yeah, that emerges as

169
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,460
real, or manifests, let's say, I've been doing

170
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,300
some, well, for a while now, engineering consulting,

171
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,440
various subjects, I mean, just stuff, just drop

172
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,360
that a thin air on me, and coming

173
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,060
up with solutions and stuff, and it's funny

174
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,860
when you hear these quote-unquote people are

175
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,820
supposed to be learned in the art of

176
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,800
engineering and all that, believe even the medical

177
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,460
stuff, one guy says he wants to take

178
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,480
this, these, when I say dealing with engineers,

179
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,200
these guys are raking it in, right, I

180
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,380
mean, like, four guys making 100 million a

181
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,880
year in engineering, I didn't know it could

182
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,860
be, like, a drug cartel or something like

183
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,960
that, you never hear, when you work as

184
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,120
an engineer in an office, you know, you

185
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,980
get a salary, right, and you get paid

186
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:58,220
well, I think it's 100k plus, 120k plus

187
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,780
out of college now, something like that, and

188
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,960
someone, you know, should get raking a quarter

189
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,940
of a million a year, but, like, 30

190
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,540
million a year, I don't know, these guys,

191
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,960
what the hell are they doing, but anyway,

192
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,060
it's good for me, though, because, you know,

193
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,600
when you're making 30 million, 40 million, 50

194
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,240
million a year, you know, handing someone six

195
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,500
figures is like a candy bar, right, so,

196
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,540
$50,000 is not a big deal, $100

197
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,680
,000 is not a big deal, yeah, yeah,

198
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,860
because you're doing all, you're doing 2 million

199
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:30,860
a month, right, so, personally, and, yeah, it's

200
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,820
quite interesting to see that, and the ignorance

201
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,580
abound, but I'd rather be speaking to engineers,

202
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:37,140
though, because, you know, they have the training,

203
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,080
you know, you can actually get into, when

204
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,799
you explain something, you can actually say, well,

205
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,280
this thing moves left and right, and goes

206
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,640
up and down, and it's made of this,

207
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,260
and they're not like, huh, right, they kind

208
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,760
of get it, right, so, yeah, interesting, anyway,

209
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,860
I just want to bring that stuff up,

210
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,580
because I don't know how much to overstate

211
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,200
humbly, the relevancy of what we discuss here

212
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:01,240
is so effing relevant, right, that it should

213
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,200
make, I mean, I don't know how many

214
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,240
of our subs have ever heard more than

215
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,080
10 Sonics pour gasoline on their heads, set

216
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,240
it on fire, and ran down the street

217
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,780
naked, how many have done that, I don't

218
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,780
know, because this is how, this is the

219
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,020
urgency of what I'm saying, right, yeah, I

220
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,120
look, I understand that, you know, and, in

221
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,800
fact, somebody asked a very long, convoluted question,

222
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,220
I'm going to break down for you fast,

223
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,980
that, you know, like, why don't you just

224
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:29,420
simply create an entire new exchange out of

225
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,740
the credit system, you could literally create the

226
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,300
credit, you know, utilizing the credit system, create

227
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,320
something that does have tangible value, and then

228
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,360
literally create a collective that would be, in

229
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,340
and of itself, a profitable venture, like a

230
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,180
new bank, almost, but I hate to use

231
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,320
the dirty word bank, he says, yeah, go

232
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,540
ahead, no, that's fine, no, you could, but

233
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,380
you can't have it defined as such, the

234
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,980
moment it's defined as such, then you get

235
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,540
a knock on the door, this goes against

236
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:00,020
the United States, and then you're at war

237
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,600
with the United States, basically, when they tell

238
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,000
you this goes against the policies of the

239
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,340
United States, it's an indirect way of saying

240
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:10,200
that we're declaring war on you, right, so

241
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,040
that's why, when they go to other countries

242
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,040
to wage war, they're, why are they going,

243
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,700
what do they say, to defend the interests

244
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,940
of the United States, right, you've heard that,

245
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,040
right, literally, an interest is exactly what they

246
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,380
collect when they make loans, so, you know,

247
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,800
yeah, well, they don't really make loans, they

248
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,600
use your credit, and in order to get

249
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,940
into that agreement, you make them the trustees,

250
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,320
right, is the main way, and then the

251
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,560
other way is that you give them also

252
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,920
security interest, if you didn't know, if you

253
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,640
didn't recognize that you were making them a

254
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,420
trustee, because a trustee, for example, when you

255
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,180
have a trust, a trustee could sell everything

256
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,980
you got, and legally, that's why, here, I'll

257
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,780
give a little legal secret out, when I

258
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,180
set up trusts, I've been doing this for

259
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,820
20 years, not setting up trusts, but consulting

260
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,980
on them, it's like, oh, man, I'm setting

261
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,960
up a trust, you know, my sister's brother,

262
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,480
my wife's, my brother-in-law is going

263
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,720
to be trustee, I say, oh, brother-in

264
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,800
-law, oh, I've seen that go sour sometimes,

265
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,960
you know, I don't care if you're married

266
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,760
for 30 years, that could go south, right,

267
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,320
and I say, listen, this is what I'd

268
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,980
like for you to do, whenever you set

269
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,760
up a trust, I want everyone who's going

270
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,080
to sign on as a trustee, sign something

271
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,220
else first, and that something else is a

272
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:20,100
resignation letter, have them sign the resignation letters

273
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,080
first, before they sign on as trustee, get

274
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,240
it, wink, wink, so if they turn out,

275
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,080
whatever, you just go record the resignation letter,

276
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,380
and they're out of there, now, some, now,

277
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,740
here, if you really want to know what's

278
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,220
going on, if you ask them to sign,

279
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,700
what's this, it's a resignation letter prior to

280
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,540
signing trustee, it's like, screw that, I'm not

281
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,760
doing that, well, they kind of exposed their

282
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,940
motive, didn't they, right, so, yeah, so, by

283
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,680
the way, it's $1,500 an hour attorneys

284
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,340
that don't know what I just said, and

285
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,640
I have spoken to some of them, mentioned

286
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,940
that, and they're like, that's a great idea,

287
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,800
and I, wait a second, you're charging $1

288
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,400
,500 an hour, and I'm giving you great

289
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,860
ideas, yeah, well, this is kind of backwards,

290
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,820
this is kind of backwards, isn't it, yeah,

291
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,900
oh, well, you know, how about this one,

292
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,460
a retired New York attorney wants to write

293
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,160
a book on how corrupt the Bar Association

294
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,740
is, but he can't, because he doesn't know

295
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,900
any law, that's almost verbatim, I'm kind of

296
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,460
paraphrasing what he told me, yeah, by the

297
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,020
way, the reason I knock, quote, unquote, doctors,

298
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,840
or medical technicians, that's what they are, and

299
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,920
attorneys, is because I know so many of

300
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,080
them, right, people that knock these other things

301
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,700
hardly have any first-hand experience, I'm like,

302
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,460
oh, my gosh, right, and priests, right, rabbis,

303
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,240
whatever, they do nothing, they're fun, I love

304
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,980
those guys, though, they create all kinds of

305
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,500
weird stories, and then they create their own

306
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,260
little offshoot of the story, it's just, you

307
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,140
know, rabbis, you mean rabbis, yeah, they're the

308
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,280
funniest, they're hilarious, they could be the, you

309
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,940
know, they'll sit there telling me about their

310
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:49,080
last steak dinner, you know, instead of, you

311
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,660
know, telling me about something in the book,

312
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,360
you know what I mean, it's hilarious, it's

313
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,740
very much like, I don't know if anyone,

314
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,760
if you guys are familiar with Guy Ritchie

315
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,040
films, Snatch, S-N-A-T-C-H,

316
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,880
you know, go watch it, the beginning, when

317
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,380
they go in to get the diamond, and

318
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:08,580
they're dressed up like Hasidim, right, and what

319
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:12,020
they're discussing, right, give me the stone, where

320
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:16,540
is the stone, yeah, anyway, so, all right,

321
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,380
let's go, question.

322
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,700
Yeah, that is a key, so somebody wanted

323
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,280
to know if you were involved in the

324
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,440
recent dust storm in Arizona, or if you

325
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,220
were affected by it, one or the other,

326
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,580
because it did make some headlines, and it

327
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,540
seemed to be a strange weather event.

328
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,280
We've been getting a change in the jet

329
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,720
stream here, and I finally said, listen, I've

330
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,880
got to do something about it, for the

331
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,920
past couple of days, I altered the jet

332
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,600
stream, the jet stream here should be coming

333
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,780
up through Mexico, like the west coast of

334
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,560
Mexico to us, bringing what's called the rainy

335
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,060
season, and what's been happening is, we've been

336
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,200
getting a jet stream coming down from Seattle,

337
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:00,120
swirling in the midwest, clockwise, across central Texas,

338
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,720
and we've been getting what's going across central,

339
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,080
you don't want anything from central Texas, especially

340
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,220
the jet stream, very hot and dry, I

341
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,700
said, this is really screwed up, I did

342
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,680
about 20 hours of ops, and I got

343
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,600
rain to come here from the south, and

344
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,080
it's a lot of work, it's very sensitive,

345
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,300
right, it's like, I don't know, it's kind

346
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,100
of like between dialing a watch and scratching

347
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:27,160
your butt, but anyway, so, yeah, so anyway,

348
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,460
I'm just joking, people, I have to laugh,

349
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,700
because I don't know if they'd say this

350
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,340
everywhere, but on the east coast, it's definitely,

351
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,920
I don't know whether to scratch my watch

352
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,400
or wind my ass, you know, when you're

353
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,180
confused, yeah, that's why I said it up

354
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,800
that way, yeah, you got it, so anyway,

355
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,720
so anyway, that's it, and we had some

356
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,600
rain today, a slow drizzle, those are called

357
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,660
Haboobs, or Habeebs, or something like that, sounds

358
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,160
a lot like friend in Arabic, and it

359
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,220
went around us, it forks, there was one

360
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,000
coming, you could see it, it's really ominous,

361
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,020
it's like that movie Scorpion King or whatever,

362
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,460
it's a wall, a tan wall that goes

363
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:07,240
up to about the low height of airplanes

364
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,180
before they land, really tall, 700, 800 feet,

365
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,420
1000 feet, and it moves towards you very

366
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,820
slowly, completely engulfs all the traffic lights, come

367
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,500
on, you have a visibility of anywhere between

368
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,880
10 and 50 feet, and they always go

369
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,560
around us when I know they're coming, obviously,

370
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,020
because I've mentioned, when you set up these

371
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,860
devices, you create a force field or a

372
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,540
bubble, it's amazing how when there's lightning, you

373
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,500
know, get inside, like that's going to help,

374
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,320
right, so you don't get hit by lightning,

375
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,580
right, and the first thing I do is

376
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,560
start activating devices, it forms a force field

377
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,960
around you, right, so no, I saw that,

378
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,980
I had nothing to do with it directly,

379
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,920
I didn't, you know, but it went around

380
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,560
us, because we usually get it, and if

381
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,900
you study the jet stream, it was going

382
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,480
from west to east, which it shouldn't be,

383
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,060
it should be going south to north, but

384
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,700
thanks for asking, yeah, and it went over

385
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,740
phoenix, I think, so, you know, yeah, it

386
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,020
shut down, they lost power, a couple of

387
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,940
the counties there lost power, right, so here's

388
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,280
one about pets, by the way, I always

389
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,000
like these questions, why do some humans experience

390
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,560
a loss of vacuum from cats, has anyone

391
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,280
found ways to bypass this experience, short of

392
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,380
maintaining the cats and humans general hygiene, how

393
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:21,120
should we go about remediation, now, really quickly

394
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,800
on this, I lived with a friend temporarily,

395
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,000
when I was getting a divorce, and I

396
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,120
had nowhere to go, and he had a

397
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,580
cat, and I was like, dude, I can't

398
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,720
stay with you, because cats just blow me

399
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,200
up, you know, and he's like, well, look,

400
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,560
cat scratch fever, if they scratch you, you

401
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,620
get a rash, like that also, yeah, plus

402
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,460
I just get the runny eyes, runny nose,

403
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,320
I mean, just my whole vacuum goes out

404
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,380
of whack, that's because the cat has a

405
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,280
case of cat psoriasis, it's, you don't see

406
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,940
it, it's very small, very fine, and energetic,

407
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,000
it's because of the quality of life of

408
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,280
the cat, most of the time, in other

409
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,040
words, I found out that most people that

410
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,400
have adverse reactions to being around felines, if

411
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,120
they're around a barn cat, in a barn,

412
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,920
with the doors closed, it's not so bad,

413
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,880
but when they're in an indoor, near an

414
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,060
indoor cat, meaning it doesn't get to go

415
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,180
outside, apartment house, what have you, they have

416
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:13,480
that issue, yeah, well, typically, yeah, my friend

417
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,619
was one of the most incredibly clean people

418
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:17,440
ever, and so he kept it at a

419
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,020
minimum, but I couldn't escape it, and I

420
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,200
happen to know there's a lot of people

421
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,119
that like, I know you say it's a

422
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,540
matter of psoriasis, but it seems like everybody's,

423
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,420
everybody's indoor cat is a problem, everybody's, you

424
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,380
know, really, yeah, for some people, yeah, now

425
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,680
here's the other thing, I'll take this, we

426
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,060
all take interest in things that affect us

427
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,360
personally, if something doesn't affect us personally, we

428
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,580
very rarely take interest in it, unless it's

429
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,920
an occupational thing or whatever, and you have

430
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,820
to know, so I've never had an adverse

431
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,640
reaction to cats, I've remotely, and not been

432
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,320
around people, had an adverse reaction to cats,

433
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,060
but I've heard people say that I have

434
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,860
adverse reactions to cats when the topic came

435
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,920
up, and those people are actually hypersensitive, or

436
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,600
very, you have, you know, you have sensitive,

437
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,020
very sensitive, then hypersensitive, right, but I would

438
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,620
say they were sensitive to, very sensitive in

439
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,660
hyper, all three, I don't know, I think

440
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,680
that there's been a lot of stuff about

441
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,740
cats have special, you know, bacteria, quote-unquote

442
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,500
things that in their gut that go into

443
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,100
your gut, if you just touch them, you

444
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,160
know, like 30 seconds handling a cat, you

445
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,760
get it, right, Richard Allen Miller is big

446
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,360
on that, and starts taking over your brain,

447
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,080
some shit like, I just, am I on

448
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,220
point with that, or am I off?

449
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,420
Richard Allen Miller says a lot of things,

450
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,000
you got to decode, so, you know, who

451
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,320
knows, but people have talked about that, what

452
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,640
is it, tox, toxus plasmosis, whatever the hell

453
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,460
it is, I forget how you say it

454
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,900
exactly, but you know what I'm talking about,

455
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,960
where they say this thing gets in your

456
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,780
brain from the cat poop, and maybe it

457
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,200
does, I don't know, but you know what

458
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,960
is funny to me, is that when I

459
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,060
was young, the first pet I had was

460
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,980
a cat, and my cat used to go

461
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,800
outside, inside, he was outside a lot of

462
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,680
the time, and he didn't make me sick,

463
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,900
but only these indoor cats, yeah, that's what

464
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,300
I mentioned, yeah, it's, yeah, that's right, there's

465
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,360
a certain stress, certain element that they change

466
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,620
the environment, now to me, if you really,

467
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,160
you know, everybody cover your ears, I think

468
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,200
cats are visiting here to monitor us, if

469
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,340
you guys know about John C.

470
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,000
Lilly, did a lot of research with dolphin

471
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,220
brains, and psychedelics, and all that, right, he

472
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:25,480
talks about echo, ECCO, ECCO, which is Earth

473
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,260
Coincidence Control Office, it's like one of God's

474
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:31,200
field offices, if you want to understand more

475
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,340
of what he meant by that, it's the

476
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,700
Adjustment Bureau film, he says that's real, well,

477
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,420
he died before the film came out, more

478
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,460
than 15 years, or 10 years before, 15

479
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,740
years before the film came out, that's based

480
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,980
on John C.

481
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,240
Lilly, there's an Adjustment Bureau, and they control

482
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,600
large, long events in people's lives, in society,

483
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,400
and you're sort of controlling the small events,

484
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,180
and they do make adjustments in the small

485
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,860
events, so the big events happen, and when

486
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:01,640
he was tripping enough in isolation, they approached

487
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,900
him and said, listen, we appreciate what you're

488
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,160
doing, but don't do it anymore, we want

489
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,380
you to go back and learn what it's

490
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,040
like to be a human, you know, like

491
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,440
be a screw-up, right, so, but they

492
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,960
did tell him that if you figure out

493
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,700
how we do things, you'll never have to

494
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,240
come back here again, you're done here, so

495
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,840
I thought that was interesting, and I think

496
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,400
cats play a role somewhere in that, well,

497
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,560
they would be excellent monitoring devices, because, I

498
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,020
mean, they seem to be everywhere and nowhere

499
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,740
at the same time, yeah, yeah, yeah, there

500
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,360
are other people said, if you don't put

501
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,500
a probe, or a, what do you call

502
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,880
it, a chip, though, one of those sensors

503
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,160
in people, put it in their pets, right,

504
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:42,780
right, so, yeah, because their pet's not going

505
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,620
to be able to communicate that it has

506
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,220
something like that, so, yeah, and cats, by

507
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,920
the way, it's very well known, they're not

508
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,420
evolved from, someone was talking about evolution today,

509
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,080
I had to interrupt very simply, of course,

510
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:57,160
but cats did not evolve, domestic cats, small

511
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,460
cats, from large cats, at all, they're very

512
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,780
different, just like dogs did not evolve from

513
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,300
wolves, just look at a wolf paw and

514
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,480
a dog paw, and they're internal, they have

515
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:10,240
different aspects to their biology, they're independent, what

516
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,300
happens is species don't evolve, species are injected,

517
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,520
they're introduced, right, yeah, so, when you have

518
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,740
like a small looking canine, large canine, medium

519
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,640
canine, oh, they didn't evolve, you know, in

520
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,060
any way, they were, it was time to

521
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,580
bring in this size and this type, and

522
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,300
they just put it in, you put it

523
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,180
into our reality, you know, there's no evolution

524
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,120
at all, as a matter of fact, the

525
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,160
food industry is wholly and solely dependent on

526
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,720
the lack of evolution, like long-term canning

527
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,840
stuff, right, you're gonna, this is a Chuck

528
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,520
Missler thing, if you can peanut butter for

529
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,020
a fallout shelter, it's supposed to last for

530
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,000
25 years, yeah, yeah, I was shocked when

531
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,560
I found out some things were designed to

532
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,620
last 25 years, you know, food stuffs, right,

533
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,960
wet, yeah, it's, they're relying on there's no

534
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,040
evolution, right, right, you get it, so no

535
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,000
change, yeah, what else you got?

536
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,740
Okay, so, on the topic of acoustic counter

537
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,440
space, I'm thinking the most important factors in

538
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,960
the material used for the barrier, in quotes,

539
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,460
the size of the hole and the amount

540
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,120
of space between the barrier and the back

541
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,880
of the speaker, could the Greek elaborate on

542
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,500
these factors?

543
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,900
Oh, wow, who, I wonder who wrote that,

544
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,820
email me, email me, sounds like you got

545
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,620
at least one or two sharpened pencils in

546
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,140
your pocket, you know how to listen and

547
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,780
communicate, thank you very much.

548
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,160
This is a long-time listener, I know

549
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,380
the handle they're using, this is a long

550
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,380
-time sonic observer, let's call it.

551
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,600
Well, either way, either way, what you wouldn't

552
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,860
believe, I've had long, long, long, long time

553
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,100
listeners that couldn't structure a sentence like that,

554
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,440
but anyway, no, that's great, there you go,

555
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,880
the false back, imagine a false back, it

556
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,300
doesn't have to be a false back, per

557
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,460
se, in the enclosure and when you successfully

558
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,100
do this, you don't need all that volume,

559
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:05,120
there's something called Thiel's small parameters, T-H

560
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,740
-I-E-L and small, now you ready?

561
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,960
Now, I forgot Thiel's first name, but small,

562
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,540
his name, there are two Australian guys that

563
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,220
came up with speaker parameters, like how much

564
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,140
volume need behind a certain driver when it,

565
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,560
when you measure its parameters, you know how

566
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,360
flexible it is, dimensions and all that, electrical,

567
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,120
mechanical, anyway, I just want to play on

568
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,800
this, because it's funny when you find that

569
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,460
most people have been in audio and know,

570
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,220
use Thiel's small parameters, but they don't know

571
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,100
about small, small's first name is Richard, now

572
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,920
what's the, what's the nickname for Richard?

573
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:40,020
I'll leave it at that, so yeah, you

574
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,040
got it, all right, so yeah, the Thiel's

575
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,000
small parameters fall apart, that's why someone kind

576
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,220
of gave me an elbow and says, no,

577
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,820
they're never, industry's never going to use this,

578
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,420
because it destroys Thiel's small parameters, and his

579
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:54,900
entire business is based on Thiel's small, right,

580
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,940
it's kind of like what the acoustic counter

581
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,900
space is like, oh yeah, cars can run

582
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,540
on water, right, or guess what, the periodic

583
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,880
table doesn't apply anymore, they're going to let

584
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,040
you get away with that, no, never, right,

585
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,060
their entire system is based on that, so

586
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,500
it's based on Thiel's small parameters, they fall

587
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,060
apart, so the question, I guess, was materials,

588
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,900
the barrier, the barrier is the same, you're

589
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:20,360
using the actual structure, the baffles, let's call

590
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,500
it, they're all, they should be made, or

591
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,440
can and should be made of the same

592
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,540
material the loudspeaker enclosure is, so if you're

593
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,940
working with an enclosure that's half-inch particle

594
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,460
board, make it out of half-inch particle

595
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:35,020
board, right, I tend to, okay, also these

596
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,780
things could go behind drivers, there's a patent

597
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:42,660
on, someone did a patent on something similar,

598
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,860
and it was called embedded transmission line, and

599
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,520
I got in communication with them, and I

600
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,180
gave them all these drawings, and how they

601
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,520
can improve their patent, and when they got

602
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,420
the continuance, they put my drawings in the

603
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,180
patent, oh, did I ever show you that,

604
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,880
all my drawings are in somebody else's patent,

605
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,780
you never showed me that, you got permission,

606
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,320
okay, yeah, so when I show these drawings,

607
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,640
I said go to this patent number, and

608
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,480
you'll see all my stuff there under a

609
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:08,400
different thing, right, I give them permission, because

610
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,640
you know me, I like to give pretty

611
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,980
much whatever I can away to help people,

612
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,840
I wouldn't do it anymore, but not because

613
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,680
of that, I think, I think it's just,

614
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,160
what is it called, Bob Pearls, right, so

615
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,700
yeah, the answer, I guess the answer I'm

616
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,760
getting here, just make, just use whatever materials

617
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,180
you have, now the gap inside the counter

618
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:31,000
space changes depending on the driver's side, if

619
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,400
you're doing it for behind a tweeter, a

620
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,620
very tiny speaker, it's much proportionally smaller, for

621
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,160
a large woofer, I would make the gap

622
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,580
quarter inch of air space, quarter inch of

623
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:45,400
absorbent material, all right, and I'm still developing

624
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,140
this, and it's unbelievable, especially when you do

625
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:50,440
an isobaric setup, I have a speaker that

626
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:55,820
is 9x7x10 dimensions, small, you can put both

627
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,220
of them under one arm, and when you

628
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,840
play these with a, they're not very efficient,

629
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,400
because I just use drivers, I find, if

630
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,840
I use really good drivers, they'll be more

631
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,840
efficient, but I'm more sensitive drivers, but you

632
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,780
crank these things up, and you think there's

633
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:11,760
like big old JBL towers, or those big

634
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,080
-ass Sergo and Vegas, or huge rock and

635
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,320
roll speakers, that are as tall as your

636
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,960
brother was, whatever, when you're growing up, oh

637
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,580
yeah, Ben's, yeah, that's what you think is

638
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:21,300
in there, huge speakers, and the base extension

639
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,480
goes down to 20 cycles, like really 20

640
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,740
cycles minus 60b, but pretty flat down to

641
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,140
28, a little tiny four and a half

642
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,620
inch woofer, it's like, how is that possible,

643
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,860
every time I listen to it, I'm like,

644
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,040
no, we don't live in a real world,

645
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,400
no, not at all, you know, this is

646
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,180
not real, this is not really happening, yes

647
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,920
it is, yeah, so, have you ever tried

648
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,080
to apply that, yeah, have you ever tried

649
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,680
to apply that kind of stuff to instrument

650
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,320
cabinets, because part of what you're describing vaguely

651
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,000
sounds to me like what they did with

652
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,640
Laney for a little bit, when they were

653
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,880
actually concentrating on their construction, once they went

654
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,860
into like mass production, it was over, but,

655
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,440
well, when they do that to an instrument,

656
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,420
it will change the resonance, see that resonance

657
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,320
you have in a guitar, whether it's acoustic

658
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,020
or not, right, or any instrument is the

659
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:06,400
characteristic of it, and by the way, you

660
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,780
know that bullshit about the Stradivarius, where it's

661
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,160
three million, because no one knows how to

662
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,680
duplicate the sound, it's total bullshit, I know

663
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,220
how to duplicate, I can build you a

664
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:19,320
Stradivarius that will sound exactly like the original,

665
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,640
except for if you, actually I could, I

666
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,840
could, that sounds, I'm saying this humbly, and

667
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,220
it's based on this theory, I'll give this

668
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:30,860
information out, it's very well established, I'll give

669
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:35,000
the information, it's a German guy, again from

670
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,140
Snats, you know, where'd you get that for,

671
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,180
who's going to get you, protect yourself from

672
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:44,340
who, it's the Germans, right, it's here, I'll

673
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:48,760
give you this guy, it's a C37, C37

674
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:52,260
acoustics, here, I'll click on it, look it

675
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:58,000
up, it's, the website is enemoza.com, it's

676
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,120
C37 theory English, this is in English, by

677
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:06,180
Dieter Enemoza, not a good German accent, E

678
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:10,240
-N-N-E-M-O-S-E-R,

679
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:14,620
it's called C37 theory English, what that means,

680
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,880
C37 is the 98.6 blood temperature, and

681
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,740
basically what gives that Stradivarius that sound is

682
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:24,320
the, and tonality is the coating, the lacquer

683
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,520
that they used, it's not the wood, it's

684
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,860
the coating, so I'm very big into natural,

685
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,300
if you're going to have a hi-fi,

686
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,580
a hi-fi, you know, for, you know,

687
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,680
music is wonderful, but it gets more wonderful

688
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,060
when you have a nice high, a really

689
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,700
good hi-fi to play it on, right,

690
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,980
and everything blooms, the sound just blooms, and

691
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:42,380
everything just sends, usually if you have a

692
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,060
good hi-fi, it's better than what they

693
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,340
had in the recording studio, and then you

694
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,040
get into the problem of, I can't get

695
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,040
recordings that sound good, right, so you can

696
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:53,000
have a very revealing system, because, yeah, so,

697
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:57,820
yeah, so check them out, C37, he's got

698
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:02,160
some pretty good articles, all very German, so,

699
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,440
yeah, that's, so I apply a lot of

700
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,040
that, for example, when I do coatings and

701
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,400
things, I use natural shellac, which come from

702
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,720
the lac bug, yeah, it's actually a bug,

703
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,800
right, they make a resin out of, and

704
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,500
alcohol, I use lacquers, I got away from

705
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,020
acrylics and all that, you can hear the

706
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:25,700
difference, yeah, you want to use natural sustained

707
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,900
materials, in other words, they're not modified with

708
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:31,980
too much plastic, yeah, so anyway, about the

709
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,580
counter space, let's do a get-together on

710
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,900
that in the next couple of weeks, I'll

711
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,000
announce it here, just to discuss it, the

712
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,180
sooner we discuss it, I'll do, like I

713
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,760
did the weather and other stuff, I'll pop

714
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,760
diagrams, drawings, photos, maybe a video, I have

715
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,600
sent people videos of what the little speakers

716
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,160
sound like, I know, whatever you have, but

717
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,560
if you play it with headphones, you'll be

718
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,660
like, oh my gosh, that's a lot of

719
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,500
sound, right, and it's coming out of this

720
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,700
little tiny thing, I wouldn't say they're tiny,

721
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:02,580
they're small, so, you know, probably smaller than

722
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,820
the sound, right, okay, so the Greeks, oh

723
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:08,640
my gosh, yeah, the Greeks said in one

724
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,100
podcast, that what they're selling as AI is

725
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,080
not really AI, now that I, no, understand

726
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,340
some technical stuff, and having worked with it

727
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,840
a bit, I get it, it doesn't have

728
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,240
its own memory, and it can't retain any

729
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,600
information, it just gives the output, and then

730
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,980
drops the whole thing, so there is no

731
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:30,900
AI, just a more advanced algorithm, so somebody

732
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,420
was testing what you had to say there,

733
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,180
and I wanted to let you know, and

734
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:37,240
networking, and it came about, I don't remember

735
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,760
in the heydays of the internet, there was

736
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,420
a lot of talk about that, that's when

737
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,860
Snowden, that was the heydays of the internet,

738
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,240
when Snowden was in the news, that was

739
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,220
the end of the heyday, right, yeah, the

740
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:49,040
end, remember all that stuff, that they're spying

741
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,800
on us, and whatever, I actually looked up

742
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,100
what the, what was disclosed, the, versus what

743
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,120
everybody was talking about, what was disclosed is,

744
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,080
now they finally have enough computational power and

745
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,740
memory to make a transcript of everything, right,

746
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:04,580
what they're doing is, every phone conversation, no

747
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:07,760
one's listening to anything, I shouldn't say that,

748
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:12,360
but what's really happening is, transcripts are being

749
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,520
made of everything, transcripts of all your transactions,

750
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,620
your movements, your, in other words, your map,

751
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,020
you know, have you ever seen the maps

752
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:19,500
in Wile E.

753
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,900
Coyote, but anyway, all your conversations, your emails,

754
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,820
transcripts are being made in a file, like

755
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,640
just like years ago, that was it, what

756
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,700
do you say, 99% of US citizens

757
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,380
have an FBI file, right, was it something

758
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,940
like 87%, 97%, I don't know, whatever, you

759
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:36,940
get it, yeah, there was, so it's a

760
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:41,200
very high number, proportion, right, some people, like,

761
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,640
they don't know how to label you, but,

762
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,360
but now it's 100%, yeah, now it's 100%,

763
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,640
because the fact is that the, the goal

764
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,960
of the NSA, which was stated, was to

765
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,360
capture every conversation they could, so they did

766
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,740
that, by transcript, yeah, no one's, yeah, and

767
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,180
that was the thing, though, but back then,

768
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,640
people said, oh, that's radio, that's telephone, that's,

769
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,060
yeah, but that has now gone further into

770
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,900
the rest of it, so that's everything now,

771
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:08,700
yeah, that's all it is, they bottlenecked, they

772
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:13,180
bottlenecked everybody into using a device that, that,

773
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,240
look, recently, I hate the voicemail thing, recently,

774
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,080
the voicemail shows up as a text message

775
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,020
now, yeah, right, and voicemail, you can hear,

776
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,260
why, because they're trying to tell you, hey,

777
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,060
look, this is what we're doing, look, pay

778
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:30,880
attention, I'm fine with it, because, whatever, not,

779
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,680
well, I'm not fine with it, because it's

780
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,820
not going to be used right, but if

781
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,660
you know your rights, you can make sure

782
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,060
that it's being used right, because you signed

783
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:40,580
them, your permissions to do that indirectly, it's

784
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:43,700
always indirect, but what I just want to

785
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,120
bring up, we brought up the, I dropped

786
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,220
an article, by the way, speaking of reading,

787
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,120
in the Ocelli, it's called, I think, ocellianthegreekchitango

788
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,880
.com, it's an NIH document on the history

789
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,260
of glucose measurement, blood glucose measurement, and that's

790
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:02,460
how you catch these assholes in telling you

791
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,900
the truth, well, Greek, why would you call

792
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,300
them assholes, telling you the truth, always look

793
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,540
up the, how many times you heard me

794
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,060
say, if you, in order to understand a

795
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,480
thing, you have to know the history of

796
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,920
that thing, right, yeah, I mentioned once, there

797
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,000
were some young twins always watching TV, and

798
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,300
they thought, I asked them how long the

799
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,640
TV's been around, they thought it was around

800
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,500
since the dinosaurs, right, they didn't know the

801
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:24,540
history, it's a recent development, so, but I

802
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,800
put that article up, and whoever can read

803
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,440
it with comprehension, you go ahead and read

804
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,520
that and tell me that there is such

805
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,800
a thing as blood glucose measurement, there isn't,

806
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,820
it's an attempt, so, yeah, and this goes

807
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,120
on and on and on and on with,

808
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,620
when you read what's going on, and you've

809
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,960
got to know your rights, by the way,

810
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,820
just like I've said many, many times, there's,

811
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,800
I assure you, no one in prison right

812
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,920
now, today, is there lawfully or legally, no

813
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,220
one, because if you know what lawful and

814
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,460
legal is, you wouldn't be in prison, oh,

815
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,000
by the way, I did find that Judge

816
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,160
Bork interview on PBS, the confirmation, with senator

817
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,200
questions and all that stuff, and they spoke,

818
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,580
the part when they asked him, what are

819
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,720
you going to do about the growing prison

820
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,080
population, he said, I'm not going to do

821
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,600
anything, because everyone in prison has volunteered to

822
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,900
be there, they dubbed the hosts of PBS

823
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,300
speaking over that, so you can't get it,

824
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:15,780
you can see his mouth moving, but you

825
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,280
don't hear it, so, shucks, wonder why they

826
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,540
did that, wonder why, I'm sure that was

827
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,800
just an editorial decision, you know, for the

828
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,440
sake of appearances, you know, right, oh my

829
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:30,120
gosh, yeah, aesthetics only, yeah, aesthetics, right, that's

830
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,840
what I was looking for, aesthetics, correct word,

831
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:36,840
thank you, hey, here's another interesting question, a

832
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,239
question to the Greek about living lawfully and

833
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:44,739
separately yourself, uh, discernment, okay, bank account, uh,

834
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,940
that would be unlawful, does the Greek have

835
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,860
a bank account, now, I know you've answered

836
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:52,300
this, it wouldn't be unlawful, it wouldn't be

837
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,320
unlawful, no, but go ahead, well, I knew

838
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,840
you answered the does the Greek have a

839
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:01,580
bank account question before, no, right, uh, but,

840
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,100
so, it's not unlawful for you to have

841
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:08,300
a bank account, no, it's not, it's just

842
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,180
like it's not unlawful to go and sell

843
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:13,860
heroin in your neighborhood, well, no, it's illegal,

844
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,700
it's illegal, but that's only because you can't

845
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,660
pay the taxes on it, um, there's no

846
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,900
law that, yeah, there's no law, well, you

847
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,360
shouldn't have to pay taxes if you were

848
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,500
born in the USA, anyway, on anything, and

849
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,840
that can be proven out, your passport makes

850
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,320
you tax exempt, by the way, if you're

851
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,880
a national, but, um, if you have a

852
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,580
passport, you know, they bring something up, and

853
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,800
you give them the passport, you say you're

854
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,460
tax exempt, they give them the number and

855
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,600
name of organizations, the name on there, and

856
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,780
it takes off the taxes every time, so,

857
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,520
but here's the deal, there's no, um, unlawfulness

858
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:51,520
on growing, selling, or processing anything that grows

859
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,360
on an animal or a plant to anyone,

860
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,020
well, nothing unlawful on that at all, ever,

861
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,840
but is it illegal, in a lot, many

862
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,540
cases, in a lot of places, with certain

863
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:06,740
things, yeah, so, yeah, the reason I don't

864
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:09,060
do it is because I don't, it's like,

865
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,900
okay, let's do our banking, let's go find

866
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:14,600
the Zeta cartel, it's a cartel, all right,

867
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:18,180
and I can't sleep at night knowing that,

868
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,880
uh, what I signed on to as terms

869
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,800
and service, terms and conditions, and they don't

870
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,580
want to change it the way I want

871
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:30,420
it done, no, they don't, what I want

872
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,260
them to do is, I want to hold

873
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:37,620
them to 12 U.S.C. 1431, go

874
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,400
ahead, pull that up, 12 U.S.C.

875
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,700
1431, Chuck, 12 U.S.C. 1431, pull

876
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:50,220
that up, and read it, just the first,

877
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,200
like, 30 words, or 20 words, oh, yeah,

878
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,280
no, I just said, I think I know

879
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,860
that one verbatim, had to pull up a

880
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,200
browser real quick, so I think I know

881
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,200
that one verbatim, all right, that's fine, no,

882
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,560
I know that one verbatim, but I'd rather,

883
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,260
it's got more impact when you read it,

884
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,880
okay, if you say so, uh, let's see,

885
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,840
okay, so, 12 U.S.C. code, uh,

886
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:11,040
funny signo thing there, uh, 1431, yeah, section

887
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,840
1431, powers and duties of banks, that's what

888
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:19,620
you want, yeah, yeah, okay, borrowing money, keep

889
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:23,040
reading, 20 words, A, borrowing money, issuing bonds,

890
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:28,880
and debentures, general powers, each federal home loan

891
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,340
bank shall have power, subject to rules and

892
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:35,000
regulations prescribed by the director, to borrow and

893
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,100
give security, therefore, and to pay interest thereon,

894
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,660
to issue debentures, bonds, or other obligations upon

895
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:46,580
such terms and conditions as the director may

896
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:50,060
approve, uh, good, that's it, you could stop

897
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,000
there, because it just continues with more, a

898
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,480
list, laundry list of the same, right, but

899
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,580
if you were to, if you were to

900
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,400
break that down, the powers and duties of

901
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,600
the bank is essentially to borrow money and

902
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:04,580
pay interest, debentures are unsecured, unsecured instruments, like

903
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:07,360
credit cards and stuff like that, similar, so

904
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,760
where does it say, but you could keep

905
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,040
reading the thing, and they'll give you a

906
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,820
thousand dollars every time it says they give

907
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,500
loans, you know why, I still have that

908
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,520
thousand dollars, and I always will, because it

909
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,200
doesn't say anywhere that they have the power

910
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,760
to loan anything, how many times have you

911
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,700
seen a billboard, we lend money, how many

912
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,000
people have said, I went in banking, got

913
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,960
a loan, you did a big switcheroo, right,

914
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,280
it's right, so why would you want to,

915
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,060
yeah, now here's the thing, I go and

916
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,900
speak to the banks, and I'm like, I

917
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,120
need to speak to your senior banker, oh

918
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,220
yeah, okay, come in on this day, going

919
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,380
on that day, and they give you the

920
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,980
senior banker, he doesn't know what the hell

921
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,440
you're talking about, I said, who's your senior

922
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,760
banker, oh well, he'd be in on this,

923
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,600
you know, you got to go to this

924
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,460
other branch, I go to that branch, and

925
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,220
he doesn't know what I'm talking about, who's

926
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:54,780
your senior banker, and they give me an

927
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:57,880
address, it's an office building, whatever, and then

928
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,300
completely outside of a regular bank setting, and

929
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,660
you go talk to him, and all he's

930
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,880
interested in is how many people you talked

931
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,240
about these things or asked prior, and he

932
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,320
doesn't even know what you're talking about, because

933
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,900
they don't, he knows a little bit of

934
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,880
it, a little bit, he wants to, he

935
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,540
was so curious of how many people I

936
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,700
brought this up with prior in his organization,

937
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,040
do you think you're going to be working

938
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,060
for the IRS or bank for whatever, 30

939
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,380
bucks an hour, I don't know what they're

940
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,240
paying, I don't know, if you know how

941
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,440
the hell the money system works, you can't

942
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,180
sit there in good conscience and work there,

943
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:35,660
no, I couldn't, right, so anyway, it's not

944
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:39,520
unlawful, what they're doing is even legal, because

945
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,360
you agree to it, constitution says there'll be

946
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,500
legislature will make no law that interferes in

947
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:48,920
the agreements of contracts, but they're doing a

948
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,760
lot more than just making a contract, but

949
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,700
anyway, well, go on, what's the question, I

950
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,880
don't even think we breached the question, oh,

951
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,400
well, back to it, let me see if

952
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,040
I can get it, I was doing other

953
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:01,140
things here, yeah, let me see, where is

954
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,140
it, Greece said, what's a pocket selling in,

955
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,420
no, no, that's the wrong one, hold on,

956
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,200
I know it's here, it's in one of

957
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,600
these, let's see, that's fine, let's do another

958
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,820
one, and we'll come up to it again,

959
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,960
okay, well, this is the only, this is

960
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,940
like the last one that I had in

961
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,120
mind, anyway, I wanted to see if we

962
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,600
could end with this, because this is a

963
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:22,220
little bit of a winding road, Old Testament,

964
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:26,000
King Nebuchadnezzar was cast into the wilderness and

965
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,520
became as a wild beast eating grass, because

966
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,340
he didn't recognize the Most High, and the

967
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:34,280
Most High said that he controls the affairs

968
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,000
of men and all the kingdoms of the

969
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,420
earth.

970
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:41,600
In the New Testament, Satan takes up Yeshua

971
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,060
up to the highest mountain and shows him

972
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:46,100
all the kings of the earth, and Satan

973
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:49,340
said to Yeshua, worship me, and I'll give

974
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:51,920
you all these kingdoms, are we dealing with

975
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,040
two entities that rule the affairs of men

976
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,600
and control kingdoms?

977
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:00,940
Two entities, the same office, if you look

978
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:04,100
at the New Testament Christ says, I'll protect

979
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,260
you from the evil one, one who does

980
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:10,600
evil, if you look in Jeremiah, Yahweh says,

981
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:13,480
has evil ever fallen on a city that

982
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,340
I have not brought?

983
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,400
Yeah, they're the same one, essentially, it's the

984
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,220
same office.

985
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:23,560
In the book of Job, in Yahweh's counsel,

986
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,060
who do they see walking around, and they

987
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:25,840
ask him, what are you doing?

988
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,360
Who, who do they see?

989
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:31,820
Satan, right, yeah, he's hanging out, same office,

990
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,880
like the bankers, right, or whatever, so, yeah,

991
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,720
you got a problem with that?

992
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,320
Now, most people will say, well, that sounds

993
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:43,320
like Satanism, then, no, it's not, and you

994
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,900
should understand, like, for example, Satanism is in

995
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,160
the same category as Christianity, what a joke,

996
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,440
what a joke, you know, Christianity is a

997
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,260
joke, by the way, right, it's a joke,

998
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,700
it's the kind of joke that doesn't even

999
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,560
have a punchline that people sit around and

1000
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,780
listen to, right, Satanism is the opposite of

1001
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,860
Christianity, they'll tell you that, yeah, they make

1002
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:04,320
a little more sense, actually, I don't endorse

1003
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:09,340
that, because it's dumb, just like Christianity is

1004
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:12,040
dumb, I mean, really dumb, and it's actually

1005
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,780
dumb, which is like, you know, third level,

1006
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,980
so, but it's there to flag you, once

1007
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:21,060
you pick one of these religions, they know

1008
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,760
that they don't have to invest in a

1009
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,400
control apparatus anymore, and you cannot pose a

1010
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:31,240
threat model that they can't overcome, right, so,

1011
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,860
no, I would say that once you understand

1012
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:37,900
the office of the Most High, you understand,

1013
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:40,460
because look, let's go back and let's massage

1014
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:43,400
this, right, the fallen angels, why are they

1015
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:43,700
fallen?

1016
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:46,580
Because they left their original habitation, what was

1017
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:46,900
that?

1018
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:48,440
Right?

1019
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:53,300
So, it's a political thing, if you're politically

1020
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:57,060
favorite, you're a good god or an angel,

1021
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:59,300
if you're politically, you did something that made

1022
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:04,400
you politically unpopular, right, you're a demon, so,

1023
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,180
yeah, stay away from politics.

1024
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,400
Yeah, that's what they do now, I mean,

1025
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,520
there's, you know, no longer any nuance at

1026
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,780
all in political discourse, it's just, nope, they're

1027
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:15,400
the enemy, they're evil, that's it.

1028
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,240
Well, just like John C.

1029
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,720
Lilly said, he said, don't get into the

1030
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,580
super pleasurable, because then it'll grab you, and

1031
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:25,320
you want to keep doing it, right, because

1032
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,700
it's pleasurable, and don't get into the really

1033
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:30,440
negative shit, because it's just negative, right, it's

1034
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,560
just destructive.

1035
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:35,100
Somewhere in the middle, there's a Buddhist principle

1036
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:39,400
on that, or some ancient philosophical principles, in

1037
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,760
Greek, parmetro ariston, like median, be in the

1038
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,300
middle, and do it well, and then you

1039
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:47,820
can, right, so, yeah, I think people, I

1040
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:50,740
think I've given enough on this stuff, you

1041
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:53,860
know, like people, I'm a Yahwehist, right, I

1042
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:55,780
do use those laws, because any law you

1043
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:57,220
want to follow on the surface of the

1044
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:59,140
earth is based on that Old Testament stuff,

1045
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:03,020
or similar to, right, so, if you understand

1046
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:06,300
law, you know your rights, right, then you

1047
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,820
can operate here, and when you have to

1048
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:12,160
apply force, you know why you're applying force,

1049
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:15,420
because everything else has been exhausted, right, so

1050
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,420
I think it's worthwhile knowing those things, but

1051
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:18,900
I never said Yahweh was a good guy,

1052
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:21,320
I never did, when did you ever hear

1053
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,640
me say that, right, I just know the

1054
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:23,960
rules.
