Colds and naps and medical malpractice aside, here we are, Rated Y, once again. Greek, how are you? Oh, much better on the laptop. I'm using an old wireless Logitech wireless headset, chilling in front of the laptop.

Can't run away, it's too far, but yeah, just telling you, it's funny, they do an article once in a while that Hulk Hogan might have died because of malpractice, they didn't even use that term, but yeah, him and like 4,000 other people in the USA that day. This is common, this is so common, and Ozzy Osbourne and all these guys, so you could live to 100 pretty simply here if you're like them. In other words, if you feel you belong here, you're part of this system, I saw someone where trust the science means trust the system, right? You could live pretty long, but the problem is you won't be much better off than you were in the 19th century, you will be, because you want to avoid all the stuff that everyone else is taking in, including the food they eat, very, very important.

Years ago, even in the film, it's shown in art, you go to a weird town, and people say, must be something in the water, right, oh hell yeah. You notice that's never making it anywhere, even the alternative, alternative is a waste of time too, they're not talking about what's in the water, right, at all, anymore? Well we have, I mean, over the years, there's been a lot of people like myself who've talked about the water and how people don't understand it, and of course, but the crap they're pumping into the water is a problem, and the containers they're putting the water in is a problem, I mean, it took some of us a little longer to figure that out, but I mean, it's just obvious, and now there's so much plastic in everybody's body, I don't know if that's, you know, I don't know what your view is on the plastic situation. Plastic is not an issue, well, there's seven types of plastic generally used in industry, and we'll go through it really, really fast, so fast I'll be done before I even say what the plastics are, one of the plastics, if not two of the plastics, have these things called plasticizers, and one is a BPA, the other one is a phthalate, I like that word phthalate, it's spelled P-T-H-A-L-A-T-E, and those two plastics, yeah, yeah, those, one is PVC, the other one is polycarbonate, so with the BPAs, it's funny when you see like a polyethylene and it says no BPA, I'm like, of course, it's polyethylene, but those things are gender-bender chemicals first, they dump them in the river, you know, the factories that have the BPAs and the phthalates, when they have a runoff, the fish, all the fish are female, regardless of how many male fish were there a month ago, right, and then you have, and then what it does is it does accumulate more like toxify the liver and the kidneys, and now 99% of what people complain about being lack of fitness or health is liver issues, and there's no discussion, but by the way, I was driving here in Tucson recently and it said center for liver, medical center for the liver, I think it was something like that, I was laughing, like you're gonna go there and these morons know anything about the liver, right, I wanna go in there and ask these morons, if you go into surgery and you have a procedure where half of the liver is removed, how long does it take for it to grow back, and half of them say, oh my gosh, oh, I don't know, I'm serious, right, I think we went over this, I don't know if anyone looked it up, there's maybe some scant information, it'll grow back in like two weeks, yeah, so I don't know, but anyway, you're in really bad shape, people, humans, you know, it's still a fact, not really well reported, they shut down major funding, by the way, in the 80s for Red Cross medical research across the world, like doing profiles of societies and all over the world, they used to go to, you know, as many countries as they could, spend time there and document what, you know, quote, unquote, the health of the people, and they shut that down, you know why, because they found out the more, quote, unquote, poor the country was, the lower the infant mortality rate was, for example, the lowest infant mortality rate on the western hemisphere is Cuba, most likely today, they found out that the people lived an average, you're ready, 17 years more, not five or 10 or two, right, that's a lot, right, so if you live to 100, 17 years is 17% more, if you live to 80, it's 23% more, and so on and so forth, so they lived 20 double digit plus times longer, infant mortality was down, quote, unquote, health issues, disease, cancer was non-existent, right, non-existent, yeah, and yeah, this is what's great, this isn't, in other words, go to the pot, everyone knows, has heard of someone that's got some ailment, I see them, I'm in a neighborhood, I haven't moved from this place in 25 years now, almost 24, and I've seen people just a year or two older than me walking with a cane in this neighborhood, right, right, and they're being killed slowly by the medics, you watch it, you know, they go, how do I know they're being killed by the medics, well, they have a job, or a job, not a yob, a job, I think I've explained the difference between a job and a yob, right, like, hey man, I got a yob, that's different than, hey man, I got a job, so anyway, when they have these jobs, they have to get what's called a yearly or biannual, what do you call it, medical exam, a physical, they always call it, physical, yeah, yeah, and guess what, they fall for the high blood pressure, they fall for this, the cancer screening, I've read cancer screening stuff, and I said, go back to the doctor that tells you you have cancer, and have him sign an affidavit swearing that you have cancer, he said, I wouldn't do it, he won't do it, I called him, hey, they won't do it, of course, none of them will ever do it, because you don't have it, do you know how rare cancer is, by the way, it's extremely rare, well, it used to be, you know, yeah, no, no, in other words, people are dying from, they're dying, in other words, right now, one out of two people will die of cancer, just like one out of two people who are married, one out of two couples that are married are going to divorce, that still holds, in other words, half the people, more than half the people are dying of so-called cancer, right, so, but there's no such thing, really, as they portray it, that, no, my gosh, have I confused everyone right now, so, anyway, yeah, probably, yeah, what is the thing, as you thinketh so you are, and your beliefs become your reality, right, oh, yeah, there's so on and so forth, many different philosophical stripes that basically say that, you know, you create your own reality by your own perception, and how you interpret things is exactly the way they are, so, the Agregor thing, well, enough people believe in something, yeah, that emerges as real, or manifests, let's say, I've been doing some, well, for a while now, engineering consulting, various subjects, I mean, just stuff, just drop that a thin air on me, and coming up with solutions and stuff, and it's funny when you hear these quote-unquote people are supposed to be learned in the art of engineering and all that, believe even the medical stuff, one guy says he wants to take this, these, when I say dealing with engineers, these guys are raking it in, right, I mean, like, four guys making 100 million a year in engineering, I didn't know it could be, like, a drug cartel or something like that, you never hear, when you work as an engineer in an office, you know, you get a salary, right, and you get paid well, I think it's 100k plus, 120k plus out of college now, something like that, and someone, you know, should get raking a quarter of a million a year, but, like, 30 million a year, I don't know, these guys, what the hell are they doing, but anyway, it's good for me, though, because, you know, when you're making 30 million, 40 million, 50 million a year, you know, handing someone six figures is like a candy bar, right, so, $50,000 is not a big deal, $100,000 is not a big deal, yeah, yeah, because you're doing all, you're doing 2 million a month, right, so, personally, and, yeah, it's quite interesting to see that, and the ignorance abound, but I'd rather be speaking to engineers, though, because, you know, they have the training, you know, you can actually get into, when you explain something, you can actually say, well, this thing moves left and right, and goes up and down, and it's made of this, and they're not like, huh, right, they kind of get it, right, so, yeah, interesting, anyway, I just want to bring that stuff up, because I don't know how much to overstate humbly, the relevancy of what we discuss here is so effing relevant, right, that it should make, I mean, I don't know how many of our subs have ever heard more than 10 Sonics pour gasoline on their heads, set it on fire, and ran down the street naked, how many have done that, I don't know, because this is how, this is the urgency of what I'm saying, right, yeah, I look, I understand that, you know, and, in fact, somebody asked a very long, convoluted question, I'm going to break down for you fast, that, you know, like, why don't you just simply create an entire new exchange out of the credit system, you could literally create the credit, you know, utilizing the credit system, create something that does have tangible value, and then literally create a collective that would be, in and of itself, a profitable venture, like a new bank, almost, but I hate to use the dirty word bank, he says, yeah, go ahead, no, that's fine, no, you could, but you can't have it defined as such, the moment it's defined as such, then you get a knock on the door, this goes against the United States, and then you're at war with the United States, basically, when they tell you this goes against the policies of the United States, it's an indirect way of saying that we're declaring war on you, right, so that's why, when they go to other countries to wage war, they're, why are they going, what do they say, to defend the interests of the United States, right, you've heard that, right, literally, an interest is exactly what they collect when they make loans, so, you know, yeah, well, they don't really make loans, they use your credit, and in order to get into that agreement, you make them the trustees, right, is the main way, and then the other way is that you give them also security interest, if you didn't know, if you didn't recognize that you were making them a trustee, because a trustee, for example, when you have a trust, a trustee could sell everything you got, and legally, that's why, here, I'll give a little legal secret out, when I set up trusts, I've been doing this for 20 years, not setting up trusts, but consulting on them, it's like, oh, man, I'm setting up a trust, you know, my sister's brother, my wife's, my brother-in-law is going to be trustee, I say, oh, brother-in-law, oh, I've seen that go sour sometimes, you know, I don't care if you're married for 30 years, that could go south, right, and I say, listen, this is what I'd like for you to do, whenever you set up a trust, I want everyone who's going to sign on as a trustee, sign something else first, and that something else is a resignation letter, have them sign the resignation letters first, before they sign on as trustee, get it, wink, wink, so if they turn out, whatever, you just go record the resignation letter, and they're out of there, now, some, now, here, if you really want to know what's going on, if you ask them to sign, what's this, it's a resignation letter prior to signing trustee, it's like, screw that, I'm not doing that, well, they kind of exposed their motive, didn't they, right, so, yeah, so, by the way, it's $1,500 an hour attorneys that don't know what I just said, and I have spoken to some of them, mentioned that, and they're like, that's a great idea, and I, wait a second, you're charging $1,500 an hour, and I'm giving you great ideas, yeah, well, this is kind of backwards, this is kind of backwards, isn't it, yeah, oh, well, you know, how about this one, a retired New York attorney wants to write a book on how corrupt the Bar Association is, but he can't, because he doesn't know any law, that's almost verbatim, I'm kind of paraphrasing what he told me, yeah, by the way, the reason I knock, quote, unquote, doctors, or medical technicians, that's what they are, and attorneys, is because I know so many of them, right, people that knock these other things hardly have any first-hand experience, I'm like, oh, my gosh, right, and priests, right, rabbis, whatever, they do nothing, they're fun, I love those guys, though, they create all kinds of weird stories, and then they create their own little offshoot of the story, it's just, you know, rabbis, you mean rabbis, yeah, they're the funniest, they're hilarious, they could be the, you know, they'll sit there telling me about their last steak dinner, you know, instead of, you know, telling me about something in the book, you know what I mean, it's hilarious, it's very much like, I don't know if anyone, if you guys are familiar with Guy Ritchie films, Snatch, S-N-A-T-C-H, you know, go watch it, the beginning, when they go in to get the diamond, and they're dressed up like Hasidim, right, and what they're discussing, right, give me the stone, where is the stone, yeah, anyway, so, all right, let's go, question.

Yeah, that is a key, so somebody wanted to know if you were involved in the recent dust storm in Arizona, or if you were affected by it, one or the other, because it did make some headlines, and it seemed to be a strange weather event. We've been getting a change in the jet stream here, and I finally said, listen, I've got to do something about it, for the past couple of days, I altered the jet stream, the jet stream here should be coming up through Mexico, like the west coast of Mexico to us, bringing what's called the rainy season, and what's been happening is, we've been getting a jet stream coming down from Seattle, swirling in the midwest, clockwise, across central Texas, and we've been getting what's going across central, you don't want anything from central Texas, especially the jet stream, very hot and dry, I said, this is really screwed up, I did about 20 hours of ops, and I got rain to come here from the south, and it's a lot of work, it's very sensitive, right, it's like, I don't know, it's kind of like between dialing a watch and scratching your butt, but anyway, so, yeah, so anyway, I'm just joking, people, I have to laugh, because I don't know if they'd say this everywhere, but on the east coast, it's definitely, I don't know whether to scratch my watch or wind my ass, you know, when you're confused, yeah, that's why I said it up that way, yeah, you got it, so anyway, so anyway, that's it, and we had some rain today, a slow drizzle, those are called Haboobs, or Habeebs, or something like that, sounds a lot like friend in Arabic, and it went around us, it forks, there was one coming, you could see it, it's really ominous, it's like that movie Scorpion King or whatever, it's a wall, a tan wall that goes up to about the low height of airplanes before they land, really tall, 700, 800 feet, 1000 feet, and it moves towards you very slowly, completely engulfs all the traffic lights, come on, you have a visibility of anywhere between 10 and 50 feet, and they always go around us when I know they're coming, obviously, because I've mentioned, when you set up these devices, you create a force field or a bubble, it's amazing how when there's lightning, you know, get inside, like that's going to help, right, so you don't get hit by lightning, right, and the first thing I do is start activating devices, it forms a force field around you, right, so no, I saw that, I had nothing to do with it directly, I didn't, you know, but it went around us, because we usually get it, and if you study the jet stream, it was going from west to east, which it shouldn't be, it should be going south to north, but thanks for asking, yeah, and it went over phoenix, I think, so, you know, yeah, it shut down, they lost power, a couple of the counties there lost power, right, so here's one about pets, by the way, I always like these questions, why do some humans experience a loss of vacuum from cats, has anyone found ways to bypass this experience, short of maintaining the cats and humans general hygiene, how should we go about remediation, now, really quickly on this, I lived with a friend temporarily, when I was getting a divorce, and I had nowhere to go, and he had a cat, and I was like, dude, I can't stay with you, because cats just blow me up, you know, and he's like, well, look, cat scratch fever, if they scratch you, you get a rash, like that also, yeah, plus I just get the runny eyes, runny nose, I mean, just my whole vacuum goes out of whack, that's because the cat has a case of cat psoriasis, it's, you don't see it, it's very small, very fine, and energetic, it's because of the quality of life of the cat, most of the time, in other words, I found out that most people that have adverse reactions to being around felines, if they're around a barn cat, in a barn, with the doors closed, it's not so bad, but when they're in an indoor, near an indoor cat, meaning it doesn't get to go outside, apartment house, what have you, they have that issue, yeah, well, typically, yeah, my friend was one of the most incredibly clean people ever, and so he kept it at a minimum, but I couldn't escape it, and I happen to know there's a lot of people that like, I know you say it's a matter of psoriasis, but it seems like everybody's, everybody's indoor cat is a problem, everybody's, you know, really, yeah, for some people, yeah, now here's the other thing, I'll take this, we all take interest in things that affect us personally, if something doesn't affect us personally, we very rarely take interest in it, unless it's an occupational thing or whatever, and you have to know, so I've never had an adverse reaction to cats, I've remotely, and not been around people, had an adverse reaction to cats, but I've heard people say that I have adverse reactions to cats when the topic came up, and those people are actually hypersensitive, or very, you have, you know, you have sensitive, very sensitive, then hypersensitive, right, but I would say they were sensitive to, very sensitive in hyper, all three, I don't know, I think that there's been a lot of stuff about cats have special, you know, bacteria, quote-unquote things that in their gut that go into your gut, if you just touch them, you know, like 30 seconds handling a cat, you get it, right, Richard Allen Miller is big on that, and starts taking over your brain, some shit like, I just, am I on point with that, or am I off? Richard Allen Miller says a lot of things, you got to decode, so, you know, who knows, but people have talked about that, what is it, tox, toxus plasmosis, whatever the hell it is, I forget how you say it exactly, but you know what I'm talking about, where they say this thing gets in your brain from the cat poop, and maybe it does, I don't know, but you know what is funny to me, is that when I was young, the first pet I had was a cat, and my cat used to go outside, inside, he was outside a lot of the time, and he didn't make me sick, but only these indoor cats, yeah, that's what I mentioned, yeah, it's, yeah, that's right, there's a certain stress, certain element that they change the environment, now to me, if you really, you know, everybody cover your ears, I think cats are visiting here to monitor us, if you guys know about John C. Lilly, did a lot of research with dolphin brains, and psychedelics, and all that, right, he talks about echo, ECCO, ECCO, which is Earth Coincidence Control Office, it's like one of God's field offices, if you want to understand more of what he meant by that, it's the Adjustment Bureau film, he says that's real, well, he died before the film came out, more than 15 years, or 10 years before, 15 years before the film came out, that's based on John C. Lilly, there's an Adjustment Bureau, and they control large, long events in people's lives, in society, and you're sort of controlling the small events, and they do make adjustments in the small events, so the big events happen, and when he was tripping enough in isolation, they approached him and said, listen, we appreciate what you're doing, but don't do it anymore, we want you to go back and learn what it's like to be a human, you know, like be a screw-up, right, so, but they did tell him that if you figure out how we do things, you'll never have to come back here again, you're done here, so I thought that was interesting, and I think cats play a role somewhere in that, well, they would be excellent monitoring devices, because, I mean, they seem to be everywhere and nowhere at the same time, yeah, yeah, yeah, there are other people said, if you don't put a probe, or a, what do you call it, a chip, though, one of those sensors in people, put it in their pets, right, right, so, yeah, because their pet's not going to be able to communicate that it has something like that, so, yeah, and cats, by the way, it's very well known, they're not evolved from, someone was talking about evolution today, I had to interrupt very simply, of course, but cats did not evolve, domestic cats, small cats, from large cats, at all, they're very different, just like dogs did not evolve from wolves, just look at a wolf paw and a dog paw, and they're internal, they have different aspects to their biology, they're independent, what happens is species don't evolve, species are injected, they're introduced, right, yeah, so, when you have like a small looking canine, large canine, medium canine, oh, they didn't evolve, you know, in any way, they were, it was time to bring in this size and this type, and they just put it in, you put it into our reality, you know, there's no evolution at all, as a matter of fact, the food industry is wholly and solely dependent on the lack of evolution, like long-term canning stuff, right, you're gonna, this is a Chuck Missler thing, if you can peanut butter for a fallout shelter, it's supposed to last for 25 years, yeah, yeah, I was shocked when I found out some things were designed to last 25 years, you know, food stuffs, right, wet, yeah, it's, they're relying on there's no evolution, right, right, you get it, so no change, yeah, what else you got? Okay, so, on the topic of acoustic counter space, I'm thinking the most important factors in the material used for the barrier, in quotes, the size of the hole and the amount of space between the barrier and the back of the speaker, could the Greek elaborate on these factors? Oh, wow, who, I wonder who wrote that, email me, email me, sounds like you got at least one or two sharpened pencils in your pocket, you know how to listen and communicate, thank you very much. This is a long-time listener, I know the handle they're using, this is a long-time sonic observer, let's call it. 

Well, either way, either way, what you wouldn't believe, I've had long, long, long, long time listeners that couldn't structure a sentence like that, but anyway, no, that's great, there you go, the false back, imagine a false back, it doesn't have to be a false back, per se, in the enclosure and when you successfully do this, you don't need all that volume, there's something called Thiel's small parameters, T-H-I-E-L and small, now you ready? Now, I forgot Thiel's first name, but small, his name, there are two Australian guys that came up with speaker parameters, like how much volume need behind a certain driver when it, when you measure its parameters, you know how flexible it is, dimensions and all that, electrical, mechanical, anyway, I just want to play on this, because it's funny when you find that most people have been in audio and know, use Thiel's small parameters, but they don't know about small, small's first name is Richard, now what's the, what's the nickname for Richard? I'll leave it at that, so yeah, you got it, all right, so yeah, the Thiel's small parameters fall apart, that's why someone kind of gave me an elbow and says, no, they're never, industry's never going to use this, because it destroys Thiel's small parameters, and his entire business is based on Thiel's small, right, it's kind of like what the acoustic counter space is like, oh yeah, cars can run on water, right, or guess what, the periodic table doesn't apply anymore, they're going to let you get away with that, no, never, right, their entire system is based on that, so it's based on Thiel's small parameters, they fall apart, so the question, I guess, was materials, the barrier, the barrier is the same, you're using the actual structure, the baffles, let's call it, they're all, they should be made, or can and should be made of the same material the loudspeaker enclosure is, so if you're working with an enclosure that's half-inch particle board, make it out of half-inch particle board, right, I tend to, okay, also these things could go behind drivers, there's a patent on, someone did a patent on something similar, and it was called embedded transmission line, and I got in communication with them, and I gave them all these drawings, and how they can improve their patent, and when they got the continuance, they put my drawings in the patent, oh, did I ever show you that, all my drawings are in somebody else's patent, you never showed me that, you got permission, okay, yeah, so when I show these drawings, I said go to this patent number, and you'll see all my stuff there under a different thing, right, I give them permission, because you know me, I like to give pretty much whatever I can away to help people, I wouldn't do it anymore, but not because of that, I think, I think it's just, what is it called, Bob Pearls, right, so yeah, the answer, I guess the answer I'm getting here, just make, just use whatever materials you have, now the gap inside the counter space changes depending on the driver's side, if you're doing it for behind a tweeter, a very tiny speaker, it's much proportionally smaller, for a large woofer, I would make the gap quarter inch of air space, quarter inch of absorbent material, all right, and I'm still developing this, and it's unbelievable, especially when you do an isobaric setup, I have a speaker that is 9x7x10 dimensions, small, you can put both of them under one arm, and when you play these with a, they're not very efficient, because I just use drivers, I find, if I use really good drivers, they'll be more efficient, but I'm more sensitive drivers, but you crank these things up, and you think there's like big old JBL towers, or those big-ass Sergo and Vegas, or huge rock and roll speakers, that are as tall as your brother was, whatever, when you're growing up, oh yeah, Ben's, yeah, that's what you think is in there, huge speakers, and the base extension goes down to 20 cycles, like really 20 cycles minus 60b, but pretty flat down to 28, a little tiny four and a half inch woofer, it's like, how is that possible, every time I listen to it, I'm like, no, we don't live in a real world, no, not at all, you know, this is not real, this is not really happening, yes it is, yeah, so, have you ever tried to apply that, yeah, have you ever tried to apply that kind of stuff to instrument cabinets, because part of what you're describing vaguely sounds to me like what they did with Laney for a little bit, when they were actually concentrating on their construction, once they went into like mass production, it was over, but, well, when they do that to an instrument, it will change the resonance, see that resonance you have in a guitar, whether it's acoustic or not, right, or any instrument is the characteristic of it, and by the way, you know that bullshit about the Stradivarius, where it's three million, because no one knows how to duplicate the sound, it's total bullshit, I know how to duplicate, I can build you a Stradivarius that will sound exactly like the original, except for if you, actually I could, I could, that sounds, I'm saying this humbly, and it's based on this theory, I'll give this information out, it's very well established, I'll give the information, it's a German guy, again from Snats, you know, where'd you get that for, who's going to get you, protect yourself from who, it's the Germans, right, it's here, I'll give you this guy, it's a C37, C37 acoustics, here, I'll click on it, look it up, it's, the website is enemoza.com, it's C37 theory English, this is in English, by Dieter Enemoza, not a good German accent, E-N-N-E-M-O-S-E-R, it's called C37 theory English, what that means, C37 is the 98.6 blood temperature, and basically what gives that Stradivarius that sound is the, and tonality is the coating, the lacquer that they used, it's not the wood, it's the coating, so I'm very big into natural, if you're going to have a hi-fi, a hi-fi, you know, for, you know, music is wonderful, but it gets more wonderful when you have a nice high, a really good hi-fi to play it on, right, and everything blooms, the sound just blooms, and everything just sends, usually if you have a good hi-fi, it's better than what they had in the recording studio, and then you get into the problem of, I can't get recordings that sound good, right, so you can have a very revealing system, because, yeah, so, yeah, so check them out, C37, he's got some pretty good articles, all very German, so, yeah, that's, so I apply a lot of that, for example, when I do coatings and things, I use natural shellac, which come from the lac bug, yeah, it's actually a bug, right, they make a resin out of, and alcohol, I use lacquers, I got away from acrylics and all that, you can hear the difference, yeah, you want to use natural sustained materials, in other words, they're not modified with too much plastic, yeah, so anyway, about the counter space, let's do a get-together on that in the next couple of weeks, I'll announce it here, just to discuss it, the sooner we discuss it, I'll do, like I did the weather and other stuff, I'll pop diagrams, drawings, photos, maybe a video, I have sent people videos of what the little speakers sound like, I know, whatever you have, but if you play it with headphones, you'll be like, oh my gosh, that's a lot of sound, right, and it's coming out of this little tiny thing, I wouldn't say they're tiny, they're small, so, you know, probably smaller than the sound, right, okay, so the Greeks, oh my gosh, yeah, the Greeks said in one podcast, that what they're selling as AI is not really AI, now that I, no, understand some technical stuff, and having worked with it a bit, I get it, it doesn't have its own memory, and it can't retain any information, it just gives the output, and then drops the whole thing, so there is no AI, just a more advanced algorithm, so somebody was testing what you had to say there, and I wanted to let you know, and networking, and it came about, I don't remember in the heydays of the internet, there was a lot of talk about that, that's when Snowden, that was the heydays of the internet, when Snowden was in the news, that was the end of the heyday, right, yeah, the end, remember all that stuff, that they're spying on us, and whatever, I actually looked up what the, what was disclosed, the, versus what everybody was talking about, what was disclosed is, now they finally have enough computational power and memory to make a transcript of everything, right, what they're doing is, every phone conversation, no one's listening to anything, I shouldn't say that, but what's really happening is, transcripts are being made of everything, transcripts of all your transactions, your movements, your, in other words, your map, you know, have you ever seen the maps in Wile E. Coyote, but anyway, all your conversations, your emails, transcripts are being made in a file, like just like years ago, that was it, what do you say, 99% of US citizens have an FBI file, right, was it something like 87%, 97%, I don't know, whatever, you get it, yeah, there was, so it's a very high number, proportion, right, some people, like, they don't know how to label you, but, but now it's 100%, yeah, now it's 100%, because the fact is that the, the goal of the NSA, which was stated, was to capture every conversation they could, so they did that, by transcript, yeah, no one's, yeah, and that was the thing, though, but back then, people said, oh, that's radio, that's telephone, that's, yeah, but that has now gone further into the rest of it, so that's everything now, yeah, that's all it is, they bottlenecked, they bottlenecked everybody into using a device that, that, look, recently, I hate the voicemail thing, recently, the voicemail shows up as a text message now, yeah, right, and voicemail, you can hear, why, because they're trying to tell you, hey, look, this is what we're doing, look, pay attention, I'm fine with it, because, whatever, not, well, I'm not fine with it, because it's not going to be used right, but if you know your rights, you can make sure that it's being used right, because you signed them, your permissions to do that indirectly, it's always indirect, but what I just want to bring up, we brought up the, I dropped an article, by the way, speaking of reading, in the Ocelli, it's called, I think, ocellianthegreekchitango.com, it's an NIH document on the history of glucose measurement, blood glucose measurement, and that's how you catch these assholes in telling you the truth, well, Greek, why would you call them assholes, telling you the truth, always look up the, how many times you heard me say, if you, in order to understand a thing, you have to know the history of that thing, right, yeah, I mentioned once, there were some young twins always watching TV, and they thought, I asked them how long the TV's been around, they thought it was around since the dinosaurs, right, they didn't know the history, it's a recent development, so, but I put that article up, and whoever can read it with comprehension, you go ahead and read that and tell me that there is such a thing as blood glucose measurement, there isn't, it's an attempt, so, yeah, and this goes on and on and on and on with, when you read what's going on, and you've got to know your rights, by the way, just like I've said many, many times, there's, I assure you, no one in prison right now, today, is there lawfully or legally, no one, because if you know what lawful and legal is, you wouldn't be in prison, oh, by the way, I did find that Judge Bork interview on PBS, the confirmation, with senator questions and all that stuff, and they spoke, the part when they asked him, what are you going to do about the growing prison population, he said, I'm not going to do anything, because everyone in prison has volunteered to be there, they dubbed the hosts of PBS speaking over that, so you can't get it, you can see his mouth moving, but you don't hear it, so, shucks, wonder why they did that, wonder why, I'm sure that was just an editorial decision, you know, for the sake of appearances, you know, right, oh my gosh, yeah, aesthetics only, yeah, aesthetics, right, that's what I was looking for, aesthetics, correct word, thank you, hey, here's another interesting question, a question to the Greek about living lawfully and separately yourself, uh, discernment, okay, bank account, uh, that would be unlawful, does the Greek have a bank account, now, I know you've answered this, it wouldn't be unlawful, it wouldn't be unlawful, no, but go ahead, well, I knew you answered the does the Greek have a bank account question before, no, right, uh, but, so, it's not unlawful for you to have a bank account, no, it's not, it's just like it's not unlawful to go and sell heroin in your neighborhood, well, no, it's illegal, it's illegal, but that's only because you can't pay the taxes on it, um, there's no law that, yeah, there's no law, well, you shouldn't have to pay taxes if you were born in the USA, anyway, on anything, and that can be proven out, your passport makes you tax exempt, by the way, if you're a national, but, um, if you have a passport, you know, they bring something up, and you give them the passport, you say you're tax exempt, they give them the number and name of organizations, the name on there, and it takes off the taxes every time, so, but here's the deal, there's no, um, unlawfulness on growing, selling, or processing anything that grows on an animal or a plant to anyone, well, nothing unlawful on that at all, ever, but is it illegal, in a lot, many cases, in a lot of places, with certain things, yeah, so, yeah, the reason I don't do it is because I don't, it's like, okay, let's do our banking, let's go find the Zeta cartel, it's a cartel, all right, and I can't sleep at night knowing that, uh, what I signed on to as terms and service, terms and conditions, and they don't want to change it the way I want it done, no, they don't, what I want them to do is, I want to hold them to 12 U.S.C. 1431, go ahead, pull that up, 12 U.S.C. 1431, Chuck, 12 U.S.C. 1431, pull that up, and read it, just the first, like, 30 words, or 20 words, oh, yeah, no, I just said, I think I know that one verbatim, had to pull up a browser real quick, so I think I know that one verbatim, all right, that's fine, no, I know that one verbatim, but I'd rather, it's got more impact when you read it, okay, if you say so, uh, let's see, okay, so, 12 U.S.C. code, uh, funny signo thing there, uh, 1431, yeah, section 1431, powers and duties of banks, that's what you want, yeah, yeah, okay, borrowing money, keep reading, 20 words, A, borrowing money, issuing bonds, and debentures, general powers, each federal home loan bank shall have power, subject to rules and regulations prescribed by the director, to borrow and give security, therefore, and to pay interest thereon, to issue debentures, bonds, or other obligations upon such terms and conditions as the director may approve, uh, good, that's it, you could stop there, because it just continues with more, a list, laundry list of the same, right, but if you were to, if you were to break that down, the powers and duties of the bank is essentially to borrow money and pay interest, debentures are unsecured, unsecured instruments, like credit cards and stuff like that, similar, so where does it say, but you could keep reading the thing, and they'll give you a thousand dollars every time it says they give loans, you know why, I still have that thousand dollars, and I always will, because it doesn't say anywhere that they have the power to loan anything, how many times have you seen a billboard, we lend money, how many people have said, I went in banking, got a loan, you did a big switcheroo, right, it's right, so why would you want to, yeah, now here's the thing, I go and speak to the banks, and I'm like, I need to speak to your senior banker, oh yeah, okay, come in on this day, going on that day, and they give you the senior banker, he doesn't know what the hell you're talking about, I said, who's your senior banker, oh well, he'd be in on this, you know, you got to go to this other branch, I go to that branch, and he doesn't know what I'm talking about, who's your senior banker, and they give me an address, it's an office building, whatever, and then completely outside of a regular bank setting, and you go talk to him, and all he's interested in is how many people you talked about these things or asked prior, and he doesn't even know what you're talking about, because they don't, he knows a little bit of it, a little bit, he wants to, he was so curious of how many people I brought this up with prior in his organization, do you think you're going to be working for the IRS or bank for whatever, 30 bucks an hour, I don't know what they're paying, I don't know, if you know how the hell the money system works, you can't sit there in good conscience and work there, no, I couldn't, right, so anyway, it's not unlawful, what they're doing is even legal, because you agree to it, constitution says there'll be legislature will make no law that interferes in the agreements of contracts, but they're doing a lot more than just making a contract, but anyway, well, go on, what's the question, I don't even think we breached the question, oh, well, back to it, let me see if I can get it, I was doing other things here, yeah, let me see, where is it, Greece said, what's a pocket selling in, no, no, that's the wrong one, hold on, I know it's here, it's in one of these, let's see, that's fine, let's do another one, and we'll come up to it again, okay, well, this is the only, this is like the last one that I had in mind, anyway, I wanted to see if we could end with this, because this is a little bit of a winding road, Old Testament, King Nebuchadnezzar was cast into the wilderness and became as a wild beast eating grass, because he didn't recognize the Most High, and the Most High said that he controls the affairs of men and all the kingdoms of the earth. In the New Testament, Satan takes up Yeshua up to the highest mountain and shows him all the kings of the earth, and Satan said to Yeshua, worship me, and I'll give you all these kingdoms, are we dealing with two entities that rule the affairs of men and control kingdoms? Two entities, the same office, if you look at the New Testament Christ says, I'll protect you from the evil one, one who does evil, if you look in Jeremiah, Yahweh says, has evil ever fallen on a city that I have not brought? Yeah, they're the same one, essentially, it's the same office. In the book of Job, in Yahweh's counsel, who do they see walking around, and they ask him, what are you doing? Who, who do they see? Satan, right, yeah, he's hanging out, same office, like the bankers, right, or whatever, so, yeah, you got a problem with that? Now, most people will say, well, that sounds like Satanism, then, no, it's not, and you should understand, like, for example, Satanism is in the same category as Christianity, what a joke, what a joke, you know, Christianity is a joke, by the way, right, it's a joke, it's the kind of joke that doesn't even have a punchline that people sit around and listen to, right, Satanism is the opposite of Christianity, they'll tell you that, yeah, they make a little more sense, actually, I don't endorse that, because it's dumb, just like Christianity is dumb, I mean, really dumb, and it's actually dumb, which is like, you know, third level, so, but it's there to flag you, once you pick one of these religions, they know that they don't have to invest in a control apparatus anymore, and you cannot pose a threat model that they can't overcome, right, so, no, I would say that once you understand the office of the Most High, you understand, because look, let's go back and let's massage this, right, the fallen angels, why are they fallen? Because they left their original habitation, what was that? Right? So, it's a political thing, if you're politically favorite, you're a good god or an angel, if you're politically, you did something that made you politically unpopular, right, you're a demon, so, yeah, stay away from politics.

Yeah, that's what they do now, I mean, there's, you know, no longer any nuance at all in political discourse, it's just, nope, they're the enemy, they're evil, that's it. Well, just like John C. Lilly said, he said, don't get into the super pleasurable, because then it'll grab you, and you want to keep doing it, right, because it's pleasurable, and don't get into the really negative shit, because it's just negative, right, it's just destructive. Somewhere in the middle, there's a Buddhist principle on that, or some ancient philosophical principles, in Greek, parmetro ariston, like median, be in the middle, and do it well, and then you can, right, so, yeah, I think people, I think I've given enough on this stuff, you know, like people, I'm a Yahwehist, right, I do use those laws, because any law you want to follow on the surface of the earth is based on that Old Testament stuff, or similar to, right, so, if you understand law, you know your rights, right, then you can operate here, and when you have to apply force, you know why you're applying force, because everything else has been exhausted, right, so I think it's worthwhile knowing those things, but I never said Yahweh was a good guy, I never did, when did you ever hear me say that, right, I just know the rules.
