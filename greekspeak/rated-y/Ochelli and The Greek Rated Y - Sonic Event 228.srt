1
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:11,200
Okay, so rated Y, I think it's 228,

2
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,300
but I don't know.

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:12,780
Who knows?

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:13,940
Maybe I'm losing count.

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,720
Anyway, here we are.

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,120
And how are you tonight, Greg?

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,080
Yeah, how are you is a good question,

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:21,520
isn't it?

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,680
Everyone always asks that.

10
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,780
No one really whatever wants the answer, do

11
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:25,040
they?

12
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,240
Well, nobody takes that into account.

13
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,360
And I got to tell you, one of

14
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,220
the weird questions I got this week, which

15
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,780
I don't fully understand, actually begins on a

16
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,060
how are you sort of question.

17
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,500
Because look, emo work, you've discussed it in

18
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,280
earlier Sonics, right?

19
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,440
And that is definitely one of those things

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,440
that everybody uses to judge how they are

21
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,560
when you say how are you?

22
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:47,700
Well, I'm happy.

23
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,700
I'm sad is usually part of that question

24
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,280
if they bother to say anything.

25
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:52,960
Right?

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,940
So anyway, yeah, what that's, that's really a

27
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,060
big how are you is, is, I don't

28
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,060
think that could ever really be answered, right?

29
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,319
But that that's okay.

30
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,620
It's, it's, it's what they call a nicety.

31
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:07,380
Right?

32
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,240
And they're in, by the way, in Japan

33
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,780
and Bushido, they don't ask that at all.

34
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,340
In Japanese called traditional probably probably do.

35
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,200
Now you know how I say what, if

36
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,520
you want to know the country's been like

37
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,580
USA, you Sonian?

38
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:19,800
Yeah.

39
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,260
Frank Lloyd Wright, the architect, he wanted to

40
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,860
create you Sonia, which is USA.

41
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,920
And then you know, another country within it.

42
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,340
Okay, culture.

43
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,680
And if the country has Levi's years ago,

44
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,260
I used to ask, do they have leave?

45
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,760
Can you buy Levi jeans in Japan?

46
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,120
They're like, yeah, okay, then it's becoming Americanized,

47
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,400
right?

48
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,740
But anyway, back to the email.

49
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,620
Yeah, email, big stuff, man.

50
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,800
I've been working on it, doing some new

51
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,460
findings with it, especially with weather work and

52
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,960
the water work.

53
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,600
Yeah, remember, you know, that you can never

54
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,300
find anything new on that.

55
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,440
Because remember, in the 70s, they had this

56
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,420
thing called a mood ring.

57
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,420
Oh, yes.

58
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:59,080
Right.

59
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,080
It was just a heat sensitive film.

60
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,840
And it was it was relevant.

61
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,620
It was relevant.

62
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,500
And you know, it turned red and orange,

63
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,000
and it turned blue and green, right?

64
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,700
So yeah, I was always one of those.

65
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,620
Yeah, I was always one of those kids

66
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,140
where the mood ring didn't change.

67
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,600
A lot of times when I put it

68
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,320
on everybody else.

69
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,320
Oh, look, I make it green.

70
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:19,940
I make it blue.

71
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,320
And I would put it on and be

72
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,520
like, yeah, it's just stayed the same.

73
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,400
A lot of times.

74
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,640
It's temperate temperature.

75
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,440
Yeah.

76
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,120
Anyway, temperature sensor.

77
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,680
So So back to the thing.

78
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:36,120
Anyway, that's sorry, that reminds me that this

79
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,360
has been looked at forever.

80
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,520
Yeah, the email thing, but it's just never

81
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,020
openly discussed like we are.

82
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,140
So anyway, right.

83
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,560
Well, somebody is working with it.

84
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,420
Okay, I'm just gonna give you that context

85
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,820
for the long part until they get to

86
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,340
the question.

87
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,840
And they've been working with it.

88
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,300
And they were curious, is there a particular

89
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,760
best default or starting time of day, comma

90
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,720
state of mind?

91
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,480
Or is this kind of work a fully

92
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,160
loaded, energetic, or fully unloaded energetic best activity?

93
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,300
So we're going all over the place with

94
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,480
this question, but I think you understand none

95
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:07,980
of that.

96
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,560
Okay, none of that scratch all that.

97
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,560
No, it's none of that.

98
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,380
Well, I was going to go back to

99
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,480
the early discussions.

100
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,600
Yeah, yeah.

101
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,900
Well, I was thinking it's like asking quick.

102
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,540
Oh, I'm sorry.

103
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,080
Yeah, it's a bodily foot.

104
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,640
That's fine.

105
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,460
The echoes coming back and went away.

106
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,720
I got used to it not being there.

107
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,500
Yeah, whenever I'm on this stupid rectangle, the

108
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,720
known as the iPhone, an earlier iPhone, it

109
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,380
gets an echo.

110
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,000
So no, the, the the purpose of discussing

111
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,280
the emo is because it's an attribute that

112
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:36,800
we have.

113
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,540
It's a sense.

114
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,240
So it's more than a sense.

115
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,140
It's what would you call an ability that

116
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,820
we have just like walking, and all these

117
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,940
other things that we do.

118
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,740
And it's never been acknowledged.

119
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,120
It won't be by the system.

120
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,280
The current system is a system of control.

121
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,340
Don't want you to know anything.

122
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,800
You might back me up on this.

123
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,100
Maybe I don't I know I wasn't hallucinating.

124
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,740
But more than once, I've seen a quote,

125
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,500
an ex director of the CIA says that

126
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,140
you are our job is done when everything

127
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,500
the American public believes is a lie, right?

128
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,340
Am I close or off?

129
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,500
No, absolutely true.

130
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,540
William Colby is most often attributed with that

131
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,620
quote, but others have been given a similar

132
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:13,960
quote.

133
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,180
And it's exactly the same.

134
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,360
Here's the funny thing about this emo thing,

135
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,519
though, to me, is as you describe it

136
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,880
as one of those abilities, then one could

137
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,840
kind of conversely ask themselves, when is the

138
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,020
best time to walk then?

139
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:26,760
Right?

140
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,280
It is all situational.

141
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,360
So it appears to me as though, you

142
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,460
know, their question, they should be able to

143
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,420
answer it, they're going to find that things

144
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,540
are situational as to when it's best to

145
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,620
do certain things, right?

146
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,480
It's not always a good idea to run.

147
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,220
It's not always a good idea to walk.

148
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,420
But in certain situations, that's the only thing.

149
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,740
Yeah, good.

150
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,600
So well, here's the thing, the most effective

151
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,560
use of emo is when you don't know

152
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,980
you're effectively using it.

153
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:56,220
A very strong desire to help someone afar,

154
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:56,760
right?

155
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,520
People say send healing energy, you will actually

156
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,160
feel that hug, just like when you gesture

157
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,420
a hug or get a hug, there's an

158
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,860
emotional feel a body feel that you have,

159
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:06,280
right?

160
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,960
An emotional, physical feeling you have.

161
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,120
And you'll notice that if you really desperately

162
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,600
just cry out to whatever, it'll be similar

163
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,320
to that.

164
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,160
Right?

165
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,980
So just like the guarding, when you guard

166
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,940
yourself, just desperately cry, you're trying to guard

167
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,920
yourself, it will come out, it'll be very

168
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,900
similar to when you're accused of something that

169
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,640
you didn't do, or it's even stronger if

170
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,500
you're accused of something that you did do

171
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,200
and deny.

172
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,420
Denial is very powerful, very powerful, by the

173
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:35,680
way.

174
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,180
Yes.

175
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,640
So you're gonna most people are using this

176
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,220
is nothing.

177
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,040
I'm just saying take control.

178
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,800
It's kind of like with the contracts, right?

179
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,580
You know, I see banks don't lend money,

180
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,540
you know, they just take your instrument, get

181
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,540
it cashed, and then turn it into a

182
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:49,780
loan.

183
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,100
Oh, my gosh, you know, do a read

184
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,740
your contract says it very plainly.

185
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,800
And let's see.

186
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,600
The most very plain.

187
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,620
Yeah, let's see if it's very, very plain.

188
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,400
Yes, please.

189
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,080
Let's see if I've learned something here, then

190
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,780
let me try and help this question real

191
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,140
fast.

192
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,360
Last thing, and then we'll move on.

193
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,140
Anybody could think about this and say they've

194
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,900
already experienced the use of emo, with people

195
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,260
not realizing it, you walk into a room,

196
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,680
and there is somebody who does have an

197
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,800
aura about them that they actually just put

198
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,080
out.

199
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,540
And it does change the room, right?

200
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,300
Yeah, everybody's been in an experience where somebody

201
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,560
comes in, they change the dynamic of the

202
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,260
room, simply by who they are, what they're

203
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:32,100
projecting the emo that they're actually carrying with

204
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,940
them, knowingly or otherwise.

205
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,740
And that's just the way it is.

206
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,360
And you notice when you're in the presence

207
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,440
of people without them doing a thing without

208
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,560
them saying a thing.

209
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,860
They are projecting already because of exactly this

210
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,180
thing.

211
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,320
And all you're saying is that you can

212
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,940
be conscious of it and take control of

213
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,060
it.

214
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:51,980
Am I right or wrong?

215
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:52,500
Right?

216
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,820
Okay, exactly.

217
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,680
And you could test it, you can test

218
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,080
it just like with the weather work, just

219
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,140
don't go out and start swinging devices around

220
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,800
and see if there's a change engineer it

221
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,340
say like, well, we're gonna do this this

222
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,180
way, because it'll make rain and look, there's

223
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,580
no rain in the forecast, right?

224
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,300
Or we're gonna do this and stop the

225
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,920
rain, because there is rain in the forecast.

226
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,420
So it's engineering, like recently, I was out,

227
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,660
and there were these two women, and it

228
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,860
was the typical American woman dialogue where one

229
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,060
is speaking, and the other one's looking at

230
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,180
the other one saying, when is she going

231
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,500
to shut up so I can speak?

232
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,340
Right, right.

233
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,380
And, and then the other one speaks on

234
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,640
the ones like, when is this bitch gonna

235
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,100
shut up so I can speak right?

236
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,060
And I was like, Oh, I'm gonna make

237
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,900
this this one go to the bathroom real

238
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,940
bad in a panic.

239
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,040
So the first thing I did was, regardless

240
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,820
if it's a pool, a beach, a bathtub,

241
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,560
when you know, when you first immerse yourself

242
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,620
in warm water, there's an emotional reaction because

243
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,340
the water is electrically charged, you know, it

244
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:47,980
grounds you.

245
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,540
And even take an extreme example of the

246
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,740
power of water, what happens if you're in

247
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,060
water in a blow dryer or toaster falls

248
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:56,660
in it, right?

249
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,620
So without a GFI, right protection, so you

250
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,340
get electrocuted.

251
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,040
So the all water that you jump in

252
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,400
will have an electrical reaction.

253
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,220
So what I did was I combined the

254
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,260
emotional feeling of going into a warm bath

255
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,940
with an electrical shock around the bladder.

256
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,500
And she was like, I waited and said,

257
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,340
Oh, it didn't do anything.

258
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,440
I waited about 30 seconds.

259
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,320
It didn't do anything.

260
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,300
Yeah, I'm gonna try it again.

261
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,360
As soon as I said, let me run

262
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,520
through that cycle again.

263
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,980
So is there a bathroom here?

264
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,360
I got to use the bathroom.

265
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,340
And I said, God, let's put this bitch

266
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:29,940
in a panic.

267
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,260
She goes, Where's the bathroom?

268
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,299
You know, I don't believe they don't have

269
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:34,080
any signs here.

270
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,440
Where are the signs for the bathroom?

271
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,360
Fine.

272
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:37,000
I need some help.

273
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,580
Where's the bathroom?

274
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:38,900
Oh, wow.

275
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:39,679
Wow.

276
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,299
Wow.

277
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:40,799
Is it Greek?

278
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,500
You're a jerk.

279
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,280
Greek, you are such a jerk.

280
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,840
So the weak minded, right?

281
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,640
Just like in Star Wars.

282
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,660
These are not the drones you're looking for.

283
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,020
You're free to go.

284
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,160
We're free.

285
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,420
You know, whatever is true is that's the

286
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:55,700
best.

287
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,400
That's the best thing I had a movie

288
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,200
that ever showed.

289
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,860
You can do it, especially with the quote

290
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,900
unquote, weak spirited.

291
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,560
You know, that was very weak spirited.

292
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,460
That always kind of pissed me off about

293
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,380
the whole Jedi mind trick thing.

294
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,280
It only really seems to work on the

295
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,520
weak minded with the Jedis.

296
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,960
You notice that like it never works on

297
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,080
the bad guys.

298
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,220
It's like those guys are always very determined,

299
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,100
very clear minded.

300
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,080
Exactly.

301
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,260
So that means it'll work on 99 percent

302
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,040
of your family, 99 percent of your friends,

303
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,640
99 percent of your coworkers, 99 percent, 99

304
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,040
.9 percent of people around you.

305
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:29,840
Yeah, you stole my.

306
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,000
So that's that's pretty good.

307
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:31,700
I got you.

308
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,200
That's some pretty good odds, though.

309
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,200
No, in real life, that's pretty good odds.

310
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,500
It's good odds in real life.

311
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,640
But you're killing me because you stole my

312
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,100
punchline.

313
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:39,680
But that's OK.

314
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,340
Let's move on to some other.

315
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,020
That's fine.

316
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,640
It's OK.

317
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,140
Let's move on to some weird random stuff,

318
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,600
which is has the Greek ever heard of

319
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,060
German new medicine?

320
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,040
I don't even know what that is, frankly,

321
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,540
but German new medicine.

322
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,820
Is that a particular thing?

323
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,220
Yeah.

324
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,740
But if you if you hear anything coming

325
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:01,000
out of German or Japan, pay attention because,

326
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,620
you know, the whole system is based on

327
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,620
stupidity and control.

328
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,920
I just I was shocked.

329
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,840
I was sitting down having some beef tacos

330
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,420
that I made.

331
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,620
I did a bunch of New York strip

332
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:12,580
steaks yesterday and stovetop potatoes.

333
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,340
You know how I just put tears with

334
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,820
carrots and onions and cooked enough, like five

335
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,980
pounds of everything just so I don't have

336
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,540
to cook for the next few days.

337
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,280
And it's really good.

338
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:24,020
Leftovers are eaten cold or are great also.

339
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,040
So I made some beef tacos and I

340
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,280
sat down, put on a YouTube beef street

341
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,720
tacos, Mexico, OK?

342
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,340
And these ads come on.

343
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,820
And I told Linda, I said, are these

344
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,220
ads getting addressing like, in other words, the

345
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,920
vocabulary, the demeanor, the the way that the

346
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,440
message is delivered is dumber and dumber and

347
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:42,760
dumber.

348
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,540
Like not only are they speaking to immature

349
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,540
children, but like dumb children.

350
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:48,340
Right.

351
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,940
I'm like, whoa, this is really bad.

352
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,260
And then another ad comes on different products

353
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,000
and it's all really, really dumb.

354
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,640
Are we being dumbed down?

355
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,780
And the control structure requires, in other words,

356
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,780
what's coming requires such a juvenile mindset and

357
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,840
dumb mindset that's even worse than it's ever

358
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,100
been.

359
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,380
Wow.

360
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:07,400
Yeah.

361
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,140
Right.

362
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,140
So, yeah, that's what's coming.

363
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,920
So anyway, I do derail the question there.

364
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,840
What was the question?

365
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:14,600
Oh, yeah.

366
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,860
German new medicine.

367
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,620
Is that a you know, where has the

368
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,520
have you ever heard of it?

369
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:18,920
Was there.

370
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,120
Yeah, that's that's where that's that's where I

371
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,460
was like, if you hear anything coming out

372
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,780
of Japan or Germany, pay attention.

373
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,920
But I hope they're not.

374
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,540
Oh, my gosh.

375
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,720
The thing that really breaks my heart.

376
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,160
I know Americans are dumb.

377
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,800
Most people who Southern Europeans are dumb.

378
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,340
But when you talk about I feel my

379
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:36,920
heart's broken.

380
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,540
I hear they're dumbing down the Germans and

381
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,320
the Japanese.

382
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:40,240
Right.

383
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,540
But anyway, because those for those people, those

384
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,600
two groups, by the way, are for the

385
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,440
past two centuries are the ones that really

386
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,060
provided a lot of the technological, let's say,

387
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,620
not the actual technology invention and devices, but

388
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,320
the wherewithal to have them built in a

389
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,380
fine in a way that, you know, the

390
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,780
product lasts, let's say.

391
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:58,520
Right.

392
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,940
And a good engineering.

393
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:00,520
Right.

394
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,520
Because most of the inventions are American, let's

395
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,820
say, or non Japanese or German.

396
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,640
But they're produced by Japanese and German and

397
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,180
refined.

398
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,020
Right.

399
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,940
So I hate my heart.

400
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,360
I just my heart goes out to those

401
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,180
people because that means we're really screwed now.

402
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,260
And when made it right.

403
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,460
So gotcha.

404
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,540
Anyway, it used to be made in made

405
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,400
in junk.

406
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,860
And then it went to like, wow, made

407
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,080
in Japan now is excellent.

408
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:25,420
Right.

409
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,940
And and whatever.

410
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:28,540
Anyway.

411
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:29,340
Yeah.

412
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,620
It just I never heard of it.

413
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,800
But I'm just saying it's if put it

414
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,380
this way, from my point of view, my

415
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,800
book, if it's German medicine, you should look

416
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,200
into it.

417
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:37,460
Yeah.

418
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:38,340
OK.

419
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:38,920
Excellent.

420
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:39,820
I don't know it.

421
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,560
I never heard of it.

422
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,320
Never heard of it.

423
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,240
Fair enough.

424
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,280
But but indeed, I mean, that would be

425
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,920
something new, though, for sure, because, you know,

426
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,600
as you said, there hasn't been any changes

427
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,360
in things like medicine in, you know, 200

428
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,180
years, pretty much.

429
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:56,960
So, you know, because, well, the teens, 120,

430
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,220
they dumbed it down, because if you listen

431
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,020
carefully, I say people learn how to read

432
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,920
with comprehension, listen with comprehension.

433
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,120
What I mean by that is you want

434
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,240
to treat something.

435
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,220
All they do is treat something, treat the

436
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,180
symptoms, treat the symptoms, treat the symptoms.

437
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,620
It's never about fixing you or being unsecure.

438
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,720
It means you're going to stay sick.

439
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,980
You're just not going to feel or look

440
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,300
sick.

441
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:17,560
Right.

442
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,060
So, yeah, Flexner, Flexner reports.

443
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,840
That's why I tell people there's no more

444
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,600
medical research because the Flexner report was was

445
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,140
adopted as medical standard and said that only

446
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:32,140
current medical standards will be applied when that

447
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,240
was 1912, 13, 14, 15, whatever.

448
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,100
So everything else is retarded, which which I

449
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,140
do know people in the medical field that

450
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:39,940
try to get patents.

451
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,020
And it's like, oh, my gosh, try to

452
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:42,860
get a medical patent.

453
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,380
I'm talking about not pharmaceuticals because they wrapped

454
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:48,320
up with the inner sanctum of the patent

455
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,280
office and all that.

456
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,940
I'm talking about just some guy practicing what

457
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,760
he has a device.

458
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,340
And I know someone like, for example, most

459
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,600
ER cases, people that come into emergency room

460
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,620
have a displaced hip.

461
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:00,200
Right.

462
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,400
The femur comes out of the the socket

463
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,340
out of the hip bone.

464
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:03,880
Oh, yeah.

465
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,320
And they have to pop that back in.

466
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,960
It's one of these unusual things like like

467
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,560
half the people that go to ER, especially

468
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,360
at night, have that.

469
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,480
And he and usually it takes an orderly

470
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,920
and two people, three people to set it

471
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,420
back in.

472
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,900
And he developed a device that one doctor

473
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,420
can do it.

474
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,560
One medic can do it.

475
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,880
So and it's been like 15 years and

476
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,040
they won't issue him a patent.

477
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,500
And it works really.

478
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,300
But anyway, that would be useful to speed

479
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,320
up that process, because otherwise you've got to

480
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,200
direct multiple people to do it right.

481
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,740
And and I've done that, you know, with

482
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,500
somebody before I've had my own shoulder.

483
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,480
My shoulder redone is even a pain in

484
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:39,760
the neck.

485
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,620
Well, this is this is hip and femur.

486
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,220
I had also.

487
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:42,540
Yeah.

488
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,160
Yeah.

489
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,980
What they do is they had me stand

490
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,800
outside and you could see something's wrong because

491
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,440
you look at your reflection yourself and you're

492
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,600
two inches lower on the side.

493
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,920
They came out and you're like, oh, that

494
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,980
looks weird and I can't move it.

495
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:54,740
And it's numb.

496
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,160
And the orderlies come says before you see

497
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,760
the doctor, we're just going to pull your

498
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,760
arm on three and they go one and

499
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,200
two and they pull it on to.

500
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:02,680
Right.

501
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,220
Right.

502
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,380
So.

503
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:04,820
Yeah.

504
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,100
So anyway.

505
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:06,620
Yeah.

506
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,900
Well, that's that's actually an effective way to

507
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,320
do it, though.

508
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,640
Anyway, would appreciate insight into the difference of

509
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,380
using a translator.

510
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,000
Now, look, in parentheses, they put no water

511
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,660
versus a water gun, whether assuming the devices

512
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,340
are the same exact material and dimensions.

513
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,880
I recall there is a tunneling effect when

514
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,000
using a water powered device.

515
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,960
That's their whole question, by the way.

516
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,610
I need more information on what it means

517
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:43,390
by tunnel effect, because when I did the

518
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:46,570
weather seminar I spoke on, I'm paraphrasing, I

519
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,970
might have used these exact terms that water

520
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:51,470
gun is a disintegrating ray put on any

521
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:54,350
sci fi cartoon or Star Trek disintegrating ray.

522
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:54,990
Right.

523
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,850
Whatever you point the water gun to, it's

524
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:58,810
a disintegrating ray.

525
00:15:58,890 --> 00:15:59,710
It goes away.

526
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:00,610
Right.

527
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,490
It's like an eraser.

528
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:04,130
There was an old Looney Tunes cartoon where

529
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,710
they show the guy with an eraser right

530
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:06,750
on the cartoon character.

531
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,190
So that's what it does.

532
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:11,290
The water, the translator, the dry translator is

533
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:14,010
not that you want the translator to be

534
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,710
built in a way where it represents a

535
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:18,330
lower ethereal potential than its environment.

536
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,730
So it feeds the environment.

537
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:19,970
Right.

538
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:20,890
Because low to high.

539
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,390
So I don't know what the tunneling effect

540
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:27,050
is, but someone recently asked me about the

541
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:29,250
health benefits and whatever on the water gun.

542
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,550
And I do have testimonials on this.

543
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:33,630
A strong water gun or well grounded with

544
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:36,110
good water flow can be used as a

545
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,630
temporary pain reducer.

546
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,070
Like if you have a bad toothache.

547
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:39,390
Right.

548
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:42,070
And it's two in the morning or, you

549
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,470
know, soreness or whatever.

550
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:43,730
Yeah.

551
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:46,370
I used to go out, you know, maybe

552
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,670
I could save the tooth and it hurts

553
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,210
real bad, you know, just now it's just

554
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:49,750
extracted.

555
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,330
But then it was like a turn on

556
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,950
the water gun, put my face about six

557
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,290
inches from it in 10 seconds.

558
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:55,110
The pain is gone.

559
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:55,370
Right.

560
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,450
And it stays gone for a while.

561
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:58,670
Right.

562
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,950
So, well, yeah, that's interesting.

563
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,890
I mean, I've seen a native person do

564
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:07,170
the thing with the stone, which is which

565
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,349
is interesting as well.

566
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,770
I think that's a magnetic consideration and it

567
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:13,930
does actually alleviate the pain temporarily as well.

568
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,890
Well, you have the if it concentrates the

569
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:18,390
ether.

570
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:19,170
Yeah.

571
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:22,310
It will result in a lower potential feeding

572
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:22,829
the ether.

573
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:26,170
If it disperses the ether, it results in

574
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,050
a higher potential.

575
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:27,910
It'll make a hole.

576
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:28,310
Right.

577
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:29,330
That's what the water does.

578
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:30,730
So, yeah.

579
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:31,210
Yeah.

580
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,590
I really don't know.

581
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,410
I just know if I how many times

582
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:37,030
I push this member, push this button, this

583
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:37,350
happens.

584
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,070
That's all I know.

585
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:38,350
Right.

586
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:39,770
It's not that bad.

587
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,490
But we do know we do know it

588
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:44,070
requires grounding water and layering.

589
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:44,570
Right.

590
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,770
So so just specifically message to that listener,

591
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,950
Joe, a little more information, maybe.

592
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,850
And we'll definitely readdress this question.

593
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:53,650
Thank you.

594
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,190
Specifically on tunneling.

595
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,770
I've heard your turn term is used often

596
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,050
and I don't know how he wants to

597
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:00,650
use it here.

598
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,430
OK, the tunneling term.

599
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:03,430
Fair enough.

600
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,410
So I've only got one more piece here

601
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,470
and it is could the Greek explain why

602
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:10,710
a 15 minute nap can recharge us when

603
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:11,630
dead tired?

604
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,690
Now, that could be an interesting question of

605
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:15,130
itself.

606
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,070
But what is it about this 15?

607
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:18,830
Because it's not like, you know, we're set

608
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:19,570
on a clock here.

609
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:19,990
Exactly.

610
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,730
But what about the short nap and the

611
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:25,090
fact because it seems to me like a

612
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,470
lot of what's done in sleep.

613
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,130
Yes, it's great to get, you know, a

614
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:29,090
good amount of sleep.

615
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,810
But a lot of that time may be

616
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,490
wasted because the process is all that's required

617
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:36,730
as opposed to the rest to reset certain

618
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:37,110
things.

619
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,810
That's my answer to that.

620
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:41,490
But you might have a better one as

621
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:42,590
far as why is he made?

622
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,290
Two reasons.

623
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,250
It's not as physical as it is mental.

624
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,790
Like if you really take a bonafide nap,

625
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,370
which means you're out like a light, you're

626
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:51,950
not conscious.

627
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,350
You might even go into a dream state.

628
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:56,450
Your consciousness pops in somewhere else.

629
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:57,690
It's being used somewhere else.

630
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:00,230
And what happens there and when you come

631
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:03,090
back is whether or not you are refreshed

632
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:03,450
or not.

633
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,930
Like, for example, lately, when I take a

634
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,610
15 minute nap, I come back and I'm

635
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:08,390
totally drained.

636
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,690
And the first thing that goes in my

637
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,230
mind, where the hell did they take me?

638
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:12,890
Right, right.

639
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:15,190
So for example, if you take a 15

640
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,870
minute nap and you go to another world

641
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:19,030
where you're getting a massage and you have

642
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,330
a semi athletic Latin call girl rubbing your

643
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:25,550
feet or whatever, you might come back refreshed,

644
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:25,910
right?

645
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,910
But if they send you in another world

646
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,470
where they give you a lightsaber and you

647
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,410
have to fight Darth Vader or whatever, you

648
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,210
come back and you're like, shit, now I

649
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:34,970
have sleep inertia.

650
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,570
I need two more hours, right?

651
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:37,410
Oh, yeah.

652
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:40,270
So the physical, the physical part.

653
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,030
Yeah, you know, if you don't sleep, what

654
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,810
is it about seven days, you can die.

655
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,470
It's even less than that more like four

656
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:46,830
or five.

657
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,410
Actually, I was on a meth trip once

658
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:49,750
for three days, I remember.

659
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,050
And anyway, I didn't even know what it

660
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:53,270
was.

661
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,150
I was at a party.

662
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:57,890
And these two guys, these guys, anyway, they

663
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:59,550
market NASCAR stuff.

664
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:02,550
I didn't know that it's like $13 billion

665
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,390
a year.

666
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,530
You know, a long time ago, it's amazing

667
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,470
how much money is in some things that

668
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,530
people don't think of much, you know, it's

669
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,130
like, well, that can't possibly make a lot

670
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:12,470
of money.

671
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:13,950
And there is a lot of money and

672
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:17,390
things like I'm amazed sometimes that exactly my

673
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,210
gosh, but I've seen that I've seen the

674
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,070
hats and the jackets, they're very expensive.

675
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:24,370
But anyway, so he they bought these two

676
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,270
mansions next to each other and combine them

677
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:28,130
and made one big complex and the strippers

678
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,730
here, everything closes at 2 a.m. So

679
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,430
they would go and hire everything closes at

680
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,430
2 a.m. I don't know where you

681
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:34,590
are.

682
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:35,930
They're like 2 a.m., 1 a.m.,

683
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:36,450
something like that.

684
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,450
Also, not like New York.

685
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,770
Yeah, no, anything other than like New York.

686
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,190
New York's a whole other experience.

687
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:44,930
But everywhere else in the country, two o

688
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,450
'clock in the morning is usually your dead

689
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:47,750
limit, no matter where you are.

690
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:48,710
Maybe Vegas.

691
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:49,590
Yeah, it was a deadline.

692
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,900
So so they would ferry these these sorry,

693
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,880
Vegas isn't.

694
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,960
Well, I'm sure there's lots of places, you

695
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,580
know, but not not I can even imagine.

696
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,560
Well, you know, in northern Europe, Stockholm and

697
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,220
Netherlands, you know, Germany.

698
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,180
But yeah, they have this thing.

699
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,360
So anyway, they put this.

700
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,780
Yes, I show up and I see these

701
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,880
half naked women walking everywhere and like, oh,

702
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,240
these are strippers we bring up here or

703
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:14,440
whatever.

704
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,200
So this guy comes through the door and

705
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,660
he opens his brown paper bag and he

706
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,620
starts handing stuff out.

707
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,560
Everybody's looking at it.

708
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,080
A little baggies is all.

709
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:21,860
Let's try it right now.

710
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,860
So he walks up to the bathroom vanity.

711
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,500
We're in one of the bedrooms.

712
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,440
You know, those big globe lights that they

713
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,520
have on bathroom vanities.

714
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,220
Oh, yeah.

715
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,120
You know, the big, like cosmetic lamp.

716
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,240
It's a light bulb.

717
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,080
It's just a big glass bulb with a

718
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,200
little filament, like twenty five watts or whatever.

719
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,380
It looks like a big round one, like

720
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,020
the big round balls they used to get

721
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,080
all the way around a mirror, like for

722
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,240
makeup mirrors and backstage, old, old backstage mirrors.

723
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,320
Yeah, exactly.

724
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,160
But a non non frosty one.

725
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,060
She unscrews a bulb.

726
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,060
I say, what the hell?

727
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,900
And he breaks off the stem, dumps the

728
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,920
stuff out, puts this pinkish colored powder in

729
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,000
there and lights it with a lighter.

730
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,960
And everybody's passing around inhaling it.

731
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:01,700
And I'm like, take some.

732
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,620
Like, what the hell is it?

733
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,400
Just take some.

734
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,140
Oh, yeah.

735
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:04,540
Right.

736
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,740
And I'm like, what the hell is this?

737
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,100
Right.

738
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:10,120
So it's like burnt plastic.

739
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,560
Right.

740
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,300
And I'm like, you guys are just out

741
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,240
of control, man.

742
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:13,780
You guys are.

743
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,580
This is, you know, whatever goes in.

744
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,840
And just people just kept coming over.

745
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,140
And I'm not going to mention.

746
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,800
Actually, no, I'm not going to mention who

747
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,180
was there.

748
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,380
And I usually do mention them.

749
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:23,600
Right.

750
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,500
Let's just say local politicians, children.

751
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,140
Right.

752
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:27,580
Boy.

753
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:28,260
Yeah.

754
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,180
Like senators, like senators, children.

755
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,980
So that's why I want to.

756
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,100
I think, by the way, this is getting

757
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,980
off years ago, back in twenty fifteen or

758
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:38,120
so.

759
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,740
I think when we stopped, Ocelli in the

760
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,440
Greek says, how are you doing?

761
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,020
This is I'm working with this woman.

762
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,400
She's a Korean businesswoman.

763
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,960
And she just left Hunter by the vice

764
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,500
president's house in Florida.

765
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,500
Hunter Biden.

766
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,200
He's a real nut job.

767
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:50,640
Yeah.

768
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,020
Twenty fifteen, twenty sixteen.

769
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,340
I do remember that.

770
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,220
And I remember thinking of you every time

771
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,460
the laptop was brought up, like I was

772
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,700
wondering, are you in any of those pictures?

773
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,460
Because you could have been there just around.

774
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,380
No, I was there.

775
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,740
But she she she went to go visit

776
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,180
to do some business stuff because you go

777
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,220
with water, believe it or not.

778
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,860
And he says, I don't care about this.

779
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,260
Come on, take your clothes off and do

780
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:13,840
this and do that.

781
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,320
And she came back shocked.

782
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,820
She's no, I don't bother with the vice

783
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,120
president.

784
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:17,960
So there's a total free.

785
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,640
I think I reason I'm bringing this up

786
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,080
on the side, because I remember discussing or

787
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,120
bringing it up to you.

788
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:23,440
Yeah.

789
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,720
The vice president's son.

790
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,420
And then later on, we see a 10.

791
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:26,900
What is it?

792
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,440
Ten years later or nine, eight, eight, nine

793
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:30,940
years later.

794
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,500
And I'm like, oh, I knew about that.

795
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:33,280
Yeah.

796
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,280
First, not first and second hand.

797
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,580
Yeah, it was like eight years.

798
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,200
That's why I cracked up when I first

799
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,000
started hearing about the laptop, because not every

800
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,620
picture in the laptop is him with a

801
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,560
crack pipe dressed in, you know, women's clothing.

802
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,580
There are some regular pictures of just people

803
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,040
coming in and out of his place and

804
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:48,600
stuff like that.

805
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,000
I mean, I'm not talking about the laptop

806
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,480
or whatever.

807
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,960
That's normal because people take pictures all the

808
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,280
time with these digital devices.

809
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,680
If it wasn't a laptop, it would have

810
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,840
been a scrapbook film for digital devices.

811
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,960
People used absolutely developed film and put it

812
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,100
in a scrapbook or that.

813
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,400
No, actually, they didn't even do that.

814
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,760
Sorry if they were smart.

815
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,080
Kind of content.

816
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,760
Yeah, they were right.

817
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,100
Yeah.

818
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,160
It's all full rights.

819
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:11,520
Yeah.

820
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,340
Because you don't want photo viewing what you're

821
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:14,800
shooting.

822
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:15,260
Right.

823
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,740
The thing was that it was a total

824
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,780
degenerate.

825
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,440
And I was trying to bring that across

826
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,240
that because I've seen it also the level

827
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,600
of degeneracy and the people are supposedly authorities

828
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,740
because they're not really authorities.

829
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,600
They're only authorities because they took advantage of

830
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,440
the credit system.

831
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,160
And yeah, it's really bad.

832
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:35,960
It's really bad.

833
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,340
You and I like a private communication started

834
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,940
talking about how the sons and daughters of

835
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:44,160
a lot of these people are like really

836
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,160
out there as like, you know, like tornadoes

837
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,280
of debauchery.

838
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,760
I think that was what I said, because

839
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,160
it's always been that way.

840
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,860
It's always been that way.

841
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,260
But we talked about, you know, you ever

842
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,460
see the drug problem.

843
00:24:59,260 --> 00:24:59,660
Right.

844
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,940
You hear about drug problem recently or whatever.

845
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,760
And then you go back in the 60s.

846
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,100
Oh, they had a drug problem there.

847
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:05,380
Right.

848
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:05,700
Yeah.

849
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,700
In the 50s, they had a drug problem.

850
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,220
LSD was legal, by the way, when it

851
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,380
first when it was first put out, when

852
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:15,380
it passed the initial testing, it was legal

853
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,420
and prescribed right forms of LSD, lysergic acid

854
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,660
to housewife preferred to treat depression for a

855
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,060
short time.

856
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,280
I don't even think it was a year.

857
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,580
Well, everything goes.

858
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,580
Everything is until the government demands.

859
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,700
So it's everything is legal until the government

860
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,560
demands are cut.

861
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,180
I mean, cocaine and heroin were available for

862
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:36,840
sale right out in the open until what?

863
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,000
Sometime around the same time that they made

864
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,220
what alcohol legal.

865
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:41,520
Right.

866
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,080
I mean, it was almost the same time

867
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:43,320
period.

868
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,640
It's mixed mixed bag.

869
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,500
Remember that reefer madness propaganda movies, just like

870
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,020
they do propaganda movies that Arabs are terrorists

871
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,920
and all this other stuff.

872
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:56,360
But I'm talking cocaine was legal in 1901.

873
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,220
Cocaine was something you could buy.

874
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,980
Oh, in part.

875
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,680
Well, yeah, of course it was.

876
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,900
Well, it was Coca-Cola was famous.

877
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,360
It had it for a short time.

878
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,360
And people died from the issue of Coca

879
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,700
-Cola because, you know, it's a hell of

880
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,440
a drug, right?

881
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,920
Can't get enough of it.

882
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,000
Yeah, you really can't.

883
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,600
And the it was included in a pocket

884
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,440
theory, really.

885
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,120
There was a very big you could look

886
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,120
this up on morphine addiction in the eighteen

887
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:28,080
hundreds, the entire eighteen hundreds, especially after the

888
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,040
what you call the American Civil War, the

889
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,140
when all the insane asylums were built, were

890
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:32,440
built.

891
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:32,860
Oh, yeah.

892
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:36,100
The sanitarium, you know, massive sanitariums.

893
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:36,380
Yeah.

894
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:36,600
Yeah.

895
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,660
But here's the massive morphine addiction.

896
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,660
But it was so commonly sold.

897
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,860
And I brought this up to you many

898
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:42,220
times.

899
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,160
It was so commonly sold that products for

900
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,120
women were basically, you know, booze and morphine

901
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:47,760
in a bottle.

902
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,160
And it was there for what their period

903
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:50,600
cramps.

904
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,600
I mean, let's be blunt.

905
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,400
And that's what it was sold to them

906
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,020
as like this.

907
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,840
This is mama's little helper to make you

908
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,640
not feel so angry once a month.

909
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,980
I mean, yeah, everything before.

910
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,560
And before that, it was the opium.

911
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,120
Right.

912
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,700
You can go look at the opium wars

913
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,760
and all that other stuff.

914
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,820
And the opium goes all the way back

915
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,880
to Roman times because they had massive trade

916
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,120
with Asia and China.

917
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:13,840
Oh, yes.

918
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,640
And it's not really China.

919
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,780
It's Afghanistan.

920
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,340
And I think it could be grown in

921
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:19,660
Turkey.

922
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,500
It has to be a certain altitude and

923
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,260
a certain temperature.

924
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:22,900
Right.

925
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,980
That's why, you know, like, for example, the

926
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,540
coca plant has to be grown at high

927
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:26,960
altitude.

928
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,480
And when they were showing videos of the

929
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,700
war on drugs, burning the cocaine fields down

930
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,760
in Columbia on sea level, I was like,

931
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,320
that's all fake because you can only grow

932
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,480
the cocoa plant at three thousand or five

933
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,500
thousand feet and higher.

934
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:40,880
Right.

935
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,720
Just like when the covid stuff came out,

936
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,000
they were showing full hospitals.

937
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,460
And that was from some ferry boat accident

938
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,540
in Italy 15 years ago.

939
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:49,880
Right.

940
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,560
People on ventilators.

941
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:51,820
Right.

942
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,720
So, yeah, it's insane.

943
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,060
No one can make sense of anything.

944
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,780
If they keep people confused and afraid, they'll

945
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,920
never be able to use proper logic.

946
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:02,520
Right.

947
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,800
And I think that's I think it's getting

948
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,580
worse, sadly.

949
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,560
And opium was well beyond, oh, it's an

950
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,340
addictive problem.

951
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:12,100
And it got into it was actually weaponized

952
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:15,640
and brought to those populations in order to

953
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,480
decimate them, where they just kind of dumped

954
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:17,960
it in there.

955
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,820
It was really cheap.

956
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,840
And it is really your friends, you know,

957
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,060
from Great Britain that utilized it as a

958
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:27,300
weapon for, I don't know, five hundred years

959
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,160
easily.

960
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,940
It was just like it was just like

961
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,520
the health care here is now you had

962
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,880
to buy it when you're in Asia.

963
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,900
You had to buy it.

964
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,100
You had to buy a certain amount of

965
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,400
opium or you were taxed to pay the

966
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,980
taxes like now you either get the health

967
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,260
care or you pay five hundred dollars eight.

968
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:43,520
Right.

969
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,340
Which is eight.

970
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,340
Oh, my gosh.

971
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,060
I should it should be eight thousand if

972
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,800
you're that stupid to not know how to

973
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,460
get out of that.

974
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,700
But that's OK.

975
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,980
I mean, and look, I was never as

976
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,420
well as, you know, in the Bible says,

977
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,740
don't say that because you were like that,

978
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:56,920
too.

979
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,520
I was never, ever, ever fell for all

980
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,200
that authoritarian tax regulation stuff.

981
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:07,580
I always knew it was a what do

982
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:10,020
you call a ruse and a prank to

983
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,800
the ignorant and those that are easily fear

984
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,040
fearful because at a very young age, I've

985
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,000
had several older people say you better read

986
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,080
the U.S. Constitution because most of the

987
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,860
stuff that you discover as you get older

988
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,140
is unconstitutional.

989
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:22,980
Of course.

990
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,420
And all I had to hear was the

991
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,220
tax is unconstitutional.

992
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,280
And I always knew if I ever had

993
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,020
to get involved with those guys to bring

994
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,800
up the Constitution, they'll tell you that doesn't

995
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,320
apply here.

996
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,540
Well, then you don't apply here.

997
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,440
Right.

998
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,300
That's what do they call it when you

999
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,520
when you go against the government or the

1000
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,040
authorities?

1001
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,440
It's called it's there's a term for it.

1002
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,120
I can't recall it right now.

1003
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,480
Sedition, sedition.

1004
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,060
Yeah.

1005
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:52,840
Yeah.

1006
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:53,500
Yeah.

1007
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,580
But ultimately, when you start looking at how

1008
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,360
they do it, it's because it's all trust

1009
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:58,700
law.

1010
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,000
Right.

1011
00:29:59,220 --> 00:29:59,440
Right.

1012
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,260
But I didn't know it was eight hundred,

1013
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,020
but it doesn't matter.

1014
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,180
I actually I hope it goes up to

1015
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,380
like ten thousand and really punish those that

1016
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:08,100
believe in it, because that's how the Catholic

1017
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,280
Church does the same same stuff.

1018
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:10,580
Right.

1019
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,100
They like the Catholic Church sells indulgences right

1020
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:14,800
to go to heaven.

1021
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,500
These credit people are.

1022
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,040
Oh, my gosh, it's so ridiculous.

1023
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,360
It's it's really bad.

1024
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,520
You really got to think twice.

1025
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,700
When I see people involved with like income

1026
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,940
tax and all this other stuff and health

1027
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:31,120
care and whatever, it makes me think twice.

1028
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,900
It's like, are you that weak that going

1029
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,160
along with it is easier?

1030
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,240
I'm not saying fighting and getting out of

1031
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:38,380
it.

1032
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,660
Is it that are you that weak of

1033
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,540
an individual, you know, or whatever you want

1034
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,240
to call yourself to fall for that system?

1035
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,060
And the answer is yes.

1036
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,080
Most people, even today, I bet most of

1037
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,000
our subs are subject to it and they

1038
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,660
don't do anything about getting out of it.

1039
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,080
Maybe we should do what depends on how

1040
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,260
much response we get.

1041
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,080
I'll just post the codes.

1042
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,000
There's a few very simple codes.

1043
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,160
All you got to do is state that

1044
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,920
if you it's solely voluntary.

1045
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,760
It's one of the CFRs.

1046
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,260
Actually, I should bring it up and read

1047
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:07,480
it.

1048
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,340
It tells you that if you're an employee

1049
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,780
having withholding and you don't want withholding anymore,

1050
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,700
it's just simply make a sworn a statement

1051
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,560
that has to be sworn.

1052
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,380
It has to be without the United States.

1053
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,700
I could show you that code, too.

1054
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,940
There's statements with the United States and without

1055
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,780
the United States.

1056
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,120
And it's funny with the United States.

1057
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,780
So you swear the penalty of perjury, but

1058
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:30,500
without the United States is you swear under

1059
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,580
penalty perjury according to the laws of the

1060
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,820
United States of America.

1061
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,840
That's without the United States.

1062
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,500
Very interesting.

1063
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,200
But all you got to do is make

1064
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,780
a statement and give it to the employer.

1065
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,620
And that's it.

1066
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,200
And you give them about a week and

1067
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,140
they have to stop pulling taxes out.

1068
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,780
And of course, watch the sparks fly.

1069
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:49,200
Right.

1070
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:49,580
Right.

1071
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,920
And well, ultimately, what happens if you do

1072
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,320
it right, you just send a copy of

1073
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,200
the IRS and the IRS will call the

1074
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,160
employer and say, don't take any more taxes.

1075
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,540
He did all the proper stuff.

1076
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,900
It's funny when the accountants at the company

1077
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,180
say, I never heard of that.

1078
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,000
You have everybody has to pay taxes and

1079
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,360
then they get a from the IRS telling

1080
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:07,880
them to stop.

1081
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,040
It's like what a wake up call.

1082
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:09,320
Right.

1083
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,080
Yeah.

1084
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:11,500
Yeah.

1085
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,080
Yeah.

1086
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,180
It's really sad.

1087
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,600
The condition that people are in just in

1088
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,300
general, you know.

1089
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:16,900
You know what?

1090
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,580
I did have one more little thing.

1091
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,220
And I wasn't sure if we've already gone

1092
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,800
over this because it sounds familiar.

1093
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,860
We may have covered this already, but let's

1094
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,660
just double check.

1095
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,660
A question for Chuck and Greek.

1096
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,520
If humans have a line of credit, their

1097
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,740
signature in parentheses that apply.

1098
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,760
OK, OK.

1099
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,080
It's prepaid upon birth, they're saying.

1100
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,060
And would there be a financial incentive to

1101
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:42,320
slaughter the actual person since governments get paid

1102
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,560
in full up front and are looking to

1103
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,880
do with that?

1104
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,760
OK, I'm just has nothing to do.

1105
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:48,000
I see.

1106
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:48,620
But go ahead.

1107
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,040
Go ahead and finish.

1108
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,260
You know, I just want to give you

1109
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:51,760
the whole thing.

1110
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,580
Would there be a financial incentive to slaughter

1111
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,960
children since governments get paid in full up

1112
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,180
front and are looking to minimize expenditures by

1113
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,720
removing them from existence?

1114
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,060
Now, my first reaction to this is that

1115
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:09,120
as you continue to, you know, gather so

1116
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,020
-called expenses as you're going through, you're still

1117
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,480
generating just by living.

1118
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:17,480
You're generating more and more of this.

1119
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,900
It doesn't work that way at all.

1120
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,760
OK, my mother doesn't work that way in

1121
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,220
slaughtering children or whatever.

1122
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,600
The worst thing that I've seen happen.

1123
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,760
Let me just put it this way out

1124
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,020
of war.

1125
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,160
The worst thing I've seen happen openly with

1126
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:31,120
the credit system other than the financial crashes

1127
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,660
like tarp and covid was that doge thing

1128
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,500
with Elon Musk.

1129
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,060
He just went in there and got all

1130
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,480
the private QCIP numbers attached to Social Security

1131
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,340
numbers to fund his campaign that he's working

1132
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:43,820
on.

1133
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,280
Right.

1134
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,960
So that's that was like amazing because no

1135
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,660
one knows how this system works.

1136
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,620
And those that do or don't have platforms

1137
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:53,100
to discuss or like us have 10 subs,

1138
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:53,860
you know, whatever.

1139
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,740
So no one's getting any information.

1140
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,460
And and the people that are out there

1141
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,980
talking about this, you know, the one guy

1142
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,540
says one thing, the other one says another.

1143
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,040
Yeah, the credit system works this way very

1144
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:07,480
simply.

1145
00:34:07,639 --> 00:34:09,280
It's actually based on the Constitution.

1146
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:12,460
The government was set up with certain tasks

1147
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:16,560
besides military protection and and whatever is to

1148
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,020
print print and coin money.

1149
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:18,600
True.

1150
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:21,020
Now, to put this in perspective, you can

1151
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:24,699
objectify anything political, anything social by making a

1152
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:27,120
list of how you are going to objectify

1153
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,060
qualitatively and quantitatively.

1154
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,600
I could say this surely, which by the

1155
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,320
way, the coin was the worst president.

1156
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,080
You're coining and minting money, by the way.

1157
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:36,020
Guess what?

1158
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,159
They don't actually do that.

1159
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,960
They have the Federal Reserve to do that.

1160
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,739
So quite honestly, they're not doing one of

1161
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:42,840
the things they're supposed to do.

1162
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:43,460
Reserve does.

1163
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:47,080
Well, no, there's a print in minting office

1164
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:47,739
that does it.

1165
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:49,800
The Federal Reserve puts the control over it.

1166
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:52,020
No, the government still prints everything and does

1167
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:52,320
everything.

1168
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,139
The Treasury checks.

1169
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,520
The Federal Reserve is just the trustee.

1170
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:58,360
Yeah, that's the worst president the United States

1171
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,820
has ever had without a worst president.

1172
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,380
The United States has ever had by a

1173
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,080
long shot.

1174
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:07,200
I mean, so clear it is FDR.  Why?

1175
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:12,200
There's never been a parliamentary government monarchy dictator

1176
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,100
in the history of mankind that has ever

1177
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:17,120
told its population to surrender its gold.

1178
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,580
You could find the worst government that ever

1179
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:19,960
existed.

1180
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:23,600
Even they never did anything as drastic as

1181
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:23,820
that.

1182
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,360
And the American people went for it.

1183
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:25,580
Right.

1184
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,900
That's how they set them up to do

1185
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,160
that.

1186
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:28,440
Right.

1187
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,420
Does it matter?

1188
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,020
That's why it's land of the slave freedom.

1189
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,560
But even back then, we're better off now

1190
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,240
than we were back then, by the way,

1191
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,940
believe it or not.

1192
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,680
Yeah, kind of by a long shot.

1193
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,260
It's kind of amazing.

1194
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,740
There's a is the worst.

1195
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,640
Yeah, there's a there's a former college professor

1196
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,220
just really quickly right now who, you know,

1197
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,340
got himself retired from his prestigious position.

1198
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,860
I'm not going to name him, but because

1199
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:59,460
he started writing about and trying to explain

1200
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:03,500
to people exactly point by point how FDR

1201
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,200
was basically an American dictator who was at

1202
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:10,220
war with the Constitution and the people of

1203
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:13,100
the country completely all the way around with

1204
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,220
the historical data they've collected.

1205
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,460
And it's amazing that he's like a liberal

1206
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:17,820
icon.

1207
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,620
He started writing about this.

1208
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,840
And all of a sudden, you know, he

1209
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,580
no longer had a position in academia.

1210
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,400
They even pulled his books, all kinds of

1211
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:26,580
stuff.

1212
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,740
But he's still writing it now.

1213
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,800
He's still doing it.

1214
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,820
But it's kind of amazing.

1215
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,140
He's one of those guys who went, wait

1216
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,440
a minute, I've been sort of lied to

1217
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:34,780
here.

1218
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:40,140
The only one that could have possibly overshadowed

1219
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,060
him would have been Reagan by pushing the

1220
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:45,000
button and launched a full on strike on

1221
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,160
the Soviet Union with a full on retaliation

1222
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,620
that would be possibly a runner up to

1223
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:49,900
that.

1224
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,840
You don't think Wilson was pretty bad?

1225
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:53,820
Woodrow Wilson?

1226
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,620
No, not at.

1227
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,940
Well, no, not as bad as FDR. No,

1228
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,500
not as bad as FDR, as bad as

1229
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,520
FDR. He didn't ask.

1230
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,340
He put the Federal Reserve in.

1231
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,340
But here I'm not here.

1232
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,620
I'm not against the Federal Reserve at all.

1233
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,360
I'll explain.

1234
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,620
OK, because.

1235
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,900
OK, so the emergencies have now gone away.

1236
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,480
They're never going to go back to substance

1237
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,220
back money.

1238
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,680
And so everything is in a trust.

1239
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,800
That's why I in one of the Sonics,

1240
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,320
a hundred Sonics ago, I said, go look

1241
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,580
at that guy with the toupee, the congressman,

1242
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,060
what he said on the floor in 1992.

1243
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,720
What's his name?

1244
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,160
Doesn't come to mind right now.

1245
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,720
He's a funny congressman to pay.

1246
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,900
But anyway, he talked about the United States

1247
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,300
as the largest bankruptcy in world history.

1248
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:36,660
Right.

1249
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,060
Right.

1250
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,060
So everything is done by trust.

1251
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,060
Everything is done by trust.

1252
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,420
Like, for example, if you go look at

1253
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:46,200
the critical satire cartoons of the eighteen hundreds,

1254
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,900
they have these big fat guys as railroad

1255
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:51,840
trust, mining trust, oil trust, petroleum trust.

1256
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,960
Everything is in a trust.

1257
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,180
You call corporations whatever you want.

1258
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,080
There always is always a trust and a

1259
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,020
trustee relationship.

1260
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,420
If you have one of those God forsaken

1261
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:04,020
things known as a college diploma hanging on

1262
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:04,880
the wall, go read it.

1263
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,880
What does it say here by the trustees

1264
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,620
of the university declare that this person has

1265
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,420
enough credits to get a bachelor's degree or

1266
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:12,640
whatever?

1267
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,600
Everything is done by trust.

1268
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:18,160
So this person bringing up whatever you know,

1269
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:21,560
slaughtering children or whatever, that's nothing compared to

1270
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,800
the overall thing about the trust.

1271
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:28,080
Sixteenth Section 16 of the Federal Reserve Act

1272
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,840
states that actually the Federal Reserve Bank in

1273
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,500
general, it's more than one place, I believe,

1274
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:36,240
using Federal Reserve notes, which is anything basically

1275
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,080
checks, credit cards, low, whatever, whatever you want

1276
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,620
to call it, cash money.

1277
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:44,720
They're all constitute Federal Reserve notes is a

1278
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,620
mortgage, a first lien mortgage on all persons

1279
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,320
and property in the United States.

1280
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:49,580
Right.

1281
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,180
America.

1282
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,920
That's everyone agrees to that.

1283
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,320
No one's ever gone after that.

1284
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,220
So but here's the here's the thing about

1285
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:59,540
the credit thing, because they took your ability

1286
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,840
to pay away.

1287
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,920
They have to pay for everything for you.

1288
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,460
But they can't let you know that because

1289
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,820
it'll collapse the labor market.

1290
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,240
Right.

1291
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,080
No one will want to go to work

1292
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,120
because everything's paid for.

1293
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,020
So they have to do that.

1294
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,160
Now, let me just give the positive side.

1295
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,460
The Federal Reserve Act plainly states that if

1296
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,680
anyone is applying for Federal Reserve notes like

1297
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:25,060
member banks and associations, financial institutions, you guessed

1298
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:25,500
it right.

1299
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,700
If you have a license to go to

1300
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,260
their window.

1301
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:28,740
Right.

1302
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,260
They they have to bring collateral and the

1303
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,940
application is the collateral.

1304
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,960
Whatever number is on the application, we're talking

1305
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,020
about the application.

1306
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:39,800
Right.

1307
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,580
That produces the funds.

1308
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,120
So give me an example.

1309
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,060
Let's say you're going to go buy a

1310
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,520
car for, let's say, 50 K.

1311
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,540
You apply for it.

1312
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,320
They go get the 50 K from the

1313
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,940
application and then you do what's called a

1314
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,160
purchase and sale agreement.

1315
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:54,640
Right.

1316
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,720
And then they go get another 50 K

1317
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,980
and then you do maybe a buyer seller

1318
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,420
agreement and they go get another 50 K.

1319
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,200
So you've created one hundred and fifty thousand

1320
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:04,660
dollars.

1321
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,940
And then they task you is they give

1322
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:07,880
you the car and say you have to

1323
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,300
pay it all back plus interest.

1324
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,220
So now another 50 K.

1325
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:12,100
Right.

1326
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,060
So this is how they get super.

1327
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,640
That's why when you look at any bank

1328
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,740
statement, like look at a new bank, they

1329
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,960
start out with like 40 million in assets.

1330
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,880
The next year, it's like almost a billion.

1331
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:23,260
How?

1332
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,660
Because all they have to do is deny

1333
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,080
people.

1334
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:25,420
Right.

1335
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:29,160
So when you apply, let's say, Chuck, you

1336
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,380
and I get an office and we're a

1337
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,140
bank and we tell people, why don't you

1338
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,480
come in and apply for a hundred thousand

1339
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,040
dollar loan?

1340
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,420
And we get 10 people come in to

1341
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,000
apply and we tell them because of your

1342
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,360
credit report, we're denying you.

1343
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,400
They believe that we get the 10 people's

1344
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,020
hundred thousand.

1345
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,180
We get a million dollars a day.

1346
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:44,960
We get to keep it.

1347
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,920
We get to keep the million dollars.

1348
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:47,840
No people walk away.

1349
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,800
They don't give us a fight because they've

1350
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,860
been trained that the credit report means something,

1351
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,260
which is a bunch of mom and pop

1352
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:56,320
businesses that were started in the 70s to

1353
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:56,880
do that.

1354
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,740
There's no legal bearing on it.

1355
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:01,780
It's actually slander because everything on a credit

1356
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:05,120
report is is paid for, by the way.

1357
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,920
It's just they tell you that it's not

1358
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:10,260
you didn't you didn't perform as agreed, meaning

1359
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,720
to pay it again, repay it.

1360
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,020
Right.

1361
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:16,420
So anyway, all these applications are adding up

1362
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:19,020
and they're not being put on the market.

1363
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,560
They're being held as to leverage other things,

1364
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:26,340
fortunately, because if the applications that everyone's been

1365
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,340
denied for, I think right now, 48 percent

1366
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:30,520
of all mortgage applications are being denied.

1367
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,940
So go look and go look at Wells.

1368
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,380
This is just Wells Fargo.

1369
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:35,900
Yeah.

1370
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,140
So go look at Wells Fargo balance sheet

1371
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:41,160
when they started denying the applications and where

1372
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:41,780
they are now.

1373
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,080
You can see huge earnings and no one's.

1374
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,160
This is all very much.

1375
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,700
This is like, what would you say?

1376
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:48,640
Eighth grade math.

1377
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,560
So the simple multiplication is what?

1378
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,600
Eighth grade or sixth grade?

1379
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,880
Probably sixth grade math.

1380
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,080
Sixth grade multiplication.

1381
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:55,320
It's lower than that.

1382
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,420
I remember math.

1383
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:56,640
No.

1384
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:57,020
Yeah.

1385
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:59,660
I was taught my multiplication table, say, in

1386
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,840
the second or third grade.

1387
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,060
And I wasn't even second or third grade.

1388
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,300
I wasn't even in a good school.

1389
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:05,700
So, yeah, go ahead.

1390
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,740
So when I yes, fourth grade for me

1391
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:11,960
is probably college level now anyway, but or

1392
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,420
high school.

1393
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:13,700
But let's say that kind of math.

1394
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,220
That's how stupid the population is across the

1395
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:16,580
board.

1396
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,240
They can't go see.

1397
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,960
You can actually do historic thing.

1398
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,100
One charts of denials.

1399
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,980
When did the denials for wealth to pick

1400
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:24,540
one bank?

1401
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,220
So let's say it's March of 2023.

1402
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:30,140
They start denying most people.

1403
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,460
Go look at what the bank had in

1404
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:36,600
reserves or in an account in 2023 and

1405
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,860
watch it grow as they're denying applications.

1406
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:39,260
Yeah.

1407
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,860
OK, so this is how the credit system

1408
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:42,280
works.

1409
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:43,460
It's all your.

1410
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,400
So, by the way, it's all yours, but

1411
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,400
it's abandoned.

1412
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,420
You're abandoning it.

1413
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,080
So what I mean by that is if

1414
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,200
you went all those applications that were denied

1415
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,180
and they're used as an asset to leverage

1416
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,320
for Wells Fargo, if you look at their

1417
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,640
paperwork, it's your name that's on there.

1418
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,000
It's your name.

1419
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,160
It's your property.

1420
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:03,760
It's kind of like if you drop something

1421
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,820
that has your name engraved on it and

1422
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,280
someone finds it and you say, well, that's

1423
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,160
my my name's on it.

1424
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,100
You show that it's your name.

1425
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,120
It is no question.

1426
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,780
Oh, we're going to give it to somebody

1427
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:12,560
else anyway.

1428
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,780
You know, kind of a scam that would

1429
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:14,940
be.

1430
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:17,340
So no one is looking at this.

1431
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,380
The biggest scam, the biggest scam going on

1432
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:23,060
still because it's an oxymoron is university or

1433
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:23,540
college.

1434
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:27,500
When you apply to the college, the college

1435
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,200
gets full tuition from your application.

1436
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:32,200
And then they say, are you going to

1437
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,540
get a loan or are you going to

1438
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:33,720
buy?

1439
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:34,760
You're going to pay for your tuition.

1440
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,400
So they get paid again, again.

1441
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,060
So the biggest scam for whatever people think

1442
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:42,200
it is, you didn't learn anything.

1443
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,200
Anyone who's gone to college and is honest

1444
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,060
with themselves knows they didn't learn anything.

1445
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,680
They're really worthwhile at all.

1446
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:50,600
You couldn't get like, who was it?

1447
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,220
Goodwill, Walker, whatever.

1448
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,300
A couple of late fees at the library.

1449
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:54,640
Right.

1450
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:59,020
So you're being scammed on a level right

1451
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:00,140
now still.

1452
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,260
And by the way, since my early, early

1453
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:06,440
days on Revolution Radio in 2009, 2010 with

1454
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:09,560
Seth Michael and these three, four hour conversations

1455
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,900
I would have through the middle of the

1456
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,700
night on the weekend, I kept telling, they

1457
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:15,400
kept talking about finance, this finance.

1458
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:16,320
Have you ever filled that?

1459
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,820
So do you know that all that funds

1460
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:19,380
are first produced through your application?

1461
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:21,140
And they're like, huh?

1462
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,680
And I've been saying this for so long.

1463
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:26,320
It's so tiring.

1464
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:29,080
And then finally, recently, more people have been

1465
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:29,820
speaking on it.

1466
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,280
And I'm like, oh my gosh, it took

1467
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,380
like 20 years to get people to just

1468
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,960
start doing not because of me, but I'm

1469
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,120
like, I just gave up.

1470
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:40,260
I was like, what are you discussing credit

1471
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,240
reports for?

1472
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,860
Your application paid for everything.

1473
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:50,060
So the credit thing is is the Federal

1474
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:53,660
Reserve, believe it or not, is the friendliest

1475
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:55,120
thing that has ever happened.

1476
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,220
Even even it's on the level with the

1477
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:59,960
Constitution, by the way, like the Ninth Amendment.

1478
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,660
Everyone talks about First Amendment, Second Amendment, Fifth

1479
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:02,920
Amendment.

1480
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,300
The Ninth Amendment is the best one, because

1481
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:08,900
that basically states paraphrasing here that no right

1482
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:10,740
shall be a bridge that anyone has right

1483
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,080
now, no matter what it is, like no

1484
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,740
matter what you're doing that you consider a

1485
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,240
right, it can be you should defend it.

1486
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:15,960
It's defendable.

1487
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:16,520
You should be left.

1488
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:17,200
Right.

1489
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:19,340
It's not specific.

1490
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:21,980
It's it's not like the second is arms

1491
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:22,840
or safe.

1492
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,900
There's incrimination.

1493
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:26,880
And that's like anything that you're doing right

1494
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,000
now that you think is a right you're

1495
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:28,540
able to do.

1496
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:29,980
Oh, my gosh.

1497
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,020
The Ninth Amendment is the one you should.

1498
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:33,880
Everyone should be looking at and using.

1499
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:37,000
And the second thing is the Federal Reserve

1500
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,300
Act, which says when an institution or a

1501
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,660
bank comes to get Federal Reserve notes, which

1502
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:45,520
is basically money on account, because that's how

1503
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,340
you know when you have Federal Reserve notes,

1504
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:48,800
it could be it's credit on your account.

1505
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:49,040
Right.

1506
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:51,040
You can withdraw from it, write checks off

1507
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:51,660
of it, whatever.

1508
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:55,640
OK, they the Federal Reserve needs collateral and

1509
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,520
the application serves as collateral.

1510
00:45:58,180 --> 00:45:58,620
Right.

1511
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,340
And if you read it at the bottom,

1512
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:02,920
it even says that if you need more,

1513
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,440
you could come more and add more to

1514
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,220
that application.

1515
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:12,350
Now, when do you think companies show up

1516
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:14,190
in town's job fair and they get what's

1517
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:15,950
going on, for example, with these job fairs?

1518
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:17,910
You know, these businesses, these young idiots to

1519
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:19,410
apply, they don't hire anyone.

1520
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:21,330
They walk away with applications.

1521
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:23,770
And for the full salaries the company keeps,

1522
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:24,850
that's how they fund the company, that's how

1523
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:27,710
Raytheon funds itself, not through government contracts and

1524
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:28,730
all that stuff or whatever.

1525
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:33,110
And then the Federal Reserve Act allows that

1526
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:34,490
a year later, they could come back with

1527
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:37,070
that on that same application and pull another

1528
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:39,110
million or two million out for you.

1529
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:42,390
And the whole time it's under your name

1530
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:44,830
and you have people walking around wondering how

1531
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:45,950
the credit system works.

1532
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:48,030
No, the two best things that ever happened

1533
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:52,170
in American jurisprudence are the Ninth Amendment and

1534
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:55,110
the Federal Reserve Act, Section 16, without a

1535
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:55,330
doubt.
