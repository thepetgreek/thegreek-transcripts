1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,760
Rated Y, Sonic Event 229.

2
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,560
Excuse me for the sound of my voice,

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,100
it might sound strange, but here we are,

4
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,020
it's shifting a bit.

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,440
Anyway, Greek, how is the evening going where

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:21,800
you are?

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,160
It's all right.

8
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:24,840
Busy, man.

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,980
Just doing consulting with engineering projects and same

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:29,560
old, same old.

11
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:30,200
You know what I say?

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,119
Humans are, right?

13
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,420
So, yeah, I hear that.

14
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,040
Anyway, you know, a weird thing happened today.

15
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,840
Weird thing happened today when I was gathering

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,980
up the questions and comments, a guy wrote

17
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,280
to me and was asking what happened.

18
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,740
Why is it like, in other words, I

19
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,420
think they're still signed up for the old

20
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,480
Greek speak thing.

21
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,620
And or maybe with Sam.

22
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:52,480
Yeah.

23
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:53,720
So I think with Sam.

24
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,000
Yeah.

25
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,680
Well, that's an administrative thing that should have

26
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,280
been worked out.

27
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,500
I try to stay out of that.

28
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:58,900
Yeah.

29
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,220
No.

30
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,440
Well, I thought we had established and done

31
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,120
everything, but it was weird because, you know,

32
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,640
we did that about a year ago and

33
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,640
it was like, yeah, yeah, there's I've gotten

34
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,840
responses when I was doing this stuff with

35
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,760
the paranormies.

36
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,420
He was signed up to both and he

37
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,680
was wondering the same thing.

38
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,680
So yeah, I stay away from it really.

39
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,700
I mean, privately, I just sit back and

40
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,300
watch for people that work with me and

41
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:21,620
do stuff.

42
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,940
I just sit back and I'm like, why

43
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:23,340
bother?

44
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,200
But, you know, just keeping someone's benefiting from

45
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,300
all this, I hope I know pretty much

46
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:36,120
not a super fact, but most people that

47
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,020
are subs and listen to me before did

48
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,840
not know how the money system works, how

49
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,780
the human body works, that what they think

50
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,620
was in the Bible was never in the

51
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,220
Bible or what's in the Bible they never

52
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,940
heard of all these things.

53
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:53,760
So I'm going to be continuously putting out

54
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,540
that stuff and just doing it on like

55
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,680
a platform like the Internet or whatever is

56
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,520
more efficient.

57
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,620
I've been doing this since the early 2000s

58
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,100
on what was called conference calls.

59
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,419
You call like a one meet up by

60
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:09,360
something I meet up some members one eight

61
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,580
hundred number you get up to ninety nine

62
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:10,980
people.

63
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:11,580
Yeah.

64
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,040
Well, and I was doing it there.

65
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,880
I think talks you right before talk show

66
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,580
before just regular conference in the late 90s

67
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,380
conference calls.

68
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,060
You call this number and a whole bunch

69
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,380
of people meet on a conference call.

70
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,700
And then after that, when I moved to

71
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,240
Tucson, it was pretty much like little law

72
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,960
groups, retirement people like, you know, the one

73
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,900
of those Knights of Pythias kind of thing.

74
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,500
They're looking for people to come and speak,

75
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,580
you know, OK, like Ralph Epperson.

76
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:40,280
Right.

77
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:40,560
Right.

78
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,920
Ralph Epperson ran a publishing company and he

79
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,380
asked me to go and speak all.

80
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,860
And I've been saying the same stuff now

81
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,700
for three decades.

82
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,960
So, you know, whatever.

83
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,920
I want to bring something up since the

84
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,360
last time we left off, it was like

85
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,960
politicians, children and drug use and debauchery and

86
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,620
all that stuff.

87
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,000
Yeah.

88
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,400
It's funny when you know about it secondhand.

89
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,080
I wasn't there.

90
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,080
So I can't say firsthand from people that

91
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,360
actually were there firsthand.

92
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,500
And then you see what they put out

93
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,540
on the media about it.

94
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,340
You're like, yeah, that's that's it.

95
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,020
But it's actually a lot worse than what

96
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,140
they're putting out in the media.

97
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,080
And it's also very convoluted.

98
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,280
I think when I was bringing up the

99
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,400
former vice president's son debauchery, I was working,

100
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,760
I said, with a Korean businesswoman.

101
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,500
She went to his house home somewhere in

102
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:30,800
Florida.

103
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,360
Yeah.

104
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,600
And he's basically just a little more.

105
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,600
She basically told her, yeah, I'll talk about

106
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,360
the business context, what we could do for

107
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:37,640
everybody.

108
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,680
Take your clothes off and get high first.

109
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,580
This is like a business meeting.

110
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:41,900
Right.

111
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,340
She's like, I'm married and I'm really not

112
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,160
into getting high.

113
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,600
So I'm going to go outside for a

114
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,000
little bit.

115
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,020
You know, she took off.

116
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:49,220
Right.

117
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:49,720
Right.

118
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,880
This is with the Hunter Biden guy.

119
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,960
And so this was back in 2015.

120
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,540
I think you and I were in touch

121
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,060
or somehow I think I brought that up

122
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,280
to you.

123
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,620
I remember speaking to you about it.

124
00:03:59,720 --> 00:03:59,940
Yep.

125
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,700
And and then when you see the thing

126
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,980
about the light, you mentioned a laptop.

127
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,800
I don't even know what the laptop meant

128
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,640
or anything like that, because what they do

129
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,040
is they put a curve on it.

130
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,260
Like, for example, now with the Epstein stuff,

131
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,279
Epstein was just a broker.

132
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,200
One guy that is a fall guy for

133
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,540
a broker.

134
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,640
I'll give you another thing that I found

135
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,480
out a while back.

136
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,920
All of the attorney general's offices do what

137
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,920
Epstein did.

138
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,060
Right.

139
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,220
What does that mean?

140
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,040
What they do is they they have people

141
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,220
that are predators and they go out to

142
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,780
places like Disneyland, Coney Island, public beaches.

143
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,700
So you're going to have all up and

144
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,780
down the East Coast, West Coast, inland.

145
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,720
It would be places that have water parks,

146
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,240
Chicago, stuff like that.

147
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,980
And they take photographs of children that might

148
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,360
their their clients might be interested in.

149
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,680
And also they follow the children to their

150
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,800
family and they get a picture of the

151
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,500
license plate.

152
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,580
Sometimes they even follow home and get the

153
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,120
address where the children live.

154
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,640
And they have like a photo album.

155
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,640
And when their clients are interested in the

156
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,620
child, now they circle back and they have

157
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,920
the license plate and the address and they

158
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,760
go to the attorney general's office to get

159
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,880
the rest of the details.

160
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,880
Just like that.

161
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:24,200
Right.

162
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:24,620
See.

163
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,320
So this is like, well, you know, I

164
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,540
mean, so when you hear on the news,

165
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,080
attorney general, they caught these criminals and put

166
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,880
them behind bars.

167
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,240
It's so convoluted.

168
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,240
The world is so dirty.

169
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,080
I'm always going to go back to say

170
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,720
what I always said was you can go

171
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,820
online and look at the weirdest, craziest conspiracy

172
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,220
theories.

173
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,840
I'm telling you, if you sum up what's

174
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,420
really going on, it's even worse than all

175
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,560
the stuff you hear online.

176
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,860
So, yeah, well, yeah, pretty much.

177
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,760
That's what you'll if you dig around.

178
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,240
And I don't know why I've been made

179
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,320
aware of all these things.

180
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,780
Like sometimes someone would start speaking on something.

181
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,400
You know, the attorney general is really dirty

182
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,960
because I'm like, why are you bringing that

183
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,140
up?

184
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,940
I really don't care.

185
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,020
I know they're great, but they give me

186
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,860
all the details and I'm like, holy shit.

187
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,060
OK, well, what am I going to do

188
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,900
with that information?

189
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:15,220
Right.

190
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,140
Well, here we go.

191
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,580
I can convey it to 10 other people

192
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,840
that are listening or whatever.

193
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,520
The other thing that was very open that

194
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,760
some people remember that guy, Jared of Subway

195
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,500
Sandwiches, I think they did lock him up

196
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,460
for pedophilia or something.

197
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:28,820
Right.

198
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,340
Yeah.

199
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,100
Well, kiddie board.

200
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,100
Well, that's the small part of it.

201
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,300
The big part of it was whenever he

202
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,460
would be involved in like marketing meetings, they

203
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,720
would go and sit down and like the

204
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,340
board table.

205
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,400
And before the meeting ever started, this happened

206
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,200
more than once.

207
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,960
He would stand up or ask people around

208
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,940
him, do you want a place where I

209
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,680
could find some young boys or young children

210
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,980
to have sex with around here?

211
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,200
And that would be like, whoa, you know,

212
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,180
what the hell?

213
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,900
You know, so, so many he asked that

214
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,020
to so many people that they couldn't just

215
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,880
like tell him to shut up and slap

216
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,360
on the wrist.

217
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,140
They just nailed him right for whatever.

218
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,680
So and I knew that information before he

219
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,900
was locked up for all that.

220
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,400
That's why when I mentioned this to someone,

221
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,560
they said, oh, yeah, he's locked up for

222
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,140
child porn.

223
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:17,680
I was like, really?

224
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,560
I didn't even know that.

225
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,540
You know, most people find out about what

226
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,380
the media put forward first, you know, where

227
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,640
by the way, if you were going around

228
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,940
10 years ago saying the Hunter Biden guy

229
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,980
to go to him for influential business meetings

230
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,420
and tell you to take your clothes off

231
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,420
and get high with him, you're crazy, right?

232
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,560
So you don't really openly speak on these

233
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,680
things, you know, too much.

234
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,400
Oh, I know.

235
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,600
I got in trouble for the drug thing

236
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,380
because I tried to explain to people when

237
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,360
you see those big drug busts, those are

238
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:46,860
intentional.

239
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,080
They let them catch that.

240
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,820
And how do I know that?

241
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,020
Of course, from DEA agents who say, yeah,

242
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,640
that's the one they let us catch.

243
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,400
You know, there's 100 of them, but they

244
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,480
let us have that one.

245
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,980
So we look like we're doing our job.

246
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,060
You know, that's that's what it is.

247
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,760
I was just going to pull a name

248
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,060
thing.

249
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,460
I'm not going to mention his name.

250
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,820
He's a witness protection program official for the

251
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,060
DEA.

252
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,200
I won't pull his name, but I'll give

253
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:14,880
a little background.

254
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,160
He was a State Department of Mexico sniper,

255
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,460
like their best guy.

256
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,720
And he started going around to State Department

257
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,300
parties and hitting on the other dignitaries wives

258
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,680
when he was younger.

259
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,860
And they didn't like that.

260
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,940
So let's get rid of this guy.

261
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,840
All we got to do is tell the

262
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,919
Americans we got the best sniper in this

263
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,740
side of the hemisphere and they should have

264
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:35,900
him.

265
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,000
And they told the American DEA that and

266
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,419
and State Department actually.

267
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:43,980
And they came and kidnapped him from Mexico.

268
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,100
The way they did that, he was very

269
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:46,960
close with his sister.

270
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,260
They sent a bunch of guys in to

271
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,140
his sister's house like she was going to

272
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,800
get accosted or molested.

273
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,400
She got on the phone screaming, you know,

274
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,520
I need your help.

275
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,140
And he ran out, ran over there into

276
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:57,760
a trap.

277
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,740
They handcuffed him in a blindfold and put

278
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,260
a bag over his head and helicopter flew

279
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,300
him somewhere in Texas.

280
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,500
That is funny because he was an all

281
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,040
tile room.

282
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,040
It was just like the Matrix.

283
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,620
And he says, I need to speak to

284
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,140
an attorney.

285
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,460
And he says, you see a phone in

286
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,340
here, asshole.

287
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,320
That's what they told him.

288
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,680
So when I saw the Matrix, I was

289
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,000
like, oh, this is kind of like a

290
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,060
connection to the Matrix.

291
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,240
But make a long story shorter.

292
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,220
He's like, hey, I know you know about

293
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:23,880
money or whatever.

294
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,040
You know, they have a pallet, a few

295
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,140
billion dollars for me.

296
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,840
Of cash in Brazil in a warehouse.

297
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,480
The only and it's got my name on

298
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:31,760
it.

299
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,700
But the only caveat, the only conditions are

300
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,940
that I can't leave.

301
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,320
It can't leave the building.

302
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,760
So what do we do?

303
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,640
And I was like, well, if it's cash,

304
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,640
it has to leave the building.

305
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,800
That's the purpose of cash.

306
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,120
Cash is no good when it's in a

307
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,480
pallet or under your bed or whatever.

308
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,260
Right, right.

309
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,340
And I said, how would that why would

310
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,180
they give you, you know, a million dollars

311
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,240
and hundred dollar bills is like the size

312
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,580
of back in the days when you got

313
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,240
business cards, remember the business cards when you

314
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,420
ordered the thousand pack?

315
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:00,760
Right.

316
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,960
Not the 500.

317
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:02,540
Right.

318
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,860
That's what a million dollars in cash feels

319
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:05,600
like in hundreds.

320
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,440
And how do I know?

321
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:07,700
Okay.

322
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,280
So I said, God damn it.

323
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,600
You know, how do you get so much?

324
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,140
Are you kidding?

325
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,340
The DEA is the biggest drug dealer in

326
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,100
the world.

327
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,000
This is from a DEA person, right?

328
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:18,320
Yeah.

329
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,260
And I can keep on going.

330
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,640
I've on private Skype groups.

331
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,120
I gave stories in his name and all

332
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,280
that.

333
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,500
I mean, it's just not stories.

334
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:25,880
These accounts.

335
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:28,740
Yeah.

336
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,840
It's not too far from stuff you see

337
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,820
in the movies, actually.

338
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,220
But the movies actually are mild.

339
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:33,840
Yeah.

340
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,120
It's actually quite mild.

341
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,800
Sounds very much like a guy I met

342
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,840
in the 90s named Carlos, but we'll leave

343
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,920
it at that.

344
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,220
Tell me.

345
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:41,580
Yeah.

346
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,760
But here's the thing.

347
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,400
Yeah.

348
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,600
When you but here's the thing.

349
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,360
When you do a movie, it has to

350
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,540
make sense to the audience.

351
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,060
Stuff I've experienced didn't make any sense at

352
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:50,700
all.

353
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,200
You see.

354
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,520
So it has to make.

355
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,620
That's why these movies sometimes you.

356
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:55,620
I don't know.

357
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,000
Would you.

358
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,880
Who would you say is makes movies that

359
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,000
are kind of eclectic?

360
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,140
Who's the guy that did Snatch and Lock,

361
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,780
Stock and Two Smoking Barrels?

362
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,320
British guy.

363
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,740
You know what I'm talking about, right?

364
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,480
Geez, I should just look it up.

365
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,040
Who is it?

366
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,100
Who is Snatch and Lock, Stock, Smoking Barrels?

367
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,540
Oh, Brad Pitt.

368
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,340
No, no, no.

369
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:15,880
The direct.

370
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,740
The guy who did the film.

371
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:17,780
Guy Ritchie.

372
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,440
Guy Ritchie.

373
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:18,820
There you go.

374
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,040
It's more like a Guy Ritchie film or

375
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,620
Quentin Tarantino.

376
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,920
But even there, they let you tie things

377
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,440
together.

378
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,220
But, yeah, it's bizarre.

379
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:30,860
And yeah.

380
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,580
Anyway, let's let's get off of that.

381
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,220
I just wanted to let people know these

382
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,560
are the reason I'm saying this stuff is

383
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,140
because when you do your whatever, whatever media

384
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,860
collection and entertainment or whatever, keep in the

385
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,480
back of your mind that things are.

386
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,260
Yeah, it is like that.

387
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,920
And much worse and much more elaborate.

388
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:49,580
Right.

389
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:50,920
So.

390
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:54,100
OK, so there was a response from the

391
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,860
last Sonic where you were asked about German

392
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,500
medicine, new German medicine.

393
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,140
And he said it's good for analyzing potential

394
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:05,860
emotional root causes for manifested physical conditions.

395
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,020
It doesn't seem like a good catch, although

396
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,060
is how he put it.

397
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:10,600
Easy.

398
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,240
That's that.

399
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,620
We already have that.

400
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,960
If you there's something called the Mase John

401
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:20,400
Mase method where your mind, your mind associates

402
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,900
all memories traumatic or not with images.

403
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,120
Right.

404
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,760
So imagine you had a photo album.

405
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,160
That's all.

406
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:27,860
There's no audio.

407
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,140
There's no you have to recall the image

408
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,600
before you recall the audio and the feeling

409
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,280
and the smells.

410
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,320
You know, we talked about how smells can

411
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,260
bring you back and all that.

412
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,780
So the image is the first thing that

413
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,780
has to be recollected.

414
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,740
So you basically and you don't have to

415
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:45,940
do any association with these psychiatrists, psychologists or

416
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,320
who is it?

417
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,480
Samuel Goldin of Goldenmeier Films.

418
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,640
Twenty said anyone who wants to see a

419
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,800
psychologist or a psychologist should have their head

420
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,220
examined.

421
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,460
But yeah, so it's all imagery.

422
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,840
So that image, if you have a trauma,

423
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,540
you never share it with anyone.

424
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,080
What you do is you expand that image.

425
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,000
You can't do this alone.

426
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:05,700
That's a weird thing.

427
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,820
You have to be coached through it.

428
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,900
But you never tell the person what the

429
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,320
trauma is, who's coaching you, walking you through

430
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:11,520
it.

431
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,600
It's interesting how it's like a bilateral thing.

432
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,060
You expand the image so it can't get

433
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:16,440
any bigger.

434
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,600
And then you shrink it till it can't

435
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,260
get any smaller.

436
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,040
And it disappears.

437
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,880
And it's a cure all for for anything,

438
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,840
even if someone's too happy.

439
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,120
So the physical attachment comes in where if

440
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,860
you have very trauma, especially if you're going

441
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,580
to one of these demons known as psychologists

442
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,300
or psychiatrists, they're there to adjust you.

443
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,900
So you fit into the system, by the

444
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,420
way, just like doctors are there to suppress

445
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,520
the symptoms.

446
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,980
They even tell you this will reduce your

447
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,460
symptoms.

448
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,020
Right.

449
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:44,240
Right.

450
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,240
It doesn't treat the cause.

451
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,180
So your symptoms are that you're you're not

452
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,440
adjusting to a system that's really fucked up.

453
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:50,660
Right.

454
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,660
So they try to find out why you're

455
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,280
not adjusting to a fucked up system.

456
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,080
But what happens is when you do have

457
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,300
the trauma in your mind, your body, your

458
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,460
mind starts to change its identity to become

459
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,680
relevant to that hidden trauma, to that thing

460
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,780
that you're carrying around.

461
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:12,060
Your identity will change the way you relate

462
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,100
to other people, the way you relate to

463
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,660
every aspect of your life, including what you

464
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,720
consider to be personal.

465
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,740
Time will change after that.

466
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,980
So when you your identity starts to change,

467
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,220
your emotions start to change, your physical actions

468
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,000
start to change.

469
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,320
You're going to definitely manifest ailments.

470
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,020
Well, the emotional side to ailment is also

471
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,620
very external because we're subject to induction.

472
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,000
For example, when you go into a hot

473
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,580
tub, bathtub to take a bath, even a

474
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,140
shower or in a pool, you know, say

475
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,180
no peeing in the pool.

476
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,820
Well, you cover all of your skin with

477
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,240
water.

478
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:48,900
There is enough induction to create new water

479
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,680
inside your body and then displace that older

480
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,280
water at the at the bladder.

481
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,720
Now, the water doesn't run to the bladder.

482
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,180
It's energized and energized, materialized in the bladder.

483
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,000
Remember, when I say induction, it's like the

484
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,460
food replicator in Star Trek.

485
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,040
One thing moves to anything can move from

486
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,700
any side of the body to out of

487
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,540
the body by just replicating itself in the

488
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,400
particular location.

489
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,180
You start replicating things in the body or

490
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:20,020
whatever by induction, which is it could be

491
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,980
fields around you, other people.

492
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,900
This is how diseases are caused.

493
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,840
You know, you don't it's it's almost impossible

494
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,840
to contract disease by breathing airborne.

495
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,360
It has to be through induction.

496
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,900
There have been many enough tests that have

497
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,680
been publicized.

498
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,920
Good luck finding them now where they would

499
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,520
people with advanced tuberculosis or whatever classic diseases,

500
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,800
smallpox were injected.

501
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,760
Blood was drawn and then injected into healthy

502
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,640
subjects and they never came down with it.

503
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,240
So it's not a physical thing, disease or

504
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,000
nutrition or.

505
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,360
So the disease is really not physical.

506
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,500
So saying there is a way to figure

507
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,400
it out through the emotion is spot on.

508
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,740
But do they know what they're talking about?

509
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,100
Now, I'm going to venture to say they

510
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:02,580
don't.

511
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,800
They don't know.

512
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,660
I bet most of those people in that

513
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,800
unless they prove otherwise believe in, quote, unquote,

514
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,340
what is it?

515
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:13,860
Microbiology theories like virus theory, transmutation of transmittal

516
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,520
of disease by microorganisms and absorption of nutrition

517
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,040
in the body.

518
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,920
I don't think they understand the human body.

519
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,680
If they did, their research would go through

520
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,100
the roof.

521
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,700
I mean, they would be a thousand years

522
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,560
ahead of the current state.

523
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,540
So I don't know.

524
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,200
Interesting.

525
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,420
I hope they don't.

526
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,340
Interesting thought, though, is that, you know, you're

527
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,400
saying you can't breathe in the disease, quote,

528
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:34,680
unquote.

529
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,640
But if you breathe in particles, they could

530
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:41,440
then through induction create something in the body.

531
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,980
If they're in there, in there or no,

532
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,680
if you can induce it.

533
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,340
Yeah, exactly.

534
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,520
Well, it's just like radiation.

535
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,240
You could be subjected to a lot of

536
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,120
radiation and you'll get a sunburn or whatever.

537
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,180
But if you if you inhale like 9

538
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,500
-11, people around 9-11 or the or

539
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,640
several places through the like, the other one

540
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,280
was Oklahoma City.

541
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,359
A lot of people die from radiological diseases

542
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,119
or the burn.

543
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,040
If you breathe in the dust, the burn

544
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,920
pit syndrome in the Middle East, when they

545
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,540
the soldiers came back with the exotic.

546
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,520
Yeah, that also.

547
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,119
Right.

548
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:12,619
OK.

549
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:12,819
Yeah.

550
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:14,599
If you breathe in these particles and they're

551
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:17,220
constantly ionizing like tiny little x-ray machines

552
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,920
in your lungs, that will cause disease.

553
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,160
Yeah.

554
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,319
So if you have, let's say, if you

555
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,240
inhale something that's airborne and it gets into

556
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,800
your body, that's not enough.

557
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,480
It has to create induction in the body.

558
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,480
Right.

559
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,760
Because the lungs are completely sealed, by the

560
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:33,920
way.

561
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,440
Nothing ever goes through the lungs.

562
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,820
As a matter of fact, they collapse.

563
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,720
If that happens, if the tissue gets so

564
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,500
thin that it can't support the lungs will

565
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:41,800
collapse.

566
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,340
But anyway, there is no by the way,

567
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,220
in the lungs, there is no you breathe

568
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,480
in oxygen and give off CO2.

569
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,900
That is the dumbest thing you can ever

570
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,680
say.

571
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,120
Once you understand the lungs are completely sealed

572
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,140
or nitrogen breathers.

573
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,700
I know I've gone into this before, not

574
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,800
oxygen breathers, but we do require a certain

575
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,020
content of oxygen.

576
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:01,440
Right.

577
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,660
So, yeah, it's kind of like saltwater fish

578
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,520
or salt swimmers.

579
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,980
No, they're water swimmers.

580
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,540
They just happen to be in saltwater.

581
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,020
We're nitrogen breathers and we just so happen

582
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,960
to need oxygen in that nitrogen.

583
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,580
You see, this is not how it works.

584
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,980
And by the way, whenever you see these

585
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,480
old people or even younger people on pure

586
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,440
oxygen, you're walking around with that tank.

587
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,540
I usually tell them you're going to die

588
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,080
of pneumonia in six months if you keep

589
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:25,520
that up.

590
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,440
And they always do if they keep it

591
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:27,840
up.

592
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,400
Right.

593
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,160
So too much oxygen.

594
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:31,800
Yeah.

595
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,160
What else?

596
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,660
OK, well, it creates oxygen is gravity moves

597
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,620
downward and hydrogen is heavenly.

598
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,360
It goes upward.

599
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,820
Anything that is affected by oxygen goes to

600
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,260
the earth.

601
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,160
What do you what if I said this

602
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,580
guy's going to the earth pretty soon?

603
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,420
Do I have to keep explaining what that

604
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:48,740
means?

605
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:49,040
Right.

606
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,040
If you're going to the earth, most culture

607
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,840
would take anything.

608
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,220
Yeah, you take that as being dead.

609
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:55,440
Yeah.

610
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,940
So the oxygen is earthbound gravity.

611
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:01,140
So take a piece of shiny iron, oxygenate

612
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:01,240
it.

613
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,380
What happens to the rust flakes?

614
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,120
They fall down.

615
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:06,980
Anything you oxygenate, you notice develops an oxygenation

616
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,140
reaction, goes down, falls to the ground.

617
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,900
Hydrogen, on the other hand, goes upward.

618
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:13,280
Right.

619
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:18,320
That's that's how I was explaining an agricultural

620
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,340
meeting recently.

621
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,460
When you go pick an orange off of

622
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,300
a fruit tree, you notice all that water

623
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:24,800
and juice.

624
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,340
These these morons believe that the water is

625
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,920
drawn up through the roots, through the trunk

626
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,800
of the tree, down the branch into the

627
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,140
orange.

628
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,820
That's not what's happening at all.

629
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:34,720
Anyone.

630
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,060
And I like to keep keep it practical.

631
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,680
I tell people you ever cut a tree

632
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,160
down, you ever cut some fresh wood.

633
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,180
Does it ever look like any water can

634
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,860
travel through that with any efficacy at all

635
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,220
to fill that orange?

636
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:47,540
Never.

637
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,480
It's that orange produces its own water.

638
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,580
It's all energetic and the roots are hydrophobic.

639
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,240
If you remove those live roots off the

640
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,000
tree and rinse them off real good, let

641
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,560
them dry a little bit and then spray

642
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,560
them with a water bottle.

643
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,260
Mr. You'll notice the water beads up.

644
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:06,680
Yeah.

645
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,820
On the roots, just like a freshly polished

646
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,520
car hood with wax.

647
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,540
That's hydrophobic.

648
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:13,440
Yeah.

649
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,600
So if they did any absorption, it would

650
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,640
be more like akin to holding up a

651
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,120
dry piece of cotton and misting it with

652
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:22,420
water.

653
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,040
What happens?

654
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,100
It soaks right in.

655
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:24,480
Right.

656
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,560
So or microfiber, there is absolutely no absorption

657
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,840
in the roots.

658
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,720
It's serology.

659
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,480
You could look it up and they show

660
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,060
you the cells.

661
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,420
They are so tightly packed and hydrophobic.

662
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,520
I had a medical person email me about

663
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,980
investigating intestine, stomach and GI tract.

664
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,640
This is Greek.

665
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,200
There's no way that could be absorbed.

666
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,880
As a matter of fact, it is hydrophobic.

667
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,380
Like you said, I was like, well, thank

668
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:47,540
you.

669
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,620
Thanks for checking, checking it out.

670
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,560
So anyway.

671
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,220
Anyway.

672
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,000
So slightly different subject.

673
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,460
Would love to know more about how to

674
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,420
stop income tax being withheld.

675
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,140
Also, is there a process to recoup taxes

676
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,120
already paid?

677
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,260
Yes.

678
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,340
Yes.

679
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,200
They don't like to do that because, OK,

680
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,620
I can give the codes.

681
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,140
Actually, see if I could go find them.

682
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,080
I'll go to the laptop.

683
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,760
I might even switch over audio if we're

684
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,660
going to be on longer because the echo

685
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,440
is really severe.

686
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,780
Like I'm hearing you speak twice.

687
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,100
So I have to filter it out.

688
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:19,960
Sorry about that.

689
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,100
The purpose of taxation as it's an oxymoron,

690
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,320
just like you're always going to be a

691
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,200
taxpayer because they set up the all caps

692
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:27,780
name, not you.

693
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:31,560
They could because they created your legal status,

694
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,680
your legal position, which you can't get out

695
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:33,800
of.

696
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,820
The only way to get out of it

697
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,940
is stop using it.

698
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,600
They could call it whatever.

699
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,440
So you're a taxpayer.

700
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,200
That's just a name.

701
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,160
It's like calling you.

702
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,580
I don't know, a red ball player or

703
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:42,840
whatever.

704
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,820
It doesn't matter.

705
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,120
But the overall purpose of taxation where people

706
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,860
have to participate, by the way, it is

707
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,360
voluntary.

708
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,380
Every time they give a C-SPAN is

709
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,200
good for looking this up, believe it or

710
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,860
not, on YouTube.

711
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,820
Every time a new IRS commissioner is commissioned

712
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:04,520
within the first minute of his new commission

713
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:08,040
acceptance speech, he says, we have a voluntary

714
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:08,580
system.

715
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,960
Otherwise it won't work.

716
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,800
But most people get in trouble.

717
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,000
So they don't know how they get in

718
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,380
trouble and how everyone says it's mandatory.

719
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,140
The purpose of taxation all around is very

720
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:19,580
simple.

721
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,520
It's to take your time away because they

722
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,580
know you're working for it.

723
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,200
If you work for seashells, they would take

724
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,000
seashells.

725
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,900
If you work for frog skins, they would

726
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,460
take that.

727
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:27,760
Right.

728
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,080
They take the reason they're taking your labor

729
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,500
and your time is because this thing called

730
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:38,420
education with a capital C education, because all

731
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,720
of it is about reading and comprehending what

732
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,100
you're reading and actually committing yourself to read.

733
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,000
If you educated yourself on how the system

734
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,940
works, the level of voluntary participation, which most

735
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,380
people think is involuntary, would be very, very

736
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:52,800
low.

737
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,240
It would be so low that would be

738
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,080
your you would have much more free energy

739
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,320
and all that meaning of your own time.

740
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,640
That's the first reason they do it.

741
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,420
The second reason, the second thing about recouping

742
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:07,860
that then you have to be like expert

743
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,280
level on all this.

744
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,560
So a basic novice, that's just, you know,

745
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:16,560
if you might succeed, you will succeed if

746
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,440
you keep it simple.

747
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,000
Having withholdings.

748
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,380
It's very simple.

749
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,820
You will succeed with all that.

750
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,720
But recovering that you would have to be

751
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,340
much more advanced at that because it requires

752
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,940
then shifting things around.

753
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,160
There's something called the palms manual, P.O

754
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,060
.M.S., the public whatever, whatever it's the

755
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,300
P.O.M.S. It's online, but the

756
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,720
one that's online is very heavily abridged.

757
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:46,000
That is the manual that the Social Security

758
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,740
Administration uses to give out so-called benefits.

759
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,340
Right in there, they tell you the right

760
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,920
way to get benefits is to put the

761
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,040
all caps name, the beneficiary into a trust.

762
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:01,360
And then that trust has is managed and

763
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:01,780
administered.

764
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,940
And all of the fees of administrating the

765
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,740
trust and property is sent to the IRS.

766
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,180
So then so let's say if you were

767
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,600
to get a professional trust manager, they charge

768
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,180
like 250 an hour, 250 an hour, usually

769
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:21,380
between four, between, let's say, 250 and 450

770
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:21,980
an hour.

771
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,280
Yes.

772
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:22,760
OK.

773
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,860
And so let's say you're doing that 10

774
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,500
hours a week.

775
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,420
That's forty five hundred a week times 50

776
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:29,940
weeks.

777
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,940
You get into a quarter of a million.

778
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,300
So that's how you recover it.

779
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,740
But to recover it directly is is refi.

780
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,340
You have to do what's called an amended

781
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,020
return.

782
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,920
Right now.

783
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,500
Now it's a full time job.

784
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:50,080
And heart boat heart like the heart and

785
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,660
then boat B.O.A.T. on YouTube.

786
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,660
A little convoluted, but you'll hear some testimonials.

787
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,860
And it's a full time job to do

788
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,180
this.

789
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,440
But let's see.

790
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,380
I'll go into the office here and I'll

791
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:05,360
bring up the code for a very simple

792
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:05,860
statement.

793
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:06,680
And there's two ways.

794
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:10,820
There's several ways to deal with withholding.

795
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,460
The easiest one is the David Merrill go

796
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:18,220
to savings to suitors forum and look around

797
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:18,400
there.

798
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,220
That's where you do a conditional endorsement on

799
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,520
all your financial instruments.

800
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,900
And if taxes taken out, it's refunded plus

801
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,560
five percent.

802
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,200
That's where you make a demand for lawful

803
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:28,760
money.

804
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,640
Twelve USC for 11.

805
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,940
That's all you have to do on the

806
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,300
back of all your written instruments.

807
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,520
And you have to have a written check.

808
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:41,020
I believe that if they do direct deposit,

809
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,900
just go do a screenshot of it.

810
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,260
Make a print print copy of it and

811
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:50,580
write that on the screenshot and predate it.

812
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,680
So if you do is let's say it's

813
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,820
April 1st transfer.

814
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,440
You go ahead and do a screenshot, hit

815
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,980
print on your printer and then put March

816
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,100
31st on it that you made the demand.

817
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:04,740
Right.

818
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,740
OK, let's see if I can find that

819
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,940
channel for testimonials again, though, because you broke

820
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,040
up a little bit during it was a

821
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,540
hard boat or something like that.

822
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:13,840
Yeah.

823
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,600
Heartboat was the YouTube channel.

824
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,120
Heartboat.

825
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:16,480
OK.

826
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:16,980
Yeah.

827
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,320
It's recoupers.

828
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,440
Recoupers is the group.

829
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,300
They're on Telegram.

830
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,760
Talk about a convoluted mess.

831
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,240
People keep saying get on Telegram.

832
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,280
You have to do it on your phone

833
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,080
first and then they send you an email

834
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,620
and then you can go to some site

835
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,160
and then go to their site on the

836
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:30,420
computer.

837
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,520
I was like, you know what?

838
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,140
I'm not making time for that.

839
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:34,460
Sorry.

840
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,260
I have plenty.

841
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,600
Everyone people say I don't have enough time.

842
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,480
All you have is time.

843
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,400
That's all you have.

844
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,780
You have time in a naked body.

845
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,660
That's all you have.

846
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,860
And that you hopefully are clothed occasionally.

847
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,840
And that's all you have.

848
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,880
Some people say I don't have time.

849
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,700
We're not paying attention.

850
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,380
But things do you want to invest your

851
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,280
time into that?

852
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:51,540
Right.

853
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,820
The answer for me would be no.

854
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,880
So let's see if I can find.

855
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,300
Besides, if you really want to social media

856
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,380
outlet, there's a lot easier things to sign

857
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,700
up for that take no time.

858
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,540
So, you know.

859
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:04,660
Yeah.

860
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,040
Yeah.

861
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:09,280
So the easiest thing, by the way, also

862
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:16,120
put in on YouTube 1913 Federal Reserve remedy.

863
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:20,220
David Merrill, you'll get a 30 minute video

864
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,640
that was done 15 years ago.

865
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,760
He goes over it like on a 20th

866
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,280
grade level.

867
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,140
20th grade level is like fifth year in

868
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:26,480
college.

869
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:26,840
Right.

870
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,040
Sixth year in college.

871
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,460
But it's normal.

872
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,720
It would be normally, you know, what people

873
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,640
how people used to converse, let's say, 100

874
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,400
years ago.

875
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,720
He uses big words.

876
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,020
Right.

877
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:42,180
So, yeah, that would be another place to

878
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:42,380
start.

879
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,260
Any time we see if I think I

880
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,600
bookmarked, I think it's on another laptop.

881
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,360
But let's say I'll bring it up in

882
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:48,640
the car.

883
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,440
What anything else in the meantime?

884
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,580
I have a very long comment that I

885
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,740
thought was very solid.

886
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,360
And I wanted to run it by you,

887
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,520
but I don't know if you can put

888
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,180
up with my echo.

889
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,440
Oh, yeah.

890
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,280
The echo is pretty.

891
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,220
OK.

892
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,820
So all medical theories, whether conventional or, quote,

893
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,760
alternative and quote past or current are based

894
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,900
on the concept that disease are, quote, malfunctions

895
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,440
and quote of the organism.

896
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:19,040
Dr. Hamer's H.A.M.E.R. discovery

897
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:23,200
show, however, that nothing in nature is, quote,

898
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:26,880
diseased and quote, but always biologically meaningful.

899
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:31,200
According to the five biological laws, diseases are

900
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,620
not malignancies, as claimed by conventional medicine, but

901
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:38,380
are instead age old biological special programs of

902
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:38,840
nature.

903
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,920
Biological special programs of nature is, in quotes,

904
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,980
created for our survival.

905
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,180
The five biological laws are in perfect harmony

906
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,780
with spiritual laws.

907
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,760
Because of this truth, the Spanish call the

908
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,560
new medicine La Messina Sagrada.

909
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:59,660
Yeah, La Messina Sagrada, the sacred medicine.

910
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,500
OK, I thought that was a good comment.

911
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,680
That's pretty good, right?

912
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,000
Yeah, yeah.

913
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,120
The whole idea.

914
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,280
Let's go back to the.

915
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,040
Everybody knows enough about cars.

916
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:15,180
You're driving down the road, reciprocating engine water

917
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:15,540
cooled.

918
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,680
Your water pump stops working.

919
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,920
Now your engine doesn't cool down.

920
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,420
The engine burns up and seizes.

921
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,600
The pistons get so hot that they actually

922
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,580
bind themselves to the engine block.

923
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:29,700
Right.

924
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,220
So someone, the current disease theory would be

925
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,320
like, oh, the problem is we is the

926
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,540
piston getting stuck to the engine block or

927
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,300
the metal melted.

928
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:37,640
Right.

929
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,060
No.

930
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,380
Well, it all started because a water pump

931
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,060
wasn't working.

932
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:41,360
Right.

933
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,140
So the water pump led to the engine

934
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:44,520
seizing.

935
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,380
You've heard that before.

936
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,220
It's very common.

937
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,480
It used to be common.

938
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,520
I've heard a lot.

939
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,960
And that's just because you didn't have cooling.

940
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,480
It led all the way to these other

941
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,000
disasters.

942
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,040
So the body is very much like that,

943
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,120
but it's also too much energy, not enough

944
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:58,560
energy.

945
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,800
But, you know, you know, I'll just reiterate

946
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,820
something during covid.

947
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:06,240
People have I walked into a place called

948
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,100
Sprouts and this was like two months into

949
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:09,980
the mask mania.

950
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,860
And I'm going to go in without a

951
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:12,180
mask.

952
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,480
And I just march in like, you know,

953
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,900
and I'm halfway into the store.

954
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,680
And a guy comes up, says, you have

955
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,460
to have a mask on.

956
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,660
I said, well, I don't have an immune

957
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,460
system.

958
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,080
Is that a big issue?

959
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:22,940
Is that like a vegan?

960
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,440
Is that like a vegan focused grocery store?

961
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,240
Sprouts or not?

962
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,480
You know, it's like a dish.

963
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,420
It's like a discount version of Whole Foods.

964
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,200
Oh, OK.

965
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,840
It used to be called it used to

966
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,060
be called Sunflower Market.

967
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,380
And yeah, it was it's weird.

968
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,980
This did some weird stuff to the guy

969
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:39,780
who originally owned it.

970
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:44,140
But it's California, Colorado and Arizona.

971
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,340
OK, it's like imagine Whole Foods been to

972
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,960
a Whole Foods, but discounted.

973
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:48,240
Right.

974
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,280
Pretty thankful.

975
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:49,640
Right.

976
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,600
Yeah, that's pretty good.

977
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,140
So so I told him anyway, I don't

978
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,080
have an immune system.

979
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,700
And he took that as I don't need

980
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,420
a mask now.

981
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:59,180
And I would have taken a hundred lie

982
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:02,160
to test detector tests and put my hand

983
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,160
on a stack of Bibles.

984
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,000
And it would show that I'm not lying.

985
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,300
Right.

986
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:05,820
Right.

987
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,280
Because I don't have an immune system.

988
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,740
As a matter of fact, no one does.

989
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,600
There's no such thing.

990
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,500
But anyway, what was cool about it?

991
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:14,460
Everyone's all masked up and I'm walking through

992
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,140
and he's walking me down the aisles, tell

993
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,800
people ahead of me to move away.

994
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,620
And he's asking, what are you here to

995
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,000
get today?

996
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:20,580
I want this.

997
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,640
So he would walk me right to the

998
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:21,820
office.

999
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,020
He's like assistant manager.

1000
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:23,340
Right.

1001
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,120
He knows everything.

1002
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,600
Help me do my shopping.

1003
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,820
He he stopped the line for the cash

1004
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,260
register.

1005
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,800
No more people go to the other register.

1006
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,340
And he had me give it was like,

1007
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,400
oh, my gosh, I got first class treatment,

1008
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,000
got out of it.

1009
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,000
Thank you for coming in.

1010
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:41,220
Right now, most people can't say that confident.

1011
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,860
OK, so if you have an immune system,

1012
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,700
what's the organ for the immune system?

1013
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,600
Huh?

1014
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,500
What?

1015
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,340
Yeah, I thought so.

1016
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,420
There isn't.

1017
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,540
So explain what the immune system does.

1018
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:57,240
Well, you see, Greek, it has antibodies and

1019
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,760
it captures things that are nasty toxins, viruses,

1020
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,560
stuff, and then eliminates them from the body.

1021
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,800
Ah, sounds like.

1022
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,400
So it's basically the elimination system.

1023
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,720
So elimination system.

1024
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,420
We've got kidneys, bladder, liver, large intestine.

1025
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:10,740
Yeah.

1026
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,120
So we do have organs for the elimination

1027
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,600
system, don't we?

1028
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,260
We do.

1029
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,020
Ah.

1030
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,260
So now.

1031
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:20,180
So now immune system equals elimination system.

1032
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,120
How is your elimination system working?

1033
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,580
Like Linda works with people, you know, by

1034
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,500
appointment and stuff.

1035
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,640
And, you know, they have a lot of

1036
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,740
chat to chat times.

1037
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,700
And she says a lot of people she

1038
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,080
talks to when you get health stuff.

1039
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:32,340
Yes.

1040
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,200
How often do you pass a bowel movement?

1041
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,600
Some of them are like once a week,

1042
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,380
twice a week.

1043
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:39,520
Can you imagine all that stuff in there

1044
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,280
was you hear like John Wayne and Elvis

1045
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:41,780
Presley?

1046
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,940
He had like 30 pounds of undigested meat

1047
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:44,660
in his intestines.

1048
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,220
Remember that?

1049
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,540
That was I don't know why they put

1050
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,060
it out there.

1051
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:47,600
Yeah.

1052
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,140
So we're reading about that or hearing it.

1053
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:49,460
Yeah.

1054
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:49,680
Yeah.

1055
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:53,020
Because the the but the opioids that they

1056
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,580
give them arrest the digestion.

1057
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,100
So neurotoxins and food will do that.

1058
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,760
So if you're not eliminating, isn't it the

1059
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,640
same as not taking the garbage out to

1060
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,920
the curb for a long time?

1061
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,460
Right.

1062
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,440
What's the difference?

1063
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:07,800
Right.

1064
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,420
You're going to a really gross house.

1065
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,780
Let's get all the garbage out of here

1066
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,180
first.

1067
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:12,480
Right.

1068
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,140
OK.

1069
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,500
So you're rotting.

1070
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,940
And then, of course, combine that with poor

1071
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:20,280
nutrition coming in in great quantities, really using

1072
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,480
the wrong type of gas in the engine

1073
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,800
and filling up the tank with the wrong

1074
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,520
type of fuel.

1075
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:25,820
Right.

1076
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,200
Imagine.

1077
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:26,760
Yes.

1078
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,420
So this is where this is the rot

1079
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:33,080
and ignorance and destruction of your society is.

1080
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,720
Yeah.

1081
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,100
And the people that are the medical people,

1082
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,420
most of them don't know it because they're

1083
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,680
they're not bad people, but they're not good

1084
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,340
people either.

1085
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,460
That's for sure.

1086
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,040
For sure.

1087
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,480
I can't tell you for sure all the

1088
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,920
people in the medical industry are bad, but

1089
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,240
I can tell you for sure, for sure,

1090
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:49,720
for sure.

1091
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,260
They're not good people.

1092
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,560
And so somewhere else, the people that are

1093
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,960
running them even don't know the stuff we

1094
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,740
discuss here.

1095
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:02,140
It's the people above them and the people

1096
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:02,740
above them.

1097
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,840
And then ultimately you go to the people

1098
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,760
that are running it are not really human

1099
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,360
at all.

1100
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:08,420
All right.

1101
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,600
Like, again, I've mentioned there's no species in

1102
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,139
the universe.

1103
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,500
Let's say in the in the realm, even

1104
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,380
on Earth, that will create a long term

1105
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,880
demise for its own species.

1106
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,860
Can you think of one?

1107
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,800
You might hear about like a spider eating.

1108
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,940
It's that's what the black widow eats her

1109
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,199
mate.

1110
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:26,480
Right.

1111
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:27,699
Right.

1112
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:28,280
Or whatever.

1113
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,620
And you have certain animals that eat their

1114
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,000
young and whatever.

1115
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,260
Or eat the mom or other ones.

1116
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,460
I think when there's some spiders.

1117
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:37,040
Yeah.

1118
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,000
There's a couple of them.

1119
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:39,620
They eat the mother.

1120
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,080
There's a couple of them that, you know,

1121
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:42,880
do a territorial.

1122
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:43,520
Yeah.

1123
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,080
They do a territorial thing, though, where it's

1124
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,260
like there's too many males.

1125
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,800
So they fight with each other and kill

1126
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,300
each other a bit to thin out the

1127
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:50,620
herd.

1128
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:54,120
You can have a species wide.

1129
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,400
But what's going on?

1130
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,320
In other words, with the delusion.

1131
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:58,400
Right.

1132
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:01,300
So at least with those guys, the animals,

1133
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,140
you know, there's no delusion.

1134
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,500
It's well known that they do that.

1135
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:04,760
Right.

1136
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,140
Yeah.

1137
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,420
But the humans are so delusional that they're

1138
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:10,380
going to these, quote unquote, professionals for help.

1139
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,260
I had a legal discussion today with someone

1140
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,860
that didn't want to identify themselves as an

1141
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:18,180
attorney and talk about every time I have

1142
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,540
a discussion with a medical person or an

1143
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,420
attorney, it just.

1144
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,200
Do you remember when you were young and

1145
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,820
you knew a sidewalk was poured and you

1146
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,940
go put your name on it?

1147
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:29,280
Right.

1148
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:29,720
Yeah.

1149
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,280
Or scratch into it or whatever.

1150
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,220
You know, it hardens that.

1151
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,420
It's like every time when I speak about

1152
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:41,080
how horrible the legal financial medical stuff is,

1153
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,780
whenever I speak to one of these people

1154
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,880
that work in it, it helps harden that

1155
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,400
concrete.

1156
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,380
It makes the stuff that I'm saying seem

1157
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,960
even harder, more true, not more true, but

1158
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,180
harder and harder.

1159
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,200
Like like sometimes like maybe I mean too

1160
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,060
harsh on these guys.

1161
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,800
And I get a refresher every so often

1162
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,780
that this is definitely how it is.

1163
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,780
And they're just helping me.

1164
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,940
What would you call solidify the fact, you

1165
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:02,220
know?

1166
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,600
So it's sort of that whole, you know,

1167
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,320
when people show you who they are the

1168
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:10,020
first time, you know, pay attention because it

1169
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,120
doesn't get any better.

1170
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,840
You know, it's that concept.

1171
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,840
It's, you know, if you're right the first

1172
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,080
time, you're going to be right the last

1173
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:17,540
time, too.

1174
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,200
Anyway.

1175
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,360
Well, yeah, that's that's where the thing says

1176
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,580
you don't have to say you're sorry.

1177
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,740
Like very often with people know me for

1178
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,120
a long time.

1179
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,080
I've never said anything to anyone that I

1180
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,640
would take back and say, I'm sorry.

1181
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:32,420
I might maybe now modify the way I

1182
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,160
said it.

1183
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:33,980
Right.

1184
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,780
The way I delivered it, maybe.

1185
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,600
But what I said, no, that still stands.

1186
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,000
You have to be very careful about what

1187
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,440
you say.

1188
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,320
And then, of course, there's stuff like when

1189
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,260
you find a historical thing that you might

1190
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,740
have espoused as it was incorrect.

1191
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,660
And it shouldn't be a surprise, by the

1192
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:48,900
way.

1193
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,820
Then you go back and change and say,

1194
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,020
I was wrong about that.

1195
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:52,220
Right.

1196
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:55,020
But it's still it's not taking it back

1197
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,260
or saying, you know, what do we say?

1198
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,200
Say you're sorry.

1199
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,040
You know, no.

1200
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,360
Everything I've ever said, even when I've called

1201
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,060
people idiots or dumb or whatever.

1202
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:02,680
Yes.

1203
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,180
It took a lot to get me to

1204
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:05,760
that point.

1205
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,040
And, you know, it was well, it was

1206
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,420
may not have been well taken, but it

1207
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,180
was well-deserved.

1208
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,260
Right.

1209
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,060
Anyway, what else?

1210
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,700
All I've ever had to do is modify

1211
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,320
a position on a historical thing.

1212
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,580
You know, I discuss that kind of stuff

1213
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,140
all the time.

1214
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:21,220
And it's like, well, because of this new

1215
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:21,820
information.

1216
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,140
Yes.

1217
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,960
There's more proof of this and that.

1218
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,540
And, OK, I have to adjust a bit,

1219
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,100
but it's never like I don't make sweet.

1220
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:32,260
And it was objective anyway.

1221
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,120
You couldn't you know, you did the best

1222
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:34,960
you could at the time.

1223
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,420
So always do the best you can.

1224
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:40,760
And here's the other kicker is that I've

1225
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,120
been saying the same stuff about the medical

1226
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,720
stuff since the 80s.

1227
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,440
In the 80s, 40 years ago, I said,

1228
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,760
all they do want to do is cut.

1229
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,400
They're going to give you a diagnosis, then

1230
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,000
which is presumption.

1231
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,780
And then they're either going to cut on

1232
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,580
you, burn on you or poison you.

1233
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,580
So take your pick.

1234
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,580
You know, what's funny is there were TV

1235
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,920
characters in the 80s that pretty much were

1236
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,780
echoing what you were saying, but they were

1237
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:06,380
usually portrayed as the, you know, belligerent nut

1238
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,680
job who just didn't want to fight with,

1239
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,320
you know, the good medicine.

1240
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,840
And but they were saying the same exact

1241
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,180
thing.

1242
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,720
It's just that they were then characterized as

1243
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,500
that's the resistant idiot who's going to get

1244
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,120
himself killed because he's not listening to us.

1245
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,980
And I take note of that.

1246
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,820
There was a representative character now and then

1247
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,620
it was usually an older guy, you know,

1248
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,600
and most times they would just, you know,

1249
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,320
act like, oh, well, he was just old

1250
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,620
and ill informed, you know.

1251
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,840
But it turns out he was right.

1252
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,300
Anyways, well, the 80s was a good was

1253
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,240
40 years ago.

1254
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,160
I wouldn't go back there, but I'm glad

1255
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:42,760
I was there.

1256
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:43,620
Exactly.

1257
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,840
So here's something else about the body.

1258
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:48,400
If our bodies are electrical, what is the

1259
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,980
effect of rhythmic breathing?

1260
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:50,700
Question mark.

1261
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:55,040
Would that be something like electrically recharging the

1262
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,080
body, increasing the voltage?

1263
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:57,680
Mark.

1264
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,620
OK, no, it would it would increase the

1265
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:02,280
processes.

1266
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:02,760
Right.

1267
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:05,920
Because when you breathe faster, other things follow

1268
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,320
through.

1269
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:07,720
Right.

1270
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,060
A whole bunch of other things from that

1271
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:10,520
metabolic.

1272
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,940
That's why you have aerobic exercise and anaerobic

1273
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,400
where you can't get enough air.

1274
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,020
Right.

1275
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,960
The electrical part is a substrate.

1276
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:22,080
Don't really be concerned too much about that.

1277
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,340
That takes care of itself.

1278
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,920
It's kind of like your car needs work,

1279
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,780
but you're always just looking at the battery

1280
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,480
fluid and the battery is charged enough.

1281
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:30,980
That's OK.

1282
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:31,380
That's fine.

1283
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,420
And then go to the next thing.

1284
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,600
It's all these other things that are putting

1285
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,280
a drain on the battery or not allowing

1286
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,020
it to recharge.

1287
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:37,440
Right.

1288
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,980
And electricity is a very, very, very touchy

1289
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:45,740
subject because it is not any electricity like

1290
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,720
you'd find in a battery cell of any

1291
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,220
type or coming out of a wall or

1292
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,680
whatever it is.

1293
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,800
All electricity is it's an expression of the

1294
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,600
ether and how it's being pressurized.

1295
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,500
You know, most electricity, except for the chemical

1296
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:05,000
electricity from a battery, is magnetically pressurized.

1297
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,480
And believe it or not, the one even

1298
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,000
that is batteries are designed for tend to

1299
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,340
be magnetically pressurized also, but not like, you

1300
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:16,040
know, a rotating stator like you see on

1301
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:16,720
a generator.

1302
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:22,360
So the more chemical cells, batteries are more

1303
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:26,260
realistic to live, you know, what a body

1304
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,520
is, but not really again.

1305
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,120
Right.

1306
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,420
So it's a complex subject that if I

1307
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,960
I'm going to be going that that road.

1308
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,680
Actually, I had a conversation with someone today.

1309
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,540
There's an energy device that's being used on

1310
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,560
large groups of people for good, by the

1311
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:40,780
way.

1312
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,220
There's a company that is making like if

1313
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,900
you're going to have a big venue, a

1314
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,940
rave or whatever.

1315
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:47,480
Right.

1316
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,900
They set up these devices.

1317
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,000
At least I didn't say scale or neither

1318
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,560
did they.

1319
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:54,020
So good because scalar is an oxymoron when

1320
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,920
it's used to with waves and stuff.

1321
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,000
And he says that it gives you a

1322
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,880
feel good feeling.

1323
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,000
And they want me to look at the

1324
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,660
circuit and transducers.

1325
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,260
And I said, I'll be glad to look

1326
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:03,860
at that shit.

1327
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,740
Who doesn't want to feel good by just

1328
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,080
plugging something into a wall?

1329
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:07,320
Right.

1330
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,360
Other than you know what?

1331
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,660
So I hear you.

1332
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,140
OK.

1333
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,780
Also, this is a follow up from another

1334
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,240
sub subscriber, that is.

1335
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,460
And also on the body, electric can Greek

1336
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,980
comment on the effect of the emo on

1337
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:21,800
our organs.

1338
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,800
And if there is any electrical charge that

1339
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,700
happens between people in conflict that can harm

1340
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,060
us.

1341
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,020
That's a good question.

1342
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:35,540
The emo is created by the the organs,

1343
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,160
by the way, that they would be part

1344
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:38,860
of the generator.

1345
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,840
Because remember, when you set up your body

1346
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,400
to do the emo, you can just think

1347
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:43,820
a thought.

1348
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,560
It has to trigger that feeling also like

1349
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,460
the giving feeling.

1350
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,660
I say gesture a hug.

1351
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,400
And when you feel that feeling that you

1352
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,420
do when you're giving a hug, now you're

1353
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,140
ready to give the giving.

1354
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:54,600
Right.

1355
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,580
And all that.

1356
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,160
So you have to get the body into

1357
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,000
that feeling.

1358
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,000
And that's generated by the organs.

1359
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,860
And I know that when people are missing

1360
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:04,620
organs, you still have a phantom effect from

1361
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:04,820
it.

1362
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,900
You know, but yeah, that's a good question.

1363
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,680
The organs, if you look at them, you

1364
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,340
know, they're very discernible.

1365
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,100
The kidney cells are very different from any

1366
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:13,700
other organ.

1367
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,980
And liver cells are different from so on

1368
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:16,640
and so forth.

1369
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,900
It's almost as if a group of aliens

1370
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,540
got together to cooperate, to work inside of

1371
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:21,640
you.

1372
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,760
That's how strange they are.

1373
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,100
Right.

1374
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,620
So but the charging and all that, the

1375
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:32,500
Tai Chi, Qigong fighting method, which is there

1376
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,980
is no way of doing it.

1377
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:36,160
There is no it's not like practice this

1378
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,080
like a Kido or Tai or karate.

1379
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,640
The Qigong is to borrow as much energy

1380
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,140
as you need to focus where you need

1381
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:44,320
it.

1382
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:49,000
So, for example, if you're in a conflict,

1383
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,500
an armed conflict, a physical conflict with someone

1384
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:55,060
and there's people watching, you draw the energy

1385
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:57,980
from all the people watching around you to

1386
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:00,240
yourself and then focus it out towards what

1387
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,440
you want to focus on doing.

1388
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:01,740
Right.

1389
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:02,280
Right.

1390
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,160
We're not on YouTube, so I could say.

1391
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,100
So if you want to knock the guy

1392
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,360
down, you're going to have to go after

1393
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,020
his legs.

1394
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,240
It's a lot easier to knock someone down

1395
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,400
by attacking below the knees than hitting him

1396
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,020
on the shoulder.

1397
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,300
Hitting someone on the shoulder is not going

1398
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:16,880
to knock him down.

1399
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:18,120
Hitting them below the knees will.

1400
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:20,580
So you start portioning off where you're going

1401
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:21,400
to send that energy.

1402
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:24,540
Now, let's say you're alone with someone and

1403
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,620
you want to you're on the defensive or

1404
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:30,040
the offensive and there's no people around to

1405
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:30,760
take energy from.

1406
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:31,800
You take it from the tree.

1407
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:33,220
Right.

1408
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:35,800
You can take and say there's no trees

1409
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,680
and there's parked cars.

1410
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,340
You take it from the car engine, the

1411
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:40,740
residual field of energy that was around the

1412
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:41,300
car engine.

1413
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:43,940
And when you're training for Qi Gong and

1414
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:47,060
Tai Chi, you train yourself to draw energy

1415
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:49,280
off of your surroundings and then focus it.

1416
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:51,360
Isn't there an X-Men that does that?

1417
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:51,720
No.

1418
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:54,940
X-Men seem to be autonomously powered, aren't

1419
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:55,120
they?

1420
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,920
Well, no, there is.

1421
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,320
There is an X-Men.

1422
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:00,340
Magneto?

1423
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,820
He draws from his environment?

1424
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:02,740
He draws.

1425
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,940
He can manipulate metal.

1426
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,220
So metal is something that he can just

1427
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:08,800
choose to move and pressurize.

1428
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,380
But there are others.

1429
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,780
There's a big, wide range of them.

1430
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:15,200
So there are others that actually draw in

1431
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,640
all of the stuff.

1432
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,560
There's ones that draw from the ether.

1433
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,920
There's ones that draw from other X-Men.

1434
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:23,480
There's ones that draw, you know, like the

1435
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,400
one guy can draw from everybody's mind.

1436
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,000
It depends.

1437
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,720
They all have different sources, actually.

1438
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:31,640
They're conduits of all sorts.

1439
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,880
So this ties in with the emo, ties

1440
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,980
in with the...

1441
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:39,060
everything is tied in.

1442
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,160
That's the whole thing about Qi Gong, Qi

1443
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:41,720
Gong Tai Chi.

1444
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:44,100
I think Bruce Lee in his final days

1445
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,560
was talking about it, but he couldn't really

1446
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,740
put much forward because there's nothing to put

1447
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:49,020
forward.

1448
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:52,120
Everyone does it differently when you get into

1449
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:52,440
Qi Gong.

1450
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,980
Now in the secret schools, which you will

1451
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:55,860
be...

1452
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,040
If you've learned what they teach in the

1453
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,740
secret schools and you start teaching it without

1454
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,320
permission, you will be taken out.

1455
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,640
They will send an assassin after you.

1456
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,080
They could probably even do it remotely.

1457
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,720
Actually, some of the things they do teach

1458
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,060
in the secret schools is to do it

1459
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:09,500
remotely.

1460
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,840
I've been accused of teaching stuff in the

1461
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,620
secret schools, and I never was in the

1462
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:16,000
secret schools, so I guess I'm okay.

1463
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:17,960
Yeah, it's funny you bring up Bruce Lee

1464
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,820
because toward the end of his life, one

1465
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:21,480
of the things he was talking about is

1466
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:25,020
how energy is extended beyond your hand.

1467
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:28,420
It's not necessarily your fist making contact and

1468
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:28,840
stuff like...

1469
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,340
He was trying to explain that to people,

1470
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,400
that there is...

1471
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,700
It's rivers of energy.

1472
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:36,260
You want to tap into a river of

1473
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:36,660
it, yeah.

1474
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:38,340
And then there's...

1475
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:40,020
to get more...

1476
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,540
I dare say I'm going to do a

1477
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,920
webinar on Qi Gong and how to...

1478
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,620
I haven't...

1479
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:48,260
I have so many things to talk about.

1480
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:50,660
But I think we do well here on

1481
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:51,280
the Sonics.

1482
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:55,440
But that's a whole discussion because it's so

1483
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:55,900
subtle.

1484
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,320
And when you realize...

1485
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,320
well, it's like the weather stuff.

1486
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:00,660
How are you going to...

1487
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,220
the weather stuff is a Qi Gong thing.

1488
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,080
You have this hollow pipe that's grounded.

1489
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:07,100
How does it affect thousands of square miles

1490
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,140
of atmosphere, right?

1491
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:13,040
It behooves anyone to think about, but you

1492
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,060
know it works.

1493
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:17,240
It's scientifically proven, you know, on your own.

1494
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:19,080
You can't go to these scientists, you know.

1495
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,220
The real scientists are the ones...

1496
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:22,920
The real scientists that are employed are the

1497
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,120
ones with sledgehammers to go around and destroy

1498
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,300
what doesn't conform to their bullshit, right?

1499
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:27,840
Right.

1500
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,640
But the Tai Chi Qi Gong, that's a

1501
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:34,920
very, very personal thing.

1502
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,100
All you could teach is the concept.

1503
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:39,900
There's no method to teach.

1504
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:42,080
The best thing about the way how you

1505
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,880
advance Qi Gong is by getting the people

1506
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,680
to understand what it is, giving them some

1507
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,180
hints on what you know, and then seeing

1508
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,780
what they come up with, and then add

1509
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:51,640
that to your toolbox.

1510
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:54,280
So if you were doing Tai Chi or

1511
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:57,180
Qi Gong practice with 10 people, and you

1512
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,580
did it properly, you would have 10 different

1513
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:02,820
ways of doing something very soon, where initially

1514
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,320
you only had one, right?

1515
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:05,980
Yeah.

1516
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,380
And how are you going to teach this

1517
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:09,460
to a society that is designed to be

1518
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:13,680
enslaved in a school system that teaches you

1519
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,220
that you're worth nothing, and everything goes by

1520
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:18,300
the bell, and you're always looking for approval,

1521
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,660
and you're being degraded by being graded, right?

1522
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:22,080
Right.

1523
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:23,360
Remember we used to talk about that a

1524
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:23,500
lot?

1525
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:24,140
Absolutely.

1526
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,560
You know, it's very much that Eastern concept

1527
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:30,400
of being a teacher and a student simultaneously,

1528
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:34,260
which people misunderstand because of poor translation, number

1529
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:34,520
one.

1530
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,120
But number two, they can't wrap their minds

1531
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:36,580
around that.

1532
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:37,680
If you're there to teach, you're there to

1533
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:37,880
teach.

1534
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,060
If you're there to learn, you're there to

1535
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:39,260
learn.

1536
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:43,620
There's actually a process where that doesn't necessarily

1537
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:45,200
stand, that that's all you do.

1538
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:48,660
Well, here's the thing.

1539
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,740
I got into education for a little while,

1540
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:55,880
and it's such an oxymoron because it's a

1541
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:59,840
severe oxymoron, because children, like it or not,

1542
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,820
let's say children in an open environment, right?

1543
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:02,980
You just go to a place, you drop

1544
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,560
children by themselves, nothing else.

1545
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:07,580
They are ready to soak up everything.

1546
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:09,020
They are learning machines.

1547
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:13,420
They are learning machines from 3, 4, even

1548
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:14,660
2 years old and on.

1549
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:18,920
I've seen 2-, 3-year-olds hang out

1550
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,460
with the 4-, 5-year-olds, 6-, 7

1551
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:22,040
-year-olds, and they're all into what you're

1552
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:22,580
doing, right?

1553
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:26,040
So they are learning machines more than anything

1554
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:26,680
else, right?

1555
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:28,640
And yet there's a problem on how to

1556
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:29,120
teach them?

1557
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,260
Come on, guys.

1558
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:33,680
The problem is how do you get them

1559
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,160
to all uniformly conform to a system that

1560
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:41,120
objectifies them into nothing, right, and has them

1561
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,420
always looking for approval?

1562
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,420
Well, if you think carefully about the stacking

1563
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:47,860
questions that are constantly brought up, right, the

1564
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:50,520
2-year-old that keeps asking why, how,

1565
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:54,120
they're asking a profound thing, and they're connecting

1566
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:56,460
things together, and you're literally teaching, but what

1567
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:01,240
happens is the adult gets exhausted from answering.

1568
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,480
Because that's what they do.

1569
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,320
They're like kittens and puppies.

1570
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:05,340
They're learning machines.

1571
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,220
They want to get into everything.

1572
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,400
That's why with the animals here, whenever I

1573
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,180
bring something new, like I open a jar

1574
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:13,000
of something I haven't opened in a while,

1575
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,520
they're all like, what are you doing?

1576
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,100
And it's like they're afraid to come over.

1577
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:18,840
Is it dangerous?

1578
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,120
So what I do is I calmly show

1579
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,020
them very slowly and let them sniff it

1580
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:23,980
and look at it, and then they turn

1581
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:24,280
away.

1582
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:25,720
They're like, oh, thanks for showing that.

1583
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:26,580
I never saw that before.

1584
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,800
Thanks a lot, like I tell Linda all

1585
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,140
the time.

1586
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:32,040
These cats, they like to learn.

1587
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:34,060
So educate them, always educating them.

1588
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:36,440
Something new, whatever, you'll show them very calmly

1589
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,520
because if you don't present it to them,

1590
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:41,100
you notice how they take a cautionary stance

1591
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,060
when they're trying to figure out what it

1592
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:43,340
is.

1593
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:45,400
It's like, yeah, let's just teach them.

1594
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:46,740
Just bring it right over and say, hey,

1595
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:47,900
this is what this is, and they're like,

1596
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:50,400
oh, cool, walk right away, just like children.

1597
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,180
Pretty much.

1598
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,020
Children are learning machines.

1599
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:56,240
All they want to do is learn constantly,

1600
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,120
and it's such an oxymoron.

1601
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,520
Education is how do we teach children?

1602
00:49:59,560 --> 00:49:59,900
What do you mean?

1603
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:00,780
You don't have to do anything.

1604
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,560
You just have to accommodate their physical size.

1605
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,940
If you're working on something that's tall, you

1606
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:07,260
have to pick them up to see it.

1607
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,660
If something's too big and too heavy, don't

1608
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:10,620
let them carry it.

1609
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:13,200
Just accommodate them in the slightest ways.

1610
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,900
It's incredible to me how they can say

1611
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:20,480
we have a problem in education with beings

1612
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,680
that all they want to do is be

1613
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:22,140
educated.

1614
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,720
That's all they do.

1615
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,620
Yeah, and Tonya, it couldn't get any sicker

1616
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:27,060
than that.

1617
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:27,620
You know what I mean?

1618
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:28,240
Exactly.

1619
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,640
It's like how do we give water to

1620
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:30,440
thirsty people?

1621
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,640
All these people are so thirsty.

1622
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:32,560
How are we going to get them to

1623
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:33,000
drink water?

1624
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:34,060
You don't have to do anything.

1625
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,000
Just present them with the water.

1626
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,240
Everything's already in place.

1627
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:38,980
God damn it.

1628
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:40,120
They're really bad.

1629
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:40,680
Fair enough.

1630
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:41,460
Really bad shape.

1631
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:45,360
Some episodes ago, O and G mentioned doing

1632
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,540
a home ec show.

1633
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:47,440
Excuse me.

1634
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:49,120
The wife and I are eager to act

1635
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:50,520
on that info.

1636
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:54,500
We're up on universal principles for diet and

1637
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:56,400
lawful behavior and timekeeping.

1638
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:00,920
Broaching finances now, I guess, in more home

1639
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:01,600
ecs next.

1640
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:03,420
Thanks for the efforts.

1641
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:04,580
Yeah.

1642
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:05,300
Okay.

1643
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,960
Yeah, I'll bring up something on the home

1644
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:09,240
ec.

1645
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,420
I've noticed this because I've been moving stuff

1646
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:13,140
around, doing preparations and things.

1647
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,480
If you live in a tight space or

1648
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,540
not, I've found this with people who have

1649
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,960
property or an outdoor space, if you have

1650
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,940
these commercial cleaning chemicals or chemicals in the

1651
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:25,200
house, put them outside.

1652
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:30,560
If you have any substances, chemicals, cleaning, or

1653
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:33,580
otherwise that that company is being traded on

1654
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:35,860
the stock market, just put it that way.

1655
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,500
It shouldn't be in your house.

1656
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:41,980
What I've been doing is you do, like,

1657
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:43,100
for example, here I have what I call

1658
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:43,520
the chemical.

1659
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,360
Where's the polish for this?

1660
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,460
It's in the chemical cabinet.

1661
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:47,360
That's outside.

1662
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,200
And I could go out there and it'll

1663
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,860
be like car wax, detergents, laundry soap, all

1664
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:53,360
outside.

1665
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:55,740
The importance of that is this.

1666
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,320
You ever walk down a supermarket aisle where

1667
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:57,980
the soaps are?

1668
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:00,280
If I blindfolded you and asked you to

1669
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,060
guess what aisle, where are you, you'd be

1670
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:03,400
able to guess right on, right?

1671
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:04,160
Oh, yeah.

1672
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,840
Because you smell bleach.

1673
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:06,480
It's degassing.

1674
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:09,400
Yeah, you smell bleach and you smell all

1675
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:09,840
that stuff.

1676
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:13,540
Well, it's an all mixed together flavor montage.

1677
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:14,640
You know it's chemical.

1678
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,640
So you're breathing this indoors.

1679
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:19,760
And what I used to do when I

1680
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,800
lived in Manhattan and New York, I had

1681
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,220
a milk crate with a cover on it

1682
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:24,420
and I would put it on the fire

1683
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:24,740
escape.

1684
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,220
And sometimes you'd come back and the whole

1685
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:26,960
thing would be gone.

1686
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:28,840
That's when it was more of a rough

1687
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:29,240
neighborhood.

1688
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:31,840
But usually they respected stuff on the fire

1689
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:32,120
escape.

1690
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,380
It was like an unwritten rule.

1691
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:34,940
You leave people's shit alone when it's on

1692
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:35,620
the fire escape.

1693
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,560
Or the landlord says you have to move

1694
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,960
that because the fire department is going to

1695
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:39,640
give me a fine.

1696
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,520
Or you put it, if you have a

1697
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,120
walk up, you go all the way to

1698
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,620
the top where the exit is, you put

1699
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:46,700
it in a box up there.

1700
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,700
The other thing you could do is box

1701
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:50,380
it up and have a hose that vents

1702
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:51,600
it out near a window.

1703
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:53,440
But you don't want to vent it out

1704
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:53,880
in the window.

1705
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,780
That's also going to suck the fresh air

1706
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:56,180
in.

1707
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,940
But putting chemicals and things outside, like I

1708
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:00,620
have a cabinet with various glues, like what

1709
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:02,420
they call crazy glue and other things like

1710
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:02,740
that.

1711
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:04,620
And now I put it in a mason

1712
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:06,880
jar, which has a seal on it.

1713
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:09,000
And when I open it to get the

1714
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,340
crazy glue out, there is the strongest fumes

1715
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:12,480
of crazy glue.

1716
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,460
And that would have been leaking into your

1717
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:15,520
apartment or house.

1718
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,200
It probably makes a noise from the pressure

1719
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,320
release because it's been building up those fumes

1720
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:20,900
in there, right?

1721
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:22,800
Not that much.

1722
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,600
No, it's just a very strong fume.

1723
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,440
It equalizes pressure.

1724
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:30,880
The noise would be, you'd have to make

1725
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,760
it really hot or really cold difference where

1726
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,540
the vacuum would build up on either side.

1727
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,040
But what I'm saying is most of the

1728
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:41,960
problems, especially when they're building these ticky-tacky

1729
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,560
houses, these subdivisions, houses that were built after

1730
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:47,900
the 1960s or 70s, yes, it's that much

1731
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:48,540
of a problem.

1732
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:51,620
You must leave a window slightly open, even

1733
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:52,880
if you're in a cold place.

1734
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:55,700
As a matter of fact, these new homes,

1735
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:59,240
they make these special bathroom fans, these little

1736
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,420
fancy-using bathrooms that go up on the

1737
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:03,260
top floor, and they're designed to run 24

1738
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:03,740
-7.

1739
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:05,800
And the reason they do that is so

1740
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:08,520
the inhabitants in these homes don't die because

1741
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:11,440
the homes are made of 20% formaldehyde,

1742
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:14,620
meaning all the particle board and composite boards

1743
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:17,580
are up to 20% formaldehyde.

1744
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:21,300
So embalming materials, very toxic ureas and things

1745
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:21,820
like that.

1746
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:24,080
So most of the elements you see in

1747
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:26,380
suburbia are because the houses are not ventilated.

1748
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:29,920
Also, when the houses are shut down too

1749
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,320
tight, these super-insulated houses, you get these

1750
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:35,860
weird strains of mold that only grow in

1751
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:38,380
those conditions that you would find, like, growing

1752
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:41,060
in a cavern or something combined with the...

1753
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:43,180
So what I'm trying to say is fresh

1754
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:48,320
air exchange and things that are outgassing should

1755
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,080
be away from your living space.

1756
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,660
And I've been experimenting with that lately, like

1757
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:55,960
putting certain things with VOCs, volatile organic compounds,

1758
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:58,000
in mason jars and then opening them not

1759
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,440
much later, and you could see the fumes

1760
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:01,420
that come out of there.

1761
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,420
So you're actually toxifying yourself.

1762
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:08,400
Now, fortunately, not enough people are dropping dead

1763
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,940
for them to do anything about it, but

1764
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:13,400
I think enough people are getting ill or

1765
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,700
toxified from it.

1766
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:17,740
But the home economic thing basically is to

1767
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:21,060
be clean in your home, and it doesn't

1768
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:22,080
mean using chemicals.

1769
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:24,140
Most white Americans think being clean is going

1770
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:26,220
and buying these chemicals with companies traded on

1771
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:28,960
the stock market, you know, that toxic stuff,

1772
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:30,040
synthetic.

1773
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,080
No, it's water, use of water.

1774
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,080
Just most of the time, like, give you

1775
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:35,440
an example.

1776
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:37,020
When I mop here, I have all tile

1777
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:40,100
floor, all resilient floor, and stained concrete in

1778
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:41,020
the back bedrooms.

1779
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:42,560
No carpeting.

1780
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,700
We have area rugs, but no carpeting.

1781
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,900
When I mop the floor, I use something

1782
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:48,780
called ship shape.

1783
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:51,940
It's like a yellow powder, or I use

1784
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:54,500
a little bit of a dishwashing liquid.

1785
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:56,280
You could even use, like, a hair shampoo,

1786
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:56,920
by the way.

1787
00:55:57,260 --> 00:55:58,760
You just need a little surfactant.

1788
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,720
And when I mop, I do the soap

1789
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:01,920
once.

1790
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:04,000
The next time I mop, I just use

1791
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,460
plain water to get any residue that was

1792
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:07,720
up there.

1793
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,760
So every time I mop the floor, I

1794
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:12,240
only use a soap every other time.

1795
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,680
How many times have you heard, especially in

1796
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,440
commercial floors, oh, we got to come in

1797
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,720
and strip these floors and repolish them, right,

1798
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:21,560
because they get soap buildup and wax buildup,

1799
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:21,840
right?

1800
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:24,500
I've noticed that most people, when they're clean,

1801
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:25,980
they use soap every time.

1802
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:27,780
Try to use it every other time.

1803
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:29,560
Believe it or not, if you have a

1804
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,660
clean enough diet, all you need is water

1805
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:33,480
to clean your clothes, unless you have grease

1806
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,380
and grime that the soap needs to release.

1807
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,600
And I used to tell people, when you

1808
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,080
do your laundry, go ahead and do your

1809
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:41,960
laundry without any soap, and then open the

1810
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:43,660
wash and look inside and see how sudsy

1811
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:46,380
it is, even without the soap, right?

1812
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:50,020
So I only got two more pieces left

1813
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:50,260
here.

1814
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:51,260
Let's see.

1815
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:54,240
Is the weight loss jab phenomenon happening now,

1816
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,680
part of the setup for the, quote, perfect

1817
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:01,720
society, unquote, before the glitches, question mark?

1818
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,140
I see it as a poison being presented

1819
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:06,540
as a good thing, so a prank for

1820
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:06,920
sure.

1821
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:09,860
What was the first part?

1822
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:11,040
That goes really intense.

1823
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:11,260
Go ahead.

1824
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,420
What was the first part of the question?

1825
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:12,860
Sorry.

1826
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:16,940
Is the weight loss jab phenomenon happening now,

1827
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:17,960
part of the setup?

1828
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:20,280
I'm not aware of it.

1829
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:26,460
The weight loss phenomenon being recently, or since

1830
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:29,620
we first came out back in the 70s?

1831
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:30,420
No, no, no.

1832
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,580
This is new stuff where there's these injections

1833
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:36,320
like Ozempic and stuff like that.

1834
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:37,800
Oh, my gosh.

1835
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:39,580
Well, thankfully, we'll put it this way.

1836
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,760
Thankfully, I don't think any humans are taking

1837
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,040
that next question.

1838
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:43,800
Okay.

1839
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,120
In other words, you have to be so

1840
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:47,460
removed from your humanity to fall for something

1841
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:47,960
like that.

1842
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:49,480
I never want to even address it.

1843
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:50,220
Okay.

1844
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:50,920
Fair enough.

1845
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:54,280
But it is rather commonplace among the masses,

1846
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,980
so to speak, just so you know.

1847
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:58,440
It's a good, but not to discount the

1848
00:57:58,440 --> 00:57:59,740
effort of the question.

1849
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:00,560
It's great.

1850
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,760
Thank you for asking, because I didn't know.

1851
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:05,340
I mean, if you, yes, other people, look,

1852
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:08,460
there's even people that, men that want to

1853
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:09,880
be women and women that want to be

1854
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:10,180
men.

1855
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:12,060
I mean, you know how deranged that is?

1856
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,000
Yeah, but that's.

1857
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:14,800
You know, we're two different species.

1858
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,160
But no matter what.

1859
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:17,120
That's like saying I want to be a

1860
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:17,460
dog.

1861
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:18,480
Yeah, but no matter what.

1862
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,180
No matter how they try to amplify that,

1863
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:22,880
that's still a small number in the in,

1864
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:24,460
you know, among the masses.

1865
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:25,260
This is epic.

1866
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,460
Thing is large.

1867
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:30,240
There are people even like creating compounding facilities

1868
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,680
to try and make the stuff cheaper and

1869
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,380
everything else, which the drug companies.

1870
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:34,980
Oh, yeah.

1871
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:36,720
I mean, it's it's a very large.

1872
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:37,720
Most.

1873
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:38,820
Yeah.

1874
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:39,320
Unless.

1875
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:39,680
Okay.

1876
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:41,520
There's two types of weight gain.

1877
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:44,200
One is because you're malnourished and the body's

1878
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:47,040
like we need to store up somehow because

1879
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,360
we're not getting any nourishment.

1880
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:50,200
We're actually in a famine condition.

1881
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,640
So we need to store up.

1882
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:52,160
Okay.

1883
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:52,460
Right.

1884
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:53,940
Because the food that's coming in has so

1885
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:54,680
little nutrition.

1886
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:56,600
And the other one is that you're eating

1887
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,620
food that is so rich in nutrition that

1888
00:58:58,620 --> 00:58:59,640
you're getting fat.

1889
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:00,040
Right.

1890
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:01,380
How do you discern the two?

1891
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:02,100
Very simple.

1892
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:03,880
Just ask them what they eat.

1893
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:04,780
You're right.

1894
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:07,660
You know, I have pepperoni pizza and Diet

1895
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:07,920
Coke.

1896
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,020
Why am I gaining weight?

1897
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:09,340
Right.

1898
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:11,960
So, yeah, that's well.

1899
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:15,340
So years ago, gaining weight was a sign

1900
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:15,880
of wealth.

1901
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:16,220
Right.

1902
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:16,720
You know that.

1903
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:16,920
Right.

1904
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:17,380
Oh, yeah.

1905
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:20,960
So everybody was skinny at a point.

1906
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:23,520
And they actually had, you know, look, she's

1907
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,600
a nice thick girl.

1908
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:24,900
Right.

1909
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:25,660
Or a thick boy.

1910
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:27,300
They're very well taken care of.

1911
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:27,580
Yeah.

1912
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:28,420
So they're well fed.

1913
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:29,480
They obviously have money.

1914
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:29,880
It's bizarre.

1915
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:30,280
Yeah.

1916
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:31,160
No, definitely.

1917
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,800
But I'm just saying it's much like much

1918
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,520
like that trend you were thinking of with

1919
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,860
the diet pills and all that and the

1920
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:38,780
diet systems.

1921
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:39,480
Yeah.

1922
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,400
This thing is new in that it's just

1923
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,540
an injection like there's nothing else.

1924
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:45,380
It's just inject yourself with this.

1925
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:46,500
I get it.

1926
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:48,900
I get the injection part.

1927
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:49,560
I get it.

1928
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:50,000
Fine.

1929
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:51,580
But let me just say it like this.

1930
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:53,540
Thankfully, there aren't any humans that have gotten

1931
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:53,900
it yet.

1932
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:54,860
There you go.

1933
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:55,600
All right.

1934
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:56,560
So last one.

1935
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:57,540
Last one.

1936
00:59:57,620 --> 00:59:58,800
And this is quite a doozy.

1937
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:00,220
Greetings, Chuck.

1938
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:00,620
In Greek.

1939
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:03,460
Can you please elaborate on how Christianity is

1940
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:04,120
satanic?

1941
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:06,580
Hmm.

1942
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,080
Adversarial to the scriptures.

1943
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:08,820
Yes.

1944
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,480
Satan means adversary.

1945
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:10,960
Right.

1946
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:13,460
So satanic would be your.

1947
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:15,720
See, Satan is very simple.

1948
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:17,440
It's when it should be black.

1949
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:18,500
It tells you make it white.

1950
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:19,840
When it's to go up, it tells you

1951
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:20,460
make it down.

1952
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:21,860
It's not this Hollywood thing.

1953
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:22,180
Right.

1954
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:22,660
Right.

1955
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:24,780
It's just adversarial.

1956
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:27,820
So like, you know, you should be going

1957
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:28,220
to the right.

1958
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:29,440
He tells you to go to the left.

1959
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:30,420
Absolutely.

1960
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:31,240
Satanic.

1961
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:32,200
And from that respect.

1962
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:34,240
Now, you can take that on a broad

1963
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:36,940
term where you have a character that brings

1964
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:40,420
other specific things like disease and whatever else

1965
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:40,980
like that.

1966
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:42,640
You know, you could say that goes on

1967
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,000
there, too, because if you look at the

1968
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,580
Christians, they're tied in with the medical industry.

1969
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:46,920
Right.

1970
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:47,480
Very much.

1971
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:48,040
Absolutely.

1972
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:48,820
And the political.

1973
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:50,400
Every time you go to church, they tell

1974
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,800
you, pay your taxes and go see the

1975
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:52,200
doctor.

1976
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,200
So they're satanic for disease.

1977
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:55,440
Yeah, it's pretty satanic.

1978
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:55,880
All right.

1979
01:00:57,360 --> 01:01:01,140
And but the only thing is, I don't

1980
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:01,340
know.

1981
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:04,000
I would say that it has to do

1982
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,960
with that's what happens when you don't study

1983
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:07,440
and read.

1984
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:10,980
There's there's an emphasis on gaining knowledge in

1985
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:12,200
all the ancient writs.

1986
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:12,640
Right.

1987
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,020
And one of the things, if you go

1988
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:18,260
to the biblical narrative, how many times does

1989
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:20,520
it say to gain knowledge and to study?

1990
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:22,660
I mean, I don't have a number on

1991
01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:24,300
it, but it's dozens of times, if not

1992
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:25,560
100 times at least.

1993
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:26,000
Right.

1994
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:27,860
And what do the Christians do?

1995
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:28,940
They just told to believe.

1996
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:32,940
So it's definitely satanic adversarial to what you're

1997
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:33,860
supposed to be doing.

1998
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:34,320
For sure.

1999
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,400
It's just a control mechanism.

2000
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:41,540
It's very cheap because anytime you want to

2001
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:43,960
control people, you want to before you set

2002
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:46,620
out on doing that, you want to figure

2003
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:48,300
out how much you have to invest into

2004
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:49,880
a control apparatus, don't you?

2005
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:50,500
Of course.

2006
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:54,100
So if you have something like Christianity, that's

2007
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:55,860
a marvelous control apparatus.

2008
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:56,680
And guess what?

2009
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,440
How much do you have to invest in

2010
01:01:58,440 --> 01:01:58,920
that?

2011
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,900
You tell the followers to pay for it

2012
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:05,500
to donate 10 percent or whatever.

2013
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:06,580
So you couldn't end it with a more

2014
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:07,400
perfect system.

2015
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:07,640
Yeah.

2016
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:10,180
It's kind of like I was discussing some

2017
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:10,600
finance.

2018
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:12,480
You know, anyone who has a checking account,

2019
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:16,300
anyone who has a checking account, a regular

2020
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:20,860
one, is paying 100 percent bank fees, 100

2021
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:21,340
percent.

2022
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:23,120
So when you write a check to someone

2023
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:26,180
for one hundred dollars, when that person, that

2024
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:27,980
someone gets the check and they endorse it

2025
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:29,620
and there are two signatures on that instrument

2026
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:31,320
and there's a date and the number, the

2027
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:33,560
amount is written out in words, blah, blah,

2028
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:55,760
blah, blah, blah,

2029
01:02:55,900 --> 01:03:03,740
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

2030
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:06,320
blah, blah, blah, blah, of giving you 100

2031
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:09,540
percent fees on my checks, let's make it

2032
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:11,500
10 percent according to like what state the

2033
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:12,580
state law suggests.

2034
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:14,300
So in other words, you would write a

2035
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:17,100
check for one hundred dollars to someone and

2036
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:18,540
you go back to your account and they

2037
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:21,020
took out ten dollars instead of one hundred.

2038
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:22,260
How about that?

2039
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:24,560
It doesn't take a genius to figure that

2040
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:24,780
out.

2041
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:27,140
Just go read about what negotiable instruments are.

2042
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:32,620
blah, blah, blah, UCC, you know, 3-104,

2043
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:36,380
all these little simple acts, Federal Reserve Acts,

2044
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:37,300
right?

2045
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:37,760
Right.

2046
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:38,780
And go to your bank.

2047
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:39,400
Yeah.

2048
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,560
Your bank statement doesn't say we get 100

2049
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:44,680
percent fees, 100 percent checking fees.

2050
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:45,540
No.

2051
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:48,260
They just say you're giving us all security

2052
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:49,940
and just giving us all of it, bitch.

2053
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:50,700
Right.

2054
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:51,900
So how about write a letter to them

2055
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:53,280
amending the terms of service?

2056
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:54,540
How about you guys?

2057
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:55,180
Let's start off.

2058
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:56,680
Take 10 percent on my checking.

2059
01:03:57,060 --> 01:03:57,160
All right.

2060
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:58,340
So I write a check for a thousand

2061
01:03:58,340 --> 01:03:58,700
bucks.

2062
01:03:58,820 --> 01:03:59,600
You take out 100.

2063
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:01,800
Or if I write a check for 900

2064
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,020
bucks, you take out 90.

2065
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:03,640
How's that?

2066
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,280
Isn't that more reasonable, people?

2067
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:08,560
Because when you send someone an instrument that

2068
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:11,260
says pay to the order of electronic also.

2069
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:12,000
Right.

2070
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:15,840
And the funds are created.

2071
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:21,740
The accounting credit on account is credited when

2072
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:23,520
the person on the other end endorses it.

2073
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:27,160
Also, is there anything that I said that

2074
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:28,700
an eighth grader couldn't be explained?

2075
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:29,020
Was it?

2076
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:29,480
Where is it?

2077
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:29,800
Remember?

2078
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:31,000
And it was at the eighth grade.

2079
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:32,980
They showed you how to write a check,

2080
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:34,940
how to write numbers with words.

2081
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,280
Remember that on the blackboard?

2082
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:36,820
Oh, yeah.

2083
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:37,120
Yeah.

2084
01:04:37,180 --> 01:04:38,460
That was earlier than that.

2085
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:39,800
I think it was seventh or eighth grade.

2086
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:40,160
Yeah.

2087
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:41,880
Well, you one day you'll get a check.

2088
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:42,800
You have to write a check.

2089
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,260
Now, write this out, please.

2090
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:44,500
Right.

2091
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:44,680
Yeah.

2092
01:04:44,860 --> 01:04:46,620
On the blackboard or whatever.

2093
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:47,240
Yeah.

2094
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:48,340
Why don't they tell you that?

2095
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:49,640
By the way, they're going to be doing

2096
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:51,360
100 percent fees on your checking.

2097
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:52,820
Well, they don't say that part.

2098
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:53,600
Yeah.

2099
01:04:53,740 --> 01:04:55,340
But the thing that I remember this.

2100
01:04:55,540 --> 01:04:56,120
No one does.

2101
01:04:56,540 --> 01:04:58,520
But by the way, I'm the only person

2102
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:00,180
that I've ever heard on the Internet or

2103
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:04,300
not that just said all checking accounts are

2104
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:06,200
basically 100 percent banking fees.

2105
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:07,980
I'm going to I'm putting together a much

2106
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:11,100
simpler way to discuss the financial stuff because

2107
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:12,100
it's time.

2108
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:13,080
Yeah.

2109
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,520
It's like Molotov cocktails.

2110
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:17,360
Instead of driving in with a tank, you

2111
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:19,260
just have these, you know, you just want

2112
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:20,800
to you got to put your stuff together,

2113
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,320
you know, and make it real easy.

2114
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:24,800
When you start explaining the negotiable instruments and

2115
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:26,160
all that to people, they glaze over when

2116
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,400
you say 100 percent checking, 100 percent bank

2117
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:29,280
fees on your checking account.

2118
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:30,000
What does that mean?

2119
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:31,540
They get you get their attention a little

2120
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:32,080
more clearly.

2121
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:33,420
Right.

2122
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:36,220
So and during one of these discussions back

2123
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:39,060
and forth about, you know, finance and money

2124
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:43,520
and stuff, the somebody posted the Emergency Banking

2125
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:47,420
Relief Act, the Emergency Banking Act of 1933,

2126
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:48,160
1933.

2127
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:48,800
Yeah.

2128
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:50,780
There is a Wikipedia page and they just

2129
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:51,340
said hint.

2130
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:55,240
So I think I think that's that that

2131
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:58,040
goes back to your discussion about the receivership

2132
01:05:58,040 --> 01:05:58,560
and all that.

2133
01:05:58,640 --> 01:05:58,840
Yeah.

2134
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:01,240
But it's over.

2135
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:01,600
There is.

2136
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:02,900
It's all leveled out now.

2137
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:04,140
It's no it's all accepted.

2138
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:05,520
In other words, you're never going to go

2139
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:06,540
back to substance money.

2140
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:07,340
They say so.

2141
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:08,340
Right.

2142
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:11,140
Because as long as they have the full

2143
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:13,020
force and might of the U.S. military,

2144
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:15,800
they're going to also have the full faith

2145
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:18,080
and credit of the U.S. government and

2146
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:20,900
also the Federal Reserve Act that states that

2147
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:23,520
Federal Reserve notes represent a first lien mortgage

2148
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:26,220
on all property in the United States, persons

2149
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:26,800
and property.

2150
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:27,700
You might even say persons.

2151
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:28,300
I'm not sure.

2152
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:30,000
I read it both ways.

2153
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:32,880
So, yeah.

2154
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,860
So, you know, they have a lien on

2155
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:35,280
everything.

2156
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,260
So basically, let's say there's 300 million people

2157
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:39,500
in the U.S. You're a one in

2158
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:41,600
300 million shareholder of everything.

2159
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:42,800
Right.

2160
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:44,820
But there's no cap and there's no conditions.

2161
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:46,280
Yeah.

2162
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:48,880
So basically what I just said will collapse

2163
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,320
the labor market, by the way.

2164
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:51,020
Yeah.

2165
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:51,780
You know what I mean?

2166
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,960
I mean, is that is that a cat

2167
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:55,300
acting like a dog, by the way?

2168
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:56,300
Or is that a dog?

2169
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:59,320
No, that's a dog, not a cat.

2170
01:06:59,400 --> 01:06:59,560
Yeah.

2171
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,600
The neighbor got it's a beautiful, good looking

2172
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:02,540
pit bull mix.

2173
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:04,320
And it doesn't know how to act.

2174
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:05,920
It's quite far away, actually.

2175
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:08,560
But it projects because we're in the desert.

2176
01:07:08,740 --> 01:07:09,560
You know, dry air.

2177
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:10,640
I think it was a dryer.

2178
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:11,920
Humid air projects more.

2179
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:13,240
I think dry air.

2180
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:15,200
I think dry air is a damping effect.

2181
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:16,820
Yeah.

2182
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:18,360
But yeah.

2183
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:21,040
So, yeah, I'm going to be giving some

2184
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:26,980
more just down factual to the point financial

2185
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:29,180
stuff, because I think it's been time for

2186
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:29,860
a long time.

2187
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,640
You're not going to destroy the labor market.

2188
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:34,160
Most people are just too moronic.

2189
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:35,640
I mean, they're really dead people.

2190
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:38,080
I mean, again, going back to Christianity being

2191
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:38,660
satanic.

2192
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:41,640
I mean, let's just say this.

2193
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,400
Fortunately, there are no humans in that Christian

2194
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:43,800
religion.

2195
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:44,540
You know what I mean?

2196
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:45,560
I mean, what are they?

2197
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:46,140
They're cattle.

2198
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:46,500
Yeah.

2199
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:47,080
Yeah.

2200
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:48,660
And here's the thing.

2201
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:49,520
Are they bad people?

2202
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:50,080
I'll say it again.

2203
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:51,260
No, they're not bad people.

2204
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:52,120
But are they good people?

2205
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:53,780
No, they're definitely not good people.

2206
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:56,560
It can't be good because if you even

2207
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:58,520
if you do good acts as a Christian

2208
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:00,960
or whatever, you're going to get suckered into

2209
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,540
some evil shit real fast, thinking you're doing

2210
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:03,840
good.

2211
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:05,540
So does that still keep you good?

2212
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:07,560
In other words, even if you haven't done

2213
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:11,200
anything like they at the potential of being

2214
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,120
led into that so automatically.

2215
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:13,740
Right.

2216
01:08:13,860 --> 01:08:15,380
You cannot be classified as being.
