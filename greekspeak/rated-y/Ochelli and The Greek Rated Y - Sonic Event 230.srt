Sonic Advent 230 and here we are and

2

hope the audio is a little better the

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,400
old iPhone that I have is just not

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,520
hacking the this type of transmission so yeah

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,580
I want to go to the chat real

8
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,880
quick you have some stuff Vandy posted some

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,820
Michio Kushi stuff and nice there's really not

10
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,620
much to go anywhere on macrobiotics or that

11
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,980
kind of philosophy other than people's like what

12
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,340
do they call them when you do a

13
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,860
website to talk about your personal experiences kind

14
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,680
of thing Oh like a blog yeah yeah

15
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,880
yeah right and you could look up some

16
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,540
of his books but one thing I met

17
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,500
Michio Kushi I don't know him very well

18
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,160
but I did not know him very well

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,660
I when I was at the New York

20
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:05,080
City Macrobiotic Center they they had an honorary

21
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,140
dinner for him and Shizuko asked me to

22
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,940
bake to make the dessert mind you I

23
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,640
was only there for a few months and

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,820
but anyway I baked this carrot cake macrobiotic

25
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,140
sort of vegan yeah mm-hmm and it's

26
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,340
always good to make the cake a day

27
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,800
before like if you know anyone who has

28
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,760
like a cake business especially for high and

29
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,340
you know wedding cakes would cost 5,000

30
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:30,700
bucks right and yeah or more and so

31
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,220
you always make the actually wedding cakes you

32
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,080
freeze them when you freeze the sponge the

33
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,760
cake and thaw it out it gets moist

34
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:41,060
but supposedly hmm okay I was sort of

35
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,840
aware so anyway I made the entire cake

36
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,280
the day before next day of I opened

37
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,500
the fridge I had a frosting on it

38
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:53,360
was made with some spices agar-agar kuzu

39
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,020
silken soy milk a bunch of other stuff

40
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,000
like you know vegetable stuff really nice frosting

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,160
or icing icing okay there's a difference in

42
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,760
frosting and icing I think what's supposed to

43
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,780
be thicker than the other but anyway okay

44
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,320
I opened the fridge the next day and

45
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,220
all the icing frosting is gone it got

46
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,060
absorbed into the cake so now I had

47
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,240
a cake with no I just look like

48
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,400
a plain cake the two-layer cake I

49
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,580
panicked so I made it again and put

50
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,960
it on this time it stayed so ended

51
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,140
up turning like a rum cake see because

52
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,600
when you put those frostings you know when

53
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,300
you whip you creams and things you make

54
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,720
butter right or hydrogen it's very durable where

55
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,060
if you whip certain vegetable stuff and it's

56
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,780
not hydrogenated it doesn't support itself very long

57
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,480
kind of like a cappuccino imagine a cappuccino

58
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,720
in the fridge overnight it's no longer a

59
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:48,600
cappuccino right so yeah so anyway I anyway

60
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,120
make a long story short I met him

61
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,300
there once and I met him again but

62
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,400
we're looking reading his books very dogmatic very

63
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,040
very dogmatic he's almost like really angry about

64
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,800
Americans he's happy about being here some weird

65
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,980
story but it's very dogmatic in the end

66
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,940
of his life he started speaking more on

67
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,940
how you should just eat traditional right so

68
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,040
if you're in Saudi Arabia don't keep donkey

69
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,260
milk is fine right okay or cat I'm

70
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,720
sorry can't camel milk is fine camel milk

71
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,920
all right camel milk but from someone that

72
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,940
knows him sick meet you you know they

73
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,680
said they died of cancer he would secretly

74
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,800
have a rice cooker for regular white rice

75
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,840
and salted salmon and when no one was

76
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,520
around or when he wanted to be alone

77
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,540
he told people not to come over he

78
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,820
would prepare regular white rice and salted salmon

79
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,320
for himself on a regular basis and a

80
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,340
couple of people that I knew personally found

81
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,340
him in the closet with some young intern

82
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,920
ladies he was married so he's not perfect

83
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,820
and he's very dogmatic he brings forward some

84
00:03:54,820 --> 00:04:00,640
good information I personally would not recommend him

85
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,240
to beginners or overall unless you know the

86
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:08,060
warning I just gave you very dogmatic so

87
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,980
but most of the information that is neutral

88
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,940
without his opinion let's say on it is

89
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:17,360
pretty good because he's just referring bringing forward

90
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,440
what was around for thousands of years anyway

91
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,000
so I like to mix experimental you know

92
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
the province of the mind has no limits

93
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,260
and it's to be experienced experimentation right right

94
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:30,920
that's John C.

95
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,780
Lilly not just you hear people talk about

96
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:39,360
just experience well most people are just too

97
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,020
dead from the neck up to for any

98
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,340
experience to matter first of all but when

99
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:47,280
you say experience through experimentation if you're learned

100
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,360
about the real scientific method or the scientific

101
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,220
method it gives you protocols for experimentation right

102
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,540
right you got your theory hypothesis experiment conclusion

103
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,620
and other things so you have to be

104
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,920
a good observer you have to have controls

105
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,400
be able to take measurement be able to

106
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,720
communicate what you're doing and the results you

107
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,880
have to be honest in terms of objective

108
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,360
if you do exclusions mention them that's how

109
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,200
I live my life and I always have

110
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,620
people when we had circles of social people

111
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,040
when they met someone they would always come

112
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,260
to me and say hey do you know

113
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,480
so-and-so I'm thinking of dating or

114
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,780
what do you think and they knew that

115
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,300
whatever I said held water you know what

116
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,300
I mean okay why because my experience with

117
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,520
that person was experimental that's X sounds kind

118
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,580
of weird though right there because when you

119
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,700
say what did you experiment with yeah nothing

120
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,240
like that but you know it meaning I

121
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,420
observed them that try to based on certain

122
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:46,540
whatever benchmark so I'm glad that he put

123
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,840
that video up and I know more and

124
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,700
more people are watching it that kind of

125
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,240
stuff and that's a very good foundation but

126
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,600
there's really no way to simplify outside of

127
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,560
microbiotics what Michio is doing and that's what

128
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,520
I try to do that's why I don't

129
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,780
even want to call it yin and yang

130
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:05,560
at all but I call it expansive contractive

131
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,660
balance of universal principles so I just want

132
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,020
to bring that up because it's good it's

133
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,980
very rare that someone puts up a Michio

134
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,320
video but also Vandy asked about some guy

135
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,560
having his head almost severed and put on

136
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,060
ice now you got to give me information

137
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,700
Vandy where you got that source of that

138
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,480
because we have this thing in America I

139
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,200
think you call it Chinese whispers here it's

140
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,280
called telephone right where you start when one

141
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,880
story goes from one place to another could

142
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,500
have been the guy lost his wallet and

143
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,400
he saw you know a severed head and

144
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,160
ended up being by time he gets the

145
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,460
story that his head was severed and you

146
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,760
put in an ice barrel you know I

147
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,760
don't know so if it's a lot otherwise

148
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,260
I'm not going to invest money much in

149
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,960
it and the guy regular one two three

150
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,100
four five six put up a video for

151
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,180
a tick tock video about aliens talking about

152
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,320
how screwed or rugged humans are for having

153
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,860
a monetary system as they do which I

154
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,180
keep talking about so right and I posted

155
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,560
an old interview I didn't this is where

156
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,360
Chuck and I I was asked to fill

157
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,100
in for Vinny Eastwood I said no and

158
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,340
then you filled in for it I went

159
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,640
back to see who filled in for it

160
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,320
that's how got introduced to you right and

161
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,820
I had done one prior way prior to

162
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:19,300
that for Vinny and I had Trevor James

163
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,940
Constable as the guest and that's what that's

164
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,660
posted on the chat recently and I think

165
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,820
there's other stuff we can address but I

166
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,720
posted some public enemy stuff and super sperm

167
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,260
I don't know if you guys know Captain

168
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,000
Sky you remember that song super sperm I

169
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,980
you know you mentioned this to me before

170
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,620
and it's still not ringing a bell I

171
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,080
don't remember even going to look it up

172
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,600
all right well it's on the chat you

173
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:45,920
could you could public enemy my 88 Delta

174
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,780
88 by Oldsmobile 88 mm-hmm that song

175
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,320
in the they use the samples from that

176
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,020
oh they sample then I put up the

177
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:58,040
samples from super sperm and in public enemy

178
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,380
public enemies the album mm-hmm I guess

179
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,380
from 1984 85 think about it most some

180
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,920
actually I would say I don't know but

181
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,680
venture to say half or most or some

182
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,820
of our subs were not even born yet

183
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,060
believe it or not yeah that is a

184
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:18,720
weird thought so yeah yeah well sometimes when

185
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,100
you and I go back into like the

186
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,280
70s and 80s I mean to them that

187
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,760
that might as well be what you know

188
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,480
the 1800s because it's just outside of their

189
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,860
experiences and so I always find that interesting

190
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,520
anyway you know somebody sent me one of

191
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,760
the longest messages ever like it's an email

192
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,640
length serious message right and he tells me

193
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,679
I've gotten a 24 by the way I've

194
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:48,200
gotten a 24 page PDF email right well

195
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,740
24 so when you say long and it's

196
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,780
a page or two okay deal with it

197
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,660
no hey look nobody related to what we

198
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,500
do here has sent me a message like

199
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,060
that in email they do that for JFK

200
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,580
stuff they send me you know a thousand

201
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,180
page treatise on something and go what is

202
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,360
your thought you know and they want it

203
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,360
in five minutes just read the conclusion yeah

204
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,260
I know I go back to the conclusion

205
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,320
should wrap it up right I go backwards

206
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,920
and I skim and then I can usually

207
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,340
get it done in 15 but you can't

208
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,480
get it in five okay you know anyway

209
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,080
is that this is pretty interesting though and

210
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,640
I want to read the whole thing and

211
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,420
pause and let you address each piece of

212
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:29,100
it okay I would really appreciate the law

213
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,920
information I have paid thousands of dollars for

214
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,300
different teachers and it's still very confusing to

215
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,220
me some people say I need to rescind

216
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:41,460
all my documents others say that's not necessary

217
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,780
so I stopped right go ahead okay I

218
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:50,200
would rescind what is what is not necessary

219
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:56,380
like lice any license any corporation is a

220
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,400
rescission but it's not they don't have an

221
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,140
offer for a rescission is different rescission is

222
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:05,320
for a contract you could rescind what you

223
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,100
do is you cancel them right you would

224
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,900
cancel them or annul them and that most

225
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,540
of these things do have forms for that

226
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,520
what you can't cancel is a social security

227
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,380
number and the straw man just don't use

228
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,040
it I had I had spent a year

229
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,820
trying to get high up people in the

230
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,980
Social Security Administration finally did in the US

231
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,260
Treasury and it's their creation so you you

232
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,580
know you you had no part in it

233
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,000
there's a baby act about that something called

234
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,140
the baby act look it up that you're

235
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,240
not responsible for anything that was done for

236
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,500
you by others right whether it was official

237
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,060
unofficial or whatever when you were a younger

238
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,100
than 18 have you heard of the baby

239
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,300
act it's pretty powerful if you know how

240
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,040
to use it yeah it begins when they

241
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,000
say your mother reports on your birth your

242
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,480
mother reports your birth and it begins there

243
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,000
right yeah yeah right it begins there it

244
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,140
also begins on prenatal care before you were

245
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,600
born if they determine you or whatever okay

246
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,320
he's called a retard back then down syndrome

247
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,260
now it's not politically correct to say that

248
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:11,360
right mm-hmm so I mean like I

249
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,480
grew up in a very whatever white neighborhood

250
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,560
and when a black people were niggers right

251
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,160
you say it like that you know and

252
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,460
they knew what you were talking about if

253
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,520
you said someone was black they stopped for

254
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,420
a minute and thinking like what does that

255
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,260
mean oh you mean a nigger I said

256
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,260
yeah okay that's how I grew up and

257
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,200
and when you were just dysfunctional retard and

258
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,860
they had you know the down syndrome all

259
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,360
that stuff these are things that were put

260
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,460
on you before you were born including the

261
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,920
n-word by the way it's all that

262
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,760
shit you can so the baby act doesn't

263
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,400
make you responsible and you do that by

264
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,660
injunction but driver's license and corporations and stuff

265
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,220
like that yeah get rid of all that

266
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:58,380
stuff if you can because that ties you

267
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,260
into something that you know nothing about unless

268
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,560
you do know it all goes back to

269
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,820
the Queen and the Vatican all of it

270
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,200
now there used to be a very comprehensive

271
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,360
website about the Vatican building in the vat

272
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,560
in Vatican City and it's not the Vatican

273
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,540
St. Pilar's Basilica they tell you we are

274
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:17,340
a red building behind that all of the

275
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,700
State Departments of the world that subscribe to

276
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,640
us we create their policy and they cannot

277
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,880
appeal it and that was a first line

278
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,460
of the thing real arrogant now you can't

279
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,120
find it anymore it used to be an

280
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,220
HTML if anyone wants to look it up

281
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,480
the Vatican red building or something I forgot

282
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,640
what they call it just it was just

283
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,020
called the Vatican all the State Department subscribed

284
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:43,360
to so State Department is actually ecclesiastic and

285
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,800
then you have the Queen of England which

286
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,500
is the money system but through the Bar

287
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:51,020
Association and the Attorney General's position as trustee

288
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,200
and blah blah blah blah blah right there's

289
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,400
another Attorney General called a private Attorney General

290
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,620
that anyone can take that position but it

291
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,820
should what case-by-case basis right so

292
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,860
you can't say you're a private Attorney General

293
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,940
you would only be for one case at

294
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,500
a time and when you're not running the

295
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,520
case you're not a private Attorney General so

296
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,400
like for example we're going to be trafficking

297
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,860
the water devices way we do that is

298
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,260
the sole proprietorship known as the straw man

299
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,240
the all-caps letter fills out a DBA

300
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,240
doing business as and we don't say DBA

301
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,520
we're just I could actually read the doc

302
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,200
it's very simple it's two sentences that you

303
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,660
you know everything is materially factual and you

304
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,280
are going to be doing business in the

305
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,660
county city states and worldwide is this other

306
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,800
name and I just want to make public

307
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,060
record and then you put it in the

308
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:48,240
newspaper and once you get the record back

309
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,420
from the county you get a raised seal

310
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,640
on it you can go open a bank

311
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,480
account with it using the Social Security number

312
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,620
right which is actually a trust number it's

313
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,400
in the state trust and the name is

314
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,040
what's in the trust which is a sole

315
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,720
proprietorship and then you do business that way

316
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,620
and when you do banking you open the

317
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,840
bank account at the signature card you write

318
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:18,160
demand for lawful money per 12 USC 411

319
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,780
sign your name comma agent or you could

320
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,380
sign your name semicolon last name first name

321
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,060
last you could also do last name first

322
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,640
but the best is agent because in the

323
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:33,060
UCC you know on checks it says authorized

324
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:37,740
signature right the UCC states that if you

325
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:42,900
sign any document instrument it's called and the

326
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,640
name of the that's on the instrument is

327
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,680
the same as the person that's signing you

328
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,560
are not responsible for the name on the

329
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,040
instrument so let's say you're Chuck Ocelli on

330
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,060
your checkbook you know it's all capital letters

331
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:00,740
Chuck Ocelli whatever Charles Ocelli right right and

332
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,940
on the signature line when you're issuing the

333
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,860
check on the front that's micro print on

334
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,940
the line and it says authorized signature authorized

335
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,680
signature repeat I think you know about that

336
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,620
right and well you're signing for that entity

337
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,460
known as Charles Ocelli which is a sole

338
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:20,960
proprietorship with the trust to state identification number

339
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,300
it's not an ID number but it says

340
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,180
trust the state ID means you have a

341
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,140
share of the United States from the receivership

342
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,880
okay so you could actually write a bad

343
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,300
check or a blank or check a check

344
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,600
from a closed account or these blank checks

345
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,060
you can get from whatever you can buy

346
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,780
them at Office Depot no bank account or

347
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,380
anything and it's good if you go and

348
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,140
use it they'll tell you the check bounced

349
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,680
or it's that's why I use the one

350
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,980
that doesn't have any bank information and they'll

351
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,540
tell you it's no good well give it

352
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,860
back to me and then you're not going

353
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,320
to give it back to you because they're

354
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,840
going to give you a legal copy and

355
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,440
this back shows that the bank stamped received

356
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,260
on it received does it mean like when

357
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,880
you receive something receive is a contractual term

358
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:10,080
right because it has to be without defect

359
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,940
for a legal entity like a bank to

360
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,820
receive it so when you have a received

361
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,840
stamp from a bank it means it's without

362
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,500
defect and the purpose of the instrument can

363
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,440
be fulfilled and is fulfilled what is the

364
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,480
purpose of an instrument like a check it's

365
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,140
very good Chuck to order funds to order

366
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:36,420
funds either for cash or credit on account

367
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,660
right right if the bank couldn't do that

368
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,580
they would not stamp it received so there's

369
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,900
no such thing as a bad check so

370
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,540
Attorney General says you go into sources bad

371
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,020
check writers will be prosecuted you see out

372
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,860
all the time go ahead of course try

373
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,340
it try it and the only way they

374
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,040
could prosecute you is if they go back

375
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,020
and say you had a bank account and

376
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,280
you gave the bank full security interest and

377
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,600
you're operating on a hundred percent banking fees

378
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,380
that's the most they can do right so

379
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,460
attorneys don't know anything just because the Attorney

380
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,599
General doesn't mean on any law at all

381
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,540
that's confusing that's confusing because one would think

382
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,220
that receiving something is simply it was you

383
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,319
know put in your possession but right it's

384
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,140
not like that just like the word nice

385
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,960
doesn't mean what you think it is look

386
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,660
up what received means in banking it's called

387
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:29,760
a bankers acceptance a banker will not accept

388
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,700
anything that has defects and that's outside of

389
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,540
the purpose of banker when he gets something

390
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,080
he has to see what the purpose of

391
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,080
that instrument is if he can't fulfill the

392
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,640
purpose of that instrument it's returned with a

393
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,100
with a note why they usually incorporate when

394
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,000
you have accounts they'll return checks or whatever

395
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,420
and they'll give you a Xerox copy and

396
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,160
they'll just check off boxes why it was

397
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,460
no good they don't want even sits there

398
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,980
and writes anything anymore and you just look

399
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,500
at the sheet and it checked off well

400
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,660
it didn't have a date checked off it

401
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:05,620
didn't have a signature right whatever so yeah

402
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,420
okay yeah I kind of gave it slow

403
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,880
enough you notice I spoke at a low

404
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,960
tempo right yes very much so very much

405
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,960
so I went I just did a quick

406
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,640
lookup you know what is what does it

407
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,860
mean to receive something in banking and it

408
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,980
means that a payment or deposit has been

409
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:24,280
successfully sent to the recipient bank and is

410
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,320
in the process of being credited to the

411
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,040
recipients right account the exact status and availability

412
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,660
of the funds depend on the type of

413
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:36,920
transaction and the banks processing times says but

414
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,640
that's cool how they said that's a newer

415
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,220
definition because it says in the process so

416
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,820
they get some leeway right so they come

417
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,180
back and say it's no good so if

418
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,900
the bank if the check is no good

419
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,400
all right simply give me back the check

420
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,760
they can't they only give you a copy

421
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,340
of it I was in trial once and

422
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:57,300
need a recess I ran out that we

423
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,960
wanted the check back from the bank and

424
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,220
the banks that the judge says this is

425
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,420
good enough and it was just said legal

426
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,920
copy on a Xerox mm-hmm front and

427
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,960
back so I said any 10-minute recess

428
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,040
mm-hmm and they wouldn't give it but

429
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,460
finally make a long story short I did

430
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,360
get it I went and got a $10

431
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,820
bill I made a copy of it front

432
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,380
and back came into the courtroom and I

433
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,140
said just I'm going to object to what

434
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:21,040
the plaintiff has brought forward and my response

435
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,840
and rebuttal is your honor can I spend

436
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,320
this and I held up Xerox copy of

437
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,620
a $10 bill that wrote legal copy on

438
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:34,560
it right right so no the next next

439
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,380
we're not can't use that point anymore yeah

440
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,860
you didn't get your check yeah you don't

441
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,400
need the check and it just went on

442
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,220
and on this is like 2007 Wow what

443
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:46,500
do I know anyway I've been in this

444
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,260
for a long time so well 20 years

445
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,620
plus but anyway back to the I am

446
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,120
yeah I wanted to continue on with this

447
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,700
question though to see where else it goes

448
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:01,180
because there's supposedly a remedy yeah please do

449
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,380
I just want to see that we covered

450
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,380
the question oh yeah I believe we do

451
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,680
and the reason let you go back to

452
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,260
it the bank card should cover should say

453
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,740
demand for let's your only remedy and if

454
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,500
you want to know where this remedy is

455
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,480
best explained go to YouTube and it would

456
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,480
be YouTube called 1913 Federal Reserve Act remedy

457
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,100
by David Merrill it's about a half hour

458
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,140
long listen to that he speaks he's speaking

459
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,800
on like a 16th grade level you know

460
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,000
high school is 12th grade right college bachelor's

461
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,400
degree is 16th degree 16th grade so that's

462
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,480
how the government has you by the way

463
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,660
if you have a four-year degree it's

464
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,200
you've completed 16 grades right you've seen that

465
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,020
before yeah I've seen okay yeah and it

466
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:49,920
goes up to yeah so that would be

467
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,640
your backup what's the remedy for the Federal

468
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,440
Reserve it's the only remedy for the Federal

469
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,820
Reserve Act directly there are other remedies for

470
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,360
other things every time you have an instrument

471
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,720
before you endorse it demand for law or

472
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,920
lawful money only is also a demand only

473
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,720
means the demand lawful money only or demand

474
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,440
for lawful money 12 USC 411 sign the

475
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,660
name however you sign it comma agent or

476
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,900
without recourse when you get more advanced you'll

477
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,660
know when to use what right so you

478
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,400
know like when you get food you don't

479
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,180
automatically put salt on it like like like

480
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:29,760
television you taste it first right people I've

481
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,700
seen people sit down and put food and

482
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,140
they throw it away salt and pepper before

483
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,660
they taste it that's they learned how to

484
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:38,060
eat by watching television wow right so you're

485
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,080
not going to get any of this on

486
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:43,880
TV or alternative media or gurus right so

487
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,200
anyway all right so I hope I was

488
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,740
clear with that yeah I've never thought about

489
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,400
that before there are some people who salt

490
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,140
and pepper their stuff before they ever tasted

491
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,180
I don't understand that at all because they

492
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,040
learned how to eat by watching TV how

493
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,120
pathetic is that it just makes no sense

494
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,260
so anyway you know no TV doesn't make

495
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,440
any sense that's right exactly all right so

496
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,580
there's supposedly a remedy for everything yet people

497
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,000
won't tell you the remedy because quote you

498
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,620
need to figure it out for yourself end

499
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:13,280
quote uh honestly not really well honestly all

500
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,200
this law legal stuff is like reading the

501
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,380
bible you can read it in all sorts

502
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,240
of ways it depends on who is translating

503
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,820
it once you know the truth you can

504
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:24,860
see through the lies but until then it's

505
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:27,640
all very convoluted I like how the greek

506
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,360
is very straightforward but I'd like to hear

507
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,720
some of his information uh where he talks

508
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,040
for hours straight I feel like he starts

509
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,420
to get into something and then the sound

510
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:41,420
clip cuts off uh these are very brief

511
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:44,720
yeah they're very brief they're hints anyways um

512
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,780
I'm new here and so I'm trying to

513
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,400
start from the beginning and piece all these

514
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,420
together but if anyone has some direction toward

515
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:54,140
the law info that's why I joined this

516
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,920
patreon and yes I get that everything the

517
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,920
greek talks about is about the laws of

518
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,340
this realm there's more to this by the

519
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,540
way but I think I'll pause there yeah

520
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,500
it's not everything it's actually how can you

521
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,980
get her how can you sit at a

522
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,880
game board without right I'm not going to

523
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,840
give the analogy you can guess how can

524
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,240
you sit down and play a game without

525
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:17,340
what oh the laws the rules yeah you

526
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,560
need to know what the rules are otherwise

527
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,680
even something simple when you when you're given

528
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,520
uh different shape holes and different shape pegs

529
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,940
this one doesn't fit anybody got a sander

530
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,400
and a chisel no you're supposed to move

531
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,020
them around until they fit right find the

532
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:36,000
one that fits right this is a this

533
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,200
is a one it doesn't go uh the

534
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,400
square one doesn't go in the run you

535
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,840
let's chisel it down no you're supposed to

536
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,860
make maneuvers till you yeah cut the top

537
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,340
off the box throw them all in there

538
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:51,220
done uh you know just well my favorite

539
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,900
is I've seen people that said they're good

540
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,080
mechanics I had a water pump and a

541
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,740
timing belt change and he ended up with

542
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:01,400
extra bolts wow oh where do they go

543
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,960
god damn it why do you have bolts

544
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:08,000
left over such a good mechanic asshole yeah

545
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,120
or the word you go to surgery and

546
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,820
they you know they're cleaning up and it's

547
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:15,160
like we're missing some hemostats and some yeah

548
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,260
you've heard of surgeons leaving oh absolutely somebody

549
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,460
I remember the joke for a while was

550
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,320
somebody count the sponges because there was a

551
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,840
oh yeah that's a big one sponges getting

552
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,420
lost inside of patients constantly that's a terrible

553
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:32,680
way to go slow sepsisemia oh you turn

554
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,140
green oh my gosh I've seen that I've

555
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,820
walked down hospitals and seen you know like

556
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:41,100
hepatitis with looking yellow green skin and dark

557
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,380
circles under the eyes under morphine I'm like

558
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,080
oh they left the sponge in that one

559
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,700
anyway yeah it's a murder fucking factory avoid

560
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:52,580
those assholes but okay right okay so anyway

561
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,860
next uh but I'd really like to catch

562
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,260
some aha waves on the bigger picture of

563
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,720
how to live without the fear of government

564
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,300
coming after me for not saying the right

565
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,260
thing or signing the right document I'm tired

566
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:07,180
of living with analysis paralysis hiding from the

567
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,320
world because I can't figure out how this

568
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,700
all works all right stop right there that's

569
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,060
it that's the end what it's that's all

570
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,420
good it's all based on money everything's being

571
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:19,800
done for money that doesn't exist think how

572
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,120
insane that is there is no money and

573
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,940
everyone wants money the government all corporations all

574
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,820
governments are what's called legally debtors in possession

575
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,960
they're all debtors you are the creditor period

576
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:36,740
by doing the demand for lawful money will

577
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:40,780
clear you from the you know taxes don't

578
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,860
pay anything no taxes it can't they use

579
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,340
negotiable instruments and I've explained the miller bond

580
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,940
process let me just do a thing this

581
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:51,280
will help let's say uh New York wants

582
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,400
to build the governor como bridge cost a

583
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,960
billion dollars this is actually pretty close to

584
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,860
the truth I've researched that I was looking

585
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,840
at it the actual the bonds also so

586
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,360
they get all these they get an architect

587
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,880
and they get the the the project bid

588
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,920
out blueprints and all that to contractors and

589
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,160
they bid on it and when they award

590
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,480
the bid the contractor does what's called the

591
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,420
miller bond process he puts in what's called

592
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:22,600
a performance bond a bid bond a performance

593
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,360
bond and a surety bond and they each

594
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,500
have a let's say the the award is

595
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,700
a billion dollars it's pretty close to a

596
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,520
billion I think was like 700 800 million

597
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,680
for that bridge each one of those bonds

598
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:38,040
let's say is a billion the government the

599
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,220
state takes that and they deposit it through

600
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,060
the federal reserve and they get three billion

601
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,820
actually a little less than the billions federal

602
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,460
reserve takes five percent and then they put

603
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,880
it on the market for about three four

604
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,460
months and they start building it about a

605
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,180
year later sound about right they never start

606
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:56,420
right away so so the actual this is

607
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,000
how sick of a world you live in

608
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,460
whoever you is and uh billion dollar bridge

609
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:07,900
the guy who's building it funded it not

610
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,960
once not twice but three times and as

611
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,700
he's building it he's under the impression that

612
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,000
he has to get progress payments as he's

613
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,100
building it according to contract and the money's

614
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,520
coming from taxes that the state collected what

615
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,020
a crock of shit that's worse than the

616
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,820
world trade centers were vaporized by osama bin

617
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:33,500
laden with box cutters hmm that's how bad

618
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,700
this is the world you live in and

619
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,420
you go to these morons to tell you

620
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:40,100
how you're if you're healthy or not or

621
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,880
your financial advice come on you are on

622
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,860
your own is the first thing so the

623
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:50,020
advice that you got regarding analysis paralysis yes

624
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,420
very good you realize you it's not nothing's

625
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:56,060
working because it's a planet full of idiots

626
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,580
I don't know how else to say it

627
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:00,520
right so give me an example I recently

628
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,580
caught an archaic thing with this guy mark

629
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,720
pass you I don't know if you remember

630
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,440
him from back in the days of american

631
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,640
freedom radio he's making a lot of rounds

632
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,660
back 15 20 years ago I didn't think

633
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:13,780
he was still around I didn't either I

634
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,340
didn't either I was because I never was

635
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,840
into now this is not to disparage him

636
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,020
I don't know it's it's like it's it's

637
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,860
tom and dick or michael harris or whatever

638
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,740
it doesn't matter it's not personal it's my

639
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:27,100
god not personal what he says is ra

640
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,540
ra ra we gotta create human freedom and

641
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:32,800
slavery we gotta be free we gotta be

642
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:37,320
not one goddamn comment not one suggestion on

643
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,180
how to go about doing that not one

644
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:43,180
thing no oh my gosh that's worse than

645
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,540
uh than anything I've heard out there from

646
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:48,120
the mainstream just as bad so this is

647
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,360
what this is what you guys meaning you

648
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,780
guys whoever you guys are or have to

649
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:57,220
put up with until you find someone that

650
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,740
can tell you how it can be done

651
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,320
and show you the mechanics behind it a

652
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,360
really good car mechanic will do that by

653
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,020
the way or a really good surgeon will

654
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,480
walk you into the say this is what

655
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,900
we want to do and show you the

656
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:14,020
x-rays and tell you what they're going

657
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,740
to do and how long it's going to

658
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:19,240
heal a really good dentist will tell you

659
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,420
if you ever have a tooth extracted that

660
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:26,440
the opposite truth the opposing tooth will experience

661
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,100
something called eruption and continue growing because now

662
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,320
there's an empty pocket above it so be

663
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,360
aware of that it'll you're right anyone who's

664
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,940
ever said i'm going to go have a

665
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,380
tooth extract this let me know if the

666
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:40,620
dentist talks about eruption of the opposing tooth

667
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,920
on the bite no one ever does then

668
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,600
when the person went for a follow-through

669
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,220
they brought that up and the dentist was

670
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,280
surprised that they brought it up this is

671
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,360
standard stuff that needs to be discussed so

672
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,140
i always bring up the medical morons and

673
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,920
legal morons are not even worth talking about

674
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,380
they're like oh my gosh that's why idiocracy

675
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,100
already happened but another interesting thing about money

676
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,260
itself it has always cracked me up as

677
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,180
people scream about they're taking away our change

678
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,600
they're taking it's going to be a cashless

679
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,460
society and i'm you guys are a little

680
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:13,360
late cashless here's the problem this is okay

681
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,620
even if you go with their rules and

682
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:18,740
you go with their uh reports and everything

683
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:21,180
else the amount of money that they say

684
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:25,440
exists does not physically exist it hasn't it

685
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,900
doesn't it actually does not securities okay yeah

686
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,680
chuck let me just say this but the

687
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,560
amount of dollars they say there's so many

688
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,200
dollars here there's so many dollars there you

689
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,580
can't physically account for that you could never

690
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,380
collect up all the paper and everything else

691
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,140
and add it up to what they have

692
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,760
on the computer just a trillion just a

693
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,820
trillion is not enough paper to print and

694
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,580
it would be a stack of money to

695
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:51,340
the moon yeah it's not fathom it can't

696
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:54,120
be done so here um you've heard me

697
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,200
say that when regulations get strong uh the

698
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,340
black market gets strong when you want to

699
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,020
weaken the black same people by the way

700
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,720
run the government run the black market same

701
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,860
group of course uh the same and if

702
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,500
you want the black market to get weak

703
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:12,100
you deregulate okay so the cash is dependent

704
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,880
two people the two industries or groups that

705
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,900
are mostly dependent on cash money i'm talking

706
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,280
like federal reserve notes or bureaus no in

707
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,360
notes paper notes in australia they have plastic

708
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:26,000
notes whatever it's like a tyvek yeah all

709
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,120
that stuff and coin but mostly paper it's

710
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,700
much better to carry a hundred dollar bill

711
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,460
than a hundred dollars and quarters by the

712
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,840
way for sure and you notice i didn't

713
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,560
say pennies and don't even bother with the

714
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:39,220
pennies so the black market depends on that

715
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:41,440
and also the super wealthy depend on that

716
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,620
i'm giving you an example all right so

717
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,380
i got 150 million i'm going to go

718
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,700
put it in the bank that's a really

719
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,240
good business decision since the bank only insures

720
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,780
it for 250 000 that sounds like a

721
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:57,520
good business decision to put 150 million in

722
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,620
the bank when only 250 000 is going

723
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,120
to be insured does that sound like a

724
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,700
good risk no it sounds stupid that's the

725
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:07,720
funny thing that's about as dumb as dumb

726
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,100
can get like i've always seen those people

727
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,640
who win the lottery you know there's like

728
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,520
a billion dollar lottery that just i don't

729
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,620
know if they anybody wanted or whatever but

730
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,160
i passed they put the money in the

731
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,780
bank they're only insured for 250 000 yeah

732
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,120
that's the funny thing like i'm going to

733
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,360
take this check to the bank and i'm

734
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,540
like you're going to take a half a

735
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,480
billion dollar check to a bank that's only

736
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,880
guaranteeing you that you'll have 250 000 yeah

737
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,540
well let's say per account so you might

738
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,420
if you broke it up into 10 accounts

739
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:35,760
that's still just 2.5 yeah million right

740
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,580
right yeah because which was not even not

741
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,620
even one percent right right so uh because

742
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,460
one percent would be five million so okay

743
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,120
so the wealthy what they do is they

744
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,740
call the bank ahead and they want pallets

745
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:50,240
of cash okay and they have there's people

746
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,700
that do that and they move it and

747
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,100
it could be as simple as moving the

748
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,060
cash from one building to another across the

749
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,680
street it could be on a property that

750
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,320
they have give you an example when you're

751
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:05,000
on a compound a wealthy person's compound right

752
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,360
um and they have a break-in or

753
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,160
they have a let's say a security issue

754
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,820
they don't call the the local sheriff or

755
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:16,380
the police they have their own security people

756
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:21,020
right right and when they catch you you

757
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,580
don't have any rights they don't read you

758
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,680
any rights they actually catch you and they've

759
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,740
been trained that you're not human they would

760
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:30,760
treat you like a wild dog you'll probably

761
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,560
never be found again for breaking into someone's

762
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,600
house they don't call the sheriff right or

763
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,540
the police hint so the money system works

764
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,500
the same way they don't use banks the

765
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,800
way that slaves these are slave banks right

766
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,600
so anyway i just wanted to bring up

767
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,260
the easiest thing is take care of the

768
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:54,860
money first um learn about i don't know

769
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,280
uh learn about the constitution learn how to

770
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,580
do injunctions go ahead and google i don't

771
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:03,240
know what comes up first driver driver's license

772
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,420
injunction that went popular let me do it

773
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:08,520
right now start with your injunctions jonah bay

774
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,340
is good at the injunctions by the way

775
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,840
jonah bay like the bible jonah and then

776
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,920
bey could go to his website it's it's

777
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,520
pretty cheap stuff it's like these letters and

778
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,500
courses are like 100 bucks but he every

779
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,719
holiday he runs like a 50 off sale

780
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:27,139
okay so uh that was funny because one

781
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:30,100
of the cannabis you know cannabis stores aren't

782
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,920
doing well because they have a 50 markup

783
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,820
and sometimes they have to compete with uh

784
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,600
buy one get one free and if you're

785
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,659
on a 50 markup and you do buy

786
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:41,620
one get one free how much money did

787
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:45,500
you make yeah nothing zero yeah you're giving

788
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,239
it away and this is what they're operating

789
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,679

790
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:54,320
driver's license injunction well this is like a

791
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,720

keyboard uh driver's license injunction refers to a

793
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,000
court order that stops to prevent someone's action

kind of took off well you got to

799
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,890
remember most search engines have an ai function

800
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,830
at the top now that's supposed to like

801
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:30,390
cobble together oh my gosh yeah and it's

802
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:32,030
just a mess you got to skip past

803
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:34,050
that giving you anything yeah it's good garbage

804
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:37,610

it up again just like i promised i

807
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:46,510
was going to bring up the code okay

808
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,610
write this down this is an introduction this

809
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:50,170
is kind of pop fury you know we're

810
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:52,170
like uh bananas in a monkey grove or

811
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:59,850
whatever okay uh 26 cfr section 31

812
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:08,130
.3402 part one it's called voluntary withholding agreements

813
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:15,810
so voluntary withholding agreements employer uh employer employee

814
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,550
agreement employee and his employer may enter an

815
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:21,330
agreement upon section 3402 to provide withholding of

816
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:23,270
income tax payments of amounts described in paragraph

817
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:26,430
b made after december 1970 an agreement may

818
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,950
be entered under this section with respect to

819
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:33,470
the amounts of gross income and then it

820
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:35,870
says an employee wants to enter blah blah

821
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:44,890
blah if you read down this is about

822
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:47,090
where you can cancel that okay it's about

823
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:49,510
income tax withholding right i mean this is

824
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:52,190
about canceling the withholding right well it's income

825
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,890
tax well here's the thing i want to

826
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:57,270
get into that too okay uh if you

827
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:59,550
read that if you want to make a

828
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,210
request in case the employee who desires to

829
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:02,790
enter an agreement under section blah blah with

830
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:05,310
his employer if his employee performs services the

831
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:08,250
agreement was subject monitoring of the i think

832
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,990
this is there's might be another part to

833
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:13,820
it so in other words you have to

834
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:17,720
do a statement that uh okay if the

835
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,920
employee desires the agreement terminate on a specific

836
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,660
date the date of termination of the agreement

837
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,000
a statement that the employee desires withholding a

838
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
federal income tax on a parallel state tax

839
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,580
income tax the chapter name address of the

840
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,620
employer and they're okay basically you have to

841
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:35,500
write an affidavit where you no longer want

842
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:39,660
withholding it's an affidavit form uh an agreement

843
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,340
under section 3402 shall be effective such employer

844
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,980
employee mutually agreed upon however either employer employee

845
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,220
may terminate the agreement prior to the end

846
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,040
of such period by furnishing a signed written

847
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,940
notice whenever you hear a signed written notice

848
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,460
means an affidavit and the way you do

849
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,980
an affidavit is without the united states i'll

850
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,880
give you that one too that's always evidence

851
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,980
right so for example let's say there's a

852
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:03,940
trial over a burned car sometimes they have

853
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,240
the people go out to where the burned

854
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,800
car is or they bring a picture or

855
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,360
the burned car into the courtroom you know

856
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,600
what even trumps that evidence is an affidavit

857
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,820
but it has to be done under a

858
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:16,300
proper attorneys cannot write proper affidavits i don't

859
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,920
know why they just can't they don't hold

860
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,800
water and their clients don't either okay unless

861
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,640
the employer employee have an agreed termination date

862
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,160
the notice should be effective with respect to

863
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,440
the first payment of the amount of respect

864
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,180
to the agreement is effective on made on

865
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:31,100
the first status determined date okay so every

866
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,400
right so you put a date the other

867
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,260
goes 30 days after the date okay furnishing

868
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:38,680
place so so you can terminate all that

869
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,980
right now i gave you the code you

870
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:45,200
go back it's 26 cfr section 31.3402

871
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,360
part one voluntary withholding agreements and then there's

872
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,260
a very important is how to write an

873
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:56,280
affidavit which is it's called this one would

874
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:03,140
go to 28 usc section 1746 unsworn declarations

875
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,980
under penalty of perjury so here this is

876
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,740

the foregoing is true and correct if executed

00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,480
the difference yeah but if you do it

890
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,100
without the united states the verbiage is this

891
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:56,080
i declare certify verify your state under penalty

892
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,400
of perjury under the laws of the united

893
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,100
states of america that the foregoing is true

894
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:06,040
and correct wow so whenever you talk about

895
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:10,140
the united states of may america you're doing

896
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,520
it without the united states whenever you do

897
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,720
stuff with the united states you're getting shafted

898
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,600
with a big cucumber like uh brendan joe

899
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,980
williams says so those are the two things

900
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,340
i want to give that one is 28

901
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:28,100
usc 1746 unsworn declarations under penalty of perjury

902
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,480
now attorneys always do with the united states

903
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,520
they never you'll never see attorney doing the

904
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,060
first verbiage and if you told them to

905
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,700
do it he'll show up to court with

906
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,220
a document and have you sign one that

907
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,120
is the second one for some reason they

908
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:43,220
they're going to shaft you that's funny anyone

909
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,480
that i've ever known i talk about how

910
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,440
attorneys are scumbags and they're not smart someone

911
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,040
says you know my sister is an attorney

912
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,760
and she's such an asshole i'm like thank

913
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,040
you i mean i don't need to hear

914
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,620
that from you right i mean we know

915
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,320
that already you know but you know it's

916
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,720
it's interesting how the dumb ones in the

917
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,520
family either and the ones that are assholes

918
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,980
become attorneys and doctors usually you know now

919
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,560
if the whole family is like that well

920
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,860
i no comment you may not be able

921
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:10,980
to see the difference so all right so

922
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:13,560
basically everything is around the money thing and

923
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:17,060
declarations and all that and i brought up

924
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:21,420
how the money works um the next thing

925
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,640
after that is obviously i don't like to

926
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,580
use the word morality but your law form

927
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:30,300
right if you think this world is fucked

928
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,520
up then why do you want to act

929
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,800
like you belong here be prudent be uh

930
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,100
conservative i don't mean conservative versus liberal right

931
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:42,980
you know uh learn how to um fix

932
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:46,160
stuff including yourself so you don't rely on

933
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,960
these idiots known as professionals because they're morons

934
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:54,720
and um with very few exception and uh

935
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,860
you know that's that's pretty much it i

936
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:57,960
mean i don't know i mean the money

937
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,580
thing is is not all about that but

938
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,380
that's a good what they always come after

939
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,860
so if you have a problem with a

940
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,580
certain agency or whatever what do they want

941
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:06,840
from you a foot massage or they want

942
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,960
money from you right there's money and they

943
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,180
want performance and that performance is monetized okay

944
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:16,860
what are taxes taxes are very simple um

945
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:19,740
if you read uh who's the guy with

946
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:22,020
the toupee the congressman who says i'm congress

947
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:24,860
uh they from idaho ohio and they killed

948
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:27,680
trafficant trafficking the u.s has been bankrupt

949
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,260
it's the biggest trust in world history in

950
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:33,640
terms of the bookkeeping the irs is there

951
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,800
to manage the bookkeeping of the trust your

952
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,300
all caps name and social security number which

953
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,840
is a security number it's not really a

954
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,140
license to issue securities but it's a license

955
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,440
to create them that's it because if you

956
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,860
look at the it's not even a license

957
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,820
it just ties you into the treasury the

958
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:53,740
social security cannot be used as identification it's

959
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,320
right on the card read the back of

960
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,540
it that's true right not to be used

961
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:00,180
for identification if it's lost return it back

962
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:04,580
to the office okay so that's in the

963
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:07,020
trust your sole prop meaning your all caps

964
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,980
name and this and the number associated with

965
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,940
it is in the trust and it's a

966
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:13,660
very big asset it's a let's say there's

967
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:15,400
300 million people in the u.s of

968
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:18,500
a you get a 103 a three one

969
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,960
out of 300 millionth share of the country

970
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,060
but it's not even those are not even

971
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:26,800
the conditions because when it says the definition

972
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,080
of united states debt it says any any

973
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:35,020
check any bond any stock any whatever anything

974
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:38,500
that resembles money paper or not is owed

975
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,180
to owed by the united states and they

976
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:44,220
will handle it right so it's title it's

977
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:48,220
uh title uh i think it's title 18

978
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:52,380
section 8 12 is it 18 usc 8

979
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:55,720
uh this laptop i got a nice screen

980
00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:00,000
here let's see uh 18 usc 8 let

981
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,720
me see how good the memory works yeah

982
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,960
okay 18 usc 8 obligation or other security

983
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,140
of the united states defined the term obligation

984
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:11,100
or other security of the united states includes

985
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:15,080
all bonds certificates of indebtedness national bank currency

986
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,800
federal reserve notes federal reserve bank notes coupons

987
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,400
united states notes treasury notes gold certificates silver

988
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:26,560
certificates fractional notes certificate of deposit bills should

989
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,040
i say bills again let me say one

990
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:31,640
more time bills checks or drafts for money

991
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:34,980
drawn upon or authorized officers of the united

992
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:38,540
states stamps and represent that's why people say

993
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:40,400
stamps are backed by gold no they're not

994
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,340
and other representatives of representatives of value of

995
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:47,140
whatever denomination issued under any act of congress

996
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:49,460
and canceled united states stamps so cancel united

997
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:51,360
states stamps so out of value i used

998
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:54,800
to play around with those but uh a

999
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,960
canceled two cent stamp without a zip code

1000
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,720
you send the envelope they get it take

1001
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,000
the stamp off because it's canceled as long

1002
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,140
as you don't use the zip code you

1003
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:03,840
can keep using the two cent stamp until

1004
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:08,660
it's totally worn out so uh yeah yeah

1005
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:11,320
sometimes they don't they don't know that but

1006
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:14,020
you can so don't that doesn't care it

1007
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:15,780
doesn't matter what letter what they're charging for

1008
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,500
anyway these are i know it says upon

1009
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,580
authorized officers of the united states it's not

1010
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:25,300
an authorized officer the term united states territorial

1011
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:28,100
sense includes all places and waters country okay

1012
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,640
they're not explaining what an officer is here

1013
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,700
an officer does stuff that's official now an

1014
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:36,920
officer since you're a part of a trust

1015
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,640
anyone in a trust can be an officer

1016
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,780
of a you hold an office not you

1017
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,720
the all caps name right and this is

1018
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:49,260
drawn by or upon authorized officers of the

1019
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:54,640
united states stamps right okay so it does

1020
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,960
not exclude it doesn't say it includes all

1021
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,540
the citizens all the non-citizens resident aliens

1022
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:03,040
non-resident aliens but it doesn't exclude them

1023
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:07,120
because it's all by presumption but it basically

1024
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,640
gave you a long list so what happens

1025
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,060
when you get an electric bill it's already

1026
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:13,720
paid by the united states not the bill

1027
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:18,260
itself by the application right and that bill

1028
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:20,080
is actually an interest payment to you from

1029
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,800
that huge chunk they took out when you

1030
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,020
applied that's why if anyone has a car

1031
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:26,400
in a trust and you want to get

1032
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,760
insurance for it's registered with the trust name

1033
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,820
the issue the insurance will will fight you

1034
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:33,480
tooth and nail and they say we cannot

1035
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,860
insure the trust it has to be as

1036
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:37,660
someone with a social security number because when

1037
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:40,260
you get an insurance they run to the

1038
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:41,840
treasury and pull i don't know eight nine

1039
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,820
hundred thousand a million depending on what the

1040
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:46,500
policy is ten times usually so let's say

1041
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:49,300
you get basic coverage and it's forty thousand

1042
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,880
dollars right coverage basic coverage they pull a

1043
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,500
minimum four hundred thousand plus their fees and

1044
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:57,400
it's sitting there you don't know that and

1045
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,800
then when you have a claim they go

1046
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,720
take that claim and monetize it again you

1047
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,660
could it's not hard to prove this by

1048
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:06,780
the way so i just wanted to bring

1049
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:09,280
these things up but the money issue okay

1050
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:14,120
so back to taxes what taxes are is

1051
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:18,180
the franchise board collects the the fees the

1052
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:22,060
irs collects the fees the state franchise tax

1053
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:25,620
collects the fees for the trustees who are

1054
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:28,360
running the trust that your name is in

1055
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:30,680
and your property's name is in that's all

1056
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:33,240
it is it's if you are a trustee

1057
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,460
you have a right to charge for your

1058
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,520
services there are professional trustee services they're usually

1059
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:42,000
accountants and they start at 250 an hour

1060
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,940
good ones are 700 an hour okay right

1061
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:48,900
so that's why you you are doing you're

1062
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:52,100
using that name that all caps name and

1063
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:55,360
the irs withholding which is voluntary is the

1064
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,420
truck is the fee you're met the irs

1065
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:00,900
is managing the trust and no who works

1066
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:04,460
for free right very good right no one

1067
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:07,500
so they have a scale of what their

1068
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,000
fees are just like when you go rent

1069
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,260
the tool they have a chart you know

1070
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:13,140
whatever income bracket whatever and you have to

1071
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,920
do reporting that's all trust stuff i've been

1072
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,280
saying this for a long time and jonah

1073
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,960
bay recently said it's all trust stuff that's

1074
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:22,960
like the hundredth monkey thing right yeah so

1075
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,840
the taxes are actually fees for the trustees

1076
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,600
to operate the trust when you do the

1077
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,640
12 usc 411 demand for lawful money what

1078
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,520
you're doing is say i can handle my

1079
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,320
own affairs i'm not looking to get trust

1080
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:42,500
funds right okay so leave me alone now

1081
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:46,160
the thing with for example property tax every

1082
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,360
every every property tax jurisdiction says that if

1083
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:53,020
you are a non-profit you're not subject

1084
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:55,800
to property property tax and some people bring

1085
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,340
this up if you do a proper statement

1086
00:48:57,340 --> 00:49:01,320
they'll say well where's your 501c3 or 508

1087
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,100
blah blah blah like where does it say

1088
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:04,220
in the law i have to have an

1089
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:08,840
irs certificate nowhere and just think about it

1090
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,120
when people hear non-profit say oh 501c3

1091
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:14,500
blah blah blah right yes 505 whatever right

1092
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,480
no no no non-profit so let me

1093
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,620
ask you where you eat sleep shit fuck

1094
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:20,960
uh whatever else you do are you doing

1095
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,360
any of that for profit no and the

1096
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,600
answer is no so why are you paying

1097
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,600
property tax if you have a house right

1098
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,860
make a statement take them to court you

1099
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:33,300
know it's funny when you go to the

1100
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:35,040
county see where do you get the authority

1101
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,640
to tax the property they say from the

1102
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,880
state you go to the state and you

1103
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,120
ask them where do you get the authority

1104
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:42,080
to tax it to the county says no

1105
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:46,340
we don't the county does it because there's

1106
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:49,120
no it's all bullshit it's all if you

1107
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:52,360
cannot remember i read a thing you will

1108
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,160
be treated as a minor even though you're

1109
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,160
of legal age can you be does that

1110
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,820
mean if i'm 65 can i be treated

1111
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:01,280
as a minor that's according to that statement

1112
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,460
that's what it says yeah yeah it didn't

1113
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:06,260
give conditions up until you're 25 and then

1114
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:09,620
you're not no no no so yeah that's

1115
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:11,260
why early on on the sonics what i

1116
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:14,420
say people start developing 9 or 12 years

1117
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:16,020
old you might see your grandpa your uncle

1118
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:17,980
your mom and your dad 60 70 50

1119
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:20,200
i'm telling you that's a nine-year-old

1120
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,780
in there they've never grown up right you've

1121
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:24,320
heard me say this early on the sonics

1122
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:28,940
yes you know yeah they're minors so this

1123
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:31,780
is not a matter of learning what to

1124
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:33,800
do from guru it's a matter of growing

1125
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:37,180
up look i don't still don't know what

1126
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:38,740
i'm going to do when i grow up

1127
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:41,540
right so i don't even know what that

1128
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:43,480
means you actually grow down by the way

1129
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:45,360
you don't grow up when your body grows

1130
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:48,860
yeah eventually right your arms your arms no

1131
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:50,820
no no as your arms get longer and

1132
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:52,640
you get taller let's say you're really small

1133
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,820
four years old and by the time you're

1134
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:56,460

1137
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,620
growing up that's growing down your legs are

1138
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:05,160

1139
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:08,260
are growing like out from the body right

1140
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:11,120

1141
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,860

1142
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:18,300
