Sonic Advent 230 and here we are and Greek how you today again I ask I'm doing yeah much better on a laptop I hope the audio is a little better the old iPhone that I have is just not hacking the this type of transmission so yeah I want to go to the chat real quick you have some stuff Vandy posted some Michio Kushi stuff and nice there's really not much to go anywhere on macrobiotics or that kind of philosophy other than people's like what do they call them when you do a website to talk about your personal experiences kind of thing Oh like a blog yeah yeah yeah right and you could look up some of his books but one thing I met Michio Kushi I don't know him very well but I did not know him very well I when I was at the New York City Macrobiotic Center they they had an honorary dinner for him and Shizuko asked me to bake to make the dessert mind you I was only there for a few months and but anyway I baked this carrot cake macrobiotic sort of vegan yeah mm-hmm and it's always good to make the cake a day before like if you know anyone who has like a cake business especially for high and you know wedding cakes would cost 5,000 bucks right and yeah or more and so you always make the actually wedding cakes you freeze them when you freeze the sponge the cake and thaw it out it gets moist but supposedly hmm okay I was sort of aware so anyway I made the entire cake the day before next day of I opened the fridge I had a frosting on it was made with some spices agar-agar kuzu silken soy milk a bunch of other stuff like you know vegetable stuff really nice frosting or icing icing okay there's a difference in frosting and icing I think what's supposed to be thicker than the other but anyway okay I opened the fridge the next day and all the icing frosting is gone it got absorbed into the cake so now I had a cake with no I just look like a plain cake the two-layer cake I panicked so I made it again and put it on this time it stayed so ended up turning like a rum cake see because when you put those frostings you know when you whip you creams and things you make butter right or hydrogen it's very durable where if you whip certain vegetable stuff and it's not hydrogenated it doesn't support itself very long kind of like a cappuccino imagine a cappuccino in the fridge overnight it's no longer a cappuccino right so yeah so anyway I anyway make a long story short I met him there once and I met him again but we're looking reading his books very dogmatic very very dogmatic he's almost like really angry about Americans he's happy about being here some weird story but it's very dogmatic in the end of his life he started speaking more on how you should just eat traditional right so if you're in Saudi Arabia don't keep donkey milk is fine right okay or cat I'm sorry can't camel milk is fine camel milk all right camel milk but from someone that knows him sick meet you you know they said they died of cancer he would secretly have a rice cooker for regular white rice and salted salmon and when no one was around or when he wanted to be alone he told people not to come over he would prepare regular white rice and salted salmon for himself on a regular basis and a couple of people that I knew personally found him in the closet with some young intern ladies he was married so he's not perfect and he's very dogmatic he brings forward some good information I personally would not recommend him to beginners or overall unless you know the warning I just gave you very dogmatic so but most of the information that is neutral without his opinion let's say on it is pretty good because he's just referring bringing forward what was around for thousands of years anyway so I like to mix experimental you know the province of the mind has no limits and it's to be experienced experimentation right right that's John C. Lilly not just you hear people talk about just experience well most people are just too dead from the neck up to for any experience to matter first of all but when you say experience through experimentation if you're learned about the real scientific method or the scientific method it gives you protocols for experimentation right right you got your theory hypothesis experiment conclusion and other things so you have to be a good observer you have to have controls be able to take measurement be able to communicate what you're doing and the results you have to be honest in terms of objective if you do exclusions mention them that's how I live my life and I always have people when we had circles of social people when they met someone they would always come to me and say hey do you know so-and-so I'm thinking of dating or what do you think and they knew that whatever I said held water you know what I mean okay why because my experience with that person was experimental that's X sounds kind of weird though right there because when you say what did you experiment with yeah nothing like that but you know it meaning I observed them that try to based on certain whatever benchmark so I'm glad that he put that video up and I know more and more people are watching it that kind of stuff and that's a very good foundation but there's really no way to simplify outside of microbiotics what Michio is doing and that's what I try to do that's why I don't even want to call it yin and yang at all but I call it expansive contractive balance of universal principles so I just want to bring that up because it's good it's very rare that someone puts up a Michio video but also Vandy asked about some guy having his head almost severed and put on ice now you got to give me information Vandy where you got that source of that because we have this thing in America I think you call it Chinese whispers here it's called telephone right where you start when one story goes from one place to another could have been the guy lost his wallet and he saw you know a severed head and ended up being by time he gets the story that his head was severed and you put in an ice barrel you know I don't know so if it's a lot otherwise I'm not going to invest money much in it and the guy regular one two three four five six put up a video for a tick tock video about aliens talking about how screwed or rugged humans are for having a monetary system as they do which I keep talking about so right and I posted an old interview I didn't this is where Chuck and I I was asked to fill in for Vinny Eastwood I said no and then you filled in for it I went back to see who filled in for it that's how got introduced to you right and I had done one prior way prior to that for Vinny and I had Trevor James Constable as the guest and that's what that's posted on the chat recently and I think there's other stuff we can address but I posted some public enemy stuff and super sperm I don't know if you guys know Captain Sky you remember that song super sperm I you know you mentioned this to me before and it's still not ringing a bell I don't remember even going to look it up all right well it's on the chat you could you could public enemy my 88 Delta 88 by Oldsmobile 88 mm-hmm that song in the they use the samples from that oh they sample then I put up the samples from super sperm and in public enemy public enemies the album mm-hmm I guess from 1984 85 think about it most some actually I would say I don't know but venture to say half or most or some of our subs were not even born yet believe it or not yeah that is a weird thought so yeah yeah well sometimes when you and I go back into like the 70s and 80s I mean to them that that might as well be what you know the 1800s because it's just outside of their experiences and so I always find that interesting anyway you know somebody sent me one of the longest messages ever like it's an email length serious message right and he tells me I've gotten a 24 by the way I've gotten a 24 page PDF email right well 24 so when you say long and it's a page or two okay deal with it no hey look nobody related to what we do here has sent me a message like that in email they do that for JFK stuff they send me you know a thousand page treatise on something and go what is your thought you know and they want it in five minutes just read the conclusion yeah I know I go back to the conclusion should wrap it up right I go backwards and I skim and then I can usually get it done in 15 but you can't get it in five okay you know anyway is that this is pretty interesting though and I want to read the whole thing and pause and let you address each piece of it okay I would really appreciate the law information I have paid thousands of dollars for different teachers and it's still very confusing to me some people say I need to rescind all my documents others say that's not necessary so I stopped right go ahead okay I would rescind what is what is not necessary like lice any license any corporation is a rescission but it's not they don't have an offer for a rescission is different rescission is for a contract you could rescind what you do is you cancel them right you would cancel them or annul them and that most of these things do have forms for that what you can't cancel is a social security number and the straw man just don't use it I had I had spent a year trying to get high up people in the Social Security Administration finally did in the US Treasury and it's their creation so you you know you you had no part in it there's a baby act about that something called the baby act look it up that you're not responsible for anything that was done for you by others right whether it was official unofficial or whatever when you were a younger than 18 have you heard of the baby act it's pretty powerful if you know how to use it yeah it begins when they say your mother reports on your birth your mother reports your birth and it begins there right yeah yeah right it begins there it also begins on prenatal care before you were born if they determine you or whatever okay he's called a retard back then down syndrome now it's not politically correct to say that right mm-hmm so I mean like I grew up in a very whatever white neighborhood and when a black people were niggers right you say it like that you know and they knew what you were talking about if you said someone was black they stopped for a minute and thinking like what does that mean oh you mean a nigger I said yeah okay that's how I grew up and and when you were just dysfunctional retard and they had you know the down syndrome all that stuff these are things that were put on you before you were born including the n-word by the way it's all that shit you can so the baby act doesn't make you responsible and you do that by injunction but driver's license and corporations and stuff like that yeah get rid of all that stuff if you can because that ties you into something that you know nothing about unless you do know it all goes back to the Queen and the Vatican all of it now there used to be a very comprehensive website about the Vatican building in the vat in Vatican City and it's not the Vatican St. Pilar's Basilica they tell you we are a red building behind that all of the State Departments of the world that subscribe to us we create their policy and they cannot appeal it and that was a first line of the thing real arrogant now you can't find it anymore it used to be an HTML if anyone wants to look it up the Vatican red building or something I forgot what they call it just it was just called the Vatican all the State Department subscribed to so State Department is actually ecclesiastic and then you have the Queen of England which is the money system but through the Bar Association and the Attorney General's position as trustee and blah blah blah blah blah right there's another Attorney General called a private Attorney General that anyone can take that position but it should what case-by-case basis right so you can't say you're a private Attorney General you would only be for one case at a time and when you're not running the case you're not a private Attorney General so like for example we're going to be trafficking the water devices way we do that is the sole proprietorship known as the straw man the all-caps letter fills out a DBA doing business as and we don't say DBA we're just I could actually read the doc it's very simple it's two sentences that you you know everything is materially factual and you are going to be doing business in the county city states and worldwide is this other name and I just want to make public record and then you put it in the newspaper and once you get the record back from the county you get a raised seal on it you can go open a bank account with it using the Social Security number right which is actually a trust number it's in the state trust and the name is what's in the trust which is a sole proprietorship and then you do business that way and when you do banking you open the bank account at the signature card you write demand for lawful money per 12 USC 411 sign your name comma agent or you could sign your name semicolon last name first name last you could also do last name first but the best is agent because in the UCC you know on checks it says authorized signature right the UCC states that if you sign any document instrument it's called and the name of the that's on the instrument is the same as the person that's signing you are not responsible for the name on the instrument so let's say you're Chuck Ocelli on your checkbook you know it's all capital letters Chuck Ocelli whatever Charles Ocelli right right and on the signature line when you're issuing the check on the front that's micro print on the line and it says authorized signature authorized signature repeat I think you know about that right and well you're signing for that entity known as Charles Ocelli which is a sole proprietorship with the trust to state identification number it's not an ID number but it says trust the state ID means you have a share of the United States from the receivership okay so you could actually write a bad check or a blank or check a check from a closed account or these blank checks you can get from whatever you can buy them at Office Depot no bank account or anything and it's good if you go and use it they'll tell you the check bounced or it's that's why I use the one that doesn't have any bank information and they'll tell you it's no good well give it back to me and then you're not going to give it back to you because they're going to give you a legal copy and this back shows that the bank stamped received on it received does it mean like when you receive something receive is a contractual term right because it has to be without defect for a legal entity like a bank to receive it so when you have a received stamp from a bank it means it's without defect and the purpose of the instrument can be fulfilled and is fulfilled what is the purpose of an instrument like a check it's very good Chuck to order funds to order funds either for cash or credit on account right right if the bank couldn't do that they would not stamp it received so there's no such thing as a bad check so Attorney General says you go into sources bad check writers will be prosecuted you see out all the time go ahead of course try it try it and the only way they could prosecute you is if they go back and say you had a bank account and you gave the bank full security interest and you're operating on a hundred percent banking fees that's the most they can do right so attorneys don't know anything just because the Attorney General doesn't mean on any law at all that's confusing that's confusing because one would think that receiving something is simply it was you know put in your possession but right it's not like that just like the word nice doesn't mean what you think it is look up what received means in banking it's called a bankers acceptance a banker will not accept anything that has defects and that's outside of the purpose of banker when he gets something he has to see what the purpose of that instrument is if he can't fulfill the purpose of that instrument it's returned with a with a note why they usually incorporate when you have accounts they'll return checks or whatever and they'll give you a Xerox copy and they'll just check off boxes why it was no good they don't want even sits there and writes anything anymore and you just look at the sheet and it checked off well it didn't have a date checked off it didn't have a signature right whatever so yeah okay yeah I kind of gave it slow enough you notice I spoke at a low tempo right yes very much so very much so I went I just did a quick lookup you know what is what does it mean to receive something in banking and it means that a payment or deposit has been successfully sent to the recipient bank and is in the process of being credited to the recipients right account the exact status and availability of the funds depend on the type of transaction and the banks processing times says but that's cool how they said that's a newer definition because it says in the process so they get some leeway right so they come back and say it's no good so if the bank if the check is no good all right simply give me back the check they can't they only give you a copy of it I was in trial once and need a recess I ran out that we wanted the check back from the bank and the banks that the judge says this is good enough and it was just said legal copy on a Xerox mm-hmm front and back so I said any 10-minute recess mm-hmm and they wouldn't give it but finally make a long story short I did get it I went and got a $10 bill I made a copy of it front and back came into the courtroom and I said just I'm going to object to what the plaintiff has brought forward and my response and rebuttal is your honor can I spend this and I held up Xerox copy of a $10 bill that wrote legal copy on it right right so no the next next we're not can't use that point anymore yeah you didn't get your check yeah you don't need the check and it just went on and on this is like 2007 Wow what do I know anyway I've been in this for a long time so well 20 years plus but anyway back to the I am yeah I wanted to continue on with this question though to see where else it goes because there's supposedly a remedy yeah please do I just want to see that we covered the question oh yeah I believe we do and the reason let you go back to it the bank card should cover should say demand for let's your only remedy and if you want to know where this remedy is best explained go to YouTube and it would be YouTube called 1913 Federal Reserve Act remedy by David Merrill it's about a half hour long listen to that he speaks he's speaking on like a 16th grade level you know high school is 12th grade right college bachelor's degree is 16th degree 16th grade so that's how the government has you by the way if you have a four-year degree it's you've completed 16 grades right you've seen that before yeah I've seen okay yeah and it goes up to yeah so that would be your backup what's the remedy for the Federal Reserve it's the only remedy for the Federal Reserve Act directly there are other remedies for other things every time you have an instrument before you endorse it demand for law or lawful money only is also a demand only means the demand lawful money only or demand for lawful money 12 USC 411 sign the name however you sign it comma agent or without recourse when you get more advanced you'll know when to use what right so you know like when you get food you don't automatically put salt on it like like like television you taste it first right people I've seen people sit down and put food and they throw it away salt and pepper before they taste it that's they learned how to eat by watching television wow right so you're not going to get any of this on TV or alternative media or gurus right so anyway all right so I hope I was clear with that yeah I've never thought about that before there are some people who salt and pepper their stuff before they ever tasted I don't understand that at all because they learned how to eat by watching TV how pathetic is that it just makes no sense so anyway you know no TV doesn't make any sense that's right exactly all right so there's supposedly a remedy for everything yet people won't tell you the remedy because quote you need to figure it out for yourself end quote uh honestly not really well honestly all this law legal stuff is like reading the bible you can read it in all sorts of ways it depends on who is translating it once you know the truth you can see through the lies but until then it's all very convoluted I like how the greek is very straightforward but I'd like to hear some of his information uh where he talks for hours straight I feel like he starts to get into something and then the sound clip cuts off uh these are very brief yeah they're very brief they're hints anyways um I'm new here and so I'm trying to start from the beginning and piece all these together but if anyone has some direction toward the law info that's why I joined this patreon and yes I get that everything the greek talks about is about the laws of this realm there's more to this by the way but I think I'll pause there yeah it's not everything it's actually how can you get her how can you sit at a game board without right I'm not going to give the analogy you can guess how can you sit down and play a game without what oh the laws the rules yeah you need to know what the rules are otherwise even something simple when you when you're given uh different shape holes and different shape pegs this one doesn't fit anybody got a sander and a chisel no you're supposed to move them around until they fit right find the one that fits right this is a this is a one it doesn't go uh the square one doesn't go in the run you let's chisel it down no you're supposed to make maneuvers till you yeah cut the top off the box throw them all in there done uh you know just well my favorite is I've seen people that said they're good mechanics I had a water pump and a timing belt change and he ended up with extra bolts wow oh where do they go god damn it why do you have bolts left over such a good mechanic asshole yeah or the word you go to surgery and they you know they're cleaning up and it's like we're missing some hemostats and some yeah you've heard of surgeons leaving oh absolutely somebody I remember the joke for a while was somebody count the sponges because there was a oh yeah that's a big one sponges getting lost inside of patients constantly that's a terrible way to go slow sepsisemia oh you turn green oh my gosh I've seen that I've walked down hospitals and seen you know like hepatitis with looking yellow green skin and dark circles under the eyes under morphine I'm like oh they left the sponge in that one anyway yeah it's a murder fucking factory avoid those assholes but okay right okay so anyway next uh but I'd really like to catch some aha waves on the bigger picture of how to live without the fear of government coming after me for not saying the right thing or signing the right document I'm tired of living with analysis paralysis hiding from the world because I can't figure out how this all works all right stop right there that's it that's the end what it's that's all good it's all based on money everything's being done for money that doesn't exist think how insane that is there is no money and everyone wants money the government all corporations all governments are what's called legally debtors in possession they're all debtors you are the creditor period by doing the demand for lawful money will clear you from the you know taxes don't pay anything no taxes it can't they use negotiable instruments and I've explained the miller bond process let me just do a thing this will help let's say uh New York wants to build the governor como bridge cost a billion dollars this is actually pretty close to the truth I've researched that I was looking at it the actual the bonds also so they get all these they get an architect and they get the the the project bid out blueprints and all that to contractors and they bid on it and when they award the bid the contractor does what's called the miller bond process he puts in what's called a performance bond a bid bond a performance bond and a surety bond and they each have a let's say the the award is a billion dollars it's pretty close to a billion I think was like 700 800 million for that bridge each one of those bonds let's say is a billion the government the state takes that and they deposit it through the federal reserve and they get three billion actually a little less than the billions federal reserve takes five percent and then they put it on the market for about three four months and they start building it about a year later sound about right they never start right away so so the actual this is how sick of a world you live in whoever you is and uh billion dollar bridge the guy who's building it funded it not once not twice but three times and as he's building it he's under the impression that he has to get progress payments as he's building it according to contract and the money's coming from taxes that the state collected what a crock of shit that's worse than the world trade centers were vaporized by osama bin laden with box cutters hmm that's how bad this is the world you live in and you go to these morons to tell you how you're if you're healthy or not or your financial advice come on you are on your own is the first thing so the advice that you got regarding analysis paralysis yes very good you realize you it's not nothing's working because it's a planet full of idiots I don't know how else to say it right so give me an example I recently caught an archaic thing with this guy mark pass you I don't know if you remember him from back in the days of american freedom radio he's making a lot of rounds back 15 20 years ago I didn't think he was still around I didn't either I didn't either I was because I never was into now this is not to disparage him I don't know it's it's like it's it's tom and dick or michael harris or whatever it doesn't matter it's not personal it's my god not personal what he says is ra ra ra we gotta create human freedom and slavery we gotta be free we gotta be not one goddamn comment not one suggestion on how to go about doing that not one thing no oh my gosh that's worse than uh than anything I've heard out there from the mainstream just as bad so this is what this is what you guys meaning you guys whoever you guys are or have to put up with until you find someone that can tell you how it can be done and show you the mechanics behind it a really good car mechanic will do that by the way or a really good surgeon will walk you into the say this is what we want to do and show you the x-rays and tell you what they're going to do and how long it's going to heal a really good dentist will tell you if you ever have a tooth extracted that the opposite truth the opposing tooth will experience something called eruption and continue growing because now there's an empty pocket above it so be aware of that it'll you're right anyone who's ever said i'm going to go have a tooth extract this let me know if the dentist talks about eruption of the opposing tooth on the bite no one ever does then when the person went for a follow-through they brought that up and the dentist was surprised that they brought it up this is standard stuff that needs to be discussed so i always bring up the medical morons and legal morons are not even worth talking about they're like oh my gosh that's why idiocracy already happened but another interesting thing about money itself it has always cracked me up as people scream about they're taking away our change they're taking it's going to be a cashless society and i'm you guys are a little late cashless here's the problem this is okay even if you go with their rules and you go with their uh reports and everything else the amount of money that they say exists does not physically exist it hasn't it doesn't it actually does not securities okay yeah chuck let me just say this but the amount of dollars they say there's so many dollars here there's so many dollars there you can't physically account for that you could never collect up all the paper and everything else and add it up to what they have on the computer just a trillion just a trillion is not enough paper to print and it would be a stack of money to the moon yeah it's not fathom it can't be done so here um you've heard me say that when regulations get strong uh the black market gets strong when you want to weaken the black same people by the way run the government run the black market same group of course uh the same and if you want the black market to get weak you deregulate okay so the cash is dependent two people the two industries or groups that are mostly dependent on cash money i'm talking like federal reserve notes or bureaus no in notes paper notes in australia they have plastic notes whatever it's like a tyvek yeah all that stuff and coin but mostly paper it's much better to carry a hundred dollar bill than a hundred dollars and quarters by the way for sure and you notice i didn't say pennies and don't even bother with the pennies so the black market depends on that and also the super wealthy depend on that i'm giving you an example all right so i got 150 million i'm going to go put it in the bank that's a really good business decision since the bank only insures it for 250 000 that sounds like a good business decision to put 150 million in the bank when only 250 000 is going to be insured does that sound like a good risk no it sounds stupid that's the funny thing that's about as dumb as dumb can get like i've always seen those people who win the lottery you know there's like a billion dollar lottery that just i don't know if they anybody wanted or whatever but i passed they put the money in the bank they're only insured for 250 000 yeah that's the funny thing like i'm going to take this check to the bank and i'm like you're going to take a half a billion dollar check to a bank that's only guaranteeing you that you'll have 250 000 yeah well let's say per account so you might if you broke it up into 10 accounts that's still just 2.5 yeah million right right yeah because which was not even not even one percent right right so uh because one percent would be five million so okay so the wealthy what they do is they call the bank ahead and they want pallets of cash okay and they have there's people that do that and they move it and it could be as simple as moving the cash from one building to another across the street it could be on a property that they have give you an example when you're on a compound a wealthy person's compound right um and they have a break-in or they have a let's say a security issue they don't call the the local sheriff or the police they have their own security people right right and when they catch you you don't have any rights they don't read you any rights they actually catch you and they've been trained that you're not human they would treat you like a wild dog you'll probably never be found again for breaking into someone's house they don't call the sheriff right or the police hint so the money system works the same way they don't use banks the way that slaves these are slave banks right so anyway i just wanted to bring up the easiest thing is take care of the money first um learn about i don't know uh learn about the constitution learn how to do injunctions go ahead and google i don't know what comes up first driver driver's license injunction that went popular let me do it right now start with your injunctions jonah bay is good at the injunctions by the way jonah bay like the bible jonah and then bey could go to his website it's it's pretty cheap stuff it's like these letters and courses are like 100 bucks but he every holiday he runs like a 50 off sale okay so uh that was funny because one of the cannabis you know cannabis stores aren't doing well because they have a 50 markup and sometimes they have to compete with uh buy one get one free and if you're on a 50 markup and you do buy one get one free how much money did you make yeah nothing zero yeah you're giving it away and this is what they're operating on all right so i'm going to write driver's license injunction well this is like a live uh oh this is great just a keyboard uh driver's license injunction refers to a court order that stops to prevent someone's action related to a driver's license no no uh arizona can deny driver's licenses no this is driver's license injunction done by first individual the guy did it in the 70s and it kind of took off well you got to remember most search engines have an ai function at the top now that's supposed to like cobble together oh my gosh yeah and it's just a mess you got to skip past that giving you anything yeah it's good garbage what's the guy's name he went national with it um oh shit i i we'll bring it up again just like i promised i was going to bring up the code okay write this down this is an introduction this is kind of pop fury you know we're like uh bananas in a monkey grove or whatever okay uh 26 cfr section 31.3402 part one it's called voluntary withholding agreements so voluntary withholding agreements employer uh employer employee agreement employee and his employer may enter an agreement upon section 3402 to provide withholding of income tax payments of amounts described in paragraph b made after december 1970 an agreement may be entered under this section with respect to the amounts of gross income and then it says an employee wants to enter blah blah blah if you read down this is about where you can cancel that okay it's about income tax withholding right i mean this is about canceling the withholding right well it's income tax well here's the thing i want to get into that too okay uh if you read that if you want to make a request in case the employee who desires to enter an agreement under section blah blah with his employer if his employee performs services the agreement was subject monitoring of the i think this is there's might be another part to it so in other words you have to do a statement that uh okay if the employee desires the agreement terminate on a specific date the date of termination of the agreement a statement that the employee desires withholding a federal income tax on a parallel state tax income tax the chapter name address of the employer and they're okay basically you have to write an affidavit where you no longer want withholding it's an affidavit form uh an agreement under section 3402 shall be effective such employer employee mutually agreed upon however either employer employee may terminate the agreement prior to the end of such period by furnishing a signed written notice whenever you hear a signed written notice means an affidavit and the way you do an affidavit is without the united states i'll give you that one too that's always evidence right so for example let's say there's a trial over a burned car sometimes they have the people go out to where the burned car is or they bring a picture or the burned car into the courtroom you know what even trumps that evidence is an affidavit but it has to be done under a proper attorneys cannot write proper affidavits i don't know why they just can't they don't hold water and their clients don't either okay unless the employer employee have an agreed termination date the notice should be effective with respect to the first payment of the amount of respect to the agreement is effective on made on the first status determined date okay so every right so you put a date the other goes 30 days after the date okay furnishing place so so you can terminate all that right now i gave you the code you go back it's 26 cfr section 31.3402 part one voluntary withholding agreements and then there's a very important is how to write an affidavit which is it's called this one would go to 28 usc section 1746 unsworn declarations under penalty of perjury so here this is interesting you want to do it without the united states this is the when you when you execute without the united states this is what the verbiage is i declare certify verify your state under penalty of perjury under the laws of the united states of america that the foregoing is true and correct if executed within the united states wink wink united states is what washington dc right it's not part of this country guys this is what verbiage that it has i declare certify verify your state under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct that's it you see the difference yeah but if you do it without the united states the verbiage is this i declare certify verify your state under penalty of perjury under the laws of the united states of america that the foregoing is true and correct wow so whenever you talk about the united states of may america you're doing it without the united states whenever you do stuff with the united states you're getting shafted with a big cucumber like uh brendan joe williams says so those are the two things i want to give that one is 28 usc 1746 unsworn declarations under penalty of perjury now attorneys always do with the united states they never you'll never see attorney doing the first verbiage and if you told them to do it he'll show up to court with a document and have you sign one that is the second one for some reason they they're going to shaft you that's funny anyone that i've ever known i talk about how attorneys are scumbags and they're not smart someone says you know my sister is an attorney and she's such an asshole i'm like thank you i mean i don't need to hear that from you right i mean we know that already you know but you know it's it's interesting how the dumb ones in the family either and the ones that are assholes become attorneys and doctors usually you know now if the whole family is like that well i no comment you may not be able to see the difference so all right so basically everything is around the money thing and declarations and all that and i brought up how the money works um the next thing after that is obviously i don't like to use the word morality but your law form right if you think this world is fucked up then why do you want to act like you belong here be prudent be uh conservative i don't mean conservative versus liberal right you know uh learn how to um fix stuff including yourself so you don't rely on these idiots known as professionals because they're morons and um with very few exception and uh you know that's that's pretty much it i mean i don't know i mean the money thing is is not all about that but that's a good what they always come after so if you have a problem with a certain agency or whatever what do they want from you a foot massage or they want money from you right there's money and they want performance and that performance is monetized okay what are taxes taxes are very simple um if you read uh who's the guy with the toupee the congressman who says i'm congress uh they from idaho ohio and they killed trafficant trafficking the u.s has been bankrupt it's the biggest trust in world history in terms of the bookkeeping the irs is there to manage the bookkeeping of the trust your all caps name and social security number which is a security number it's not really a license to issue securities but it's a license to create them that's it because if you look at the it's not even a license it just ties you into the treasury the social security cannot be used as identification it's right on the card read the back of it that's true right not to be used for identification if it's lost return it back to the office okay so that's in the trust your sole prop meaning your all caps name and this and the number associated with it is in the trust and it's a very big asset it's a let's say there's 300 million people in the u.s of a you get a 103 a three one out of 300 millionth share of the country but it's not even those are not even the conditions because when it says the definition of united states debt it says any any check any bond any stock any whatever anything that resembles money paper or not is owed to owed by the united states and they will handle it right so it's title it's uh title uh i think it's title 18 section 8 12 is it 18 usc 8 uh this laptop i got a nice screen here let's see uh 18 usc 8 let me see how good the memory works yeah okay 18 usc 8 obligation or other security of the united states defined the term obligation or other security of the united states includes all bonds certificates of indebtedness national bank currency federal reserve notes federal reserve bank notes coupons united states notes treasury notes gold certificates silver certificates fractional notes certificate of deposit bills should i say bills again let me say one more time bills checks or drafts for money drawn upon or authorized officers of the united states stamps and represent that's why people say stamps are backed by gold no they're not and other representatives of representatives of value of whatever denomination issued under any act of congress and canceled united states stamps so cancel united states stamps so out of value i used to play around with those but uh a canceled two cent stamp without a zip code you send the envelope they get it take the stamp off because it's canceled as long as you don't use the zip code you can keep using the two cent stamp until it's totally worn out so uh yeah yeah sometimes they don't they don't know that but you can so don't that doesn't care it doesn't matter what letter what they're charging for anyway these are i know it says upon authorized officers of the united states it's not an authorized officer the term united states territorial sense includes all places and waters country okay they're not explaining what an officer is here an officer does stuff that's official now an officer since you're a part of a trust anyone in a trust can be an officer of a you hold an office not you the all caps name right and this is drawn by or upon authorized officers of the united states stamps right okay so it does not exclude it doesn't say it includes all the citizens all the non-citizens resident aliens non-resident aliens but it doesn't exclude them because it's all by presumption but it basically gave you a long list so what happens when you get an electric bill it's already paid by the united states not the bill itself by the application right and that bill is actually an interest payment to you from that huge chunk they took out when you applied that's why if anyone has a car in a trust and you want to get insurance for it's registered with the trust name the issue the insurance will will fight you tooth and nail and they say we cannot insure the trust it has to be as someone with a social security number because when you get an insurance they run to the treasury and pull i don't know eight nine hundred thousand a million depending on what the policy is ten times usually so let's say you get basic coverage and it's forty thousand dollars right coverage basic coverage they pull a minimum four hundred thousand plus their fees and it's sitting there you don't know that and then when you have a claim they go take that claim and monetize it again you could it's not hard to prove this by the way so i just wanted to bring these things up but the money issue okay so back to taxes what taxes are is the franchise board collects the the fees the irs collects the fees the state franchise tax collects the fees for the trustees who are running the trust that your name is in and your property's name is in that's all it is it's if you are a trustee you have a right to charge for your services there are professional trustee services they're usually accountants and they start at 250 an hour good ones are 700 an hour okay right so that's why you you are doing you're using that name that all caps name and the irs withholding which is voluntary is the truck is the fee you're met the irs is managing the trust and no who works for free right very good right no one so they have a scale of what their fees are just like when you go rent the tool they have a chart you know whatever income bracket whatever and you have to do reporting that's all trust stuff i've been saying this for a long time and jonah bay recently said it's all trust stuff that's like the hundredth monkey thing right yeah so the taxes are actually fees for the trustees to operate the trust when you do the 12 usc 411 demand for lawful money what you're doing is say i can handle my own affairs i'm not looking to get trust funds right okay so leave me alone now the thing with for example property tax every every every property tax jurisdiction says that if you are a non-profit you're not subject to property property tax and some people bring this up if you do a proper statement they'll say well where's your 501c3 or 508 blah blah blah like where does it say in the law i have to have an irs certificate nowhere and just think about it when people hear non-profit say oh 501c3 blah blah blah right yes 505 whatever right no no no non-profit so let me ask you where you eat sleep shit fuck uh whatever else you do are you doing any of that for profit no and the answer is no so why are you paying property tax if you have a house right make a statement take them to court you know it's funny when you go to the county see where do you get the authority to tax the property they say from the state you go to the state and you ask them where do you get the authority to tax it to the county says no we don't the county does it because there's no it's all bullshit it's all if you cannot remember i read a thing you will be treated as a minor even though you're of legal age can you be does that mean if i'm 65 can i be treated as a minor that's according to that statement that's what it says yeah yeah it didn't give conditions up until you're 25 and then you're not no no no so yeah that's why early on on the sonics what i say people start developing 9 or 12 years old you might see your grandpa your uncle your mom and your dad 60 70 50 i'm telling you that's a nine-year-old in there they've never grown up right you've heard me say this early on the sonics yes you know yeah they're minors so this is not a matter of learning what to do from guru it's a matter of growing up look i don't still don't know what i'm going to do when i grow up right so i don't even know what that means you actually grow down by the way you don't grow up when your body grows yeah eventually right your arms your arms no no no as your arms get longer and you get taller let's say you're really small four years old and by the time you're eight nine ten but from let's say an infant to adult your arms are getting longer and your legs are getting longer that's not growing up that's growing down your legs are growing down towards the ground and your arms are growing like out from the body right your legs grow down and your arms grow down a human the the legs and the arms project downwards not upwards right remember we're upside down plants plants grow up we grow down so got into a conversation today what fruit really is that would be an interesting one for another time what else you got on this uh hope i hope this has been helpful i've been pouring this out this is what the financial seminar was like what i would get into the and this is not philosophy if you're i'm always good i'm not mark pastor oops did i say that i'm gonna if i'm gonna speak for five minutes uh i hope four minutes of it is exactly what to do and how to do it your choice sometimes i wouldn't do what i would do right you know what i mean do you remember evil knievel back in the day and a lot of people try to imitate his stuff and really got screwed up remember the evil knievel oh that's a real flashback for people yeah i remember you never heard of him yeah i remember how many how many people were trying to do what he's you're a broken neck but even himself he broke his back like three times right broke every bone in his body right yeah broke many bones all the time yeah when you watch just because you watch and listen to evil cameo doesn't mean you should do what he does i i think it was
