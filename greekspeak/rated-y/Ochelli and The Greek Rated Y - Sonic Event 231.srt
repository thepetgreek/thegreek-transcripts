1
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:14,580
So, Sonic Event 231, here we go, Greek,

2
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,560
I got a lot, a lot of questions

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,980
and comments for you, but first, how are

4
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:19,100
you?

5
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,280
I'm good, man.

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,360
You're right, man, that did come in pretty

7
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,440
loud on my side, maybe you need a

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,920
new mixing board or Jitsi or something, but

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,100
as long as people can make out what

10
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,960
we're saying, that's what counts, it's the message,

11
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:32,260
right?

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,680
Yeah, true, I may have an irregular kind

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,400
of like short in my stuff, which means

14
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,340
go back and replace the wires and, you

15
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,340
know, sometimes they start to get hot and

16
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,620
cold right before they die, wires, you know,

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,000
I don't know.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,940
Well, get new stuff, all new stuff, you

19
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,380
know, get balanced cables or whatever, get a

20
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:54,020
board with balanced inputs, I don't like the

21
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,500
way it sounds for hi-fi, but it

22
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,300
sounds good for what we're doing, so.

23
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,120
Well, anyway, we'll get the message out regardless

24
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,120
of the sound, right?

25
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,100
All right, so first thing is knowing how

26
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,340
corrupt this world is and also knowing a

27
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,640
cleanup crew is what's being cleaned up, is

28
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,100
the question, the space heaters or the corrupt

29
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,440
ones or an even level of the hierarchy.

30
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,480
That's an easy one, I've answered that before.

31
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,700
Yeah, the world is not salvageable, is the

32
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,460
last comment there.

33
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,480
No, it's not, okay, allegiance, allegiance is the

34
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,780
most important thing, when you go to the

35
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,760
military, they make sure you have allegiance and

36
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,160
once you pledge allegiance or swear allegiance, if

37
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,140
you do something that's contrary to the command,

38
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,180
you can be executed on the spot.

39
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,700
Same thing works, these are all cosmic rules,

40
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,840
so let's say you're a dumbass, which is

41
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,260
a typical human and you believe, let's say,

42
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,560
this country is bad because they launched a

43
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,980
terror attack on your country, which your own

44
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,100
government really did or people within your government

45
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,660
did and you believe what they're telling you,

46
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,780
you're going to suffer the consequences as if

47
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,680
the story is true.

48
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:08,800
All right, that might be a little bit

49
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,320
of a twisted way to answer it, but

50
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,440
let's say you have allegiance to a corrupt

51
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,840
religion, institution, group, and you don't know anything,

52
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,360
you think you're doing the right thing, you're

53
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,580
still going to suffer the consequences, yes, be

54
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,300
mindful.

55
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,100
In other words, ignorance of the law is

56
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,760
no excuse, so you're going to have to

57
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,940
dig down and find out fundamental stuff.

58
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,380
Like, you know, for example, this is very

59
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:37,180
easily researched and known, no matter how it's

60
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,840
been marketed, but Catholicism, the Vatican is one

61
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,580
of the most evil institutions the world has

62
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,160
ever seen.

63
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,400
You can't show me another institution that has

64
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:46,840
lasted.

65
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,960
Formally, 1000 AD is when they built the

66
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,420
Vatican, started, right?

67
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,280
And they were around for about several, about

68
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,780
400 years, 500 years before that.

69
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,180
So you're looking at institutions about 1700, 1800

70
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,530
years old, and it's by hands down the

71
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,740
most corrupt and evil institution ever on this

72
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,080
planet.

73
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,220
Warning to you, billion Catholics or three quarter,

74
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,960
you think you're doing the right thing, you're

75
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,840
going down, bitch.

76
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,300
That's the, that's the cosmic way to say

77
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:20,460
it.

78
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,660
I would leave that place.

79
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,060
I mean, that's, that's not an opinion, by

80
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,680
the way, and I don't know if I

81
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,620
could speak for the cosmic forces, but what

82
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,460
I'm saying can be objectified, right?

83
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,060
So, yeah, so right away, most of the

84
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,200
people are going to go down just from

85
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,840
that one group, and then you got all

86
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,420
the other groups.

87
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,360
Believe it or not, the Satanists are probably

88
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,240
going to be, get it the easiest.

89
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:43,660
Why?

90
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:48,520
Because they're anti what the, they're, by the

91
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,320
way, Satanism is secular, by the way.

92
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:50,920
Yeah.

93
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,100
Right?

94
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,980
It's a secular religion.

95
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,620
It's not, it's, you know, they might throw

96
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,080
smittens, smittings of philosophy in there, but it's

97
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,440
secular.

98
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:03,000
But what they're doing is essentially anti-Christian,

99
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,960
anti-Catholic, anti-secular.

100
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,440
They're secular, that's anti-secular.

101
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,140
So, in a way, it's like the enemy

102
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,480
of my enemy is my friend.

103
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,560
So, they're going to have a much better,

104
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:19,320
easier time because they're more anti, but they're

105
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,720
also going to have a really hard time

106
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,860
because they bought into the secularness of it.

107
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,200
Like, I used to give an example.

108
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,020
You'll have, let's say, you're, you pass through

109
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,400
the pearly gates, no such thing.

110
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,100
Metaphorically, you go to heaven and you see

111
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,540
a little pastor that was handing out cans

112
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,340
to all the hungry people, but, you know,

113
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:45,360
pushed you into whatever religion they do in

114
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:45,800
the Midwest.

115
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,700
You'll see Hitler, and Hitler will be, oh,

116
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,020
I'm glad I wasn't one of them.

117
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:50,620
Right?

118
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,060
He's going to get it a lot worse

119
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,240
because Hitler wasn't promoting any kind of a

120
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,000
cosmic deity of any sort, was he?

121
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,880
Not at all.

122
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,940
Well, now- It was true, you're right.

123
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,140
Here's the thing about him directly, maybe not,

124
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,860
but some of his guys had these different

125
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,180
- Oh, they were super occult, yeah.

126
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,020
Super occult stuff going on.

127
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,500
So, and there's even like a Catholic breakaway

128
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,020
sect that was like really supportive and inspirational,

129
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,560
apparently.

130
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,540
So, I don't know.

131
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,120
It's hard to sort that out, to be

132
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,660
honest with you, to me.

133
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,800
Maybe I'm wrong.

134
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,200
It just seems like it's hard to separate

135
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,600
things.

136
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,860
So, that means eventually it's like, yeah, burn

137
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,640
it all, but we don't have to focus

138
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,720
as Yeah, there's going to be a selection.

139
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,020
If you go to, if you harken to

140
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,280
what Jason Brashear says, the phoenix is selective.

141
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,880
People that are afraid of it and are

142
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,500
misinformed are going to get it.

143
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,480
Those that know what it is and not

144
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,760
afraid of it are going to be just

145
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,060
fine.

146
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,640
I've talked about this all the time through

147
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,100
the years.

148
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,440
It's very selective, that type of destruction.

149
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,540
You hear about this often where plane crash,

150
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,060
200 people on board, 193 die, and seven

151
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,820
just walk away with not a scratch.

152
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:01,500
Right?

153
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,660
You've heard this before, right?

154
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,100
Oh, yeah.

155
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:08,320
So, yeah, and it's a bad metaphor.

156
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,000
It's actually, you'll see that kind of proportion

157
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,400
out there, but with, it's really hard.

158
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,800
All you could do is explain it in

159
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,160
metaphors, because we cannot objectify that outcome, right?

160
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,600
Because the knowledge of such an outcome is

161
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,940
given to us in allegory anyway.

162
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,640
Well, and I'll put it to you this

163
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:26,860
way.

164
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,320
There's also the selection that goes on, because

165
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,800
like you remember the Hindenburg.

166
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,780
We all know what that is, right?

167
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,500
The big airship that went down.

168
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,280
The perception is everybody died.

169
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,860
That is way far from the truth.

170
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,300
If you read the accounts, usually the people

171
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,640
that, the accounts that people wrote, they said

172
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,220
that the captain said stay inside, and everyone

173
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,800
who followed the captain's order survived.

174
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,900
Stay inside the cabin, because it was, come

175
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,940
on, man, it's German engineering.

176
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,780
They had taken that into account.

177
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,320
The cabin was designed to protect you from

178
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,900
flare up, shall we say?

179
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:00,340
Right.

180
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,060
And everyone who followed the captain's order survived

181
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,080
unscathed.

182
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,520
Whoever decided to take the matters in their

183
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,080
own hands, well, you know, those are the

184
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,800
ones you hear about.

185
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,560
You never hear about the ones that, the

186
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,320
good boys and girls.

187
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,780
You always hear about the bad boys and

188
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,300
girls, so.

189
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,180
That's true.

190
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,380
Hey, you know what, you know, a comment

191
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,240
connects to this.

192
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,100
I knew it.

193
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,680
The Greek has been quoting Snatch as long

194
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,060
as I've been listening to him.

195
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,980
Taking a windy walk through a Canaanite village,

196
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,780
how ze Germans are coming.

197
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,960
There have been a few more that I

198
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,740
can't recall now.

199
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,160
Glad to finally hear it from him.

200
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,340
Save your breath, save your breath to cool

201
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:38,880
your porridge.

202
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,540
See, I don't know this movie, but I'm

203
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:43,800
guessing.

204
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:44,600
That's the Jippo.

205
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,220
That's what, that's Brad Pitt's one of the

206
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,780
best lines when they meet him out in

207
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:53,080
the field to do another fight for a

208
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,880
caravan.

209
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,560
Pederinko Blue.

210
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,420
The size of our covers.

211
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,680
And he says, I'm not going to buy

212
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,860
a tarts mobile home.

213
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,800
What'd you say?

214
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,520
Save your breath to cool your porridge.

215
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:04,360
Yeah.

216
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,460
So anyway, I really liked that film because

217
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,660
of the metaphor.

218
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,800
Again, it's a metaphor.

219
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,900
The whole movie is a metaphor.

220
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,180
And it's interesting, too, because I'm just glad

221
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,220
to hear that you appreciate some films outside

222
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,060
of just, you know, your YouTube videos for

223
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:18,440
background.

224
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,520
Because I feel stupid sometimes making film references.

225
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,500
I'm glad you do it.

226
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:24,820
Also, Guy Ritchie.

227
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,520
This is another comment, by the way.

228
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,660
Also, Guy Ritchie films are well done.

229
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,320
Also recommended Revolver.

230
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:31,700
Sherlock Holmes.

231
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,480
King Arthur.

232
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,860
That being said, I feel like those.

233
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,100
That's the Hollywood influence.

234
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,240
The Sherlock Holmes one.

235
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,420
Another one is Lawrence of Arabia.

236
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,500
The classic one.

237
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,620
Good scene is when they take Aqaba.

238
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,600
And he took it on his own.

239
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,120
Because he was high ranking, he could make

240
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,160
a military decision.

241
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,520
And he has one of his boys.

242
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,620
And I think it was Pederasty.

243
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,600
I doubt it, though.

244
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,300
It didn't hint enough of that.

245
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,580
But there's a young man that he took

246
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,300
a liking to.

247
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,600
I think it was Pederasty, but they didn't

248
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,140
show it in the film.

249
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,320
And he brought him into an officer's club.

250
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,020
British officer's club in Arabia.

251
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,660
And you're not supposed to bring any denizens

252
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,000
in.

253
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,620
And he brought him in anyway.

254
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,200
And they refused to serve him, refused to

255
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:15,720
let him in.

256
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,680
And he says, you're going to give him

257
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,160
a lemonade.

258
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,600
And you're going to give it with ice.

259
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,660
And he's ordering.

260
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,600
It's kind of like the thing.

261
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,620
What's the lady who did not go to

262
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,300
the back of the bus kind of thing?

263
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,020
Rosa Parks?

264
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:29,720
What was her name?

265
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,380
It was Jonah Park.

266
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,940
It's a Rosa Parks thing.

267
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,640
And this is before Rosa Parks.

268
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:34,780
But that was being done.

269
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,180
The Rosa Parks thing's been going on since

270
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,120
the 30s, by the way.

271
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,140
I don't know why they just made her

272
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:38,640
popular.

273
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,960
If you tell anyone who's lived in the

274
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,920
South and was cosmopolitan about Rosa Parks, they're

275
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,480
going to laugh at you.

276
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,800
It was like 1,000 Rosa Parks.

277
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,360
God damn it.

278
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,900
Why'd they bring that bitch up again?

279
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,920
So she was the only one that made

280
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,500
it to the media, right, that took it

281
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,240
all the way, right?

282
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:51,840
Yeah, right.

283
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,900
Tons of musicians fighting with places.

284
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,180
Why can't I eat in a place that

285
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,820
I'm going to perform in, you know, for

286
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,620
decades?

287
00:09:59,100 --> 00:09:59,560
Oh, yeah.

288
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,000
Yeah.

289
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,280
And they took it just as far, but

290
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,760
it just was not, yeah, it's not talked

291
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,100
about.

292
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:05,540
Right.

293
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,180
Exactly.

294
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:06,640
All right.

295
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,100
Guy Ritchie, hats off to him.

296
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,500
I feel he's definitely, this guy continues, though,

297
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,060
I feel he's definitely in the club, low

298
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,000
level, of course.

299
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,480
I don't know about that judgment, but, you

300
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,040
know, what do you think?

301
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,340
Well, he married Madonna, didn't he?

302
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,800
Or was her, whatever, whatever.

303
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,460
Madonna's as bad as you can get.

304
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,660
She's been, you know, I think it was

305
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,040
without her own volition.

306
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,380
She got led into it.

307
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,360
Like she's full on the host now.

308
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,340
She's not even Madonna.

309
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,060
She's a host.

310
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,600
Anyway, that's another, that's for the Donald Marshall

311
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,940
people, to know what I'm talking about.

312
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,180
You know, the covering the eye.

313
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,760
Yeah, well, she went full Kabbalah.

314
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,360
She went full Kabbalah, too.

315
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,180
That's the other, that was step, what, two?

316
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,500
No, I'm talking more, what I'm saying is

317
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,020
maybe really off on the fringe.

318
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,800
Like, she's a host.

319
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,760
In other words, the Madonna is dead.

320
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,520
The spirit that's in her is something else.

321
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,540
True enough.

322
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:54,940
Yeah.

323
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,540
That's what the left, you know, covering the

324
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,140
eye, the dark eye, the black and blue

325
00:10:59,140 --> 00:10:59,520
eye.

326
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:00,800
You see that?

327
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:01,580
The, you know.

328
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,020
Okay.

329
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,580
So that's another, that's another, we should do,

330
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,360
we should do, we'd have to have Donald

331
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,960
Marshall on for that one, but there's plenty

332
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,840
of stuff about Donald Marshall.

333
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,280
You could talk about it, but right.

334
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:11,620
What else?

335
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,520
That would be interesting.

336
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:13,660
Yeah.

337
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,460
I'd love to do a guest.

338
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,960
Greek is right about the immune system.

339
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,720
If you had one, then you'd be free

340
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,960
of taxes and not bound to civic duties.

341
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,580
So if you know law and use it

342
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,640
to avoid taxes, then by definition in parentheses,

343
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,180
you have created an immune system.

344
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,620
In conclusion, all humans in the so-called

345
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,760
modern world with birth certificates are effectively born

346
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,500
with AIDS.

347
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,540
You could say that metaphorically, but you can't

348
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:43,040
pay taxes because like I said, FDR did

349
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,860
what no dictator parliamentarian or monarchy ever did

350
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,380
in history, which is tell people to surrender

351
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,060
their precious metals.

352
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,780
No one, the worst dictator ever in history

353
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,920
never even did anything near that.

354
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,620
And they pulled it off here.

355
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,620
So everything now is bills and bills of,

356
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,100
if you look up the definition of a

357
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,540
bill, a bill is a bill of exchange.

358
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,500
And if you want to know how to

359
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,840
handle bill of exchange, you read the bill

360
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,700
of exchange act.

361
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,960
So there's no such thing as paying a

362
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,300
tax.

363
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,700
That's they simplify it because you ever watch

364
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,140
like a regular TV show and then go

365
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,760
to watch like the ones made for young

366
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,920
children, like pre-nursery school, like just like

367
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,300
between Teletubbies between Teletubbies and Sesame street, something

368
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,120
between there.

369
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,120
Right.

370
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,180
That's the language that they use to the

371
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,300
public about taxes.

372
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,980
There's no such thing about taxes.

373
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:30,700
Forget it.

374
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,260
What happens is a tax liability arises and

375
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,500
they demand a payment from you, which is

376
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,180
nothing more than a promise to pay.

377
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,540
But because you don't know any better, you

378
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,860
think you have to go out there and

379
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,540
earn by working or investing somehow to give

380
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,200
it to them.

381
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,980
It's on your own fault on your own

382
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,340
head.

383
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,080
If you're going to do that, you can

384
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,120
ask the IRS is very good about receiving

385
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,920
bills of exchange.

386
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,960
If you follow the instructions that they give

387
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,780
you and I've memorized them and I've got

388
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,300
so much on my mind, I have a

389
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,580
notebook here where whenever I'm on a financial

390
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:08,740
conversation, I spew out what they should do.

391
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,320
And I could hear the pages flipping, but

392
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,760
I could give you, if you go to

393
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:18,260
the IRM I used to know it's 10

394
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:22,620
.48, but they go to the IRM manual.

395
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,560
That's their manual.

396
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,400
And it wasn't supposed to be made public,

397
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,340
but when it went public, it went public

398
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,180
so big now they can't retract it and

399
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,920
they don't want to redo it because you

400
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,680
can't redo it.

401
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,000
It's their manual.

402
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,420
If you redo it, you just what you've

403
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,560
gutted their operations, right?

404
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,540
So it's the IRM, which is the IRS

405
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:46,520
manual 3.8.45.5.10.1 remittance

406
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,020
instructions for the taxpayer wants to pay an

407
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:53,640
outstanding, whatever, with a bill of exchange or

408
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,360
registered bill of exchange, they can do so.

409
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,040
They have to order it or give you

410
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,840
permission to the campus to do so.

411
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,160
And when they send it with the instructions

412
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,580
to do so, whoever receives it in the

413
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,080
campus has to send it to the treasury

414
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,100
via air mail or the next day air,

415
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:10,860
very important.

416
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,860
And they give you the office in the

417
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,180
treasury.

418
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,000
So in the instructions, you tell them and

419
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,580
actually the office it's, it's in the IRM

420
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,440
manual there.

421
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,180
And when you look up that office to

422
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,120
make it even stick, even better.

423
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,320
Once you put in all the information of

424
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,960
the treasury office gives you the address and

425
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,000
the, and the suite number, put it in

426
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,560
the internet and you'll see the current director

427
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,180
of that office.

428
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,880
So don't only give the, in the instructions,

429
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,100
the office also find it.

430
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,680
His name is Steve, something slots, nickel, whatever,

431
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,700
or Schwarzenegger, wherever you find the name and

432
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,940
put the name on there to the director

433
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:41,440
of the office.

434
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,980
And they just, it just goes away.

435
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,320
It doesn't matter how much it is.

436
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,780
It could be a billion dollars, a million

437
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,280
dollars, a hundred thousand 90.

438
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:50,060
I saw one recently for 98,600, something

439
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,500
just goes away.

440
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,380
300,000.

441
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,460
I've seen goes away, you know?

442
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,680
So yeah, there's no, it's all promises to

443
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,440
me, but if you believe you have to

444
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,340
go work to pay a bill, that's on

445
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,820
your own, dude, that's your own head.

446
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,420
No, one's making you do that, but what's

447
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:06,940
happening.

448
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,320
Let me give a quick explanation on the

449
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:09,980
money system.

450
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,680
Someone put up a Twitter video, but blue

451
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,760
aliens laughing on how everything here is given

452
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,680
for us to use, but we create money

453
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,820
that devalues itself and they're laughing, right?

454
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,860
Like humans are rug.

455
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,320
That's fine.

456
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,820
That's true though.

457
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,800
We are on a planet that's self-sustaining,

458
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,460
right?

459
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,380
And someone had the idea while we were

460
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,580
extracting whatever we needed from the earth to

461
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:29,920
use.

462
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:30,460
Right?

463
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,840
But then the idea came up via authority.

464
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,300
It started with spiritual authority and people that

465
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,760
impressed other people with magic tricks or whatever,

466
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,440
or just bigger than others and compound you

467
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:40,920
to the ground.

468
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,040
If you didn't do what they said, they

469
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,620
came up with the idea of starting to

470
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,060
claim all these resources, whether it was agriculture,

471
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,080
mineral water, they started claiming it and forcing

472
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,440
others to do an exchange.

473
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,280
Like when, when the petroleum companies pull the

474
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,720
oil out of the ground, the earth doesn't

475
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,380
send them a bill.

476
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,000
When the farmer harvests is all the, the

477
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,880
crops, the earth doesn't send them a bill.

478
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,640
You know, there's a sky, right?

479
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,380
The fishermen doesn't get a bill from the

480
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,780
ocean, but these people came up with the

481
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,900
idea that if we can get the population

482
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,960
to accept our authority and they have to

483
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,900
give us more in exchange for what we

484
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,760
got for free, right?

485
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,400
Now, remember the labor that was used to

486
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,660
extract those things is already taken care of

487
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,720
by the way, right?

488
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,760
And that's another discussion.

489
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,740
So what happened was this carries on with

490
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,660
exchange of money.

491
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,520
Money is nothing but portable land.

492
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,940
Cause you're supposed to live off the land

493
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,500
with everything.

494
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,820
You know, everyone's supposed to share, right?

495
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,220
Not run with the scissors, whatever.

496
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,800
But when you travel from the land that

497
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,720
you're doing that, you need to bring portable

498
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,440
land with you, which would be the most

499
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,220
precious thing your land has to offer, which

500
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:43,940
is precious metals.

501
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,240
That's where we use precious metals.

502
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,560
So to make a long story short here,

503
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,820
all that has gone away.

504
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,360
And it's just a matter about, about, uh,

505
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,000
everything's paid for.

506
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,940
All you could do is order pay to

507
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,720
the order of, or promise to pay.

508
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:01,600
Right?

509
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,980
So you take the fishermen, takes the fish

510
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,660
out of the water and he promises to

511
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,500
give the water something back for it.

512
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:08,780
Right?

513
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:13,560
So everything is based on cooperation and demands

514
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,020
and acceptances.

515
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,859
Oh, I just mentioned the whole financial system,

516
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,359
but what's been going on is it's been

517
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,920
turned into a form of slavery.

518
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,400
Tech through technology, through, uh, the way cities

519
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,800
are formed through culture, that those that know

520
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,700
how this works do not share it with

521
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,380
those that they want to take advantage of.

522
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:35,200
Right?

523
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,580
so they use ledger domain and Presto digitization.

524
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:42,460
In other words, when a magician comes to

525
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,720
town, a real good one, and he's going

526
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,300
to saw a woman in half and they

527
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,780
advertise that 500 people come and buy tickets

528
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,520
to watch that.

529
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,820
Everybody knows that he's not going to saw

530
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,980
a woman in half and put her back

531
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,280
together, but they all go to see it

532
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,980
and they don't, and they don't really inquire

533
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,740
enough about how they could, no matter how

534
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,000
much it's a secret, right?

535
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,880
That's exactly how the money system works.

536
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,860
Oh, you know, like if you go to

537
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,100
court over the, let's say, you know, you

538
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,940
sign a bunch of notes, pay for the

539
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,320
car three times with your signature.

540
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,140
You go to court over and just, if

541
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,520
you want a free car, what was paid

542
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,220
for from where, where did the funds come

543
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:16,440
from?

544
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,660
So they kind of try to play with

545
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,140
this infantile logic on a system that no

546
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,220
longer exists.

547
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,300
Like what, what's done with the application and

548
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:25,500
stuff.

549
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,600
If you say you want to use the

550
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,320
application as collateral or go apply for something,

551
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,800
they say, do you have proof of funds?

552
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,120
Yeah.

553
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,080
Proof of funds, the full faith and credit

554
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,620
of the U S government asking me for

555
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,460
proof of funds is saying, first of all,

556
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,540
that I have nothing to do with the

557
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,160
U S government.

558
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,820
I have paperwork to show that I do.

559
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,460
Number one, number two, you're trying to say

560
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,180
the, the full faith and credit of the

561
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,560
U S government's not good, right?

562
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,460
The U S government is 31 trillion in

563
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,100
debt and that you're sending everybody checks for

564
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,040
a thousand dollars and cashing them just fine.

565
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:55,920
Yeah.

566
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,040
Where you want to see proof of funds

567
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,560
in the U S treasury.

568
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,980
I'll show you proof of funds in the

569
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,800
U S treasury, 31 trillion in debt.

570
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,300
I'm only a hundred thousand in debt, bitch,

571
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,340
right?

572
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,840
How come no one's using the most basic

573
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,780
what's going on?

574
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,260
I mean, because they've got everyone mind controlled

575
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,620
and every, no one knows what they're saying.

576
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,180
I've seen people that are close to me.

577
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,180
People are not close to me.

578
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,840
I listened to what they're saying and pretty

579
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,440
much 90%, if not a hundred percent with

580
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,460
some people is what comes out of their

581
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,040
mouths is oxymoronic.

582
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,520
They're actually contradicting like the last part of

583
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,400
their sentence contradicted the first part of their

584
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,020
sentence, you know?

585
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,960
So it's like plus one and minus one.

586
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,180
What happens when you put plus one and

587
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:37,920
minus one together?

588
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,360
And that's what you're getting out of everything.

589
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,780
But anyway, all right.

590
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,560
We did a lot on this last time

591
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,440
I got some comments.

592
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,420
I was a very good Sonic.

593
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:46,820
Okay.

594
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:47,860
That's fine.

595
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,220
I'm glad you enjoyed it, but it's very

596
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:54,020
frustrating to mull these things over, over and

597
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:57,060
over and see that, like how, how just

598
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,500
piss poor we are in our minds.

599
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,500
This is all psychoenergetic problem.

600
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,080
It's going to get worse, by the way,

601
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:05,940
it's going to get worse.

602
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,400
It's going to be okay.

603
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,480
This is what I would expect to people

604
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,100
to expect.

605
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,440
Do you remember right after nine 11 for

606
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,880
about a year, there was like this Muslim

607
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,460
phobia.

608
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,380
Anybody with a turban, even if they were

609
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,800
Sikhs, suddenly we're terrorists, right?

610
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,240
Yes.

611
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:20,980
Right.

612
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,320
People in gas stations getting beat up.

613
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,120
They're Sikh, right?

614
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,880
I was working in those gas stations.

615
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:26,800
I know full well.

616
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:27,660
Yes.

617
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:28,760
Yeah.

618
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,460
There's slots.

619
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,660
We have a lot of Sikhs here and

620
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,620
people think they're must use dumb fuck.

621
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,880
They're not, but you know, but anyway, they

622
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,220
do have certain rights and rituals.

623
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,540
They follow, you know, like cutting hairs, mutilation

624
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,320
and this and that.

625
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,200
They have certain things.

626
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,480
Their, their, their, their culture is based on

627
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,380
being very advanced.

628
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,160
Warrior ship.

629
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,520
They're very, very, very, very, you would never

630
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,160
want to go into battle with them if

631
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:48,840
they were prepared.

632
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:49,200
Right?

633
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:49,720
No.

634
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,240
So they're fierce warriors.

635
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,700
Anyway, all this stuff.

636
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,160
So you're going to have that nine 11

637
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,280
kind of fear, whatever coming up around finances

638
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,280
and international affairs that are going to affect

639
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:03,840
finances.

640
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,180
Yeah.

641
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,900
It's going to be interesting to watch.

642
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,100
So, okay.

643
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,600
What else you got?

644
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,600
So here's one of those weird questions.

645
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,680
If the Greek was stuck on a desert

646
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,400
Island and could only bring three food items,

647
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:21,200
what would he bring deserted Island?

648
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,960
Cause desert Island is just sand and rocks

649
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,280
and cactus deserted Island.

650
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,220
I mean, isolated depends on the latitude, right?

651
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,100
So let's say usually that, that terminology, there's

652
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,080
islands off of Greenland and Iceland, and then

653
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,140
there's islands off of the warm, warm.

654
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,860
So if it's a cold place, you would

655
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:46,120
definitely want to bring, uh, things that you

656
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:51,480
could harvest animal products with weapons, uh, ability

657
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,200
to keep warm food items would be, um,

658
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,280
root root vegetables that you can grow in

659
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,740
the snow, meaning you, you, you dig down,

660
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,200
right?

661
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,980
And the frost, uh, hot climate would be

662
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,500
salt, which would be easy to do anyway.

663
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:13,160
If you're near the water, um, no, I

664
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,980
wouldn't be concerned because food, here's the problem.

665
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,400
Uh, food items that are perishable are perishable.

666
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,860
So it wouldn't matter.

667
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:22,920
They wouldn't last very long.

668
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,560
And food items that are not perishable are

669
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,800
usually bulk items.

670
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,980
So what am I going to do?

671
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,100
Put like a cup full of Brown rice

672
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,020
in a pouch.

673
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,260
How long is that going to be good

674
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:34,480
for?

675
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,640
Actually, you can live off of it for

676
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,020
a month.

677
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,240
If you know, that's all you have.

678
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:37,520
Right.

679
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,500
I don't know.

680
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,440
If you got more specific and you said

681
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,840
like a hundred pounds of said food items

682
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,900
or something, you know, I guess they're looking

683
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,640
to see if you'd bring rice or whatever,

684
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,080
you know?

685
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,900
Yeah, probably a whole grain.

686
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,740
Millet would probably be better than rice.

687
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,360
Millet.

688
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,460
It's much smaller.

689
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,200
And, you know, it's, it's more packed.

690
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,000
yeah, millet.

691
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:58,820
I would do millet.

692
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,660
Oh, before I did Brown rice for sure.

693
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:01,700
Yeah.

694
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,420
But very, very consistent.

695
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:06,100
By the way, millet and barley was the

696
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:06,360
main.

697
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,500
Millet and barley was the main grain for

698
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,660
Asia before Westerners went there and convinced them.

699
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,180
Rice was a luxury item.

700
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,060
Always.

701
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,300
As a matter of fact, if you watch

702
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,160
some of the old Kurosawa films that are

703
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,500
not that, you know, that much back historically

704
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,440
with the samurai, the samurai were like, Oh,

705
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,180
you have white rice.

706
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,200
They offered like this one samurai payment by

707
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,020
a meal of white rice.

708
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:29,600
He's like, Oh wow.

709
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,320
You got white rice.

710
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:30,780
Wow.

711
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,880
You know, it's like, yeah.

712
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,800
Cause they eat millet and barley Asia.

713
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:39,720
It's like the 1960s, the Kurosawa films, right?

714
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:41,460
Yeah.

715
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,500
And it was right.

716
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,000
So Asia was based on millet and barley

717
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,900
oats, mostly barley and millet.

718
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,460
Did I say barley and millet or millet

719
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:48,800
and barley?

720
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,780
Yeah, you did.

721
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,320
Not rice.

722
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:50,900
Yeah.

723
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:51,620
Yeah.

724
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,280
Anyway, there was a continuation on the German

725
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,040
medicine thing.

726
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,600
Cause remember you said, you know, pay attention.

727
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,000
I think they did and continued to pay

728
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,340
attention.

729
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,920
From a, from a German new medicine article.

730
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,640
It is similar to what Greek says about

731
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,340
cancer.

732
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:09,300
Dr. Hammer's discoveries turned this paradigm completely on

733
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,940
its head by demonstrating that quote diseases such

734
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,460
as cancer are not as assumed malfunctions of

735
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,420
an organism, right?

736
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:22,360
Instead, significant biological special programs of nature designed

737
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,240
to support an individual during unexpected distress.

738
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,540
So they're linking you together with this, with

739
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,340
this concept.

740
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,000
So I don't know.

741
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:30,680
Good.

742
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:31,740
Yeah.

743
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,020
Let's, let's work that.

744
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,720
It's an, it's not a malfunction.

745
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,160
It's an overall function.

746
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,860
So there's a, a bad through way on

747
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,960
a road accidents happen or accidents do happen

748
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,980
and have happened.

749
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:47,840
So you have this overreactive force of vehicles

750
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,120
come by and they got sirens and lights

751
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:50,520
on that.

752
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,040
Other vehicles normally don't.

753
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:52,320
Right.

754
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,180
And the people look different and they're usually

755
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:55,920
more brutal.

756
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,500
They get out and they set up barricades

757
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,800
to redirect the traffic.

758
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,740
And you, you know, even approaching an area

759
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,280
like that, you're like, what's all this traffic.

760
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,280
There must've been what, Oh, it must've been

761
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,220
an accident up there.

762
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,060
I see the lights, right?

763
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,520
You can notice it from a distance.

764
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,380
So it's an over function.

765
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,220
It's an over function.

766
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,920
It's an emergency.

767
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,180
The, the, the, okay, let me just start

768
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,660
it from what I've been saying for 20

769
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,900
plus or 30 or 40 plus years is

770
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,640
cancer is what happens is you have energy.

771
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:25,880
Okay.

772
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,920
Look, you have energy moving through the body

773
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,000
up on one side, down on the other.

774
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:30,440
Right.

775
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,340
And then whatever.

776
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:32,660
Right.

777
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,820
So when you start sending too much, that

778
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,260
goes to one part of the body, the

779
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,000
body's like, listen, you're sending too much to

780
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,160
this side and it's, it's, I can't function.

781
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,900
And you, and it communicates that by like

782
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,800
various ways of not feeling well, it depends

783
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,480
on the individual.

784
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,300
So going back to the accident that you

785
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,260
talked about, here's what would happen with an

786
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:51,820
accident, right?

787
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,240
The first thing is they would block off

788
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,040
the area so that you wouldn't continuously have

789
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:56,520
traffic.

790
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,980
So, so stop.

791
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,620
This is important.

792
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,880
So first you start getting signals of cramps,

793
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,460
not feeling well, headaches, mucus on one side.

794
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,960
You ever hear people getting a mucus in

795
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,140
one side of the year or ringing on

796
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,260
one side of the air, but not the

797
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:09,720
other ear.

798
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,160
Yes.

799
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:10,580
Right.

800
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,900
On one side, you'll have pain one nostril.

801
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,120
Yeah.

802
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:14,960
You'll have cramps.

803
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,960
You might be accidental on one side.

804
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,840
You might always be bumping or cutting or

805
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,940
hurting on that one side.

806
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,280
And this happens for years and years.

807
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,560
And then finally a tumor or a very

808
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,580
bad skin manifestation or a very dark spot

809
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:27,960
forms.

810
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,680
That's the end.

811
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,140
That means like you were ignoring all the

812
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:31,740
other stuff.

813
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,700
It was very subtle.

814
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,120
Now we have to send, go ahead, Chuck,

815
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,300
you're saying with an accident, you show up,

816
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:38,620
go ahead.

817
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,580
Now you send all the, you know, the,

818
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,040
the people to block things off, to isolate

819
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,080
it, redirect traffic, et cetera.

820
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,780
And you isolate that area so that it's

821
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,080
now controlled momentarily.

822
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:50,420
Yeah.

823
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,280
I don't have the traffic.

824
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:51,680
Go ahead.

825
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:51,840
Yeah.

826
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,180
All the cops and wherever they show up,

827
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,820
don't they look like a tumor anyway?

828
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:55,660
Right.

829
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,800
I mean, you're right.

830
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,460
They're not there.

831
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,500
Normally, if you look at a helicopter view

832
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,240
of that, instead of seeing a nice linear

833
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,500
formation with movement, you see this big blockage.

834
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:05,360
Yeah.

835
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,560
And they stick out from the sky down,

836
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,180
you know, right.

837
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:08,860
They stick out.

838
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,460
Obviously there's rest different.

839
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,560
They got bright, bright lights spinning all over

840
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:12,900
the place.

841
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,140
Yeah.

842
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,040
It's exactly what the body did for you.

843
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:16,460
Yeah.

844
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,200
If you didn't, okay.

845
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,040
There are people that don't have the ability

846
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:19,920
to form cancer.

847
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,300
They die in their bed overnight.

848
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,200
Personally.

849
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:22,680
No one.

850
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:23,780
Jonathan butts.

851
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,600
You could look them up.

852
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,480
CEO of natural action technologies died in his

853
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:33,000
sleep at 49 of sudden death, not capable

854
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
of forming cancer.

855
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,220
He said he had liver failure to get

856
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,120
into personal stuff.

857
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,240
I'm not under HIPAA laws.

858
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:38,900
Am I anyway?

859
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,320
You know, the personal stuff, but at one

860
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,520
point he said he had a liver.

861
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,580
He had a liver failure when nearly killed

862
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:44,700
him.

863
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,200
And then like a week later, he was

864
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:46,960
totally fine.

865
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,360
It's like, wow.

866
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,900
Total shutdown of the most versatile organ in

867
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,340
the body.

868
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,420
And then he got okay again.

869
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,000
And he didn't look okay for a while,

870
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,580
but, and then he dies in his sleep.

871
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,240
He didn't have the ability to produce tumors.

872
00:27:59,540 --> 00:27:59,940
Hmm.

873
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:01,520
Right.

874
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,480
Obviously, or whatever.

875
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,180
Cause I asked people, did he have cancer?

876
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,620
No, they didn't just sudden death.

877
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,300
And I was like, Oh shit.

878
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,340
And you hear about this often people dying

879
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,100
in their thirties, forties, sudden death.

880
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,100
they usually mark it as heart failure.

881
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,500
Sudden death is a more common one with

882
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,540
the, with the injections, the COVID vaccines have

883
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:20,940
been doing.

884
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:21,660
Oh yeah.

885
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:24,380
And there's actually a bunch of videos that

886
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,960
haven't been taken down about athletes dying on

887
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,420
the field.

888
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,620
Soccer player, boom, falls over, die, you know,

889
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,500
people, even a couple of newscasters fell over

890
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,480
and died while they're delivering the news.

891
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:34,740
Right.

892
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:40,120
So yeah, that's, that's like, uh, it's interesting

893
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,880
if those, uh, if they know something here,

894
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,120
what we already got a few, we've mentioned

895
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,680
on the Sonic, what they're doing in terms

896
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,660
of the injections, what they're injecting into your

897
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:48,940
body.

898
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:49,880
They're not nanobots.

899
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:50,580
We went into that.

900
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,820
It's memory metal that expands at a certain

901
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,340
frequency.

902
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,580
It's a tiny little coil of memory, metal

903
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:59,160
nano size, and it reacts to a certain

904
00:28:59,160 --> 00:28:59,820
frequency.

905
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,900
And when that frequency hits the body, it's

906
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,820
no longer a very tightly wound coil.

907
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,260
It expands into a linear piece.

908
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,420
So it acts as a, as a spear

909
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,600
or a dagger going through the cell, right?

910
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,960
Because the cell can accommodate a very, a

911
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,060
very tightly rolled up ball of metal, but

912
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,260
it cannot accommodate something.

913
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,660
That's a tightly rolled up ball.

914
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,800
And then suddenly expands into a 10 times.

915
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:25,860
It's with like a spear puncturing the cell.

916
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:26,320
Right.

917
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,440
So we know that they have that.

918
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,780
And the other thing would be maybe the

919
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:33,920
MRA is actually a cancer inhibitor because they

920
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,400
are talking about, uh, these things, injections to

921
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,720
prevent cancer and people are welcoming.

922
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,260
They don't know that that kind of thing

923
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,880
will actually let you allow you to die

924
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,780
in your sleep overnight or suddenly anyway, just

925
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,320
entertaining the thought for you guys to think

926
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:49,620
about.

927
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,140
That's how to make sense of one of

928
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,200
the private questions I got, which was, you

929
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,580
know, does the Greek have any views on

930
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:57,760
this weird sort of a two fisted approach

931
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,180
from the Maha movement, which is a RFK

932
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:01,820
juniors thing.

933
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,800
Like he's doing some good things that like

934
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,260
a lot of people wanted to see done.

935
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:08,160
And at the same time, the, uh, the

936
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,540
government itself, literally doing the other stuff like

937
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,240
you just talked about with the MRA thing

938
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,960
is now going to expand and people think,

939
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:16,720
Oh, that's good.

940
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,160
They're going to do research on it, but

941
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,220
no, what that's going to do is stop,

942
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,800
which is a bad idea.

943
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:22,720
I believe.

944
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:23,420
Yeah.

945
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,920
I believe with a straight face, they could

946
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,720
tell you to prevent cancer and people want

947
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,180
to take it.

948
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,900
But preventing cancer is what allows you to

949
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,520
die suddenly.

950
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,220
Right.

951
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,380
I believe that's a very good summation.

952
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,960
It's like super hyper rational what I brought

953
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,280
up and, uh, it's most people have to

954
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,800
hear that phrase several times for it to

955
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,200
sink in because you've been bombarded for decades

956
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,760
about, uh, cancer is something that needs to

957
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,240
be cured.

958
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,760
That's like, we need to cure roadblocks.

959
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,880
You know, when there's an accident, we need

960
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,700
to prevent roadblocks from happening.

961
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:53,740
That's it.

962
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,460
I don't never that'll lead to even worse

963
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,140
situations.

964
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,380
So yeah.

965
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:58,800
Anyway.

966
00:30:59,060 --> 00:30:59,320
Yeah.

967
00:30:59,640 --> 00:30:59,860
Right.

968
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,160
Sorry.

969
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,440
If you're, if you're listening to me on

970
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,460
this planet, I'm sorry.

971
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,340
Sorry.

972
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,500
They sent you here.

973
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,100
Yeah.

974
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:06,480
Anyway.

975
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:06,880
Okay.

976
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:07,900
My apologies.

977
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,360
My apologies that you've joined us.

978
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,840
Although somebody said it's a pleasure to, uh,

979
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,540
be growing down with you quoting you from

980
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,620
the last Sonic.

981
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,220
Also, I wanted to let you know that

982
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,340
there is a bunch and I'm just going

983
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,440
to put these all together, but, uh, Mary

984
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,300
weather and a bunch of other listeners, uh,

985
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,960
wanted to say that they really appreciated a

986
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,680
lot of connected dots from the very last

987
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,880
Sonic, uh, that they felt as though that

988
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,420
was a very good, you know, uh, they,

989
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,860
they use words like truth bombs.

990
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,140
I'm putting things together here.

991
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,600
So much gratitude for the info and effort

992
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,400
that you put into this, uh, channel.

993
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,520
Appreciate it.

994
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,420
Thank you for answering these questions and putting

995
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:41,920
it together.

996
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,700
And one good Sonic solidly, uh, et cetera.

997
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,640
So I just want to let you know

998
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,540
that there was a very positive response for

999
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,260
that last one.

1000
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,980
Anyway, moving forward.

1001
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,960
That wasn't even that, by the way, that

1002
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,620
was unplanned.

1003
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,480
That was all, that was all brought on

1004
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,980
because of someone who was analysis paralysis about

1005
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,980
the law questions.

1006
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:00,420
Right.

1007
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,420
They had them.

1008
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:01,720
Yeah.

1009
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,400
They had one long and I, and I

1010
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,280
thought it was worthy to focus on that

1011
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,220
and it turned out to be it provoked

1012
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:07,540
something.

1013
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,660
That's that's what, that's what it's.

1014
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:09,900
Yeah.

1015
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,760
Otherwise I've got all that stuff in me

1016
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,140
and more.

1017
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,400
If you like that kind of stuff, go

1018
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,780
ahead and poke me with a stick on

1019
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,320
that subject.

1020
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,300
And I'll come up with more, uh, that

1021
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,960
I've learned over the years that seemed to

1022
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,140
be senseless and mindless to talk about just

1023
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:25,220
as we just finished saying cancer is actually

1024
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,940
a life extended reaction.

1025
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,360
And if you tell this to anyone, they're

1026
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,220
going to think you're nuts.

1027
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,720
Cause you, they've been taught that it's a

1028
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,660
life terminating, uh, function.

1029
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,640
So anyway, Right.

1030
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,520
It's just like, you know, AIDS is a

1031
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,140
thing too, which, you know, by the way,

1032
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,040
that's why you had to say it was

1033
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,640
a metaphor when somebody used it before.

1034
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:42,820
Yeah.

1035
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,400
Diabetes.

1036
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:44,520
Yeah.

1037
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,580
Diabetes and AIDS is the treatment.

1038
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:49,260
They convince you it's, there's no such thing.

1039
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,560
There's no such disease at all.

1040
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,400
Not even the only way you can have

1041
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,120
glucose measured in the body is in the

1042
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:54,380
urine.

1043
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,180
I there's, there's dozens of things you could

1044
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:57,340
read.

1045
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,920
They're still trying to figure out how to

1046
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,100
diagnose it in the blood.

1047
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,460
And there's a lot of medical idiots out

1048
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,480
there that think that it's actually true.

1049
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:07,140
Another, another fallacy other than AIDS and diabetes

1050
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,220
is blood tests.

1051
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,940
Blood tests are total fallacy because if you

1052
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,580
know anyone that works in a blood testing

1053
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:15,800
lab, they walk in and each technician calibrates

1054
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,320
the equipment to their own blood.

1055
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,240
Yeah.

1056
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,120
They have no benchmark and they never will

1057
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,520
because they don't understand it.

1058
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,860
It's not about go read the Flexner report.

1059
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,340
And if that doesn't make you want to

1060
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,660
set your hair on fire and run down

1061
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,160
the street.

1062
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,400
And also I've been watching some of the

1063
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,480
drug ads that, you know, pharmaceutical ads, they

1064
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,300
very clearly tell you it's for treating symptoms.

1065
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,020
Oh yeah.

1066
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,220
Very clearly.

1067
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,480
Now that's you, do you know that most

1068
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,680
people are quote unquote alcoholic and severe alcoholic?

1069
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,380
You know why?

1070
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:49,280
Oh, because they're trying to treat their symptoms

1071
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,580
and their life sucks.

1072
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,860
And instead of fixing their life, they treat

1073
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,880
the symptom, the sucky part with alcohol.

1074
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:00,140
So if you think being an alcoholic, severe

1075
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,900
alcoholic is fine, then go ahead and take

1076
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,300
their farm.

1077
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,840
They're telling you it's no different than pharmaceuticals.

1078
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:07,780
That's a very strict analogy, very direct analogy.

1079
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,380
Most alcoholics would tell you they drink because

1080
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,239
their life sucks.

1081
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,880
So why don't you change your life?

1082
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,060
No, I'd rather drink alcohol.

1083
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,659
That's why they call it self-medicating because

1084
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:18,000
that's what you're doing.

1085
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,199
You are self-medicating for the same purpose.

1086
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,820
They're telling you they're going to give you

1087
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,100
a magic pill to fix everything, except you're

1088
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:24,699
doing it yourself.

1089
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:25,639
No, they're not.

1090
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:26,940
No, they're not going to fix everything.

1091
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,280
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1092
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:40,960
no, no, no, no, no,

1093
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,400
no, no, no, no, no, right?

1094
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,960
So that's why it's all bullshit and these

1095
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,100
medical people are actually an extension.

1096
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:55,580
Okay.

1097
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:57,840
You know how police are called paramilitary.

1098
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:58,500
Yep.

1099
00:34:59,160 --> 00:34:59,400
Right.

1100
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,380
So the, basically the the medical community is,

1101
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,640
as the, is the paramilitary medical, the purpose

1102
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,360
of the medical and medical.

1103
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:08,780
Okay.

1104
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,000
People that run the world would love to

1105
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,900
shut down all.

1106
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,420
give you no medical care at all, zero

1107
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:18,060
whatsoever, and say screw you, right, but they

1108
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,460
don't do that because then they know the

1109
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,560
population would get together on its own and

1110
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,600
emerge with a viable system that works.

1111
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,920
So what they do is they distract you,

1112
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,520
come to us, come to us, same with

1113
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,020
university.

1114
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:32,960
People would be far more intelligent and well

1115
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,880
-read if all the schools and universities shut

1116
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,820
down, and it was self-encouraged to be

1117
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:41,080
autodidactic, right, so what they do is they

1118
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,240
lure you in thinking, you know, with this

1119
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,720
false thing, and the reason it comes from

1120
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:49,860
the military is because the way you stop

1121
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:52,840
an army or tactically slow down an army

1122
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,600
is by injuring the troops, not killing them,

1123
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:57,100
because it takes two good men, two uninjured

1124
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,740
troops to take care of an injured troop.

1125
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,020
Now if I were to form a military,

1126
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,760
if you're injured, you take a suicide pill

1127
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,160
or the guy next to you puts one

1128
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,660
in your head, no injured people, just like

1129
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:11,260
they say no prisoners, right, in the military

1130
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,020
that I would create is if you're injured

1131
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:16,580
and you can't move forward and proceed in

1132
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:19,640
a tactical advance, you have to take your

1133
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,080
own life or your life will be taken

1134
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,660
in 30 seconds, and you have to sign

1135
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,900
up for that, you know, it sounds kind

1136
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,540
of cruel, but you know what?

1137
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,380
You ever hear of the Spartans?

1138
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,620
Anyway, so yeah, that's a real military.

1139
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:34,960
The military we have is just a joke,

1140
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,280
like I said, after 9-11, and the

1141
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,960
society here is a joke, because if the

1142
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,840
military couldn't do anything about it, we need

1143
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,300
to immediately dissolve the U.S. military and

1144
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,480
bring in whatever allies we have to protect

1145
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,260
the country until we form a viable one.

1146
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,360
9-11 was proof of that, so it's

1147
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,620
idiot, idiocracy, you know, all the way around,

1148
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,920
you know, so to me, the military, you

1149
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,040
know, I say humans are morons and military

1150
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,560
is just weaponized morons, right?

1151
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:06,360
And yet there's a common template for hierarchy,

1152
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,000
you know, where there are the uninformed troops

1153
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,780
on the bottom and all the way up

1154
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,860
to the people that command things, and they're

1155
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:16,260
supposed to know, there is a hierarchy, there's

1156
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:16,620
a business hierarchy.

1157
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,800
Yeah, the command people are financer people, they're,

1158
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,600
yeah, they're morons.

1159
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,600
Who's that idiot that was head of the

1160
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,460
army 15 years ago?

1161
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,520
He had a lot of controversy, he had

1162
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,700
an affair with one of his, what do

1163
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,380
they call, attachés, the young girl again, and

1164
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,720
he was like a weak-chinned guy.

1165
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:34,520
Petraeus.

1166
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,160
Petraeus, yeah, that moron.

1167
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,760
He said, he wrote a paper and spoke

1168
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,260
about it that he says that the U

1169
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,980
.S. never lost a battle in Vietnam.

1170
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,260
You can't show me a battle they won,

1171
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:45,800
right?

1172
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,600
Which one did they win?

1173
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,380
I mean, this is the kind of horseshit.

1174
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,580
Oh, am I beeping?

1175
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,740
Yeah, I walked really far away.

1176
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,920
Okay, all right, I can hear you.

1177
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,380
I'll be back in range within a second

1178
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:58,880
or two.

1179
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,400
No problem.

1180
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,720
I was making myself a coffee.

1181
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,740
All right, what else you got?

1182
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,200
Yeah, well, look, here's kind of, I combined

1183
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,840
a few things, so here we go with

1184
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,840
the last thing, and who knows what you'll

1185
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,340
do with this.

1186
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,960
Christianity is an interesting sect.

1187
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,140
As a small child, I was the only

1188
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,540
one who was not going to church on

1189
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,700
Sunday with the other kids.

1190
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,500
The local priest one day visited our primary

1191
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,960
school and said in front of the whole

1192
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,740
classroom that I'm the only bad boy there.

1193
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,460
I was six years old, and he really

1194
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:29,680
made me feel like crap, but I think

1195
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,580
this listener is grateful for it now, but

1196
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,280
he calls it an interesting sect.

1197
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,220
Your thoughts on that one?

1198
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:36,860
It is.

1199
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:41,260
Well, what the hell is he doing interacting

1200
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,140
with a six-year-old?

1201
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,040
He should be interacting with the parents of

1202
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,720
a six-year-old to then interact with

1203
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,380
you as an intermediary, right?

1204
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,980
So I would find that very, unless he

1205
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:53,200
was the one, yeah, so anyway.

1206
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,060
Well, he went to the school.

1207
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,400
I think they're all scumbags.

1208
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,420
Yeah, he went to the school, but, you

1209
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:00,220
know, here we go.

1210
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,680
I always think of fish, by the way,

1211
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,740
whenever I hear the word school anymore, because

1212
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:09,200
it's not really the proper human way to

1213
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,120
educate people, but anyway, no, it's interesting.

1214
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,040
We've spent a lot of time on the

1215
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,220
school thing, but with the priest, I think

1216
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:19,180
they're all scumbags because, well, no matter how

1217
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:21,060
helpful they are, ignorance of the law is

1218
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,320
no excuse, right?

1219
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,800
And the first thing I always say, I'm

1220
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,960
the only one speaking on this.

1221
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,360
It was an article I found out written

1222
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,440
about another Greek guy in the 1990s.

1223
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,360
There is no crucifixion, no matter how much

1224
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,680
they write it in your translation.

1225
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,680
The Greek term stavros was actually a slang

1226
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:41,760
term, stavromenos, which means to be crossed or

1227
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,400
nailed down.

1228
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,340
It's kind of like now, like a slang

1229
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,540
term, like say, oh, what happened to, you

1230
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:47,980
know, Tom?

1231
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:48,920
Oh, he got screwed.

1232
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,300
Does that literally mean someone went to the

1233
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,040
hardware store and got a Phillips head or

1234
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,140
a flathead screw and the wood screw or

1235
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,200
metal screw and put it?

1236
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:56,640
No.

1237
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:00,300
So there's enough references in there from the

1238
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,480
authority in the story.

1239
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,420
I'm not saying it's true or not, but

1240
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,940
let's stick, we don't have a license to

1241
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,540
change what's being conveyed, right?

1242
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,580
So if we're talking about Melville's Moby Dick,

1243
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,360
we can't say that the whale was purple

1244
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,020
with green polka dots because that's not the

1245
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,220
case, right?

1246
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,800
We can say that, but we have no

1247
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,680
license to say that it's in the book.

1248
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,560
What's in the book is that Christ is

1249
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,180
brought to a chain of command, finally ending

1250
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,960
up with the prefect governor Pontius Pilate.

1251
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,460
In order to be a governor of a

1252
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,060
territory, you have to know the customs and

1253
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:31,920
laws of the people.

1254
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,660
He washes his hands of the matter, which

1255
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,180
is one of the ordinances in the Red

1256
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,420
Heifer, which means to absolve himself of any

1257
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,280
guilt because of a murder.

1258
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,820
He does, it's like pre, what do you

1259
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,920
call it when you do it before the

1260
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,340
fact?

1261
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,140
And he turns around, this is the book

1262
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,440
of Mark, and it's what they call it,

1263
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:52,260
a prima ficia case is what they call

1264
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:52,420
that.

1265
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,360
That's the first phase.

1266
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,620
That's something to do ahead of time.

1267
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:54,940
Go ahead.

1268
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:55,380
Yeah.

1269
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:56,840
Okay.

1270
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,360
Well, prima ficia means on his face, but

1271
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:58,700
okay.

1272
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,940
Preemptively, preemptive.

1273
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,740
And he tells the Judean authorities, I didn't

1274
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:08,040
say Jewish, Judean authorities to use their law

1275
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,600
and they retort, well, he says, I know

1276
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,380
you have a law.

1277
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,140
It goes back and forth.

1278
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,820
You could read it yourself, right?

1279
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:18,260
So what's established is Judean law will be

1280
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,620
used, which is death by stoning.

1281
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:23,300
It's not Christ's crucifixion, but we're not that

1282
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,560
stupid in the Deuteronomy 21, it states how

1283
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,100
it's done.

1284
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:27,960
It's on a tree.

1285
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,120
And we know it's an almond tree because

1286
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,520
there's all these references to an almond tree.

1287
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:36,140
You probably missed that because you've over-signified

1288
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,500
to look at the olive tree with the

1289
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:41,360
olive branch and blah, blah, blah, and the

1290
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,380
amount of olives, but you forgot to look

1291
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:46,260
at the references regarding the almond tree.

1292
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,480
And especially with Moses, why am I building

1293
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,700
this seven branch lampstand?

1294
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,780
Make sure it has almond blossoms on it

1295
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,960
because that is blah, blah, blah, lights up

1296
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,480
on fire.

1297
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,060
So in book of Numbers, anything that is

1298
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,420
on a tree is cursed and to be

1299
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:00,860
burned.

1300
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:05,180
So the thing was set on fire, but

1301
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,120
his body, he wasn't burned.

1302
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,240
The other two guys were burned.

1303
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,920
Their femoral arteries were cut, blah, blah, blah.

1304
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:12,220
The Roman soldiers there, which are actually Syrian,

1305
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,880
the Romans didn't bring people from their land

1306
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,220
to, they just hired people that were locals,

1307
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:22,220
by the way, except for some Centurion, maybe

1308
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:25,340
even not, because it said, they spoke Aramaic,

1309
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,760
so he was probably Syrian descent also.

1310
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,720
They didn't know what was going on, so

1311
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,140
they had to explain to them, and he

1312
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,880
says, holy shit, that's Herod's robe.

1313
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,200
Well, that's going to get burned.

1314
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,220
No, I want it.

1315
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:37,940
No, I want it.

1316
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,300
Okay, cast lots for it.

1317
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,720
The people passed from the third to the

1318
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,880
ninth hour doing what?

1319
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,680
How boring is it for six hours to

1320
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,360
see someone nailed to a crew?

1321
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,460
They were throwing stones.

1322
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,460
They were participants.

1323
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,840
That's why there's a lot of things about

1324
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,180
the curse that was put on them.

1325
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,400
It says, you know, what you're going to

1326
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,660
do to the Jewish people, I mean, Judeans

1327
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:03,260
there in Jerusalem is going to be also

1328
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,280
put on their children.

1329
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,860
They all participated.

1330
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:09,980
It took six hours, thousands of people doing

1331
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:13,440
this, throwing stones, right, and it's like a

1332
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,600
decomposed granite and limestone.

1333
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:17,380
It's a flat disk.

1334
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,660
Imagine a playing card made of slate.

1335
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,020
When you throw it and it hits you,

1336
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,400
it'll cut a piece of flesh off.

1337
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:24,820
It's not a river rock.

1338
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:27,560
It's very sharp, so all the flesh was

1339
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,380
torn off of his body, but no bones

1340
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:29,960
were broken.

1341
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,640
Didn't even look good, so all this is

1342
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:33,220
in the text.

1343
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:35,080
It's actually in the prophecies from hundreds of

1344
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:38,340
years before it happened also, so anyone's talking

1345
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:40,960
about a crucifixion doesn't know what they're talking

1346
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,660
about because they haven't read the text.

1347
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,500
They're going on what's called churchianity.

1348
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,380
Now, I agree what the church is putting

1349
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,860
forward is all BS, but if you go

1350
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:55,000
in the biblical text, you'll find that, you

1351
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,800
know, wow, but we have this thing, you

1352
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,960
know, it's how different, we have this thing

1353
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,880
that if you're reading, let's say, the book

1354
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,620
of Exodus and you saw the movie, that

1355
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:03,960
piece of shit movie with Charlton Heston, Ten

1356
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:07,520
Commandments, right, if you saw that before you

1357
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,100
read the book of Exodus, you're reading the

1358
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:09,700
book of Exodus.

1359
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,400
I don't care who you are unless you

1360
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,320
know what I'm about to say, which is

1361
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,260
having a clear mind and reading objectively, you're

1362
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:17,420
going to fall for what I'm about to

1363
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:19,680
say, Jason Breshears.

1364
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,660
I'm saying that friendly, affectionately.

1365
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,400
Oh, this is, I'm reading Exodus.

1366
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:27,940
This is where they're leaving Egypt.

1367
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,560
Oh, I saw this in the movie, and

1368
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,760
they read over everything real fast without reading

1369
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,160
any of the details at all, and they

1370
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,600
think the movie was accurate, but if you

1371
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:43,100
read the details, the wind blew all night

1372
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,260
from the east in the springtime, which means

1373
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:46,820
it could be as cold as 20 degrees

1374
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:47,260
Fahrenheit.

1375
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,220
Is that enough to freeze water?

1376
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,700
And they walked on the sea of reeds,

1377
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:55,000
which is fresh water, as if it were

1378
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,240
land, and in the morning, it says when

1379
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,400
the sun came out, Pharaoh pursued, but he

1380
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,400
fell to the bottom.

1381
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,780
He fell to the bottom like a stone.

1382
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,540
He fell to the bottom like lead.

1383
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:08,480
It says it three times.

1384
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:09,740
Now, let me ask you something.

1385
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:14,960
If you're walking through it, if you are

1386
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,680
already walking on the bottom, how can you

1387
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:19,440
fall to the bottom?

1388
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:22,120
It's like saying, I'm on the fourth floor,

1389
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,740
and I just walked up to the fourth

1390
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:24,120
floor.

1391
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:27,840
I thought you said you were on the

1392
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,000
fourth floor, and you walked up to the

1393
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:29,980
fourth floor, but you're already there.

1394
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:30,580
What else do you have?

1395
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,060
What you just said after that makes no

1396
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:37,300
sense, so you see, so yeah, and oh,

1397
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,920
my God, no one's paying any attention.

1398
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,120
The big one, the big tell is when

1399
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,780
you start using names like J-E-S

1400
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:45,480
-U-S, you never hear me using that.

1401
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,480
Occasionally, it'll come out, but I don't have

1402
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:51,020
to make a point, but that's like, oh,

1403
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:51,640
my God.

1404
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:55,380
You know, yeah, there's no common sense at

1405
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:59,060
all out there.

1406
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,160
Yeah, what's the internet is like very much?

1407
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,800
It's like when you, okay, there's billions of

1408
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,960
people on the internet posting, right, every day

1409
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,080
or whatever, billions.

1410
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:11,660
There's more posts on the internet than there

1411
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:13,740
are people by a factor of 100 maybe,

1412
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:17,420
and people are impressed by that, but how

1413
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:19,120
impressed are you by a sandy beach?

1414
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:21,580
How many grains of sand are on a

1415
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:22,240
sandy beach?

1416
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,160
Uncountable, right?

1417
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,020
It's finite, right, and it's all just a

1418
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:28,980
sandy beach, so I'm telling you, internet is

1419
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:30,180
just a sandy beach, dude.

1420
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:30,840
Yeah.

1421
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,020
You have to do it on your own.

1422
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:34,480
Well, the beauty of the process is that

1423
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,160
if you're dumb enough to not know what

1424
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:41,400
details you're looking for, then you're also happy

1425
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,720
with just not having an answer that is

1426
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,300
complicated.

1427
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:46,640
You know what I mean?

1428
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,280
It's that simple.

1429
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:49,900
The same skill set that would let you

1430
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:52,540
know you're wrong is the same skill set

1431
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:54,640
that gives you the confidence to think you're

1432
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:54,920
right.

1433
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,920
It's really, really fascinating when you think of

1434
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:58,400
it that way.

1435
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,820
You know, that's what we're looking at all

1436
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:01,500
the time.

1437
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:03,400
Well, you have to look at everything with

1438
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,200
a sense of purpose.

1439
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:05,700
What I mean is, okay, people ask me,

1440
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,260
what's a good book I could read?

1441
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:08,200
There's no such thing.

1442
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,480
You have to know the bad books also,

1443
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,800
right, because then you know that it's a

1444
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,380
bad book and not just hearsay, right?

1445
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,600
You have to read everything.

1446
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:18,220
Well, I don't have enough time to read

1447
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:18,540
everything.

1448
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,000
Well, that's your real answer.

1449
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,680
There's not enough time to read everything.

1450
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:24,400
The other thing is, I've read stuff, like,

1451
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,940
they used to have the, I call it

1452
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:29,320
the trash pile in the library, like, the

1453
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,600
books, misfit books that no one ever wanted

1454
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,940
to take out.

1455
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,680
Have you seen those in libraries?

1456
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:35,200
They have them.

1457
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:37,660
They put them out in a table.

1458
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,620
And there was one, like, one book I

1459
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:41,980
remember is back in the 80s, The 10

1460
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:43,180
Worst Popes Ever, right?

1461
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:44,340
I was like, oh, that's a great book.

1462
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,380
No one wants to take that out.

1463
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,380
Okay, I want that.

1464
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,540
You know, and so you go through stuff.

1465
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,700
In other words, the circumstances, like John C.

1466
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:54,920
Lilly states, we're controlled by the ECCO, E

1467
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,560
-C-C-O, which is the Earth Coincidence

1468
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,440
Control Office.

1469
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:01,780
They control long-term stuff.

1470
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:03,800
We control the short-term stuff, right?

1471
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:06,520
It's kind of like what's that, not Minority

1472
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:07,840
Pro, what's the other one, the guys with

1473
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,260
the fedora hats going around Adjustment Bureau?

1474
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,920
The Adjustment Bureau is based on that.

1475
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:15,420
Yeah, exactly, because there was no concept before

1476
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:15,720
that.

1477
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:18,000
So go along with it.

1478
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:20,220
In other words, you have to always expect

1479
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:23,280
the unexpected, be prepared for the unexpected.

1480
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,040
Well, how can you prepare for something like

1481
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:25,480
that, right?

1482
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:27,100
So you have to have an open heart,

1483
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:27,380
right?

1484
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,860
Because your emotions and feelings in your heart

1485
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:31,340
will close you off to certain things.

1486
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,120
I'm not saying be open to things that

1487
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:36,820
you know are unlawful or distasteful, but you

1488
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:37,760
have to look at everything.

1489
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:40,220
The other thing is I'm a Yahwehist, right?

1490
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:43,220
And the reason why what really firmed me

1491
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:45,480
up as a Yahwehist is in Exodus 15,

1492
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:47,640
he says, Yahweh is a man, Yahweh is

1493
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,660
a man of war.

1494
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,660
Now, if he was Elohim or God, it

1495
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:54,960
would state that, right?

1496
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,060
So he's a man.

1497
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,860
And I've had several people look at that

1498
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:59,520
in various texts, and it does say man,

1499
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:02,800
ish, ish, and woman is ishah, which means

1500
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,480
flesh and blood man, right?

1501
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,420
With certain powers, let's say, certain, certain powers,

1502
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:07,600
whatever.

1503
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:09,860
And the part that got me is war,

1504
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,940
because if you think you're here to be

1505
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:15,540
peaceful, and if you think that peace is

1506
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:18,780
a matter of flower child bullshit, everybody holding

1507
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:19,680
hands, you're an idiot.

1508
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:22,340
The way you bring peace to a knife

1509
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:24,080
fight is not by showing up with a

1510
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:26,460
knife, you show up with a machine gun,

1511
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:27,760
right?

1512
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,780
So the way you bring peace to this

1513
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:33,280
type of world is with ordinance that they

1514
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,780
have never seen before, right?

1515
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:40,140
And ultimately, it becomes nonphysical ordinance, you know,

1516
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,480
and it's spirit, mind, right?

1517
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,240
And anything goes.

1518
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:48,380
And when you look at the laws of

1519
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:52,400
the Old Testament, more than three quarters apply

1520
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,480
to the temple function to priests and their

1521
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:55,960
families.

1522
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:00,140
So the other few that are left, apply

1523
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:02,260
to basically the way you do business, the

1524
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:06,960
way you eat what you wear, how you

1525
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,200
raise a family, how you negotiate time, and

1526
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:11,920
these other things.

1527
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:15,260
And those rules, by the way, even especially

1528
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:16,620
the ones that have to do with fitness

1529
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:18,720
or health, I've all panned out to be

1530
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:19,020
true.

1531
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:20,100
Right?

1532
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:22,360
I personally disagree with the circumcision.

1533
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:23,660
I'm not circumcised.

1534
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,020
Is that TMI?

1535
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,040
But anyway, it's just a piece of information.

1536
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,460
I don't see how it's too much.

1537
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:31,640
It just is what it is.

1538
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:31,980
Yeah.

1539
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:32,360
Okay.

1540
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:33,060
Yeah.

1541
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,520
So, but if I had a son, whatever,

1542
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:36,740
I probably wouldn't.

1543
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:39,120
Now here, what that this, the order of

1544
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,540
circumcision and man is made in his image

1545
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:43,380
means that the gods are not circumcised.

1546
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,760
So it can go both ways, right?

1547
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:47,260
It can go both ways because it's supposed

1548
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:48,120
to be a sign.

1549
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,380
It was in Egypt also, by the way,

1550
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:54,180
and make a long story short about this.

1551
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,620
Do you want to, would you rather be

1552
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,400
like a God or would you rather be

1553
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,260
like someone who has allegiance to a God?

1554
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,020
I'll lift that, you know, whoever can rationalize

1555
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:03,400
that.

1556
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:05,760
That's like a rabbinical, you know, how rabbis

1557
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,180
talk about stuff and they over-rationalize, right?

1558
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:12,360
Like, you know, why did this guy get

1559
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,380
eaten by a bear?

1560
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:15,540
Why did this guy die of sickness?

1561
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:17,720
Because he, you know, there were two innocent

1562
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:20,640
boys that he said a bear sick to

1563
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,180
bear on to kill them because they made

1564
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:22,840
fun of his head.

1565
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:25,040
You know, that's why, or no, maybe it

1566
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,800
was this or was that, but the simple

1567
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,860
rationale is the gods are not circumcised.

1568
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,440
I'd rather be like the gods and someone

1569
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,900
having allegiance to the gods.

1570
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,560
I think it trumps that, but that's not

1571
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:36,980
for me to say that's very personal.

1572
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:39,100
And I did give, that's a very personal

1573
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:39,440
thought.

1574
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:41,240
And I also gave a personal thing, right?

1575
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:44,220
So the best, the funniest thing was whenever

1576
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:45,740
I dated a Jewish girl and we're at,

1577
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:46,640
I said, you ever been with a guy

1578
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,360
that's uncut?

1579
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:48,400
And they're like, what do you mean?

1580
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:50,080
And we're like, oh, no, but anyway, that's

1581
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:50,940
another thing, right?

1582
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,000
Always have fun with that.

1583
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:56,960
But so either way you do what you

1584
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,660
want, but the rules work, by the way,

1585
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,180
you're, you're, you know, like the U S

1586
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:02,560
constitution, right?

1587
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:06,360
States that anything that's contrary to the constitution

1588
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:07,340
is null and void.

1589
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:09,600
So when the cops and whatever, pull you

1590
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:10,880
over and tell you all in the state

1591
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:11,820
of Florida, blah, blah, blah.

1592
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:12,080
Yeah.

1593
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,020
But it's, that's contrary to the constitution.

1594
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:15,100
So it's null and void.

1595
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:18,700
You don't argue with those idiots, but you

1596
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:20,840
know, you just stay on that one point

1597
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,160
and it'll work out in the end.

1598
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,280
They might put you through torture in the

1599
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:24,720
meantime.

1600
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,720
And if you know what you're doing, you'll

1601
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,120
get a quarter of a million dollars for

1602
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,600
every night you're in jail, right?

1603
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:32,560
At least maybe 50,000 settlement, but that's

1604
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:33,280
still not bad.

1605
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,680
If you're in there for a week, that's

1606
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,040
250 grand, right?

1607
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,000
So you're not going to get it right

1608
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,220
away, but on the, it could really be

1609
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:41,940
two and a half million.

1610
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:43,300
And believe it or not, what I just

1611
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,160
said happens more often than you would ever

1612
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:46,780
know, but you never hear about it.

1613
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:47,040
Right.

1614
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:50,560
The other thing is the, when you stick

1615
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,420
to certain rules and you see that they

1616
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:55,140
work out, it doesn't mean your life is

1617
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:57,260
going to be easy, smoothie, whatever, whatever.

1618
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:00,360
But in the end, it works out and

1619
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:01,700
you're like, Oh, I'm glad I stuck to

1620
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:02,640
my guns or whatever.

1621
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:03,440
Right.

1622
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:07,320
So that's, I found that works for me.

1623
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:11,640
The most people think it's just about certain

1624
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,360
food laws, which are open.

1625
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,820
Like for example, most people think it's about

1626
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:16,600
not eating pork.

1627
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,700
No, it's not about that selectively.

1628
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:19,080
No.

1629
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,160
If an animal, a four legged animal is

1630
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,120
to be eaten, it should chew the cud

1631
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,680
and have a cloven hoof, right?

1632
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,980
So you have a rabbit, you choose the

1633
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:31,120
cud, but he has a paw.

1634
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:31,760
So he's out.

1635
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:34,560
The pig doesn't chew the cud, but he

1636
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,500
has a cloven hoof.

1637
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:40,480
Now let's say a pig were born that

1638
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,380
chewed the cud with two stomachs.

1639
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,620
Let's say, is he edible?

1640
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,860
Hell yeah, baby back to pork bacon.

1641
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,600
You see, because it's not about no pig.

1642
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,860
So the, the most people take a very

1643
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:55,280
juvenile approach.

1644
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:56,260
Oh, it's all pork.

1645
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:58,240
Now in the Quran, it says you shall

1646
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:01,400
not eat the flesh of swine or flesh

1647
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,140
that's been found dead, like roadkill.

1648
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:03,760
And that's it.

1649
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:06,600
So they eat camel, they donkey, they eat

1650
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:06,900
shrimp.

1651
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:09,100
They love, they have no discernment in that,

1652
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:09,380
right?

1653
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:10,960
It's just these two things.

1654
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:12,540
And that there's no discernment, but the biblical

1655
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,160
text teaches discernment.

1656
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:15,320
I'm serious.

1657
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:20,280
If a swine started being born with two

1658
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:23,820
stomachs, I wish one did and chewed the

1659
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:25,120
cud as a cloven hoof.

1660
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:26,920
What would the rabbis do?

1661
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,080
They would divide them completely, right?

1662
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,620
Yeah, it would be edible.

1663
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:31,660
It would be, it would be.

1664
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:33,520
So for example, if you understand the old

1665
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,740
Testament, let's say you mentioned the deserted Island,

1666
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:38,420
but let's say we're in the Himalayas, unmapped

1667
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:40,820
territory, and there's species of fauna we've never

1668
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:41,640
seen before.

1669
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,980
We're starving the death and here goes this

1670
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,840
furry creature and we're tracking it.

1671
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,720
And we observe that it has cloven hoof.

1672
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,720
And we observe that it chews the cud.

1673
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,420
Now we don't know what the, we don't

1674
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:54,260
know what we're going to call.

1675
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:55,520
The only thing we can call it is

1676
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,940
dinner, right?

1677
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:58,420
Because it fits.

1678
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:01,640
Well, a juvenile will say, well, it's about

1679
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:02,440
not eating pork.

1680
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,180
Like when I go out to eat and

1681
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:05,820
I say, well, everything here has got swine

1682
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:06,120
on it.

1683
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,080
I don't dig on swine, Pulp Fiction, right?

1684
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:09,860
And, um, or something.

1685
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:11,980
And, uh, and they're like, are you Jewish?

1686
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,260
And I'm like, what does that have to

1687
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:13,780
do with it?

1688
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:15,060
You know?

1689
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:16,380
Uh, not at all.

1690
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:19,720
And there's, there was a very, um, very,

1691
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:21,480
very, what do you call liberal liberal?

1692
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,280
Oh, it's another word for liberal liberal.

1693
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:24,720
You know, it's like bending the rules.

1694
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:27,020
Rabbi in the Bronx years ago, he had

1695
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:29,440
a liberal synagogue and he says, listen, the

1696
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,600
Torah, where he says not eating pork, that

1697
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,400
just means in certain restaurants, right?

1698
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:37,220
So that, that goes out of the rule

1699
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:40,660
that see, that's totally ignoring the discernment factor.

1700
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:41,980
Now you got to listen to what this

1701
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:42,440
guy says.

1702
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,040
And that's what I see going on on

1703
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,100
the internet period.

1704
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:46,740
Is that the same guy who said it's

1705
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:48,900
okay to eat Chinese food, any kind, because

1706
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:51,060
whatever, is that that same guy?

1707
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:53,060
Cause I remember a rabbi that was like,

1708
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:54,200
Chinese food doesn't count.

1709
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:56,380
I couldn't understand it.

1710
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,540
No, but there's a whole bunch of liberal.

1711
00:55:58,760 --> 00:55:59,240
Are you kidding?

1712
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,840
I mean, Jewish people are probably modern Jews

1713
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:04,040
are probably the most liberal lot ever.

1714
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,640
You ever hear of the Bolsheviks that they're

1715
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:08,840
liberalism used to be something that was good.

1716
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,260
Like liberal arts means you have a little

1717
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:13,580
bit of everything or well-rounded and it

1718
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:16,320
turned into something that's basically destroying culture that

1719
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:16,720
works.

1720
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,140
And the worst thing you can do is

1721
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:21,620
start blurring the line between male and female,

1722
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:24,900
man and woman, because in the spiritual world,

1723
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:26,440
that's extremely venerated.

1724
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:29,260
In other words, the, the effect of being

1725
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:30,880
a man or a woman, there's not one

1726
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,300
over the other, by the way, if you

1727
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:34,380
believe that, then you believe everything else.

1728
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,580
You've probably been told that's not true.

1729
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:40,740
The women was the head economist, meaning the

1730
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:41,480
head of the household.

1731
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:44,440
And even in modern culture, if anyone, if

1732
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:46,820
you go look at the Jewish community and

1733
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:49,140
you look at the Latin community, it's the

1734
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:51,500
grandma, that's the head of the household, like

1735
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:52,760
it or not, or know it or not.

1736
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:53,020
Right.

1737
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,720
And I'm talking about in the household, not

1738
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:59,280
in the community and the community, it'll be

1739
00:56:59,280 --> 00:56:59,960
the older men.

1740
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:04,520
So in the private, the it's matriarchy everywhere,

1741
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:07,220
pretty much, except for Asia.

1742
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:09,940
That's patriarchy, very pay so much that the

1743
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:11,180
women still walk behind them.

1744
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:12,840
I've seen that here even right.

1745
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,360
And sit in the backseat.

1746
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:16,780
Have you seen that?

1747
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:17,140
Yes.

1748
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:18,440
The Chinese?

1749
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:20,060
Yeah, they sit in the back, the women

1750
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:21,040
has sit in the backseat.

1751
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:26,540
So Rosa Parks, anyway, this is the veneration

1752
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:29,040
of the male and the female, the man

1753
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,260
and the woman is very high in the

1754
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:30,820
spiritual world.

1755
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,360
Of course, they're going to attack it.

1756
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:33,200
Right?

1757
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:34,920
A man who wants to be a woman,

1758
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:39,280
is extremely neurotic, very extreme.

1759
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:43,260
Neuro, what do you call psychosis?

1760
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:44,960
Mentally not well.

1761
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:45,900
Sorry.

1762
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:46,880
So anyway.
