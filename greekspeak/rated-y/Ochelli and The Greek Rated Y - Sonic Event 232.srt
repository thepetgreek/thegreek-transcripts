1
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,820
As the Sonics are numbered, it's 232.

2
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,500
But anyway, who knows what what you counted

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:14,800
as?

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:15,379
How about that?

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,160
Greek, how are you this particular day?

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,980
Or actually, it's kind of getting dark where

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:21,480
you are, right?

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,600
It is.

9
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:23,800
Yeah.

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,140
We mean, this is the Sonic.

11
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,140
I think we just did it.

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,040
We just had a long conversation for a

13
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:28,280
while.

14
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,360
And now this is the Sonic.

15
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,520
I okay, I got it.

16
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,440
Well, if I record it, if I record

17
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,580
it behind the scenes one day, if I

18
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,640
recorded it, I turn it into something.

19
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,360
Okay.

20
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,620
So yeah.

21
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,860
So yeah.

22
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,740
By the way, it's the seventh month been

23
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,340
the seventh month for a little while.

24
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,880
People or the first month if you're down

25
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,600
under and yeah, how am I doing busy,

26
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:50,020
man?

27
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,900
But now we're here.

28
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,820
Let's get what we were talking about is

29
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,500
just growth generally a rated Y.

30
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,000
And and I kind of hit me.

31
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,019
This is like a extra private social media

32
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,600
of its own because we have no agenda.

33
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,000
And the only ones that well, there's the

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,740
Patreon, where people can and the Ocelli and

35
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,420
the Greek should tango chats where people could

36
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,040
put up stuff, but it's basically you and

37
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,640
I talking at everybody on a recording with

38
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,240
a subscription.

39
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,180
And the reason it says no agenda is

40
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,340
because we're not particularly covering any single subject.

41
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,160
And I was just wondering why we just

42
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,140
still have the same number of subs after

43
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:28,680
two years.

44
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,800
And it was like, that's just kind of

45
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,600
like sitting there, you know, but it's it's

46
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:32,900
fine.

47
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,560
Fortunately, I don't depend on it for anything.

48
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:37,500
That's good.

49
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,620
And yeah, I don't know what else to

50
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:41,940
say.

51
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,800
That's what we're basically talking about.

52
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:44,140
Right?

53
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,660
Sort of sadly, I do.

54
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,800
And that's the the other part of it.

55
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,260
But it's a little more significant to me

56
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,860
in that sense.

57
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,220
But what's odd about it is that there

58
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,060
are people that want to go on to

59
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,420
other platforms, say, and sort of bring this

60
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,020
to other platforms, but they can't do it

61
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:01,520
without us.

62
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,480
So somebody proposed, hey, I want to start

63
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,400
a signal chat.

64
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,120
And I'm saying to myself, well, there's already

65
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,060
a wide open publicly available chat at Chatango.

66
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,300
But does everybody know about it?

67
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,720
And also, yeah, it's social media, isn't it

68
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,000
social media, though, like the chat Chatango let's

69
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,660
I mean, like I said, we go through

70
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,400
expansive and contractive periods.

71
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,380
Back in the 80s.

72
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,780
I would say, you know, someone always ordered

73
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,820
chocolate cake after the air, some sweet, I

74
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,160
said, How long you been doing that for?

75
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,080
This is, you know, let me think about

76
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,000
it, like, four years, you got another three

77
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,800
years of that.

78
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,480
And so you go through seven years of

79
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,000
expansive, you know, you want sweets, and then

80
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,780
seven years, you crave chips and salt, or

81
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,420
crisps would be penny if you're British or

82
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:46,880
down under.

83
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,740
And then you go seven years of expansion,

84
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,440
seven years of contraction.

85
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,600
And here's the irony of it.

86
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,540
I know someone right now who might be

87
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,020
going through a contraction period, more focused, and

88
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,580
he got involved with this, let's say, a

89
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,680
corporate entity that normally to 20 or 30

90
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,020
million a year, and they did 84 million

91
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:09,300
by June of this year, right, right by

92
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,120
June, more than two and a half times.

93
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,700
So imagine, so that person maybe is, as

94
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,980
they're contracting, putting out the energy, what's the

95
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,260
op?

96
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,080
What's the thing?

97
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,040
The other thing going to do?

98
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:22,540
Expand.

99
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,340
Right?

100
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,380
I love watching it.

101
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,560
So what I'm saying is that person is

102
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,420
narrowing their focus more on innovation on tech

103
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,120
stuff, which is not what he's all about.

104
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,960
And why is he speaking in the third

105
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,340
party?

106
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,640
So yeah, so that's just basically the gist

107
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:36,980
of it.

108
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,320
What's interesting, though, I say by the fall,

109
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,760
we're going to do some people who are

110
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,700
interested in the Scalarator, the weather work, the

111
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,360
health stuff.

112
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,000
Just a couple of more announcements, things you

113
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,740
can make, things you can do.

114
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,660
I'll probably have a video of the Turbidurator.

115
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,420
Anyway, let's, so this narrowing focus.

116
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,900
And yeah, I consider this to be a

117
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,700
social media kind of aspect, you know?

118
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,640
So anyway, all right, so there's questions, there's

119
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,580
stuff in the chat.

120
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,840
Let's hop in, people, just, you know, nothing

121
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,700
really big.

122
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,880
But you got some questions?

123
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,420
That seems to be a pretty good thing

124
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,160
to work off of.

125
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:19,520
Yeah.

126
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,240
I have a few.

127
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:21,880
Do you have anything you want to get

128
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,260
to from the chat angle?

129
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:23,700
Right?

130
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,480
I keep saying that because that's the way

131
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:25,820
it's spelled.

132
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,300
Nothing that really, you know, since I'm on

133
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,280
the laptop, I sit down here and let's

134
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,420
see what's going on there.

135
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,380
Just perusing, just general stuff, just like some

136
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,240
minor questions, nothing big.

137
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,760
I mean, I think there's some stuff in

138
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,440
the news that people, you know, everything, just

139
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,480
to, well, I don't get a lot of

140
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,860
stuff in the, that's been in, there's a

141
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,120
lot of unanswered, right?

142
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,540
There's a lot of unanswered questions regarding things

143
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,360
that people are reacting to, obviously.

144
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,780
But there always is.

145
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,540
And sometimes it's more intense than others.

146
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,760
Quick question, though.

147
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,800
I mean, we kind of have a circumstance

148
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,120
here where we're not, you know, an open

149
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,200
air business where anybody can walk in at

150
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:07,640
this point.

151
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,780
We've kind of set up a private club,

152
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,100
if you will, in the social media world

153
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,200
where it's like, hey, look, if you actually

154
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,900
pay, you can get in, but only people

155
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,500
that pay do.

156
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,700
So it's not just walk in randomly.

157
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,560
You sort of have to find it.

158
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,140
To the public.

159
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:22,660
Yeah.

160
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,360
I would never do a YouTube.

161
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,520
I'm not condoning.

162
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,640
Look, I was speaking to someone in a

163
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,360
small group the other day that has a

164
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,100
YouTube channel.

165
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,900
And I give a measurable offer of my

166
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,500
disdain of YouTube, what I really think of

167
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:39,600
it.

168
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,120
Because, you know me, years ago, even this

169
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,120
was around Ocelli in the Greek back 10

170
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,660
years ago.

171
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,120
It was 10 years ago, maybe more, about

172
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,560
10 years.

173
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,840
It is more.

174
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,040
It is more by now.

175
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,960
It is more than 10 now.

176
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:56,400
It's definitely over the 10 year mark for

177
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:56,620
sure.

178
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,620
More than a decade.

179
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,920
A decade, a tenth of a century.

180
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:00,300
Right?

181
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:00,820
Minimum.

182
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,880
Is another way to say it.

183
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,580
So a hundredth of a millennium.

184
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,280
But here's the thing.

185
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,400
You know what I did back in 2014

186
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:10,980
or 15?

187
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,820
I went and read.

188
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,220
What?

189
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,080
What did I read?

190
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:13,680
Guess what?

191
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,700
I went to YouTube terms and services and

192
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,600
all their community or whatever stuff.

193
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,020
And I said, I'm going to go sign

194
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,580
up for something like this.

195
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,460
This is like the most fascist, god awful,

196
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,820
mind control, passive aggressive.

197
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,720
What's the opposite of passive aggressive?

198
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,860
Aggressive aggressive.

199
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:35,420
Let's see.

200
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,040
That would be the shit I've ever seen.

201
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:37,720
Active.

202
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,000
Active passivity.

203
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:39,740
Right?

204
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:40,660
Active aggressive.

205
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,000
Yeah.

206
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,840
That's I would never do that.

207
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,260
I mean, and also Facebook.

208
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,640
I think I put like I was going

209
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,520
to sign up for Facebook.

210
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:48,980
I went in.

211
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,840
It was like Theo.

212
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,960
I did a pseudonym like Theo something.

213
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,180
And then I went and read the, I

214
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,060
said, wait a second, what are you doing?

215
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,020
Go read the full length, all the legal

216
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:57,240
stuff.

217
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,260
I was like, oh my gosh, oh my

218
00:06:59,260 --> 00:06:59,720
gosh.

219
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,340
You know what the hell?

220
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,980
I said, I would never do this ever,

221
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,540
ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever myself.

222
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,140
Now it doesn't mean I don't do interviews

223
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,520
or, you know, if you want to put

224
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,900
everything on YouTube, go ahead.

225
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,220
Like what Sam, he did Greek speak and

226
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,660
all that on YouTube and all that.

227
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,020
So fine.

228
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,120
I want nothing to do with it.

229
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,740
You know, I don't care if it goes

230
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,500
up to Mr. B.

231
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,380
East, you know, if you want to buy

232
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,860
me cigarettes and coffee, that's fine.

233
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,600
But, uh, no, uh, uh, that's why I

234
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,960
sold on do banking until I find someone

235
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,860
who wants to work with me.

236
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,940
You know, I don't want to be treated

237
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,660
like, you know, everyone's going to treat you

238
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,000
like an asshole anyway.

239
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,760
Why go into a trust agreement with someone

240
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,660
who tells you they are on paper?

241
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,080
Oh my God.

242
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,700
So no, I've got, there's nothing in the

243
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:41,940
chat.

244
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,140
I would, I would gladly.

245
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:44,780
I understand.

246
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,260
But I would gladly, uh, there's the joke

247
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:48,520
folks.

248
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,380
I would gladly do Mr. Beast though, because

249
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,340
that would be a collision of two worlds

250
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:58,440
that seemingly it's almost like this has never

251
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,060
been done before.

252
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,100
I'd love to see what would happen.

253
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,620
Uh, the, one of the most unthinking and

254
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,140
yet, you know, completely money driven circuit that

255
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:09,520
guy gives away houses, you know, uh, wild

256
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:09,760
stuff.

257
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:09,980
Yeah.

258
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,960
But I'm more of a, I'm more of

259
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,760
a diogenes.

260
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,980
Plato was crossing a bridge in a cart

261
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,520
and he saw diogenes under the river, washing

262
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,220
vegetables and Plato yells at him, Hey, diogenes,

263
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,900
we're going to go visit the King and

264
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:30,460
you're washing vegetables and, and he says, if

265
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,220
you knew how to wash vegetables, you wouldn't

266
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,460
have to go visit the King.

267
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,679
So that's my answer for the Mr. Beast

268
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,000
thing.

269
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,020
No, fair enough.

270
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,700
And uh, if you went to Mr. B

271
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,400
here, here's the thing.

272
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,179
I'm very personal.

273
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,900
If Mr. Beast invited you to his crib

274
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,320
and asked him, him to cook you a

275
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,420
meal, do you think it would be a

276
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,120
good meal or be total white, white people?

277
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:51,440
Shit.

278
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,160
Oh, I, I can't even imagine how bad

279
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:54,720
it would be.

280
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,060
It would ask him to make you some

281
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,520
pasta for zoo or something like that.

282
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,820
Would you know what it would be like?

283
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,420
The most horrible shit you'd, you would be,

284
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,200
yeah, run into the toilet and you wouldn't,

285
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,100
you wouldn't even be edible.

286
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:05,620
No Greek.

287
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,240
You'd be begging for the white people's shit

288
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,140
after what he puts in front of you.

289
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,020
Yeah.

290
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:10,340
Yeah.

291
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,540
To me.

292
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,760
So are we judging him?

293
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,280
So I judge people by their base character

294
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,420
on the, on stuff they can do.

295
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,680
Like when I meet someone and then people

296
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,880
ask me, how are they?

297
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,880
So, you know, I didn't think about, you

298
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,920
know, what did you think of so-and

299
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,060
-so?

300
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,300
I said, you know what, let me think

301
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:26,880
about it.

302
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,100
If they give up and if they invited

303
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,420
me over for a meal and they had

304
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,460
to cook me a meal, what would be

305
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,120
the outcome?

306
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,780
And that, and that's how I judged them,

307
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,860
by the way.

308
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,760
I know it sounds crazy.

309
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,560
So what you do, so then what are

310
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,400
they good for?

311
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,660
What are they good for?

312
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,640
And you pocket them there.

313
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,320
And so if someone asks me, well, how,

314
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,040
what do you think of them?

315
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:48,920
Well, they're good for this.

316
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,800
Very specific.

317
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:51,300
Okay.

318
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:51,800
Right.

319
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,880
Like, you know, even with people who's Chuck

320
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,620
O'Chell, he's got a good voice.

321
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,880
He's ready for prime time and I'm just

322
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,100
doing, he, you know, both of us speaking,

323
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,180
I'm this crazy guy and here's a guy

324
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,880
that was, you know, co-host and he

325
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,380
sounds like his voice sounds like it's ready

326
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,620
for prime time and that's it.

327
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,460
I don't say anything else.

328
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,160
Right.

329
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:09,640
Okay.

330
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:10,540
Right.

331
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,720
So anyway.

332
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,280
Okay.

333
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,700
My skill is, is talent.

334
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,260
You know, you, you don't ask a hammer

335
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,120
if it can handle the nail.

336
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,940
You just know it can and you use

337
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:19,840
it when you need a hammer.

338
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,980
What I do is I always point out

339
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:21,680
what I know.

340
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,200
Yeah.

341
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,680
Uh, I never thought about you cooking a

342
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,020
meal though.

343
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:25,980
Actually I never have.

344
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:26,540
Honestly.

345
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,740
I never really did.

346
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,420
I need a few more minutes on that

347
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,200
and I'll answer you for you to cook

348
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,560
a meal.

349
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,380
What would it be like?

350
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:35,600
But that's like a, um, a general overall

351
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,220
thing that I can imagine or, you know,

352
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,520
is, can the person handle the kitchen?

353
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,200
Well, see, that's, that's a lot, by the

354
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,860
way, there's a lot of cliches around the

355
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,460
kitchen, right?

356
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,020
Of course.

357
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,700
I, you know what, I think I have

358
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,520
the answer that you would give regarding me

359
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,420
cooking a meal for you.

360
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,160
I think you would, you would, uh, allow

361
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,680
it a little bit reluctantly, but only if

362
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,780
I did it in your kitchen.

363
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,360
Oh, I never thought, I don't think of

364
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,620
it in my kitchen, but that's fine.

365
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,100
Oh, well.

366
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:04,960
Theoretically.

367
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:05,520
Give me an example.

368
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,840
When I was out at the mines, when

369
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,940
I was out at the mines, uh, Placer

370
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,000
mines, uh, off of exit 10 and I

371
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,940
10 just before California on the right hand

372
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:21,600
side, north side, um, uh, everyone would work

373
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,800
and then they had to drive to the

374
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,220
Texaco or the nearest truck stop and get

375
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:25,800
hot dogs.

376
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,200
And this is like for a month straight

377
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,540
eat food at the truck stop.

378
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,120
And it was, it was more like a

379
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,960
seven 11 truck stop, not a sit down.

380
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,500
So microwave pizzas and all this stuff.

381
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,420
So whatever, whatever you can grab and go

382
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,100
and throw in a microwave and there are

383
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:46,260
things that are designed just burritos, burritos, hot

384
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:50,640
dogs, pizzas, singular hot pockets and no restaurants.

385
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,100
Yeah.

386
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:51,560
Singular.

387
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,300
Oh my gosh.

388
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,440
And so I had a bag of rice.

389
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,060
Yeah.

390
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,660
I had a bag of rice, bag of

391
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:00,580
beans, cans of beans, condensed milk, pots, camping

392
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,640
stove, veg.

393
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,600
I remember I had, it was winter time,

394
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,640
which means it's in the fifties, sixties and

395
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,100
seventies.

396
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,200
Um, I had one of those, uh, heads

397
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,200
of lettuce that you buy.

398
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:12,900
It's still growing.

399
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,280
It's in like on a plastic thing.

400
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,440
You know, it's like five bucks for a

401
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,140
little head of lettuce.

402
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:16,600
You're like, wow.

403
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,940
And it's still growing.

404
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:18,920
You turn it upside down.

405
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,340
It's got the root ball, a little bit

406
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,720
of one of these little maxi pads with

407
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,080
moisture.

408
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,520
I kept that thing alive on my dashboard

409
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,420
for a month.

410
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,640
So I would just take one or two

411
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,880
leaves of lettuce off and within a two,

412
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,080
two days after that, two more leaves would

413
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,700
start to blossom out.

414
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:33,980
Right.

415
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:34,720
Okay.

416
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,560
And I kept it going for, yeah.

417
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:36,960
Anyway.

418
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,640
So, um, yeah, I was going to bring

419
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,100
up the fruit, uh, aspect of it.

420
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:42,600
Okay.

421
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,180
Remember we, uh, two Sonics ago.

422
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:44,700
Yeah.

423
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,240
Okay.

424
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,460
So basically with fruit, you have a block,

425
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,600
you have the branch and, and you have

426
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,060
blossoms form on the stem.

427
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,680
Um, when the center of the blossom would

428
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,740
be like the, the female over ovary, let's

429
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,200
say, and it's fertile.

430
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,260
When the blossom is fertilized, the pedals fall

431
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:01,600
off.

432
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:06,080
Blossom essentially no longer serves a function, uh,

433
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,680
quickly in the center part expands in some

434
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,060
fruit.

435
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,040
The stem is the ovary or the stem

436
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,220
is the fallopian tube because the ovaries different

437
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:13,740
than the flow.

438
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,520
There's a technical, no, no, there's nothing in

439
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,160
of tubes, but no, the end of the,

440
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,680
the, where the stem, where the blossom is,

441
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,900
let's say is, uh, almost, um, on the

442
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,960
end of the female counterpart.

443
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:26,360
Okay.

444
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,900
So the blossom of the center, the center

445
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,520
of the blossom, I misunderstood not the pedals,

446
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,200
but the center.

447
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,520
Yeah.

448
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,860
Is that's pollinated.

449
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,360
Right.

450
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,380
When it's pollinated, it starts to become a

451
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,320
fruit very much like when a woman's ovum

452
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,600
or any other species is pollinated or fertilized.

453
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:43,900
Right.

454
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:44,260
Right.

455
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:48,360
What's interesting is, is the, you have an

456
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,900
umbilical cord, which is also by induction in

457
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,300
the human and in the animal, by the

458
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,920
way, they say nutrients go down the umbilical

459
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,220
cord.

460
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,520
But if you study what's in there, it's

461
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,340
mostly plasma, very, very little nutrients.

462
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,180
It's a type of plasma, just like we

463
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,600
spoke of that.

464
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,840
Um, if these medical quacks ever figured out

465
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,900
that all of the blood cells have serial

466
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:12,280
numbers on them to, or designation points, just

467
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,080
like you would put a designation and address,

468
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:14,800
right?

469
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,420
Like you see, they just see red blood

470
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:16,760
cells.

471
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,020
They don't know that this red blood cell

472
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:19,900
goes to your big toe.

473
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:20,840
This one goes to your eye.

474
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,940
This one goes to your ear.

475
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,220
This one might go to your brain if

476
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,820
it can, if it's good enough and it's

477
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,920
going to hang around long enough.

478
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,180
Right.

479
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,540
Um, they, they don't understand that they never

480
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,800
will, by the way, it's, it won't be

481
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,140
allowed.

482
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,640
Um, so back to the fruit.

483
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:41,340
The explanation that we're upside down plants, right,

484
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:46,160
again, takes hold, uh, but not, not as

485
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,320
a piece of fruit, but just the, the

486
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,960
overall archetype, these things are working through, but

487
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,760
back to the umbilical cord, the, the fruit

488
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,940
that grows on the end of the tree

489
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,720
is essentially growing from the most minuscule.

490
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,220
If you ever look at the stem that

491
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,340
the fruit hangs on, it is so narrow

492
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,540
and so thin and how much water develops

493
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,780
in the fruit.

494
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,200
It's on, it's an order of magnitude of

495
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,780
what can physically travel through that stem.

496
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,300
Nothing travels through that stem.

497
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,460
By the way, anyone, I think I want

498
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,020
once matter, if it was here, anyone who's

499
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,860
cut down a fresh tree, green tree, do

500
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,660
you see how tight the wood is?

501
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,600
Even softwood.

502
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,960
Do you see, can you imagine water migrating

503
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,920
down that branch that would, even though it

504
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,500
is porous?

505
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,120
No, it never happens.

506
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,540
So where does that water come from and

507
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,260
where, how does the fruit develop so robustly

508
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,000
with such massive water quantity, right?

509
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,580
And that's the, that's what I've been studying

510
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,660
because that's going to lead to a lot

511
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,120
of answers.

512
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,340
You see, years ago, I knew people in

513
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,440
the dead row chronology that were graduate degree

514
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:52,860
students.

515
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,640
They, they, I told them, I shooed them

516
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:55,880
away.

517
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,120
Just like when we have a neighbor whose

518
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,560
cats come over here to eat because we

519
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,580
have the good food and we brought it

520
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,840
up to her and she goes, just shoo

521
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,280
him away.

522
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:04,880
Just shoo him away.

523
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,860
Well, I had to shoo these graduate students,

524
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,000
particularly one away.

525
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,860
And the way I did that is I

526
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,900
said, you guys are learning about trees and

527
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,060
know everything about trees.

528
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:14,340
Right.

529
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,920
And I asked him, well, he said, yes.

530
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,020
I said, well, can you explain how one

531
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,400
blade of grass grows?

532
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,340
I'm on a cot.

533
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:21,620
Right.

534
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:22,480
Okay.

535
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,500
And he looked at me and says, how

536
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,440
dare you talk to an academic like he's

537
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:25,960
an asshole?

538
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:26,740
Because they don't know.

539
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,600
They don't know how even a blade of

540
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,760
grass, which is the simplest form, right?

541
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,960
So when you start to look at the

542
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,180
aspects of how water is produced by biological

543
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,560
and all that, a fruit is in your

544
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,800
face, like an exact, it's like a cartoon

545
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,760
version of what's happening in our bodies and

546
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,740
all living things.

547
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,200
You know what I mean?

548
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,620
By a cartoon caricature.

549
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,040
It's like certain features, uh, prominent are very

550
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,580
exaggerated, exaggerated.

551
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:55,680
Yeah.

552
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,640
So exaggeration and yet it's a very shallow

553
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,380
representation of something.

554
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,740
It's not the actual thing.

555
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:02,980
Right.

556
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:03,980
That's what I'm right.

557
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:04,400
Yeah.

558
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,940
The common denominator is what I'm looking for.

559
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,560
The fruit is just so much an exaggeration

560
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,319
of what's going on with induction and it

561
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,140
needs to be watched.

562
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,380
But I'm not talking about going, you know,

563
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,599
if you're an urbanist going to a supermarket

564
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,300
and the fruit that's already, I'm talking about

565
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,180
watching it grow.

566
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,040
Right.

567
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,980
So, um, yeah, I'm going to sit around

568
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,760
and watch paint dry.

569
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:24,920
Right.

570
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,060
Um, yeah.

571
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,380
Watching the fruit grow and the changes in

572
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,240
shape, color, density, all that stuff.

573
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,060
And we know it's extremely dense when it's

574
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,160
not ripe.

575
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,460
Right.

576
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,480
So, um, and green, you know, uh, the

577
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,680
hard, very, very, uh, very rigid, very, uh,

578
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:46,460
you know, uh, young in its presentation as

579
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:46,740
a fruit.

580
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,860
I mean, some fruits are like rocks, you

581
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,820
know, uh, in, in their characteristics.

582
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,220
Right.

583
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,900
But, um, it makes me wonder one thing

584
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,500
that red Fox, one thing in this red

585
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,780
Fox, why is money green?

586
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,740
Of course.

587
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,420
Uh, right.

588
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,120
Uh, good.

589
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,480
Good.

590
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,640
The Jews pick it before.

591
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:01,900
It's right.

592
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,300
Cause the Jews like to pick it when

593
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,480
it's before it's right.

594
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:04,740
Yeah.

595
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:04,980
Okay.

596
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,260
So the question though, that I have is

597
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,980
just real quick in this explanation, wouldn't a

598
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:13,200
cactus be even worse for, or more extreme

599
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,260
because you know, they, they give you this

600
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,380
weird explanation for how a cactus ends up,

601
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,620
you know, retaining water.

602
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,180
It's the same, but it's the same.

603
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,200
It doesn't read.

604
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:22,620
Okay.

605
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,840
It needs water.

606
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,040
Just like you need food.

607
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,600
You don't use it directly.

608
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,020
It doesn't transmit.

609
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,620
See, they're, they're trying to keep you in

610
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,280
a physical world that if you can't put

611
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:31,920
it in a beaker.

612
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,120
So if you need a certain amount of

613
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,280
nutrition, which is easy to figure out, you

614
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,960
don't have to cut anyone open or do

615
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,840
too much math.

616
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,260
You just lock up a bunch of people.

617
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,580
You feed this group of people, one ounce

618
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,300
of food a day.

619
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,020
The other one, two ounces, all the way

620
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,980
up to 30 ounces, 40, 60 ounces, you

621
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,540
got 60 groups of people and you see

622
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,360
who does best.

623
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,640
And then that would be the average of

624
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,220
how many ounces of food you need every

625
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:54,500
day.

626
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:54,780
Right?

627
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,940
Well, that's using easy to do a study

628
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,860
like that, but that's using ounces and literal

629
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,160
weight as a scale.

630
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,620
That's not the only, right?

631
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,080
Yeah.

632
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,980
So once you get, so let's say we,

633
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,980
we figure out it's 16 ounces a day.

634
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,180
You do, by the way, you need two

635
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,500
pounds of water and one pound of food

636
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,740
for each prisoner.

637
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,120
Or if you're going to keep people in

638
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,760
a confined area, you must supply them a

639
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:16,940
minute.

640
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,940
It's the minimum 16 ounces of food, solid

641
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,620
and 32 ounces of water a day.

642
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,360
So if you had a thousand people, you

643
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,140
need a thousand pounds of food a day

644
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:30,560
and 2000, uh, what would do the math?

645
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,180
That's a quarter.

646
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,860
Um, uh, so you'd need 250 gallons of

647
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,120
water a day for a thousand people.

648
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,080
So, um, yeah.

649
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,520
So if you guys plan on keeping any

650
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,360
prisoners anytime soon, there's their math.

651
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,500
So what I'm trying to say is all

652
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,580
that food, let's say 16 ounces a day,

653
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,580
they, they, they don't acknowledge anything unless you

654
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,060
put it in a beaker, right?

655
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,920
And you can measure it.

656
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,120
So if the people need to survive 16

657
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,940
ounces of food, you put that in a

658
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,640
package and you say, okay, how does this

659
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,220
food get into their body?

660
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:03,640
Right.

661
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,660
And if you do the math, um, they

662
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,300
eat all the food and then you measure

663
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,460
what they excrete through feces and urine.

664
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:15,080
You'll see a very tiny amount about, um,

665
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,580
the majority, the majority is out like three

666
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,360
quarters of it.

667
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:24,200
Can I, can I leave a question in

668
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:24,900
the year real quick?

669
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,960
Because it relates exactly to, it's a direct

670
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,360
question from somebody that relates exactly to what

671
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:30,720
you're saying.

672
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,600
Um, they wanted to know that since calories

673
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,820
are an invalid way of measuring things, they

674
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,660
see we are logic there and understand and

675
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,260
acknowledge it.

676
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,780
Uh, they were wondering if there is a

677
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,200
way to calibrate it because it seems as

678
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,940
though it would take, uh, more than one,

679
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,700
uh, more than one, let me see what

680
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,120
it says here.

681
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,780
More than, oh, hold on.

682
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,160
Hold on.

683
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,580
Let me, let me finish my thought and

684
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,660
then we'll finish the question.

685
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,240
Is that all right?

686
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:57,820
Certainly.

687
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,780
Let's just, we'll make this very fractional.

688
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,120
Okay.

689
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,460
So if you look at the percentage of

690
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,680
how much, how little actually is taken into

691
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,840
the body and then you write, do the

692
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,440
math, is it where, well, we don't really

693
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,380
need that much then.

694
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:09,620
Right?

695
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,400
We do because the body is very selective

696
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,820
in extracting energy and that amount that is,

697
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,220
does not come out of the body actually

698
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:17,980
is converted.

699
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,320
It's called link low, low energy nuclear reaction

700
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,160
and L E N R.

701
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,420
So you could look that up.

702
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,180
Um, there's it because it's induction.

703
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,520
In other words, the material aspect turns into

704
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,400
energy and then turns back into material in

705
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,860
the body, very selectively in cells and other

706
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,440
things that have to happen that way.

707
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:39,700
Right?

708
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,680
So you can't put that in a beaker,

709
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,580
right?

710
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,560
That's why very often people would ask me

711
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,480
about technology.

712
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,280
I'm not impressed until I can, well, during

713
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,420
the days of the fax machine, isn't this

714
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:51,600
great?

715
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,060
We got fat.

716
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,020
I'm not impressed until you could fax someone

717
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:54,920
a turkey sandwich.

718
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,840
If you can fax me a turkey sandwich,

719
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,820
then I'll be impressed.

720
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,840
If you, and then it became, if you

721
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,900
can email me and eat a turkey sandwich,

722
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,880
I'll be impressed or peanut butter and jelly

723
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,340
sandwich.

724
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,480
Now, right now, if you can, are you

725
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,400
impressed by that?

726
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,180
No.

727
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,420
If you could send me a peanut butter

728
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,780
and jelly sandwich on zoom or teams, I'll

729
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,240
be impressed.

730
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,540
I'm not impressed by any of this because

731
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:18,560
it's still using quantities, but right here's the

732
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,580
part that I never really get into is

733
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:24,620
perturbations in the ether and the wire in

734
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,100
the air.

735
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,580
The signal is not physical at all.

736
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,440
There's no electrons moving anywhere and we're using

737
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:30,960
it.

738
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:34,520
It's in our faces that we're using non

739
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,780
-material energies constantly to produce pictures on the

740
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,460
screen, information and all that.

741
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,900
But they have, they will not bridge the

742
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,700
gap only with maybe 3d printers or a

743
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,740
fax machine as a page.

744
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,900
You can use something you could print.

745
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,000
They will not bridge the gap and be

746
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,860
able to teleport you something through the airwaves

747
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,620
or the wire.

748
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,500
They, you're not allowed to do that.

749
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,000
That is a big, big no, no.

750
00:22:59,160 --> 00:22:59,280
Yeah.

751
00:22:59,400 --> 00:22:59,820
I object.

752
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,060
I object to your even calling a 3d

753
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,860
printer or something as a step forward because

754
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:06,460
it's no different than the transmission of what

755
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,020
was a Xerox, which is not the same

756
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,060
as a photocopy, but when they used to

757
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,840
be able to transmit Xerox, you have to

758
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,620
load it with something.

759
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,860
Not only that, but you're sending information from

760
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,900
one device to another and telling another device

761
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,360
to do it.

762
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,600
So literally a 3d printer, you load crap

763
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,040
into it and it's preloaded the Xerox machine

764
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:23,360
or the three.

765
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,340
So you have to put material.

766
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:27,360
I'm talking about the actual material taking form

767
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,560
from what was sent through the wire or

768
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,160
the airwaves.

769
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,220
That will never happen.

770
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,960
The 3d printer is no different than the

771
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,760
fax machine or the teletype before it because

772
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,340
it's only telling a device that has the

773
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:42,980
material elsewhere to recreate something similar through a

774
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,280
signal.

775
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,540
So the only thing that's been transmitted is

776
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:45,980
the signal.

777
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,080
Run out of paper.

778
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:47,440
Yeah.

779
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,080
The fax machine runs out of paper 3d.

780
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:49,400
Yeah.

781
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:49,820
No, no.

782
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,720
So, okay.

783
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,720
I went through this whole diatribe.

784
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,260
All we need is, in other words, we're

785
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,780
never going to get the transporter, right?

786
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,600
For Star Trek or you see it in

787
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,760
sci-fi, it exists.

788
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,480
It's not that difficult to do if you

789
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,460
copy biology, right?

790
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,580
Pouring a coffee here, if you'd like some.

791
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,680
So it's not that difficult to do.

792
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,940
What's difficult is the mind.

793
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,940
You know, it's just like, um, um, John

794
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:16,180
C.

795
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,340
Lilly, the province of the mind has no

796
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,320
limits other than the limits we set upon

797
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:20,740
it.

798
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:21,460
Right?

799
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,680
So the whole thing is about limiting.

800
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:24,300
Right.

801
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,800
So what you're saying is thus far, all

802
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,360
we have thus far, all we have is

803
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,480
the transmittal of information and telling another device

804
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,680
to recreate something.

805
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,100
And it doesn't matter, by the way, if

806
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,880
it's a radio, even when I send my

807
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,900
voice across from one radio to another, my

808
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,900
radio is telling the other radio speaker, recreate

809
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,680
my voice.

810
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,600
Now it happens quickly, but basically that's not

811
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,180
my voice actually over there.

812
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,220
That's a recreation of my voice on that

813
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:50,420
speaker.

814
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,220
Right?

815
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:51,820
Sure.

816
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,440
But, but here, let's, let me just take

817
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,380
it another step further.

818
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:57,080
The bandwidth required, you have an empty box

819
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,800
and when you send someone a signal, you're

820
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,680
going to need the peanut butter jelly sandwich

821
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,040
on your end, right?

822
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,620
It disappears on your end and it's reappearing

823
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,340
on my end.

824
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,520
We have the bandwidth for that, right?

825
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,740
We have the bandwidth and the connectivity for

826
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:14,280
that was what I'm saying, but the device

827
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,200
necessary to completely turn that peanut butter and

828
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,420
jelly sandwich into energy and send it to

829
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:23,580
me is more difficult than what the body

830
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,160
is doing.

831
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,040
Because otherwise, if he, if it was, if

832
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,740
it copied the body, you'd put the peanut

833
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:32,320
butter and jelly sandwich in the transporter and

834
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,000
it would turn into feces, right?

835
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,860
But 20% of it would be gone

836
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,680
coming over the signal.

837
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,580
And then on my end, it would end

838
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,100
up as a, as a, a peanut butter

839
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,180
and jelly sandwich facsimile, like goo and only

840
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,460
20% of it.

841
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,480
Are you, are you with me?

842
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,860
So these things, the reason I said this,

843
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,900
whoever's following what I'm saying is going to

844
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,900
be, holy shit, Greek, you think too much.

845
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,480
No, I don't think too much.

846
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,360
Get that out of your head.

847
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,640
We were not thinking correctly, right?

848
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,420
So we don't want to follow the human

849
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,380
body directly.

850
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:06,920
Right?

851
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,760
Imagine that.

852
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,000
Right?

853
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,500
So we want the whole peanut butter and

854
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,180
jelly sandwich to be sent over.

855
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:19,240
So anyway, okay, well, so the question about

856
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,680
calories, let me just do a recap.

857
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,120
It's a unit of measurement has to pertain

858
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,900
to the, let's say the physicality of what

859
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,800
you're talking about.

860
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,100
Right?

861
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,060
So if someone says, you know, cut me

862
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,780
a board, uh, 23 inches long, you don't

863
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,280
say how many pounds of that do you,

864
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,460
do you want, right?

865
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,140
It doesn't work.

866
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,260
So a calorie is defined by a thermal

867
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,840
unit calories, actually a thermal unit.

868
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:42,760
We've been so brainwashed.

869
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,960
You think it has something to do with

870
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,700
food, right?

871
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,560
It's a thermal unit.

872
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:49,020
That's that metric that is the amount of

873
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,220
thermal units that are required, a thermal unit

874
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,580
to raise one gram of water, one degree

875
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,040
Celsius, right?

876
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,820
Um, or one cubic centimeter of water, one

877
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,540
degree Celsius.

878
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,760
And I got, there's a joke about it

879
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,800
and if you read old encyclopedias anyway, so

880
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,640
that's all it is.

881
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,940
So what they, the calorimeter is very, there's

882
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,540
several ways of doing it, but what they

883
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,600
do, they want to find out how many

884
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,540
calories are in a banana.

885
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:14,080
They put it in this tube when they

886
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,260
purge, they seal it and there's a valve

887
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:16,660
on there.

888
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,160
They pull a vacuum and then they purge

889
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:18,880
it with oxygen.

890
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,240
So it's pure oxygen in there.

891
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,020
There's something that looks like a spark plug

892
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,840
and they go boom.

893
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:26,300
And the banana turns to ash, completely burned

894
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:26,600
off.

895
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,880
And that whole device is submerged in a

896
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,740
given volume of water, how many, exactly how

897
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,600
many grams of water.

898
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,360
And they do the math.

899
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,880
What was the temperature change in the water?

900
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,040
There's so many grams divided.

901
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,100
This is how many calories.

902
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,980
It's very, very old experiment, right?

903
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,300
Now that's why they say you're burning up

904
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:44,640
calories.

905
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,500
The body doesn't work that way.

906
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,880
Now if you find yourself, the joke here

907
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,340
is if you find yourself pooping charcoal briquettes

908
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:57,260
or ash, then calories apply to you, right?

909
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,020
And I don't think anyone ever has.

910
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:03,320
So calories is a misnomer for applying to

911
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:03,680
food.

912
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,560
Because if you eat a banana, let's say

913
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,920
it's 70 calories, and you poop past that

914
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,400
banana, is that poop ignitable and burnable in

915
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,300
that calorimeter?

916
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:12,960
Sure is.

917
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,960
And if you do the math, you're going

918
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,260
to see they only used a small portion

919
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:17,500
of it.

920
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,840
The rest of it is still in this,

921
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:19,980
right?

922
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:23,060
Anyway, so calories do not work at all.

923
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:23,940
It's a misnomer.

924
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,980
And they put this stuff in front of

925
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:26,240
you.

926
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,440
And there's a book written, there's a lady

927
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,960
in the 1920s who came up that we

928
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,920
should apply this to food, right?

929
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:33,920
Some idiot.

930
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:38,200
And so because of that bitch, we got

931
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,180
a misnomer, just like the food pyramid and

932
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,060
some other idiot, right?

933
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,520
So anyway, I hope that answers roundabout and

934
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,120
gives an example to people.

935
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,180
But would you finish that question, by the

936
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:50,320
way?

937
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,020
Yeah, sure.

938
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,200
The question, I'm boiling this down real fast

939
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,700
because it will be better off.

940
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,060
They're basically saying, look, if you take one

941
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,040
of these ways of measuring, you would obviously

942
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:05,000
need more than one because 100 pounds of

943
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,640
brick is definitely not useful in the same

944
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,340
way that 100 pounds of rice is, or

945
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,360
et cetera.

946
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:16,000
So the quality and some of the characteristics

947
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,700
of what it is you're doing.

948
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,620
So they're saying, is there more than one

949
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,480
measurement that could be useful here?

950
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:26,160
Like say one or two ways of measuring

951
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,360
something that would create the thing that they

952
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,340
say is useful as a calorie count.

953
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,520
And you said- There is, but it's

954
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,160
not calories.

955
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:34,540
Yes.

956
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:35,280
Right.

957
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,920
It's not calories for sure for anything alive.

958
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:41,000
Calories are only for when they invented the

959
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,620
calorimeter.

960
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,220
That's it.

961
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,220
It's only for that.

962
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,120
And they're trying to apply.

963
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,480
Just like I put up the thing about

964
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,580
blood glucose measurement, they still don't know how

965
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,240
to do it, right?

966
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,220
But they're condemning millions of people with their

967
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:52,660
treatments.

968
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,280
And it's deliberate, by the way.

969
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,160
And as part of the conversation, look, you

970
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,320
can poop charcoal if you ate charcoal.

971
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,720
That's possible.

972
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,940
Yeah, there's no conversion, but if you measure

973
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,480
the amount of charcoal you ate and the

974
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,960
amount you pooped, it would be identical.

975
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,980
That's which leads to, is it biocompatible?

976
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:14,280
Years ago, I had a prized chess set,

977
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,720
checkers, sorry, and one of my sisters was

978
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,020
a real nag.

979
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,520
She's about four years younger at the time,

980
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,480
and she grabbed a couple of checkers pieces

981
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,340
and swallowed them.

982
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,480
She goes, you can't play now.

983
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,220
So what we did was we made sure

984
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,560
that the big brother had to go through,

985
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,880
you know what, to pick out and clean

986
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:36,380
off the undigested corn and chess pieces.

987
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:39,940
How much by eating that plastic did you

988
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:40,300
gain?

989
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:40,920
Right?

990
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:41,940
None.

991
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,020
Now, you didn't gain anything, any nutrition.

992
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,660
There's certain things that, for example, you ever

993
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,460
heard of something called margarine?

994
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,540
Your body will poop 100% of that.

995
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,960
That's alien.

996
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,720
That's just like eating plastic.

997
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,380
So if you ate a tub, an ounce

998
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,180
of margarine, you would poop out an ounce

999
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:01,720
of margarine.

1000
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,820
There's no use for it.

1001
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,900
Only some moisture would come out.

1002
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,340
There's a bunch of foods out there.

1003
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,500
As a matter of fact, you know, most

1004
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:14,580
of the things added to American foods would

1005
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,340
be, if they were not added to food,

1006
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:19,020
they would be considered hazardous substances if used

1007
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,660
anywhere else, right?

1008
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,640
So you could put as much of it

1009
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,840
as you want in the food, but if

1010
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,840
you're going to drop some on the sidewalk,

1011
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,100
it's an EPA violation, right?

1012
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,200
So the same was with water.

1013
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:36,620
The EPA had water toxicity parameters, and if

1014
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,920
you had water that exceeded these parameters, it

1015
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,680
was a violation.

1016
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:43,200
But if you look at an assay or

1017
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,380
a lab report of the water in Phoenix,

1018
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,640
Arizona, it was worse than the water that

1019
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,380
they called you a violator for if you

1020
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,620
just dropped it on the sidewalk.

1021
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,920
The hypocrisy.

1022
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,840
But it's still going on.

1023
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,440
Anyway, I would say that the easiest thing

1024
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,140
to understand, it's not quantity, it's quality.

1025
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:05,500
So what you do to measure what you're

1026
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,640
going to eat is by first seasonality.

1027
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,360
If it's hot outside where you are, and

1028
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,460
it's going to be hot outside, because that's

1029
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:17,040
a predominant, it's not just heat, because it

1030
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,620
could be wintertime and you could be in

1031
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,920
an overly heated office.

1032
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,640
You've heard of people, especially when it's hot

1033
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,100
outside, oh, they over AC.

1034
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:27,300
I've walked into, it's 110 degrees here.

1035
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,320
You walk into some big stores and it's

1036
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,640
like a refrigerator, right?

1037
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,560
I'm talking about the predominant energy.

1038
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,820
So when it's winter season, you don't want

1039
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,840
to eat things that come from a hot

1040
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,780
climate because it's going to convert into your

1041
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:45,700
body and change your blood type, quality into,

1042
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,420
not type, but blood quality, maybe effect on

1043
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:51,280
the type, to being in the tropics and

1044
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,320
you won't be able to warm up.

1045
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,360
The opposite is true.

1046
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,200
If you're in a hot climate and you

1047
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,380
eat things that come from cold climates like

1048
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,960
salmon, you will not be able to cool

1049
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,140
down.

1050
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,760
Do you remember when there was the big

1051
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,400
salmon craze 20 years ago?

1052
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,660
It's good for you, eat it, and then

1053
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,420
they killed it because they said they put

1054
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,160
color in it.

1055
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,500
They killed it by turning it so they

1056
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,980
could see if they could control you.

1057
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,000
I would walk into people's homes here in

1058
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,540
the desert and they had the AC turned

1059
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,460
down to 65 and they were still sweating.

1060
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,380
For me, I keep the AC at 80

1061
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:24,780
or whatever, and it was because, I said,

1062
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,880
you're eating tropical, you're eating Arctic fish.

1063
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,580
Oh, I love it.

1064
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,220
In the middle of summer in Tucson, that's

1065
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,140
the worst thing you can do.

1066
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,960
That's the first thing you can do.

1067
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,520
There's no quantity there.

1068
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,460
Get away from the quantity.

1069
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,940
It's the quality of what you're doing.

1070
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,500
Obviously, in most cases, the quantity will be

1071
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,700
based on your size.

1072
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,980
If you had people that were a foot

1073
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,960
tall and you were to go buy a

1074
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,960
dinner plate set for them, remember, they're only

1075
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,380
12 inches tall, the whole human.

1076
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,480
You were going to go buy a dinner

1077
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,320
set for them.

1078
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,860
By the way, I was in Los Lunas,

1079
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,620
New Mexico, 10 years ago, and there was

1080
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:03,820
a little old lady going through Walmart and

1081
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:07,340
she was buying little doll sets, little cups

1082
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,560
and plates and stuff.

1083
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:09,880
I said, oh, it's for your granddaughter?

1084
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,300
She goes, no, it's for the little people.

1085
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,159
She has little people visiting her.

1086
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:18,260
Anyway, yeah, so if you know someone or

1087
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,500
a family that's only 12 or 14 inches

1088
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,940
tall and you wanted to buy them a

1089
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,840
dinner plate set, you know what the dinner

1090
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,179
plate set would look like, right?

1091
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,060
Real small, right?

1092
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:27,620
Yeah, sure.

1093
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,600
You'd fill up that little tiny plate with

1094
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,280
food and they would be very satisfied, wouldn't

1095
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:33,520
they?

1096
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,460
Mm-hmm.

1097
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,219
Right?

1098
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:38,920
Now, we got someone that's 12 feet tall

1099
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:42,159
and the dinner plate looks like a big

1100
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,400
banquet plate, two feet in diameter.

1101
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,040
You have to fill that for them to

1102
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,719
get satisfied.

1103
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,179
You get my point?

1104
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:51,020
The bigger you are, the more food you're

1105
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,239
probably going to require.

1106
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:54,219
The smaller you are, the less.

1107
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,440
So that's the quantitative aspect, yeah?

1108
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:01,140
That's the only quantitative, but the main overarching

1109
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:05,360
thing is seasonality, and squeeze in between quantity

1110
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,840
and quality, the seasonality would be the type

1111
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,420
of energy.

1112
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:15,080
When I start discussing energy with people, which

1113
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,560
I did recently, they didn't understand.

1114
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,980
They got the seasonal thing.

1115
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,800
You have to be completely brain dead to

1116
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,100
not get the seasonality.

1117
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:27,060
Usually when you bring up the seasonality metaphor,

1118
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,640
it rings a bell with mostly everyone, right?

1119
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,420
Unless they're already on a negation, they're like,

1120
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,380
oh no, anything this guy says, I'm going

1121
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,480
to say the opposite, right?

1122
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,520
So there's people like that also.

1123
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:43,000
The other thing I start out with is,

1124
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:47,040
I went to this restaurant, and the food

1125
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,080
was salty that I ordered.

1126
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,880
A simple dish, and the person that was

1127
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,560
with me, their food was salty also.

1128
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,620
Everything was salty.

1129
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,840
Waitress comes and says, how's everything?

1130
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,300
I said, everything's really salty.

1131
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,120
The cook has a sweet tooth, doesn't he?

1132
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,400
She goes, yeah, he does.

1133
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,240
He's always eating candy bars and cake and

1134
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:07,600
dessert.

1135
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,420
How do you know?

1136
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,360
How do you know?

1137
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:14,060
Well, because he's got a sweet tooth, he's

1138
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:16,560
loading up on sugars, and in order to

1139
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,880
balance that, he's putting the salt that he

1140
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,680
should be taking to balance him out into

1141
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,880
everybody else's food.

1142
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,620
Now what kind of balance is that?

1143
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,580
Is that really making balance, or is that

1144
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:32,260
the universal principles trying to make balance, but

1145
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,560
it's screwing everything up because the person is

1146
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,580
overdoing the sweets?

1147
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,520
Well, they're doing the right thing, but they're

1148
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,280
applying it to themselves.

1149
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,660
They're applying something to themselves to others.

1150
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,500
They should be applying it to themselves, but

1151
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,100
they're applying it to everyone else also.

1152
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,760
Who knows if they were also eating, but

1153
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,140
they were dishing it out.

1154
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:52,360
So even though the universal principle was still

1155
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,980
overall satisfied, it was causing chaos in our

1156
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,640
realm, you see?

1157
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:02,500
So it's like when you're wealthy enough, going

1158
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,820
to the Super Bowl is not a thrill,

1159
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,380
right?

1160
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:10,220
Having personal hunting parties where, what's a personal

1161
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:10,920
hunting party?

1162
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,940
Okay, they even did a movie that was

1163
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,040
released and then withdrawn.

1164
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,620
When you see homeless people disappearing, what they

1165
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,940
do, they have these vans, they pick them

1166
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,680
up, they offer you money, food, or whatever,

1167
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,060
they take you to a place where they

1168
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,560
clean you up, have you do some rudimentary

1169
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:26,980
exercise.

1170
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,040
They feed you, they promise you money and

1171
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,500
all that.

1172
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,580
Then they take you to another place and

1173
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,820
they tell you, give you some rudimentary weapons,

1174
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,760
and they tell you, run.

1175
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,540
Just run.

1176
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,720
Okay, do I need to get more detail

1177
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,280
on this?

1178
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,300
Okay.

1179
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,760
I think you can put that together.

1180
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:44,120
Yeah.

1181
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:44,900
Okay.

1182
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,240
So the Super Bowl doesn't do it.

1183
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,240
Human hunting parties don't do it for you.

1184
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,620
Hey, how about we get a bunch of

1185
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,840
journalists ready and we go start a war?

1186
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,940
Because every war is started, then the reason

1187
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,500
for it comes later, right?

1188
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,880
War is propagated, right?

1189
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,560
Now, that's a lot more fun because there

1190
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,960
you can do more wagering, death pool betting,

1191
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:07,780
and all that kind of stuff on a

1192
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,400
big scale.

1193
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,180
And that's what's going on, by the way,

1194
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,500
on a big scale.

1195
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,920
So when you see war, you're actually supporting

1196
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,120
it by watching football because you're just a

1197
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,760
scaled out, you know, your sport competition thing

1198
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,900
and your political competition, there's just a bunch

1199
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,700
of wealthy people.

1200
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,620
I just like to see what happens when

1201
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:28,400
you bring mayhem into another, right?

1202
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:31,440
Anyway, make a long story short, and without

1203
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,200
getting philosophical, the quality will never be beat

1204
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,900
by quantity, right?

1205
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:43,040
Like, for example, go get Hermes green crocodile

1206
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,520
handbag, it's 100k, right?

1207
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:49,780
How many handbags, purses, can you buy reasonable

1208
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,240
ones for 100,000?

1209
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,900
So let's say a reasonable handbag is like

1210
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,380
200 bucks, a quality one, let's say 400,

1211
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,220
500, right?

1212
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:03,300
Yeah, top shelf, 500 bucks should cover a

1213
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,680
coach purse, say, yeah, go ahead.

1214
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,740
Yeah, you can get a coach, I remember

1215
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,360
a coach, like you can get, yeah, for

1216
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,220
like 250, you get a pretty decent one.

1217
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,320
But so let's say 500, right?

1218
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:17,140
That's 200 purses for the cost of one,

1219
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:18,380
right?

1220
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:18,780
Why?

1221
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,260
You see, why does it stand out so

1222
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:21,840
much, right?

1223
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,480
Now here's the thing, if you had the

1224
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,180
same exact quality as that 100,000 dollar

1225
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:32,160
purse at the 500 dollar level, it's the

1226
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,220
same thing, isn't it?

1227
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,160
It is.

1228
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:37,000
You know, the perception is different, and that's

1229
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,460
exactly what quality does.

1230
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:42,140
Once you become quality-minded, you actually live

1231
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:42,860
on the cheap.

1232
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,440
Living on the cheap means you're not expending

1233
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:51,240
energy, wasting energy, worrying, being ill, right?

1234
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:54,440
So when you understand quality, real quality, not

1235
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:58,080
perceived quality and what's social, you know, so

1236
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,500
what do they call it when you buy

1237
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,800
an expensive handbag to show off or whatever,

1238
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,520
right, or expensive car, right?

1239
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,380
If you want the quality, you don't care

1240
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,900
about the price or whatever, you can do

1241
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,220
it on the cheap, right?

1242
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,320
So this is really where it's at, and

1243
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,620
they're not going to ever, this is never

1244
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,400
going to be public.

1245
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,780
You know, there's people that buy expensive cars

1246
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,860
and drive around like on the main streets

1247
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,200
at night where everybody is, so everyone could

1248
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,680
look at their car, and I always point,

1249
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,500
you know, people look.

1250
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,740
I said, look, this guy is out here

1251
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:33,260
driving senselessly, you know, obviously he's trying to

1252
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:35,500
get attention in his Ferrari, and he invested

1253
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,220
all that.

1254
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,060
He might enjoy driving it, but he's doing

1255
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:38,900
what he's doing now.

1256
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,860
So people who don't care about him at

1257
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,120
all will give him attention.

1258
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:46,220
What kind of a pathetic state, spiritual state

1259
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:46,600
is that?

1260
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,460
Could you imagine doing something to get attention

1261
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,680
from people who don't care about you at

1262
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:51,920
all?

1263
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,320
Wow, what a twisted world, right?

1264
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,380
What a twisted reality, which is very common,

1265
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:57,860
by the way.

1266
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,780
How many times have you been on the

1267
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,800
strip at night and see guys just coasting

1268
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,000
in their very expensive cars, and everyone's pointing

1269
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,360
at the Lamborghini, Ferrari, Rolls-Royce, or whatever,

1270
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:06,820
right?

1271
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:10,140
A lot of people call it a penis

1272
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:13,060
substitute or a midlife crisis mobile or whatever,

1273
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,360
because what they're doing is...

1274
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,260
The bottom line is, though, they're getting attention

1275
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,060
from people who don't care at all about

1276
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:20,280
them.

1277
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:20,840
Oh, right.

1278
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,940
The bottom line is, yeah.

1279
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,400
So the thing is, when you understand what

1280
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,960
you should be caring about, you'll find out

1281
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,640
you can do it really on the cheap.

1282
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,200
I mean, it doesn't...

1283
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,240
You can live...

1284
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,720
Okay, let's just...

1285
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,720
You can have an exceptionally high-quality life,

1286
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,480
full of, like, high level of fitness, vibrancy,

1287
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:45,520
you know, what they call health, and be

1288
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,720
joyful on the level of any other qualitative

1289
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,680
thing you can measure it by, right?

1290
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,140
On the real cheap, almost just at the

1291
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,940
same level as it would be, quote-unquote,

1292
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:00,240
what normal expenditures would be, whether it's your

1293
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,220
food, your clothes, all this stuff you can

1294
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:03,580
get.

1295
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:07,460
Always seek quality over the quantity, because I

1296
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,980
think when you have the car that we

1297
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:13,220
just mentioned, cruising, or the Hermes green crocodile

1298
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:19,140
handbag, or these Rolex watches or whatever, that

1299
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:21,780
is no longer just a qualitative statement, because

1300
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:24,880
let's say a $10,000 Rolex watch with

1301
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,900
the jewels and the stainless steel, that's about

1302
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,860
less than $200 worth of material.

1303
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:32,100
Why not just get a $200 watch that

1304
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,940
tells time just as well as a Rolex?

1305
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,580
You see, so now you have the quality

1306
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,620
timekeeping, right?

1307
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,620
So you can do a very high-quality

1308
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:46,840
existence on the cheap, is really where it's

1309
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,920
at, being here, because the rest of it

1310
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,400
is just a waste of time or getting

1311
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,480
attention from people who don't care about you

1312
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:53,800
at all.

1313
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,920
And I think that's one of the cruxes

1314
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,580
of what I speak on, right?

1315
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,580
We kind of went into a short thing

1316
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:03,340
about home economics, how you should set up

1317
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:05,980
your home and things like that.

1318
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,660
Anyone can do that, right?

1319
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:11,380
And you'll probably be healthier and better fitness.

1320
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,080
I have to use that word health, because

1321
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,760
when I say fitness, most people are still

1322
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,060
wrong.

1323
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:17,020
How many miles did I do on the

1324
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:17,780
treadmill today?

1325
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,040
Did I go to the gym, right?

1326
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:20,960
How many push-ups can I do?

1327
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,720
So, you know, be optimum.

1328
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:28,220
So you cannot optimize with quantity when you're

1329
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:30,480
dealing with your own situation.

1330
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,200
You have to optimize the quality first, right?

1331
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,800
Before you order something up, you should know,

1332
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,240
is it the right thing that I'm ordering?

1333
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,740
And there is a better way to do

1334
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:41,900
it.

1335
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,900
Anyway, you got any other questions or anything?

1336
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,120
Sure, I do.

1337
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,780
The last part of that whole question, though,

1338
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:50,080
and a long thing that they put in

1339
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,720
is, they were making a joke and said,

1340
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,560
according to them, I should just be able

1341
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,620
to eat dirt and do just fine because

1342
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,080
all the nutrients are in the dirt.

1343
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,560
No, but they're making a joke, where it's

1344
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,300
like, why not just eat dirt?

1345
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:02,780
Does it work that way?

1346
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,740
Is it biocompatible?

1347
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,940
And it would be too active.

1348
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,860
Dirt is too active.

1349
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:13,480
Like if you eat, there's certain cheeses now,

1350
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,360
like I used to like Maytag blue cheese,

1351
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:19,580
and they spray it with bacillus, which is

1352
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:21,800
the stuff that you find that they say

1353
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,240
causes the cold and all that.

1354
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,660
And it was just, I had some recently,

1355
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,280
and they don't ship it to hot climates

1356
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,280
in the summer.

1357
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:31,700
It's like $50 a pound or $30 a

1358
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,260
pound Maytag cheese when you get it here.

1359
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,400
And oh my gosh, they really messed it

1360
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:36,560
up.

1361
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,400
And I looked up online what they were

1362
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,620
doing, and the younger people took over.

1363
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:44,480
They're spraying too much bacillus, basically bacteria on

1364
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,400
it for their packaging.

1365
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,920
And it really upset my stomach.

1366
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:47,920
It was too active.

1367
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,900
Called the culture was just too strong.

1368
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:52,660
And I've had beer like that.

1369
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,200
I don't know if you've ever been around

1370
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:57,820
people who do brew their own beer, and

1371
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,020
they just quite didn't heat it up enough.

1372
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:01,780
And the yeast was a little too strong,

1373
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:04,320
and I was burping, farting, and hiccuping all

1374
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,300
at the same time.

1375
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,400
Because it was just that yeast was still

1376
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,140
too active.

1377
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:08,800
Yeah, right.

1378
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,280
This microbrewery, guys, it feels like somebody's trying

1379
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,160
to blow air directly into your gut is

1380
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,900
what it feels like, because it's like it's

1381
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:16,680
constantly expanding.

1382
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,440
If it's not done, yeah.

1383
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,980
So yeah, it's bubbling.

1384
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,240
It's like, oh my gosh.

1385
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:22,720
Especially when you hit the dark cavity in

1386
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,620
your body at that 98.6 mixed in

1387
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:26,340
with everything else.

1388
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:28,740
So when you eat dirt, unless it's really

1389
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:31,380
sandy, you're going to experience a very active

1390
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:34,000
thing, and you will get something out of

1391
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:34,500
it all right.

1392
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,300
Now, not all dirt is the same.

1393
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,740
The most dirt, by the way, is mostly

1394
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:42,360
silica sand, even though it doesn't look like

1395
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:42,560
it.

1396
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,280
It's a very high amount of mineral and

1397
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,920
metal and quartz and things like that.

1398
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,120
So you're not going to get anything out

1399
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:49,320
of it.

1400
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,080
But the reason I went through all that

1401
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,000
is because there's no such thing as a

1402
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:53,720
bad question.

1403
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,420
Actually, the opposite of a bad question is

1404
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,500
another bad question.

1405
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:01,280
But anyway, so there's no such thing as

1406
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,520
a bad question or statement.

1407
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:03,640
Fair enough.

1408
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:06,660
For future Sonics, yes, I would like to

1409
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,340
hear more about Donald Marshall.

1410
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:12,280
They were responding to- Well, just go

1411
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:18,700
to StOlga69 YouTube, StOlga69, just like in the

1412
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:19,460
number 69.

1413
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:23,860
He did a cover where he, save yourself

1414
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:24,400
the trouble.

1415
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:26,560
There's a bunch of the trouble of going

1416
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,220
through all the videos and Donald Marshall speaking

1417
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:30,000
what he did.

1418
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:33,500
Daniel, he went and edited pretty much anything

1419
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:36,000
and everything that could be found on YouTube.

1420
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,960
And he's got three videos, I think, several

1421
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:43,000
hours long of everything compiled according to category

1422
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,280
and subject.

1423
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:46,260
He's got several videos.

1424
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:48,080
And Donald Marshall actually gave it a thumbs

1425
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:48,820
up also.

1426
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,760
He's kind of behind the scenes.

1427
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,900
There are other people that have been speaking

1428
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:56,520
on the human cloning.

1429
00:46:57,260 --> 00:47:00,640
He gives examples of how a lot of

1430
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,560
popular people, Britney Spears and so on, even

1431
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,520
do videos where they show cloning centers in

1432
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,160
a cartoon kind of thing, like they want

1433
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:08,780
to break free.

1434
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,420
It's not only the cloning center, it's the

1435
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:14,460
time slam, what's that, right?

1436
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,280
And the little drill that they tell everyone

1437
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,600
are great, aliens, forms of aliens and all

1438
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,980
this underground stuff, which I'm interested in because

1439
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:23,980
it ties into the species invasion.

1440
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:27,500
We're supposedly going to have around 2046.

1441
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,840
It's also in the book of Revelation, 200

1442
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:32,080
million creatures come up to the surface.

1443
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:35,620
So it all ties in together.

1444
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:39,020
But yeah, I don't really endorse Donald Marshall,

1445
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,500
but I find a lot of the things

1446
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:43,840
that he says are useful and actually factual.

1447
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:49,520
There was, no longer online, because around the

1448
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,020
time of Donald Marshall, you could still find

1449
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:53,700
human robotoids.

1450
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:56,780
And there were several people, I wouldn't say

1451
00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:01,720
politicians, but government people and journalists, recordings from

1452
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:05,000
the 80s, of them talking about these human

1453
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:05,720
robotoids.

1454
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,320
And they call them human robotoids, they're just

1455
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,260
biological clones.

1456
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:09,860
So when you hear robotoid, you think of

1457
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:10,740
nuts and bolts, right?

1458
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,020
No, it's actually a human clone.

1459
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,440
And there was one guy, I forgot, I

1460
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:15,580
don't know who it was, but he was

1461
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:18,840
pretty prominent in the DC circuit, let's say,

1462
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:20,160
I guess you could call it a circuit.

1463
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,080
And he said, we have a problem with

1464
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:23,320
these human robotoids.

1465
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,480
This is late 70s, late 80s or early

1466
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:25,940
80s.

1467
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:27,880
He says, we can have someone, let's say

1468
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,320
the president of the United States in a

1469
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,800
robotoid form, go to another country, say something,

1470
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:34,440
create an international incident, right?

1471
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,280
And it's not the president, right?

1472
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:38,540
It's a clone.

1473
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,920
And boy, I wonder what they would say

1474
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,000
if they were alive now.

1475
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:48,540
And this recording and these little snippets in

1476
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:50,620
the media, this was mainstream, by the way,

1477
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:51,560
not alternative.

1478
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,760
It was online and you could hear the

1479
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,700
recording and now I can't find it at

1480
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:57,960
all.

1481
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,440
If anyone wants to look for it, I

1482
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,480
mean, that's fine.

1483
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:06,840
And yeah, it's a lot stranger than we

1484
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,880
can do on our own.

1485
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:10,780
So just take in whatever you can take

1486
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:10,980
in.

1487
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:11,700
Fair enough.

1488
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,360
Some people say that we're gonna look back

1489
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,180
on the days when people use terms like

1490
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:19,720
NPC, non-player characters, and think the same

1491
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,760
way that there could be a literal way

1492
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:22,380
to look at that.

1493
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,620
And there's also a symbolic way to look

1494
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:24,920
at it.

1495
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:25,720
Anyway.

1496
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:29,140
Yeah, back in the 80s, by the way,

1497
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:30,760
I hung around with people that were on

1498
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:34,740
the Ken Kesey's Magic Bus and were around

1499
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:38,860
Marcel Duchamp and some prominent New York madams,

1500
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:42,720
not the ones in the media.

1501
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:47,140
They would refer to people that were, they

1502
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:48,420
didn't use NPC back then.

1503
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,180
They just said that person's not conscious.

1504
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:51,200
Right.

1505
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:52,800
It was a common thing that they said.

1506
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,500
They have no consciousness or very low conscious

1507
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,360
individual.

1508
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:59,520
Basically, they're asleep, but they're awake, right?

1509
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:02,820
Well, the Hollywood madam still doesn't, yeah, the

1510
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:04,580
Hollywood madam still doesn't give people up.

1511
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:06,860
Although she's back kind of in circulation because

1512
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:09,700
Charlie Sheen just released a two-part documentary

1513
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:10,640
about his life.

1514
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:11,520
I don't know if you got anything to

1515
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,220
say about Charlie Sheen, but, cause some people

1516
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,320
claim he was caught up.

1517
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:16,140
Yeah, sorry.

1518
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,160
Everyone in Hollywood's caught up.

1519
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,220
No, I mean, I have a relative who

1520
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:23,380
was CEO of 20th Century Fox and then

1521
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:26,060
CEO of Paramount Pictures and they're not the

1522
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:26,640
same person.

1523
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:29,460
I mean, they're not, it's so funny.

1524
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:33,480
Years ago, they were doing a Republican, let's

1525
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,880
say more than 10 years ago, they were

1526
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,560
doing a Republican fundraiser.

1527
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,220
And then the last fundraiser he did was

1528
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:38,920
for Joe Biden.

1529
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,180
Right, so it's all just crazy.

1530
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:46,620
There's nothing, but no, no, it's just a

1531
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:47,660
disgusting mess.

1532
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,280
But I thought the Hollywood madam, wasn't that,

1533
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,160
there was another madam that says she was

1534
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:55,840
not suicidal, a little short brunette lady, but

1535
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,100
then they found her hanging, right?

1536
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,640
Yeah, that's the DC madam, if you will,

1537
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:00,660
but the Hollywood madam.

1538
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:02,060
That's the DC madam, yep.

1539
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,460
Well, this is what I got from the

1540
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:04,700
madam.

1541
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:11,680
You know, like prostitutes, right, are more informative

1542
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,980
and helpful than any attorney would ever be.

1543
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:16,180
So I'll tell you what she, they had

1544
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:18,980
a place in this guy, Oleg Cassini, he

1545
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:20,660
was a designer and he used to call

1546
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,320
him No Legs Cassini because he would come

1547
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:22,980
in in a wheelchair.

1548
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,120
And all they wanted to do, these higher

1549
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:29,280
up people, let's say, that they would entertain

1550
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,160
or serve, they would just sit there and

1551
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,740
talk for two hours, nothing.

1552
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:34,760
It's, you know, you think, oh, I'm gonna

1553
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,700
go see a call girl or go to

1554
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:39,800
whatever madams, they think it's gonna be involving,

1555
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:40,980
yeah, it usually is.

1556
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:44,060
But very often, more often than not, these

1557
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:46,260
people would just sit around and talk.

1558
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:48,160
They wanted someone to talk to because it's

1559
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,720
ultimately confidential, right?

1560
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:50,820
Forget about the confidential.

1561
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:53,420
And the thing is, you have confidentiality with

1562
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:57,460
attorneys and psychiatrists or psychologists, but they're idiots,

1563
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:57,800
right?

1564
00:51:58,060 --> 00:51:59,620
Well, they're idiots and they have an out.

1565
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:02,580
They literally have an out in their supposed

1566
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:05,180
agreement where I can go to the cops

1567
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:07,220
if, not so with the call girl.

1568
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:08,580
Yeah, that's right, they say that.

1569
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:09,680
Not so with the call girl.

1570
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,920
And they do, just like the Catholic priests

1571
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,320
used to, yeah, not so with the call,

1572
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,420
Catholic priests used to take confessions for the

1573
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:18,280
two so they could supply the surgeons with

1574
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:18,800
experimental.

1575
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:22,880
But anyway, but here was more than that.

1576
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:24,860
He says, after a board meeting, they would

1577
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:27,100
call a particular call girl to meet them

1578
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:29,340
at a hotel and discuss what decisions they

1579
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:29,880
should make.

1580
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:33,900
That's how involved some of them were because

1581
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,260
they were pretty, you know, think about someone

1582
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:38,700
who is, if you want advice from someone

1583
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:41,220
who's very worldly, has seen a lot of

1584
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:42,840
things, most likely it would probably be an

1585
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,800
older call girl or a madam, right?

1586
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,200
In terms of human character and all that.

1587
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,200
So anyway, I just wanted to throw that

1588
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:48,520
in there.

1589
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,080
I'm not gonna mention the madam's name, but

1590
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,060
yeah, okay.

1591
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,320
Fair enough, but you know, if you're dealing

1592
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,800
with, it's all got to do with sourcing.

1593
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,000
Look, these women spend time around guys who

1594
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,460
can afford to spend $10,000 on them

1595
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:02,920
in a night.

1596
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:06,220
So that means there's a certain level to

1597
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:08,540
the player that they've been exposed to constantly.

1598
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:12,040
So their information is in that.

1599
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:12,960
It's not even the money.

1600
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:15,680
Well, but it does give an indicator as

1601
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,560
to, it's not the guy who can afford

1602
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,260
100 bucks and drive up on them.

1603
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:20,960
That could be anybody.

1604
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:23,720
This is- It is, but what's even

1605
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:26,420
worse is I was reading something recently and

1606
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:28,880
this case, it was a minor case, and

1607
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,180
it was like 1.2 million in legal

1608
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:31,600
fees.

1609
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:33,100
And I'm like, oh my gosh, are you

1610
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:36,460
that stupid to be attorneys a dime?

1611
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:37,740
You know, it just shows you.

1612
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:39,300
I mean, oh my gosh, the world is

1613
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:40,100
so screwed up.

1614
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,660
So, you know, and here's the thing.

1615
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:44,620
Sometimes I'm like hopeful that there's an attorney

1616
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:46,760
that knows something or, you know, in law

1617
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:47,120
at all.

1618
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,660
And I'm like, oh, this guy sounds okay.

1619
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:50,480
And then within two minutes, they prove to

1620
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:51,660
not know anything at all.

1621
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,260
It's really disappointing.

1622
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:56,600
So, okay, what else, what else?

1623
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,520
The same with doctors, by the way.

1624
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:01,580
Of course, speaking of prostitutes, that's my editorialism.

1625
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:02,840
But anyway, this question.

1626
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:06,220
So what's so special about the historical, they

1627
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:08,460
call, the historical figure, they call G-E,

1628
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,220
you know, J-E-S-U, you know

1629
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:11,800
what I'm talking about, in Christianity?

1630
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,460
Nothing in general.

1631
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:15,020
Why was he put?

1632
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:15,580
Nothing in general.

1633
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:18,280
Okay, why was he put on a tree

1634
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,160
and stoned?

1635
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:22,840
What did he do to deserve such a

1636
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:25,080
cruel or cool treatment, they say, but I

1637
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,340
think they might have meant cool.

1638
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:28,300
That's the myth.

1639
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:31,360
That's the whole, it's not a myth, but

1640
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,920
it's if you follow the, what people that,

1641
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,440
whether, it doesn't matter when the books were

1642
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,060
written, but were they in sequence?

1643
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,960
Yes, and all that was prophesied in the

1644
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:42,560
Old Testament.

1645
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:47,740
There's no crucifixion, Roman crucifixion prophesied, but if

1646
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:49,100
you read the book of Isaiah and the

1647
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:51,860
Psalms and all that, it's very clearly a

1648
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:52,200
stoning.

1649
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,040
But, and remember, I did put in the

1650
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:57,680
chat recently, the biblical text is cumulative, so

1651
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:02,940
kindergarten to, let's say, 10th grade or something

1652
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:05,100
would be the Old Testament, and the New

1653
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:07,740
Testament's 10th grade to 12th grade, right?

1654
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:10,360
Something like that, right, or college level.

1655
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:13,120
So when you go to college math, do

1656
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:14,780
they say, do they start all over at

1657
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:18,140
first grade math, or is it cumulative, right?

1658
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:20,420
So if you read the, that's why they

1659
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:22,800
tell you, just read the, like, if you

1660
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,020
took everyone that was five or six or

1661
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:26,500
seven going to school and put them in

1662
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:29,340
college level learning right away, you know, they

1663
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:30,960
wouldn't know anything at all, no matter how

1664
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,800
much, because they don't have the basis to

1665
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,640
do anything with it, and that's exactly what's

1666
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,160
going on.

1667
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,880
But the New Testament is an absolute mess,

1668
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:40,580
but if you understand the history and the

1669
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:43,020
corruption, first of all, it's adopted by the

1670
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:46,480
most corrupt institution in the world has ever

1671
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,480
seen, the Vatican, right, which is an entire

1672
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:50,060
culture.

1673
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:51,520
It has nothing to do with religion.

1674
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,340
It just happens to be also a religious

1675
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:58,720
institution, because the reason they used religion is

1676
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,880
to control, it's a control mechanism, right?

1677
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:03,760
So just like science is now.

1678
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:08,680
They adopted it, and they changed things in

1679
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:08,820
there.

1680
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:11,880
There were several, years ago when I was

1681
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:15,540
looking into this, there were very well-recorded,

1682
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:18,380
what do you call, inventories of what was

1683
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:22,160
in the Vatican Library regarding the New Testament,

1684
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,160
and very little of it is ever brought

1685
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:24,360
out.

1686
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:25,900
There's a lot more that they're not gonna

1687
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:28,840
release, little leaks here and there, but they

1688
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:32,740
do date the original text down before the

1689
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:34,440
first century, you know, first century, so they

1690
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:38,000
are contemporary, late contemporary, but I'll tell you

1691
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,280
for sure, if you don't understand the law

1692
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:44,360
and the culture in the Old Testament, you

1693
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:47,520
will never understand anything in the New Testament

1694
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,580
properly, and there is a proper way, let's

1695
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:51,640
say a more proper way.

1696
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:54,660
The most famous one is when the Christ,

1697
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:56,280
they brought the woman that they were going

1698
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:59,400
to stone, and he says basically, whoever is

1699
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,940
without sin, throw the first stone, and a

1700
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:03,980
typical moron would say, oh, that's because he's

1701
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:04,480
compassionate.

1702
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,020
No, he was actually going by the book,

1703
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:10,780
because the stoning, they want to stone her

1704
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:13,640
because that, why didn't they want to crucify

1705
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:16,460
her, the Roman, or have her flogged by

1706
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:16,960
the Romans?

1707
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:21,520
Because they were applying Judean jurisprudence, right?

1708
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:25,200
So, so it was the Christ.

1709
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:29,000
What is the ordinance of an execution?

1710
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:33,580
What is the ordinance of accusation as a

1711
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:33,820
witness?

1712
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,820
There was no witness, because in order to

1713
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:39,840
be a witness, you have to, you can't

1714
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:42,200
have any warrants or outstanding parking tickets.

1715
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:43,920
You have to have a clean record yourself,

1716
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:45,340
right?

1717
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:49,020
And I'm not talking ever doing it, but

1718
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:51,220
there has to be settled, right?

1719
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:55,120
So they had unsettled things, not that they

1720
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:56,160
never did anything.

1721
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:58,800
No, they were unsettled.

1722
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:01,860
They were still outstanding, right?

1723
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:05,700
And only the witnesses commenced the execution.

1724
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:07,560
This is all in the Old Testament, but

1725
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:08,660
if you don't know the Old Testament, you

1726
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:09,500
think it's compassionate.

1727
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:12,340
And in order, if there is no witness

1728
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,700
to a woman with adultery, they would sweep

1729
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,480
the floor, the dust, and put it in

1730
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,160
a cup and have her drink it, right?

1731
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:20,680
If she loses loss of, loses the use

1732
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:22,980
of her leg or legs, she's guilty.

1733
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:24,500
This is like witchcraft, right?

1734
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:25,800
Think about it, magic, right?

1735
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:26,380
No witnesses.

1736
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,740
We take the dust from the temple floor

1737
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:30,620
or, you know, and we put it in

1738
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:32,500
a cup with a liquid, and if she

1739
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,600
drinks it and she's guilty, she falls to

1740
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:35,020
the ground.

1741
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,680
If she's not guilty, she walks away.

1742
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:41,900
That's like an elixir-type magic, witchcraft-type

1743
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:42,200
stuff.

1744
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:43,420
Doesn't it sound like that, right?

1745
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:47,460
So that's why he was writing on the

1746
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:47,860
dust.

1747
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:50,160
It's very specific on the dust on the

1748
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:50,400
floor.

1749
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:52,900
He was bringing up the ordinance, right?

1750
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:54,800
This is the most, but we don't have

1751
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,660
to go that far because you don't have

1752
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:58,660
any witnesses, and there's no one here really

1753
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,340
standing up to accuse.

1754
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:03,320
He was just going by the book, and

1755
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:04,880
I'm telling you, if you go back and

1756
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,760
read it, and you'll see, like, he's very,

1757
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:10,460
how about the woman pleading with him to

1758
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:14,580
heal the daughter, and he's ignoring her, totally

1759
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:15,220
ignoring her.

1760
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,180
And they're like, why do you ignore her?

1761
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:19,740
Because I didn't come for her, you know?

1762
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,520
And then she basically says, don't you feed

1763
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:23,740
the scraps to the dogs?

1764
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,460
You know, she basically had her lower herself

1765
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:26,740
to a dog, and then he says, go

1766
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:26,960
home.

1767
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:30,800
So this is already very tight.

1768
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,160
It's very by the book.

1769
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:39,020
It's very, very rational and logical if you

1770
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:40,200
understand the Old Testament.

1771
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:43,380
He was not someone that was very kind

1772
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,980
to the people in public, by the way.

1773
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:50,160
And anyway, I'm not gonna get into, here's

1774
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:50,520
the thing.

1775
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,880
I hate to sound like the only person

1776
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:56,480
who's ever read the so-called Bible and

1777
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:57,380
can explain it.

1778
00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:00,040
But apparently, it seems like that's so.

1779
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,360
Well, there were many- Everyone else is

1780
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:03,800
taking nitpicks with agendas.

1781
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:06,200
I mean, Jesus, like they say, right?

1782
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,040
Yeah, by the way, you just walked past

1783
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:09,740
something that caused that electronic noise.

1784
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:13,100
But anyway- Yeah, like, geez louise, yeah.

1785
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:16,560
There were many replies to this in the

1786
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:16,860
community.

1787
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:17,780
I don't know if you want me to

1788
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,100
skim through them and give you an idea

1789
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:22,020
of what the replies were, but one person

1790
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:23,880
said that they think it was actually the

1791
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:25,100
punishment for blasphemy.

1792
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:29,000
And that's what was prescribed based on a

1793
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,040
certain version, blah, blah.

1794
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:32,780
Okay, but why blasphemy, somebody asked.

1795
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:34,620
And then they gave him, you know, look,

1796
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:35,080
go read.

1797
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:38,400
Okay, I was asking more about the real

1798
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,060
story of this guy in the Old Testament,

1799
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,520
not the biblical Christ.

1800
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,640
Blasphemy is still very generic.

1801
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:47,920
Okay- Well, that was an accusation, and

1802
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,900
according to Judean law, again, because you cannot

1803
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:55,020
say that you're God without proving it, right?

1804
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,080
And that would be enough.

1805
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:02,760
Yeah, it's very complex, because remember, they had

1806
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:03,560
lost authority.

1807
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:05,620
Pontius Pilate was the ruling authority.

1808
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:08,520
He's the only one that did the ritual

1809
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,220
of the red heifer, which is the washing

1810
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:11,000
of the hands.

1811
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:13,780
We have no account that any of the

1812
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:16,800
Judean authorities washed their hands of anything, did

1813
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:16,980
we?

1814
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:18,240
It's very technical.

1815
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:21,580
I mean, it's quite the discussion, but you

1816
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:23,320
have to know the details and what these

1817
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:24,680
things mean, right?

1818
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,780
So, anyway, keep going.

1819
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:30,580
Yeah, that you had spoken previous, Sonics, about

1820
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:32,920
the J-E-S, you know, character being

1821
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:37,360
a prototype, and, you know, that came back

1822
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:40,500
from death, you know, show that as possible,

1823
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:43,240
a divine being that man killed.

1824
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:47,480
I thought maybe he was Yahweh reincarnated, but

1825
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,100
maybe not.

1826
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:50,400
Let me interject something.

1827
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:53,180
We have control over the small things, but

1828
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:55,880
not over the big things, right?

1829
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,700
The big things in our lives, right?

1830
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:01,220
Like Tesla coming up with the Tesla coil.

1831
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:03,380
He probably had no choice in that.

1832
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:04,940
That had to happen, right?

1833
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:07,340
So this is also a proof from the

1834
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:08,940
other side that they have control.

1835
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:10,740
That's why the John C.

1836
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:13,960
Lilly stuff, I like a lot, because the

1837
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:18,800
ECCO, which is the Earth Coincidence Control Office,

1838
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:20,720
they control the big long-term events.

1839
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:23,340
We control the small ones, right?

1840
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:30,100
So there was something about a Messiah being

1841
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:31,860
stoned to death according to the law of

1842
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:32,140
Moses.

1843
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:34,540
That's why Moses made the seven-branch lampstand

1844
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:35,820
in the likeness of an almond tree.

1845
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:37,000
We know it was an almond tree.

1846
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:38,680
There's so many references.

1847
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:39,820
It's in the first chapter.

1848
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:44,040
Jeremiah, Jacob, also in Genesis, on and on

1849
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:44,380
and on.

1850
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:50,600
Yeah, it's very technical and overlapping.

1851
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:51,860
What do you call hyperlinks?

1852
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:54,080
When you have a link and you go

1853
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:56,220
to, imagine you click on a link and

1854
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:57,560
it takes you to another page that's full

1855
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:58,020
of links.

1856
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:00,480
And then each time you click on one

1857
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,900
link, it opens to another page with links

1858
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:04,240
and some more information.

1859
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:07,380
This is what the biblical text is like,

1860
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:08,180
believe it or not.

1861
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:11,100
Yeah, I've had that experience online, actually.

1862
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:13,880
It becomes exhausting, to be honest.

1863
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:16,880
Yeah, but every little detail has to be

1864
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:17,260
minded.

1865
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:18,380
I mean, what does it mean?

1866
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,100
Now you're starting, this is what the rabbis

1867
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:22,860
did, but you're never gonna get an honest

1868
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:25,340
review of what they actually, you know, when

1869
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:28,920
they write stuff back in the days, the

1870
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:33,140
rabbis like, let's say, commentary on whatever, it

1871
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:35,020
has to sit for 100 years before they

1872
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:35,620
publish it.

1873
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:37,360
They have to mull it over.

1874
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:41,100
So, and you know how much editing is

1875
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:42,420
done in that 100 years, right?

1876
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:43,280
Oh, of course.

1877
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:47,040
That's why even in contemporary historical writing, there

1878
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:48,580
used to be a standard of wait 75

1879
01:03:48,580 --> 01:03:51,360
years before you actually release an account of

1880
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:54,380
anything because, yeah, you need to actually go

1881
01:03:54,380 --> 01:03:55,160
over it.

1882
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:57,760
And take the mic for a minute and

1883
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:57,980
a half.

1884
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:58,680
I'll be right back.

1885
01:03:58,820 --> 01:03:59,320
Yeah, sure.

1886
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:02,500
Further replies in this, you know, went back

1887
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:02,840
and forth.

1888
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:04,820
I find it interesting when a conversation is

1889
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:08,240
generated from one of these comments or questions.

1890
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:10,800
And, you know, look, guys, if you wanna

1891
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:13,080
continue on that, no problem, just let me

1892
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:14,660
know and we'll see where else we have

1893
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:15,100
to go.

1894
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:18,340
But there was also a reference to the

1895
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:23,460
Godspeak podcast, I guess, which was a previous

1896
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:26,160
thing, a previous Sonic the Greek did regarding

1897
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:26,520
this.

1898
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:27,940
And I guess it was a podcast on

1899
01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:28,420
Islam.

1900
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:32,120
I don't see a link to it in

1901
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:35,260
the Patreon, you know, back and forth here.

1902
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:38,760
But anyway, it's interesting that if you go

1903
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:40,980
back over some of these Sonics, I've discovered

1904
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:45,140
anyway, with ones that contain valuable information, one

1905
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:46,780
listen is never enough.

1906
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:50,960
You listen to it with a different focus

1907
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:53,380
on a different day and you may come

1908
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:54,960
away with different information.

1909
01:04:55,220 --> 01:04:55,980
It is possible.

1910
01:04:56,540 --> 01:04:58,920
And I think that happens also with any

1911
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:02,060
text that has complexities to it, like the

1912
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:03,160
Greek is talking about that.

1913
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:04,540
You know, look, you click on a link,

1914
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:07,480
you might end up with more links.

1915
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:09,940
More links, yeah.

1916
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:13,060
Well, the thing about Islam is they really

1917
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:16,520
played the population when they noticed there was

1918
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:22,620
no direct organized that could be massive, and

1919
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:23,200
it is massive.

1920
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:25,180
There are more Muslims in the Pacific, by

1921
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:27,180
the way, you know, Rim, than there are

1922
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:27,900
in the Middle East.

1923
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:30,180
Most people think there are more, I think

1924
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:32,860
it's a two to one in Asian countries.

1925
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:34,500
There are more Muslims than there are in

1926
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:36,600
the Middle East or what's Southwest Asia.

1927
01:05:37,060 --> 01:05:41,600
But what they wanted a organized enough, formalized

1928
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:44,540
religion to counter Christianity, right?

1929
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:45,840
That's what basically was.

1930
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,740
So when you fall into, you got played,

1931
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,180
you know, as a group.

1932
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:52,920
But in itself, it's written on like a

1933
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:54,780
third grade, let's stops at like second or

1934
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:55,600
third grade level.

1935
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:57,140
Like, you know, when you give up coloring

1936
01:05:57,140 --> 01:05:59,440
books, you finally get a pencil, but this

1937
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:00,660
is like when we were growing up, right?

1938
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:02,620
When you remember, you just had crayons and

1939
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:04,060
now you have a pencil, but you never

1940
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:05,660
get to a typewriter or whatever.

1941
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:07,420
Oh, there was also the switch.

1942
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:09,300
Yeah, there was also the switch from the,

1943
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,000
when we were kids anyway, the big fat

1944
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,080
pencil to now the skinny pencil.

1945
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:15,680
Yeah, right, just, yeah, cause it was right.

1946
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:21,280
So it was put together to offer an

1947
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:24,200
opponent, an adversary to the Christian expansion, which

1948
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:26,000
it didn't, you know, expand beyond.

1949
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:28,640
Remember the, we had the Crusades, you know,

1950
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:32,560
to keep everyone entertained and whatever reason it

1951
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:32,720
gives.

1952
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:35,620
But what's interesting about the Quran, you could

1953
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:38,260
tell it's written in rabbinical fashion, first of

1954
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:39,580
all, how do I know?

1955
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:43,370
Well, you have to go to New York

1956
01:06:43,370 --> 01:06:44,650
and you need a lawyer, so make sure

1957
01:06:44,650 --> 01:06:46,390
you get a good Jewish lawyer, right?

1958
01:06:46,410 --> 01:06:48,130
If you wanna write a holy book, make

1959
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:49,910
sure you get a rabbi to write it

1960
01:06:49,910 --> 01:06:50,430
for you, right?

1961
01:06:50,430 --> 01:06:51,290
Cause that's what they do.

1962
01:06:53,130 --> 01:06:55,490
But the positive thing, well, the other thing

1963
01:06:55,490 --> 01:06:57,970
is there's no discernment in the Quran, very

1964
01:06:57,970 --> 01:06:58,330
little.

1965
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:01,550
Like in the biblical parlance or the narrative,

1966
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:02,730
there's a lot of discernment.

1967
01:07:02,930 --> 01:07:05,770
When it prohibits something, it says, well, it's

1968
01:07:05,770 --> 01:07:08,130
things that are like this, right?

1969
01:07:08,410 --> 01:07:10,950
In the Quran, for example, with food, it

1970
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:15,170
just says swine flesh and found dead, you

1971
01:07:15,170 --> 01:07:15,750
know, roadkill.

1972
01:07:15,810 --> 01:07:17,530
No swine flesh and no roadkill.

1973
01:07:17,570 --> 01:07:19,230
But in the biblical text, if it says

1974
01:07:19,230 --> 01:07:22,610
something, it gives you discernment, right?

1975
01:07:22,790 --> 01:07:24,910
So if it, right, if it has four

1976
01:07:24,910 --> 01:07:28,030
legs, it needs to chew the cud and

1977
01:07:28,030 --> 01:07:28,910
have a cloven hoof.

1978
01:07:29,490 --> 01:07:31,530
And it gives examples, right?

1979
01:07:31,590 --> 01:07:34,870
So if you go somewhere where, right, we'll

1980
01:07:34,870 --> 01:07:36,270
give the example of last time.

1981
01:07:36,350 --> 01:07:37,930
You've never seen the animal before, but it

1982
01:07:37,930 --> 01:07:39,710
chews the cud and has a cloven hoof.

1983
01:07:39,970 --> 01:07:41,990
It's permissible, you don't find that in the

1984
01:07:41,990 --> 01:07:42,170
Quran.

1985
01:07:43,870 --> 01:07:45,690
So, but the thing about the Quran, it's

1986
01:07:45,690 --> 01:07:47,490
extra, it's like tough love.

1987
01:07:48,170 --> 01:07:51,130
Actually, Muslim means to be submissive, right?

1988
01:07:51,890 --> 01:07:56,810
And it does hearken on Elohim, Al-Allah.

1989
01:07:57,070 --> 01:08:00,470
It's not Allah, it's Al-Allah, Al, right,

1990
01:08:00,590 --> 01:08:00,990
basically.

1991
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:06,630
It's put together, in the beginning, it was

1992
01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:11,250
a very loose weave of all these groups

1993
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:13,990
of people that venerated different things, right?

1994
01:08:14,110 --> 01:08:16,410
And they try to organize and formalize them.

1995
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:19,689
And it's interesting, if you look at the

1996
01:08:19,689 --> 01:08:23,430
most fervent early on Muslim countries, most fundamental,

1997
01:08:23,729 --> 01:08:25,810
it's almost like they were forming a border

1998
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:27,210
wall against Europe.

1999
01:08:27,630 --> 01:08:30,010
Because as you go east, it becomes more

2000
01:08:30,010 --> 01:08:31,790
loose to the point where if you get

2001
01:08:31,790 --> 01:08:36,050
to Afghanistan and Persia, they're not even Muslim

2002
01:08:36,050 --> 01:08:37,870
at all, and they should, they're not at

2003
01:08:37,870 --> 01:08:38,210
all.

2004
01:08:38,649 --> 01:08:40,229
That was forced on them by the CIA,

2005
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:40,689
right?

2006
01:08:40,970 --> 01:08:44,710
With the Ayatollah, that fundamental stuff.

2007
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:47,510
And then it picks up again in Malaysia,

2008
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:49,170
places like that.

2009
01:08:49,170 --> 01:08:52,170
So it's very interesting, it's geopolitical stuff.

2010
01:08:52,729 --> 01:08:56,890
No religion, by the way, is a religion

2011
01:08:56,890 --> 01:08:59,050
that has legs to stand on, it's all

2012
01:08:59,050 --> 01:09:00,370
social control, period.

2013
01:09:00,890 --> 01:09:03,250
That's why it's real funny when you see

2014
01:09:03,250 --> 01:09:04,950
like a white guy or a white girl,

2015
01:09:05,050 --> 01:09:07,010
they're like, oh yeah, I converted to Buddhism.

2016
01:09:07,689 --> 01:09:08,850
I didn't like Christianity.

2017
01:09:09,170 --> 01:09:11,149
All they're mentioning is all the, it's like

2018
01:09:11,149 --> 01:09:12,790
saying, I used to be Democrat, now I'm

2019
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:13,170
Republic.

2020
01:09:13,290 --> 01:09:14,130
What about the Constitution?

2021
01:09:14,330 --> 01:09:15,109
I don't know, man.

2022
01:09:15,609 --> 01:09:18,130
You know, there's no, people get lost in

2023
01:09:18,130 --> 01:09:18,569
the sauce.

2024
01:09:18,569 --> 01:09:21,450
There's plenty of people that will never seek

2025
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:24,710
meat and content, they'll just seek a label.

2026
01:09:25,029 --> 01:09:25,790
It's just a label.

2027
01:09:26,430 --> 01:09:29,109
Because actually, if you read the Quran, in

2028
01:09:29,109 --> 01:09:32,569
essence, I'm paraphrasing, it tells you that God

2029
01:09:32,569 --> 01:09:35,490
didn't give his law in the Quran, he

2030
01:09:35,490 --> 01:09:36,330
gave it to Moses.

2031
01:09:36,550 --> 01:09:38,010
So you have to go look at what

2032
01:09:38,010 --> 01:09:38,930
Moses was given.

2033
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:42,250
Wow, I'm paraphrasing, it's in several places.

2034
01:09:42,430 --> 01:09:45,390
So if you're actually diligent about it, you

2035
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:46,529
would have to put down the Quran and

2036
01:09:46,529 --> 01:09:47,850
go read where the law is, right?

2037
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:48,890
And that's what I did initially.

2038
01:09:49,290 --> 01:09:50,930
I just read the Bible and where the

2039
01:09:50,930 --> 01:09:52,370
law was, right?

2040
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:56,230
So, and I had a firm standing on

2041
01:09:56,230 --> 01:09:58,990
understanding that before I went into prophecy and

2042
01:09:58,990 --> 01:10:00,370
all that other, what they were saying there

2043
01:10:00,370 --> 01:10:01,010
in the New Testament.

2044
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:02,730
It was quite a few years where I

2045
01:10:02,730 --> 01:10:05,690
just was studying the law part, the legality

2046
01:10:05,690 --> 01:10:07,830
of the law part, you know.

2047
01:10:08,650 --> 01:10:10,810
So to open, but so yeah, so this

2048
01:10:10,810 --> 01:10:15,810
is really the basis of all these discussions

2049
01:10:15,810 --> 01:10:18,170
is it's very hard to discuss this with

2050
01:10:18,170 --> 01:10:21,630
someone that, you know, if you bring up

2051
01:10:21,630 --> 01:10:25,010
the Exodus, let's say out of Egypt, yeah,

2052
01:10:25,070 --> 01:10:27,290
I saw that movie with Charlton Heston, yeah,

2053
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:27,810
right?

2054
01:10:28,630 --> 01:10:30,610
This is what most people are gonna, you

2055
01:10:30,610 --> 01:10:32,990
know, or yeah, I saw those planes go

2056
01:10:32,990 --> 01:10:35,470
into the buildings on 9-11.

2057
01:10:35,610 --> 01:10:37,330
I saw those planes, really, you were there?

2058
01:10:37,390 --> 01:10:38,270
No, I saw it on TV.

2059
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:41,910
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, you know?

2060
01:10:42,110 --> 01:10:44,390
So you can't, that's what I hear mostly.

2061
01:10:44,610 --> 01:10:46,150
Mostly, most people are like that.

2062
01:10:46,150 --> 01:10:47,330
They'll say, yeah, I saw the planes go

2063
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:50,230
through buildings like they were there and they

2064
01:10:50,230 --> 01:10:51,370
weren't there at all.

2065
01:10:51,810 --> 01:10:53,810
So most people talk and talk.

2066
01:10:53,910 --> 01:10:57,450
By the way, I wouldn't say expressly, but

2067
01:10:57,450 --> 01:11:01,490
I could say expressly avoid talking on religion,

2068
01:11:01,670 --> 01:11:04,190
Bible stuff anymore and getting into all that

2069
01:11:04,190 --> 01:11:07,410
stuff because you, I mean, right?

2070
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:09,170
The last thing, right, I want as an

2071
01:11:09,170 --> 01:11:10,690
example, I'm not saying the people that are

2072
01:11:10,690 --> 01:11:13,010
commenting, you know, if we talk about Exodus,

2073
01:11:13,130 --> 01:11:15,390
they saw the movie, right, or how many

2074
01:11:15,390 --> 01:11:17,490
Jesus movies have they done, right?

2075
01:11:17,650 --> 01:11:18,650
We talk about that.

2076
01:11:18,710 --> 01:11:21,070
They saw the movie, you know, or the

2077
01:11:21,070 --> 01:11:21,990
planes on 9-11.

2078
01:11:22,130 --> 01:11:24,330
I've had someone insist that they saw the

2079
01:11:24,330 --> 01:11:26,970
planes on 9-11 until I finally got

2080
01:11:26,970 --> 01:11:28,310
it out of them admitting that it was

2081
01:11:28,310 --> 01:11:30,250
on TV, right?

2082
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:32,230
So I just don't talk about these things.

2083
01:11:32,310 --> 01:11:33,510
It's just why bother, right?

2084
01:11:33,530 --> 01:11:35,630
That's an old motto I used to have.

2085
01:11:35,790 --> 01:11:36,970
Why the fuck bother?

2086
01:11:37,310 --> 01:11:38,070
So there you go.

2087
01:11:38,350 --> 01:11:40,390
So look, here's just the last thing to

2088
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:42,030
sort of cap this if you don't mind

2089
01:11:42,710 --> 01:11:44,670
because it's at the end of all that

2090
01:11:44,670 --> 01:11:48,070
with the conversation and the same, excuse me,

2091
01:11:48,130 --> 01:11:50,790
the same person who started it says, one

2092
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:52,950
more thing, are these guys like Yahweh coming

2093
01:11:52,950 --> 01:11:54,090
back anytime soon?

2094
01:11:54,330 --> 01:11:56,930
I would love to see them getting bored

2095
01:11:56,930 --> 01:11:57,750
with humans a bit.

2096
01:11:58,150 --> 01:12:00,010
They're just scrolling on their phone and talking

2097
01:12:00,010 --> 01:12:00,710
about Trump.

2098
01:12:01,210 --> 01:12:02,310
Cats are more interesting.

2099
01:12:02,950 --> 01:12:04,090
I want to see some action.

2100
01:12:04,290 --> 01:12:06,030
Hope these guys come back while I'm still

2101
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:08,290
here, this person said.

2102
01:12:08,690 --> 01:12:09,630
Yeah, you and me both.

2103
01:12:10,150 --> 01:12:12,570
But the thing is, action is something, okay,

2104
01:12:13,390 --> 01:12:15,570
good or bad, it's almost the same amount

2105
01:12:15,570 --> 01:12:16,970
of energy out.

2106
01:12:17,010 --> 01:12:19,810
But imagine you gotta go help somebody who's

2107
01:12:19,810 --> 01:12:21,650
in distress and you're gonna be there for

2108
01:12:21,650 --> 01:12:23,650
a while, quite a few hours, most of

2109
01:12:23,650 --> 01:12:24,130
the day.

2110
01:12:24,490 --> 01:12:25,830
You just don't wanna run out in your

2111
01:12:25,830 --> 01:12:26,710
sweatpants, right?

2112
01:12:26,890 --> 01:12:29,030
You gotta bring your keys, whatever else you're

2113
01:12:29,030 --> 01:12:32,230
gonna bring, some food, whatever, whatever.

2114
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:36,030
Let's say you're gonna go to a happy

2115
01:12:36,030 --> 01:12:38,070
occasion and it's gonna be the whole day.

2116
01:12:38,070 --> 01:12:39,470
And still, you can't just run out.

2117
01:12:39,670 --> 01:12:41,510
You have to prepare and set aside.

2118
01:12:41,610 --> 01:12:44,650
You gotta sacrifice time that you would have

2119
01:12:44,650 --> 01:12:45,690
been doing other things.

2120
01:12:46,390 --> 01:12:51,270
So whether these guys, the Elohim and whoever

2121
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:53,770
else is up there, decides to make a

2122
01:12:53,770 --> 01:12:57,710
big move, whether it's positive or negative, it's

2123
01:12:57,710 --> 01:12:59,250
gonna stop what you're doing.

2124
01:12:59,370 --> 01:13:01,750
It's a major interruption, disruption.

2125
01:13:02,690 --> 01:13:04,210
So look at it that way.

2126
01:13:04,530 --> 01:13:07,330
So I always look at it, like I

2127
01:13:07,330 --> 01:13:09,250
always said, I don't go to weddings or

2128
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:10,870
funerals because both of them are a disruption

2129
01:13:10,870 --> 01:13:14,190
in my life and they're meaningless anyway to

2130
01:13:14,190 --> 01:13:14,810
most people.

2131
01:13:15,270 --> 01:13:17,370
So I don't go to either one.

2132
01:13:17,570 --> 01:13:18,410
So look at one.

2133
01:13:18,650 --> 01:13:20,150
One, go wedding is what, right?

2134
01:13:20,210 --> 01:13:21,190
You're gonna have a, right?

2135
01:13:21,450 --> 01:13:22,890
And the funeral is what?

2136
01:13:22,930 --> 01:13:24,330
It's gonna be like, ugh, right?

2137
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:25,990
But I don't go to either one.

2138
01:13:26,070 --> 01:13:29,370
It doesn't matter if one is happy, one's

2139
01:13:29,370 --> 01:13:29,550
sad.

2140
01:13:29,630 --> 01:13:31,310
It doesn't matter because both of them are

2141
01:13:31,310 --> 01:13:34,870
an interruption and a disruption and basically bullshit

2142
01:13:34,870 --> 01:13:35,430
in the end.

2143
01:13:37,230 --> 01:13:41,070
So if you could see it coming, I

2144
01:13:41,070 --> 01:13:42,010
would avoid it.

2145
01:13:43,550 --> 01:13:46,690
Not because it's bullshit, because it's gonna be

2146
01:13:46,690 --> 01:13:48,590
bullshit for everyone else.

2147
01:13:49,670 --> 01:13:50,810
You're not gonna understand it.

2148
01:13:50,810 --> 01:13:51,950
No one's gonna know what's going on.

2149
01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:53,450
They'll probably end up killing each other, whether

2150
01:13:53,450 --> 01:13:54,270
it's good or bad.

2151
01:13:56,030 --> 01:13:57,930
But the thing is, that's why you don't

2152
01:13:57,930 --> 01:13:58,530
see it coming.

2153
01:13:59,350 --> 01:14:00,570
You don't see it coming.

2154
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:03,610
And that's what I like about what Jason

2155
01:14:03,610 --> 01:14:05,450
Brashears is showing of archaics.

2156
01:14:05,610 --> 01:14:09,170
He's showing the middle of May, 2040, 2046,

2157
01:14:09,530 --> 01:14:11,250
but it's not like you're gonna flip a

2158
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:11,690
switch.

2159
01:14:12,510 --> 01:14:15,110
Years before that, there's gonna be weird stuff

2160
01:14:15,110 --> 01:14:16,110
and it'll be confusing.

2161
01:14:16,370 --> 01:14:18,510
And if enough people understand what he's saying,

2162
01:14:19,390 --> 01:14:21,950
you'll have a bunch of people saying, if

2163
01:14:21,950 --> 01:14:23,330
he's saying what he's saying is true, let's

2164
01:14:23,330 --> 01:14:24,690
say the middle of May, 2040.
