1
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:12,600
Technically, this is event 234, but you know,

2
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,180
we're gonna we're gonna do this real short

3
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,500
and just attack the one issue that came

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,620
up between a few people.

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,120
And it's just real simple.

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,240
Look, Greek, they're complaining about the chat tango.

7
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,460
And like, you know, and I've heard this

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,780
before, you know, they don't like that.

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,120
Some people don't like chat tango as a

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,040
place to be.

11
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:33,360
And so they're saying stuff like we'd like

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,860
a forum where we could have, you know,

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,340
different subjects and this and that.

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,640
And I said, Well, look, you know, there's

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,440
lots of platforms, but I want to get

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,740
your feedback on that.

17
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,460
You know, if somebody and by the way,

18
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,820
we didn't build the chat tango, somebody else

19
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:46,060
did.

20
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,600
And people well, I suggested the forum Yeah,

21
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,540
well, here's the thing.

22
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,420
I just where people can meet when we're

23
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,400
when we're not doing our thing.

24
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,220
And to talk about what we're talking about,

25
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,560
and back and forth, I'm open, but I

26
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,340
don't I can't dedicate any time to it,

27
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,280
you're, you'd have to take that on.

28
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,620
And maybe anyone who else wants to help

29
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:04,880
out?

30
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,160
Well, I say, I'm down for whatever.

31
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,640
Yeah, I say, let me put it this

32
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:09,900
way.

33
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,560
Let me just say this before you go

34
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:12,720
on.

35
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,420
I can't really, when I go into chat

36
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,300
tango, it's like once a week, sometimes once

37
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,520
every two weeks, sometimes every other day, I

38
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,720
my time is really taken up at this

39
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,040
point.

40
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,480
Because I want it to be focused where

41
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,440
I'm focusing it.

42
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,860
I wouldn't say the Sonics are low priority,

43
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,600
but they are.

44
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,800
And I can't I can't go go beyond

45
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,640
any, any, any more than I'm doing right

46
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,800
now regarding Sonics and all that other stuff.

47
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:39,160
Right.

48
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,060
But here's the thing.

49
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,660
If these guys, I'm open to it.

50
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:41,840
Yeah.

51
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,640
If these guys want to build, okay, something

52
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,460
on a platform that you know, that they

53
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,220
prefer that they like, that could be accessible,

54
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,240
you know, and all that I say, good,

55
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:51,720
do it.

56
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,440
Show me the better spot because to tango,

57
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,520
we just used it because it was familiar

58
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,560
and it was open for anybody to go

59
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,880
to, you know, and accessible from any device.

60
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,320
But you know, some devices vary in experience

61
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,440
when you do these things, right?

62
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,280
So anyway, it would be good to have

63
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,520
a space where you can comment under different

64
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,020
topics.

65
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,720
The space looks like a big soup.

66
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,980
Yeah, this is them complaining again.

67
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,720
One is commenting about whether yet it does.

68
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,700
And that's the way it is.

69
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,760
It is a big soup.

70
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,660
And look, you, you have discernment and the

71
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,660
Greek, yeah, by the way, it's linear.

72
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,240
If some, if I tell someone that was

73
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,180
posted and should tango, like I've been scrolling

74
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,880
for an hour, you know, I've been scrolling

75
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,540
for weeks here and it doesn't go back

76
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,080
that far.

77
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,720
I'm like, okay, yeah, I get it.

78
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,540
It's cheap.

79
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,140
It's well, it's cheap.

80
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,300
Not meaning cheap.

81
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,220
It's low quality.

82
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:39,500
Yeah.

83
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,540
It is.

84
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,500
And so if somebody has something, I mean,

85
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,060
you know, yeah, linear, we can go to

86
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:44,620
a date though.

87
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,860
Usually if it's recent and find a comment

88
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,240
or find a response or find a video

89
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,380
or a picture or whatever.

90
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,200
And if somebody has a better idea, I

91
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,560
say, sure, show us, tell us, you know,

92
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,220
but let's not get into, you know, everybody's

93
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,540
got to sign up for crap and whatever

94
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:00,840
else.

95
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,280
Like in other words, build it, build it

96
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,420
and he will come despite the Mandela effect.

97
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:07,620
Sorry.

98
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,180
Yeah.

99
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:08,600
We did.

100
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,660
Well, we did.

101
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:09,860
Sorry.

102
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,060
We did set up the tango.

103
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,080
You do have to sign in.

104
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,620
It's not public, but it's like, you know,

105
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,440
today I kind of like, it reminds me

106
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,600
of the old HTML days when websites were

107
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,540
very plain and simple and there was a

108
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,400
lot, the heydays.

109
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,880
That's what I should say.

110
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,780
It reminds me of the heydays of the

111
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,760
internet right back, back when it was more

112
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,220
whatever.

113
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,220
But yeah, I can't get into, I mean,

114
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,500
like I just said on the earlier previous

115
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,020
Sonic, I heard about the archaics underground and

116
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,580
he's talking about it and he said, there's

117
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,220
a health and wellness.

118
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,140
All right, let me go check it out.

119
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:39,920
And I signed in.

120
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,460
And like I said, I just can't, I

121
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,200
don't know where to start.

122
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,840
I looked at whatever else was posted as

123
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,660
my stuff.

124
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,680
This stuff is so contrary, even though it'll

125
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,140
be helpful.

126
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,660
I just can't sit there and type all

127
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,840
day or whatever.

128
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,420
So no, but it's something like that.

129
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,140
You want to do something, something more elaborate.

130
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,860
Most forums tend to be category based and

131
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,500
member based and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

132
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,140
Someone wants to set it up.

133
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,620
It's fine.

134
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,140
Yeah.

135
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,440
Because look, either we could use the facilities

136
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,260
on Patreon and do something similar to what

137
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,360
it is they're asking for.

138
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,399
Or if you have a better solution, look,

139
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:15,980
build it.

140
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:16,480
No, I don't.

141
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,240
No, not you.

142
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,959
I'm saying you, the listener, you, the listener,

143
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,940
have a better solution.

144
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,980
Do me a favor and go ahead and

145
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,680
show me what it is and I'll work

146
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,160
with you on it and we'll develop it

147
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,760
and we'll just give Greek, you know, the

148
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,600
password or whatever.

149
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,740
And Chitango, you don't even need to sign

150
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:30,940
in.

151
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,160
You can go in anonymously.

152
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,220
But right.

153
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:34,780
Right.

154
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,760
Sort of.

155
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,380
Sort of.

156
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,860
We changed it because someone was posting porn

157
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:43,220
or something and yeah, well, I don't know.

158
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,780
I like to see more progress, progress in

159
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,980
what we talk about and if a forum

160
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,300
is the way to do it, fine.

161
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:51,620
Yeah.

162
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,220
Yeah.

163
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:52,820
No problem.

164
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,380
But like I said, you're not going to

165
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:54,760
build it.

166
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,500
And like, you know, if somebody else establishes

167
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,240
it, though, show me and we will integrate

168
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,020
it into everything.

169
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,100
I don't want to have 80 forums though.

170
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,440
So let's, you know, be selective.

171
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,120
You agree?

172
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:08,780
Hmm.

173
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,020
What do you think?

174
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,040
We have two right now.

175
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:11,560
The Patreon.

176
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,100
Yeah.

177
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,760
Well, there's the Patreon, the Chitango.

178
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,300
So the rest is, I don't know.

179
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:15,640
I mean.

180
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,320
Well, yeah.

181
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,320
But, you know, I see when you start

182
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,680
getting into people's preferences, right?

183
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,100
Somebody might say, well, I'm comfortable with Facebook.

184
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,380
Well, I would rather work in a, you

185
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,760
know, what they used to call Twitter X

186
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,820
spaces.

187
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,020
Somebody else might say, well, look, we should

188
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,960
use Reddit where you can do different subreddits,

189
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,500
you know, and OK.

190
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,360
And only people that are going to want

191
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,380
to find the Greek subreddit will find the

192
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,100
Greek subreddit.

193
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,360
But, you know, it's up to you guys.

194
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,320
If you have a better way so that

195
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,260
we can do this better.

196
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,300
Look, I'm not saying that I'm 100 percent

197
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,300
familiar with forums and obviously the Greek doesn't

198
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:50,980
do that all day.

199
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:51,320
Yeah.

200
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:51,940
You know.

201
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:52,500
Yeah.

202
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,360
Look, these these social media are like you

203
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,560
got mall security, you know, the malls, shopping

204
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,680
malls have mall security.

205
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,760
I'd rather hang out at the park, you

206
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,400
know, you know what I mean?

207
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,220
Like a public park that's more open.

208
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,940
So the more open, you know, like I

209
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,260
said, you know me, I'm going to read

210
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,520
the back in the day when I was

211
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,680
on Revolution Radio 15 years ago or more,

212
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:18,100
I started telling people, start reading terms and

213
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,000
services of anything you sign up for and

214
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,360
everything.

215
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,700
And, you know, I was explaining to them

216
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,140
is where did you get that Greek?

217
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,880
It's in the terms and services.

218
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,640
So, you know, you got to read.

219
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:35,220
So unfortunately, I've read Twitter's services in terms

220
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,180
and legal and all that.

221
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,040
I've read Facebook.

222
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,740
There's no way I'm going to sign up

223
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,280
for that.

224
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:39,560
Right.

225
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,700
And we have you read what they're what?

226
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,200
Yeah.

227
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,800
What they're lauding over your head.

228
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:44,920
No way.

229
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,320
Some so no.

230
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,940
Some of them, they tell you all about

231
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,980
taking your data and all that.

232
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,940
And the worst, by the way, is the

233
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,720
YouTube community.

234
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,640
So don't even suggest that because that's why

235
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,500
I never went there.

236
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:55,720
Yeah.

237
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,120
Right.

238
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,420
And even worse than that is the comments

239
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,020
on YouTube.

240
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,140
Worse than the communities before they even built

241
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:01,720
the communities.

242
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,220
The comments showed you what the communities are

243
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:04,880
going to look like.

244
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,820
So no, I can't read comments, but fortunately,

245
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,280
we have a pretty good group comment situation

246
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,020
with Chitango.

247
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,780
Like they're pretty cogent to the subject and

248
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,160
fairly well, let's say, educated.

249
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,660
Right.

250
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,240
So it's it's linear and it's a fairly

251
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,560
decent except for that one porn poster.

252
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,500
But but then again, look, you open up

253
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,240
your phone lines, you know, publicly on the

254
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,760
airwaves, you're going to get prank calls, too.

255
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,640
So, you know, it's just a way of

256
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,020
things.

257
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,200
There are clowns.

258
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,660
Yeah, that's fine.

259
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,500
I don't know, man, I'm putting the time

260
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,240
Greeks time is going towards developing projects, tech

261
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,540
projects, which include weather and biology.

262
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,860
And I give an example like today, it's

263
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,880
it's even it's like seven or eight ish

264
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,400
for me here.

265
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,700
And it's my day is at noontime.

266
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,900
Like in other words, I still got another

267
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,860
three or four hours of stuff to do

268
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,900
as if it was, you know, as if

269
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,660
daylights burning.

270
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,020
Right.

271
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,300
And it's not because I don't have time.

272
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,000
This is where I want to dedicate my

273
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,220
time.

274
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,040
There's a difference, right?

275
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,260
You know, people say, I don't have time

276
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:13,600
for that.

277
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,080
Well, all you have is time.

278
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,440
So manage it.

279
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,120
Parcel it out.

280
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,560
Put your time where, you know, when someone

281
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,880
tells you, I don't have time means it's

282
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,780
just not important.

283
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,520
Just like when someone says, I can't afford

284
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,640
that, you can afford anything.

285
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,400
You can you can afford a billion, a

286
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,320
billion dollar yacht.

287
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,700
If you know how to work the credit

288
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,179
system, it's all everything's affordable.

289
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,740
It's what you want to afford, because if

290
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,720
you get that 200 mile an hour Ferrari

291
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,600
or that billion dollar yacht, once you got

292
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,059
it, can you can you keep it?

293
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,760
Do you know what kind of uptake it

294
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,000
keeps?

295
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,299
Right.

296
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,620
So same with the forums and all that

297
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:43,900
stuff.

298
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,840
They do need maintenance.

299
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,180
They do need adult supervision to a degree.

300
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,220
And they do need input.

301
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:49,500
Right.

302
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,460
Last thing you want is, you know, I

303
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,300
went over that forum.

304
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,680
There's nothing really there, you know.

305
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,840
So you want to kind of keep it

306
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,820
interesting, but it needs to be supervised and

307
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,100
all that.

308
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,220
Someone wants to take that on.

309
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:58,700
That's fine.

310
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,280
Right.

311
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,160
I'm not.

312
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,800
I elect not to put my energy there.

313
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,340
The most I elect to do is to

314
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,140
is to show up and do these Sonics

315
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,660
and keep that going for whoever is interested

316
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,040
in it, because I know it's helped quite

317
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,440
a few people because I do get not

318
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,780
often, but I have gotten a 24 page

319
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,220
email.

320
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:19,800
Right.

321
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,380
I don't know how many words that would

322
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:21,860
be.

323
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:27,660
I get 10 page emails and I do

324
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,200
read them.

325
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,960
Some messages when I'm busy or too long,

326
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,140
I'll just say I'll have to go back

327
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,840
and I see I acknowledge that I got

328
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,160
it now.

329
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,820
I'll read it again and comment later and

330
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,260
it might be two months before I comment.

331
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,880
And I've had at least 100 people since

332
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,880
I've been doing Sonics say that it's changed

333
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,820
their entire life.

334
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,280
Right.

335
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:47,960
Right.

336
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,620
For the better.

337
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,980
I really haven't anyone say it's changed their

338
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,260
life for the worst.

339
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,120
By the way, if if this Greek stuff,

340
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,600
diatribe stuff that we talk about and before

341
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,440
has made your life worse, let me know

342
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,540
because it's you're right.

343
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,640
I'm not saying difficult.

344
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,780
Yeah, we'll be more difficult, but better qualitatively

345
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,780
and quantitatively in many ways also.

346
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,180
Yeah.

347
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,880
So I think that's worth doing.

348
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:15,340
Right.

349
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,740
I think, in other words, keep keep going

350
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:17,980
on.

351
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,560
And as new people come on, we don't

352
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,900
have a good historical category where they can

353
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,800
go back and listen to, quote unquote, health

354
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,580
or fitness and or tech stuff or like

355
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,960
some people interested in the water.

356
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,500
Where do I find about the scale or

357
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:30,980
eight or tech?

358
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:31,240
Right.

359
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,420
We don't have categories like that.

360
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,640
So when there's new enough new people, I

361
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,220
kind of have to start over at square

362
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:38,560
one.

363
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:38,820
Right.

364
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,260
Well, kind of.

365
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,780
But then again, there is somebody working on

366
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,900
a transcript of every single one of these,

367
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,280
in which case you could make it.

368
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,360
So and that could be something uploaded to

369
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:48,760
a form.

370
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,980
But, you know, these forms require administrators and

371
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:55,400
even Bashir's has people administer, you know, take

372
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,320
care of the commentary.

373
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,540
He's got a whole thing.

374
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,620
He's got a whole thing going.

375
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,420
He's got an entire year.

376
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,860
He calls it the archaic empire.

377
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,020
And he and I, I'm not a social

378
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,540
person like that.

379
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,680
I'm very social on the engineering tech stuff.

380
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,260
Like I said, I want to advance certain

381
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,620
things to help whoever wants to use it.

382
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,780
But my thing is not sitting in front

383
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:21,220
of the computer and writing papers or books.

384
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:21,760
Right.

385
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,820
But that's another thing.

386
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,120
Yeah.

387
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,120
The final write a book.

388
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:24,960
I'll never do that.

389
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:25,560
Exactly.

390
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,360
The final thought here, though, just I want

391
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,680
to get this across is that I think

392
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,400
very much in the spirit of everything that's

393
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,380
been done on Rated Y is, you know

394
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:33,640
what?

395
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,520
If you see something that doesn't exist that

396
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,680
you think should, why not build it yourself

397
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,320
and make it happen?

398
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,480
Because isn't that the way of things here?

399
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,180
Look, you need to get something done, figure

400
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,920
out how to do it and do it.

401
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,900
I mean, is that not really one of

402
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,880
the general through lines here that we see

403
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,940
throughout all these Sonics is that, you know

404
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,940
what, if it's not there, make it be

405
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,220
there.

406
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,220
Create it.

407
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,300
Well, yeah.

408
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,580
One of the things that somebody asked me

409
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:03,500
before, Harry, if you're listening, how are you

410
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,100
doing pretty well?

411
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,560
He said, so what do you want to

412
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,020
do, really?

413
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,040
What do you want to do in life?

414
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,100
It's about a year ago.

415
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,140
And I said, you know, I really want

416
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,980
to help mentor young people because they're not

417
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,640
getting it from their parents or not getting

418
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,340
it from school.

419
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,800
Like, you know, when you sign an application

420
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,920
to go to college, that application actually paid

421
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,500
for the tuition.

422
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,640
Then they ask you to pay for it

423
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:23,900
again.

424
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,700
Any application, how the human body really works,

425
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,700
biology, how it works, weather, work, water, work,

426
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,980
just you want to talk about ancient texts

427
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,980
like the religious texts, just the basics, you

428
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,940
know, just the basic, basic fundamentals.

429
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,740
They're not getting it from anyone.

430
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,220
And I know there's still a communication issue.

431
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,820
Years ago, I laid into the Skype group

432
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,400
was 15, 20, 30 people.

433
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,100
I laid into them.

434
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,620
I said, shame on you guys not networking,

435
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,540
because I remember back in the day, being

436
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,320
on the East Coast, NYC, Park Slope, Brooklyn

437
00:12:59,320 --> 00:12:59,960
and all that.

438
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,400
You run into people on the sidewalk, having

439
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,680
a conversation and you're with someone that they,

440
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,540
you know, you introduce them to someone else,

441
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,340
you know, for the first time.

442
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,480
And then you come to find out a

443
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,900
month later, they got together.

444
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,060
And then, you know, one guy does this,

445
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,540
the other guy does that complimentary.

446
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,320
You know, he met his sister, got married,

447
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:18,720
whatever.

448
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,100
And he's like, wow, this is great.

449
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,120
When you introduce people to each other, they

450
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,600
network.

451
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,960
They, you know, it's not just a shallow,

452
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,240
you know, greeting.

453
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,200
You know, you say, hey, what are you

454
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,780
guys doing?

455
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,960
You know, what can I do to help?

456
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,300
You know, you know, you know the Greek.

457
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,300
Hey, I know the Greek, too.

458
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,260
OK, why do this?

459
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:34,780
You do that.

460
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,460
OK, good.

461
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:36,740
You know, whatever.

462
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,660
Like some real simple would be the guy

463
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,520
had a pizzeria.

464
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,920
I introduced him to someone that I knew

465
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,820
who was an AC guy, gave him his

466
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,180
card.

467
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,800
A week later, the AC wasn't working in

468
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,400
the pizzeria.

469
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,240
Guess who he called?

470
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,580
The guy introduced him to.

471
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,060
Right.

472
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,100
Fixed his AC.

473
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:52,980
Right.

474
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,940
And I found this going on constantly.

475
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,880
It's like matchmaking and all that.

476
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,320
And I get on the Internet and you've

477
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,460
got audiences of, I don't know, half a

478
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,160
dozen people to 50 people.

479
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,280
And no one is.

480
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,760
What do you call it?

481
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:08,860
Networking.

482
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,920
What else would you say?

483
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,520
You know, I mean, they're not getting together

484
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,000
and doing anything, even regionally.

485
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,800
I remember we have people on Skype and

486
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,820
regionally like four or five of them were

487
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,420
in the L.A. area and not even

488
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,780
it's like, damn, man.

489
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,340
What?

490
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,380
Where are you?

491
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,160
You know, get together, you know, even if

492
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,940
you're not like exchange ideas.

493
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,120
Like, what do you do?

494
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,520
You know, what is what I do?

495
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,780
Hey, go work with it.

496
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,760
You know what I mean?

497
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,440
That's what a real community does.

498
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,560
And I was shocked.

499
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,700
I think it's an Internet phenomenon.

500
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,660
Maybe, maybe not.

501
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,980
But I remember again being in back in

502
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,620
New York City, you know, when I over

503
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,200
the years introducing people come to find out

504
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,660
they worked with each other or did, you

505
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,220
know, exchange.

506
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,740
It wasn't more just, you know.

507
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:53,320
Right.

508
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:53,660
Right.

509
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,140
You know what I'm talking about, right?

510
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,220
So look, I don't see that happening.

511
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,040
No, that's that is the trouble here.

512
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,660
Look, you have every opportunity to build a

513
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,000
community.

514
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,380
It's kind of a natural thing that you

515
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,080
can do where you, yeah, begin to interact

516
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,500
with people.

517
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,380
OK, we both see something the same way.

518
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,280
I mean, it's like meeting somebody at a

519
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,060
baseball game or something stupid because, look, you

520
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,240
both enjoyed baseball now build and you can

521
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:16,480
build.

522
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,600
Oh, well, this is more.

523
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,520
Yeah, this is more than that, because they're

524
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,440
being introduced to coming to a common thing.

525
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,180
But here's the thing.

526
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,920
Maybe that's the natural way of things.

527
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:27,380
Maybe the Internet, the cyber thing or whatever

528
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,240
is unnatural.

529
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,460
It's so unnatural that people just don't do

530
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:30,700
that.

531
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,760
You know, once the terminal or whatever device

532
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,340
they're using is is off or they're away

533
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,760
from it, everything that went transpired on it

534
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,340
is forgotten.

535
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,180
I don't know.

536
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,540
I just found it to be a very

537
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,780
frustrating phenomenon.

538
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:43,980
Right.

539
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:44,560
But there's nothing.

540
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,580
There's nothing stopping that.

541
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,820
That's my main point.

542
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,200
Yeah, there's nothing stopping people from interacting with

543
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:49,900
one another, though.

544
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,300
And look, the community, the community thing on

545
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:53,700
Patreon.

546
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,640
Look, build, build this other thing and show

547
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,580
me another community that we could build that'll

548
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,000
be better.

549
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,020
That's fine.

550
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:00,660
You know what?

551
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:00,860
Yeah.

552
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,560
Now, as a as a rebuttal.

553
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:02,840
Yeah.

554
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,080
Yeah.

555
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,800
But as a rebuttal to what I said,

556
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,460
I've recently come to find out by just,

557
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,100
you know, not tapping into it, but just

558
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,040
hearing crosstalk in the past year or so,

559
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,120
a lot more people have, especially from the

560
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,960
older Skype groups from 10 years ago, whatever,

561
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,040
till recently, the more people are getting to

562
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,160
know each other.

563
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,300
So I'm taking a little bit of it

564
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,040
back because I'm finding out behind the scenes.

565
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,000
There's a lot more networking, you know, people

566
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,460
that have come to the rated Y are

567
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:33,500
networking more than ever before, which is good.

568
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,140
But initially, my I was in shock years

569
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,420
ago when I found out that was.

570
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:38,880
I don't know.

571
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,700
I just like to see people benefit from

572
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,160
the meeting.
