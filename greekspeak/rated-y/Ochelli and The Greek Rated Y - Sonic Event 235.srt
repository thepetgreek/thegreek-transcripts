1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,020
Hey, Rated Y, 235, that's what it appears

2
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:12,580
to be.

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,560
And how are you today, Creek?

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,000
Yeah, you, are you, yeah, all that and

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,460
above.

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,300
That's how are you with a capital O.

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,200
You know, soon, soon, I never knew, I

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,660
never know how to answer that.

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,700
I never, I never figured out the proper

10
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,080
way to answer that in English, other than

11
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:34,680
the nice city.

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,240
I'm fine.

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:35,880
How are you?

14
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,300
And then you say, well, I'm fine.

15
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,520
How are you?

16
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,100
That's all right.

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,500
You never give a complete or honest answer

18
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,460
about that when asked, I mean, to be

19
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,160
straight, right?

20
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,800
I mean, isn't that correct?

21
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,920
I'm pretty, I'm pretty honest.

22
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,280
We, we know we're going to meet and

23
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,600
do a sonic and, um, yeah.

24
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,020
And I, so what I do is I

25
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,000
usually drop everything that I'm doing sometimes literally

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,340
and, uh, run to the computer and, you

27
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,900
know, I'm usually on time and, uh, or

28
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,640
the phone, but I'm not, I'm getting another

29
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,520
phone now.

30
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,360
Someone's getting me a phone and, um, that'll,

31
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,020
that'll work.

32
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,600
So I can walk around and do other

33
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,080
stuff, but yeah, it's just, everything's cool, man.

34
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:17,620
Yeah.

35
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,160
Excellent.

36
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:18,680
All right.

37
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,400
Well, you sound pretty mellow tonight, so I

38
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,620
guess we'll just get, cause I'm tired.

39
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,040
Yeah.

40
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,020
I've been doing a 3 a.m. to

41
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,380
midnight for a long time.

42
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,260
So, uh, well look, and eventually, uh, you

43
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,540
will have to rest a bit more.

44
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,000
I mean, again, appropriate to age and what

45
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,700
your condition is and what it is you're

46
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,040
doing.

47
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,700
That's how you have to adjust your health,

48
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,260
but maybe we'll get to that a little

49
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:40,580
later.

50
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,920
Let's just go at the questions.

51
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,860
Okay.

52
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,560
Follow up question about teeth, because there was

53
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,240
a bit of a few questions about teeth

54
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:48,660
recently.

55
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,240
I'm trying to understand if, if the Greek

56
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,320
put dental implants in after losing his teeth

57
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,460
and what's his view on them, I had

58
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,700
two teeth removed and I'd been thinking what

59
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,240
to do.

60
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,990
Never said implant.

61
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,090
Basically it was a fixture or temporary.

62
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:09,009
It's a flipper.

63
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,430
It's a small partial is what I called.

64
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:15,670
Uh, it's, it's called a partial, it's called

65
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:19,010
a temporary, a flipper in dental parlance.

66
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:25,770
Uh, and, uh, it's technically a denture, a

67
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,830
denture could be one tooth, you know, I

68
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,890
know if you know anyone who's a professional

69
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,910
hockey player, they all have that in the

70
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,430
front, right?

71
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,430
Uh, you want to be able to remove

72
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,990
it for the game, right?

73
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,230
Or a boxer or whatever.

74
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,890
Uh, I think Leon Spinks too, um, he

75
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,130
had a great set of teeth until he

76
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,330
took them out for a fight, right?

77
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:49,070
So you know, uh, it's a partial, what

78
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,610
it is, it's a, it's actually an acrylic,

79
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:55,170
a high mineral contact acrylic that's molded to

80
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,970
your palate for the upper and, and for

81
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,590
the mandible or the jaw for the lower,

82
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,430
it's a little more technical because you have

83
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,770
saliva glands in that area.

84
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:06,990
Uh, they typically are made way too thick.

85
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,370
Uh, they have to be, I contour them

86
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,370
and reinforce them.

87
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,610
Uh, yeah, it's a denture actually.

88
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,610
No, no implants.

89
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:15,850
Okay.

90
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:19,690
Now implant, they're literally putting a fence post

91
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:22,510
into, into your bone, whether it's your jaw

92
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,210
or your skull, right?

93
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,610
They're going to actually, you've seen how fence

94
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,690
posts are put in literally, it's the same

95
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,890
exact principle.

96
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,770
And it's, it's called an abutment for something

97
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,150
to connect to the, and it's, it could

98
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,690
be threaded or bonded.

99
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,230
Uh, they put a false tooth on that

100
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,770
post that goes into the, into the, uh,

101
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:42,550
body.

102
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:44,830
And I'm, I'm, I'm against those for several

103
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:48,170
reasons, uh, depending on the tooth condition.

104
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,930
Like for example, if, uh, if you have

105
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,630
bone decay, right, where teeth go loose and

106
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:56,450
break or fall out, uh, the, the posts

107
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,030
usually don't take because it's too soft.

108
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,310
And you're actually creating, uh, an area that

109
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,950
it's going to irritate the bone even more.

110
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:07,450
I highly recommend temporary a flipper.

111
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:10,210
Just if you talk to the dentist, say

112
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,810
I want a flipper or temporary, I want

113
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,110
to try it out and get yourself a

114
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:17,190
Dremel with some, with some, um, burrs, diamond

115
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,649
burrs and whittle it down.

116
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,370
Uh, get yourself some carbon paper and you

117
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,250
bite on the carbon paper and guess what

118
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:24,750
that does.

119
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,530
It leaves a trace where you need to

120
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,390
whittle it down right for the bite and,

121
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,870
uh, just to look up.

122
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,450
I don't know how many good YouTube videos

123
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:35,150
are on doing sculpture or wood carving, actually

124
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,390
carving with a, with a rotary tool and

125
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,410
then polish it out.

126
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:42,690
And you've got yourself, um, a removable, whatever.

127
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,330
I think the why in this now, maybe

128
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,130
I'm wrong, but you know, check my thinking.

129
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,390
The why in this, why you would suggest

130
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,310
the partial as opposed to say, getting the

131
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,030
implant is a little deeper because, yeah, as

132
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,170
opposed to the implant, the partial or the

133
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:57,890
denture is better.

134
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:58,650
That's what I was saying.

135
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,410
Uh, but the thing is that it's not

136
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,050
just about the fact that you lost your

137
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:04,390
tooth.

138
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,490
It is the condition.

139
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,830
Your gum didn't want to hold onto the

140
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,110
tooth.

141
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,690
I mean, it might not want to hold

142
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,110
onto the unnatural posts.

143
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,430
So you know, I'm just thinking logically, the

144
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,330
bone, not the gum.

145
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,490
It would be the bone.

146
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:15,770
Yeah.

147
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:16,510
The bone.

148
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,330
But either way, yeah.

149
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,550
The condition of your mouth.

150
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:19,770
No, seriously.

151
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,290
Okay.

152
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,350
Well, also look, when you have a tooth,

153
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,670
when you have a tooth in the socket,

154
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,490
whether it's the upper or lower, there's something

155
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,290
called a PDL periodontal ligament.

156
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,010
It's literally a shock absorber.

157
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,310
So the tooth, which is very hard, doesn't

158
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,810
go into a hard substructure or structure like

159
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:36,110
the bone.

160
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,170
You have a periodontal ligaments called the PDL.

161
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:43,250
Very often when a extraction is done, they

162
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:43,990
don't address it.

163
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,690
And when the socket heals over, the periodontal

164
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,550
ligaments in there, which sends a signal to

165
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,070
the body that the tooth is still there,

166
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,970
sends blood to the area, and you could

167
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,990
have a problem later on.

168
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:55,970
Yeah.

169
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:59,470
Hilda Clark addresses that, and it's funny because

170
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,870
when I tell people if they're getting an

171
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,410
extraction, I ask if they're going to clean

172
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,970
out the PDL and use like a number

173
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,470
eight or number 10 burr to clean it

174
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:07,690
out.

175
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,490
You know, it means, you know, you're going

176
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,110
to clean it out really well, make sure

177
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:12,710
it's all gone.

178
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,090
And they're like, wow, I haven't, the dentist's

179
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,070
typical remark is I haven't heard of that

180
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,090
since I was in college.

181
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,010
You know, how many extractions have you done

182
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,710
in the past 20 years that go improperly,

183
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:22,930
right?

184
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,310
Right.

185
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,570
So, um, and, and I've been a victim

186
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,510
of a sloppy, I've been a victim of

187
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,190
a sloppy one or two of those because

188
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,470
I don't know if I ever told you,

189
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:33,030
but occasionally I get phantom pains where it's

190
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,810
like the tooth is still there, it feels

191
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,470
like it's still the bad tooth every once

192
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:36,810
in a while.

193
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,970
And I'm like, oh, that's exactly what you're

194
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:39,390
talking about.

195
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:42,950
PDL mostly, it's probably the PDL periodontal ligament

196
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,630
and look it up.

197
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,430
It's very, and the other thing is when

198
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,770
you have an extraction, we're almost all dentists

199
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,770
don't tell you that the opposite tooth on

200
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:52,090
the bite will start erupting, start growing into

201
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:52,730
that gap.

202
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,870
So let's say you have an extraction on

203
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:58,290
the upper, uh, the lower tooth where that

204
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,970
gap is, we'll start growing into it.

205
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,670
So now instead of having an even, uh,

206
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,710
bottom row right under where the gap is

207
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,350
on the top, that tooth wants to fill

208
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,670
in the gap and it just keeps growing

209
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,670
up and growing up.

210
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:13,230
The tooth itself does not elongate, but you'll

211
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,130
see it almost, you can almost see the

212
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:15,770
roots sometimes.

213
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,250
It just wants to reach and close that

214
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:17,630
gap.

215
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:17,950
Right.

216
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:20,370
So I tell people, I said, did you

217
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,390
know, did the dentist tell you you have

218
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,110
this thing called eruption and the tooth be

219
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,350
prepared for that?

220
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:25,670
Right.

221
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,330
So, um, yeah, yeah.

222
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,290
And I was like, no, I didn't say

223
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:29,490
anything.

224
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,970
And I went back and he was surprised

225
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:31,850
that I said it.

226
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,610
So yeah, these, these guys are morons.

227
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,270
The member, they have a, you really want

228
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:36,950
to hear the joke.

229
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,110
It's the joke and the punchline.

230
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:41,530
They are state certified, state licensed, right?

231
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,050
That's all you got to say.

232
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,030
Yeah.

233
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,170
So, uh, but it don't underestimate the importance

234
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,850
of a dentist though, a dentist and a

235
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,590
barber, right?

236
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,770
And let's cut your own hair, but a

237
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,010
barber is also a surgeon.

238
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,090
I think that should come back, but, um,

239
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,990
no, I'm not into the, uh, there's a

240
00:07:58,990 --> 00:07:59,710
big fad.

241
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,710
The reason why they want to do, uh,

242
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,090
implants is cause they're expensive.

243
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:08,170
Um, they're, they can justify, uh, the costs,

244
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:08,470
right?

245
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,910
So I play with a lot of, um,

246
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,050
energy systems and the last thing I want

247
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,670
is a metal post in my skull or

248
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:14,990
jaw.

249
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:15,490
Right.

250
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:15,850
Right.

251
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,670
So use your own discretion.

252
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,210
I'm not saying no, but you know, you

253
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,730
want a metal post in there, you know,

254
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,190
that it's actually threaded in there.

255
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,070
Yeah.

256
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,010
Uh, depends.

257
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:30,850
I, I, um, a good implants probably better

258
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:34,270
than a bad temporary flipper denture, but a

259
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:38,130
good denture is better than a bad post.

260
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,370
And the chances that you're going to get

261
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,409
a good post are slim.

262
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,210
So go for the denture is another way.

263
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,970
Another like mathematical way to look at it,

264
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:46,190
right?

265
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,350
Another common sense.

266
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,470
Another common sense element is it's a lot

267
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,010
easier for you to take that out of

268
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,130
your mouth and work on it yourself than

269
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,730
it is if you got something that's kind

270
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,030
of, you know, anchored in there.

271
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,910
So, you know, especially if they don't do

272
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:59,290
it, right.

273
00:08:59,530 --> 00:08:59,710
Yeah.

274
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,450
What are they going to do?

275
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:01,890
They get one chance to do it, you

276
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:02,090
know?

277
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:02,610
Right.

278
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,630
And then you got to drill a hole

279
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,810
and yeah, and then you got to deal

280
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,090
with it.

281
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:07,250
Yeah.

282
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,270
And I've heard a lot of negative comments,

283
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,550
uh, here, here's the quandary with it.

284
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,190
The best people in any sort of the

285
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,870
ones that dropped out of school by the

286
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,870
eighth grade are on, are on the FBI

287
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,110
most wanted list, right?

288
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:21,830
Most likely.

289
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,050
And those people will not be state certified.

290
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,850
You won't be able to get state certification

291
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:27,670
if you qualify.

292
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:27,970
Right.

293
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:28,930
So now you're going to have to put

294
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:32,570
up with morons that finished school, paid for

295
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:35,010
college about two, three times, right?

296
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,590
They got jixed by the call.

297
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:39,290
They got jerked by their own school, uh,

298
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:41,090
because you know, the application for the school

299
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,570
pays for the tuition by the way.

300
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:46,650
And uh, you actually have to go sign

301
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:49,550
all this stuff to get state certification.

302
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,630
You are, you gotta be like a normie

303
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,670
that's off the rock off there, like a

304
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,650
normie that fell out, fell off their bar

305
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:59,350
stool to do that, whether, you know, to

306
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,630
be a medical or a whatever.

307
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,190
So you gotta balance that out.

308
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,410
I mean, put it this way.

309
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,910
If you stayed in school enough to go

310
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,130
to college and get a state degree, a

311
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:12,150
state license, you're a freaking moron.

312
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,610
You mean, or in other words, you don't

313
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,270
read, you just, you're just, you're just, um,

314
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:19,150
norm normally a very good person, right?

315
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,510
It's just for society and you just go

316
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,550
along your life doing what you're told to

317
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,750
do on TV and, uh, peers who are

318
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,010
morons in themselves.

319
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:32,030
So yeah, so that's, that's the quandaries part.

320
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,850
So it's just, this is kind of like

321
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:34,970
the relationship.

322
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:38,530
Just find a dentist that doesn't, uh, you

323
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:40,310
don't find to be, what did we say,

324
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,630
uh, when you was something that someone can't

325
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,090
change that you don't like repugnant to you,

326
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,310
right?

327
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:45,830
Or whatever.

328
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,830
Uh, yeah.

329
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,970
Just find someone that's sort of agreeable and

330
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:50,550
then train them.

331
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,950
And if they're not trainable, then go find

332
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:53,610
another one.

333
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,710
A dental school will probably be the best

334
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:57,470
in big cities.

335
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,330
I don't think small towns have dental schools,

336
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,330
you know, cause if you're in a small

337
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,870
town and you want it, you're probably going

338
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,090
to have to go to a bigger college

339
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:03,890
in a bigger city.

340
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:04,170
Right.

341
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:08,410
So yeah, depending on, uh, I know that

342
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,910
there's a lot of that stuff in the

343
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,690
Midwest, like Kansas and all that, because you

344
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,470
know, they were going to fortify in the

345
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,330
early 20th century, they were going to fortify

346
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:18,690
the middle of the country, uh, because basically

347
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,810
FDR wanted to go to war with the

348
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:23,310
entire world and he wanted to put most

349
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,530
of the important infrastructure right smack in the

350
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:28,130
center, like Kansas and all Oklahoma, you know,

351
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,910
all that central area.

352
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,810
So they, if you have a landing of

353
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,450
army, they have to march a long way

354
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:34,810
to get to the key infrastructure.

355
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,430
But there was so much sabotage you don't

356
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,130
hear about, you know, what is it?

357
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,790
A million and a half Americans, 2 million

358
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:43,090
Americans died during world war II here on

359
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:46,750
the mainland, but due to sabotage and you,

360
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,510
yeah, you don't hear about it.

361
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:51,430
I mean, 5,001 night, I mean, uh,

362
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,530
yeah, fires, bombings, all that stuff.

363
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,210
You don't hear any of that.

364
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,690
They call it the great generation.

365
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:56,930
Yeah.

366
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:57,450
My ass.

367
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:00,170
So there was a good reason why I

368
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,650
was just going to say, there's a very

369
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,630
good logical reason why they went to lucky

370
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,630
Luciano to protect the ports in New York,

371
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:09,550
you know, uh, because they needed somebody who

372
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,510
could actually get the job done and moving

373
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,610
it to the middle of the country.

374
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,710
Also provided them with a little bit more,

375
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,070
you know, of a buffer for air aerial

376
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,830
attacks as well, as well as what you

377
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,030
were talking about, the marches.

378
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:20,270
Yeah.

379
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,090
So they got a, they got a 5

380
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,530
,000 miles in inland and believe it or

381
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:26,310
not, it wouldn't be that hard to do

382
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:29,310
anyway, based on the competency of the military

383
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:32,230
anyway, well, but that's yet another issue.

384
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,110
Yeah.

385
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:33,750
Okay.

386
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:34,850
So how about this?

387
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:35,750
Issues everywhere.

388
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:36,510
Exactly.

389
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,170
Well, we'll move along for now.

390
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,070
You know, there might be more dental questions

391
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,070
later, but not today.

392
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:41,230
Okay.

393
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,450
Uh, whatever happened to possible debate with DAC

394
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:47,550
Hillman, uh, would like to hear about the

395
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:51,150
Greeks opinion, uh, you know, uh, number one,

396
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,550
geez, being a pederast.

397
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:53,070
Okay.

398
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,310
Now look, there's that.

399
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:57,550
And then there's a followup to this irrelevant,

400
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:02,970
irrelevant on the overall challenge to the public

401
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:05,190
perception of the overall subject.

402
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,090
Once you start correcting it, right, it's kind

403
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,250
of like nine 11, right?

404
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:09,670
Mm.

405
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,250
Uh, the most, what most people think of

406
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,890
nine 11 is, uh, 19 Arab hijackers vaporized

407
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,690
the world trade center with box cutters.

408
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,410
And it's funny people say that's ridiculous.

409
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:21,130
So we'll tell me the official story if

410
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,270
that's not ridiculous.

411
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:26,930
So the official, uh, yeah, uh, it's all

412
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:29,690
presumed, but they're missing the salient points.

413
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:30,630
They're missing the stuff.

414
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,890
Uh, it wasn't even a debate.

415
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:33,970
I'm not challenging.

416
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:37,410
I just want to bring forward, uh, here's

417
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:37,650
the thing.

418
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,430
Let's say there was a debate, me versus

419
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:39,770
whatever.

420
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,110
I don't care about that.

421
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,950
I'll grant them the wind, right?

422
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,990
And so you can't do that.

423
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,190
Right.

424
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,470
But anyway, I want to get to the

425
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:46,870
audience.

426
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,390
I want to see who in the audience

427
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,670
will come out of their trance.

428
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,650
The trance is when you accept all the

429
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:54,810
normalcy, how things have been normalized, right?

430
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,250
So, uh, I have nothing against Solomon or

431
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,370
anyone, uh, regarding which, whatever way they go.

432
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,350
I do have a hard on for the,

433
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,410
for the Vatican though.

434
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:05,530
Okay.

435
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,810
However you want to take that.

436
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,450
I was going to say, that's a bit

437
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:13,190
of a multipurpose statement, but you know what's,

438
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,030
look, what's, what's interesting to me here.

439
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,690
And, and there was a followup about this

440
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,110
debate question that I want to read to

441
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:20,150
you as well, because it shows me that

442
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,630
people just say there's no debate F sorry,

443
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,870
after the archaics interview, someone reached out to

444
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:27,370
me that we wanted to get Breshears, uh,

445
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:30,210
Jason, uh, myself, Hillman and one other person.

446
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:33,530
And he basically said, well, you're, you're honorable,

447
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,130
you know, you've answered both of my emails.

448
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:36,790
And I'm like, your buddy, Jason, you know,

449
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,730
he was ignoring him and I'm like, he's

450
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,190
not my buddy and no one's my buddy,

451
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:40,830
but yeah.

452
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:41,190
Okay.

453
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,570
You know, if I get an email answer,

454
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:43,750
like I said, if I get a 10

455
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,430
page email, which I do sometimes, uh, I'll,

456
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,150
I'll say, listen, uh, thank you for the

457
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:49,430
email.

458
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,050
Uh, I'll have to come back to it

459
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,390
and read it another time, you know, in

460
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,570
a couple of weeks later.

461
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:54,030
Right.

462
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,630
So that's how I view everything.

463
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,390
Just, I always tell people, if you want

464
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,730
to know what I'm thinking, just listen to

465
00:14:58,730 --> 00:14:59,330
what I'm saying.

466
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:00,150
Right.

467
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,510
So I don't mind the debate.

468
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:06,130
There's no challenge, but it's the audience that

469
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,390
I'm, that, that I want to serve.

470
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:08,770
Right.

471
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:09,970
That's why I said, oh, great.

472
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,190
If he wants to debate me on one

473
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:11,630
thing, fine.

474
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,510
I'll grant you the win.

475
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:13,010
Go ahead.

476
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:13,790
I'll make it.

477
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:14,590
I'll fix it.

478
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:15,190
So you win.

479
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:15,690
How's that?

480
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:18,270
But I want your audience, other new people

481
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,070
to hear what I have to say, because

482
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,130
here's the thing.

483
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,550
I think a lot of people fail to

484
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,750
recognize when they use the word debate, they're

485
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,610
looking for you to have a competition where

486
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:27,630
there's a winner and a loser.

487
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:30,750
That is not the entirety nor the primary

488
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,930
reason for debating.

489
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:35,990
And another person responded, debating is only ever

490
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:39,770
done by people of extremely poor character, cowardly

491
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,750
halfwits seeking approval and dominance.

492
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:44,550
Discussion is for adults.

493
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:51,170
Debate is for freetards, fretards, fretards, anyways, yeah,

494
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,570
he used an F at the beginning there.

495
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,410
It's more like a.

496
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:54,490
Go ahead.

497
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:55,310
No, I get you.

498
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:55,610
I get you.

499
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:56,950
And whoever was that, the same person put

500
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:57,530
that question.

501
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,990
It also, their follow up comment.

502
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,390
No, no, it was a different person responding

503
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:01,730
to it.

504
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,710
OK, OK.

505
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,050
I thought it was because that would be

506
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:06,210
like answering your own question.

507
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:09,770
But no, it's more of a potluck than

508
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,050
a than a boxing match.

509
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:11,390
Right.

510
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:11,730
Right.

511
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,490
So what are you going to bring?

512
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,350
And that's what I you know, I don't

513
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:15,690
mind.

514
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:16,530
Here's the thing.

515
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:19,270
I don't really find anyone that has opposing

516
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,350
views because I really if you really listen

517
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,770
to what I'm saying, I have no viewpoint.

518
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:25,130
All I do is bringing forward stuff that

519
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:27,730
you can say challenges the normal narrative on

520
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:30,030
anything But that what kind of a challenge

521
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,450
is it when you see that the normal

522
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:34,910
narrative is based on nothing Right, and what

523
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,390
I'm bringing forward is what you could look

524
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,970
at based on you know What's what could

525
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:41,550
be called that benchmark reference material memorialized data?

526
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,730
I'll go back on and on so you

527
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,990
know it's not you know I'm very that's

528
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:48,370
why I'm very confident because I don't have

529
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,210
to create anything.

530
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,830
It's already been done all I'm doing is

531
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,590
serving it right I'm like the butler or

532
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:52,930
the waiter.

533
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,390
I'm not in the kitchen right it seems

534
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:58,550
like Hillman's in the kitchen again, but that's

535
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,330
not right But see again people are like

536
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,950
debate because I want to see a winner

537
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,609
And it's again not the purpose and also

538
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:08,290
not what you do you can't debate with

539
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,670
people that refuse to even accept a premise

540
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:13,750
That's another problem So you know and and

541
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,349
if they're going to latch on to something

542
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:17,690
that is completely false, and we know it's

543
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:20,089
false How do you argue with somebody who

544
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:21,810
goes look I've seen Santa Claus on TV

545
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:24,270
I know he exists and therefore now prove

546
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:24,710
me wrong.

547
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,950
He's real What are you supposed to do

548
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:27,950
with somebody like that?

549
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,290
I wouldn't even I won't even say it's

550
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:33,770
false though because It's based on nothing right

551
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,470
so it could be true It could be

552
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,490
false and most people presume that it's true

553
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,130
if you have let's say a narrative or

554
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:42,970
structure of a story With characters and events

555
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,910
based on nothing right is it true or

556
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:46,290
false?

557
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:49,050
There's there's nothing to grab on to right,

558
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,290
so it's even worse than being false But

559
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:51,870
that's my point.

560
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,450
I'm not accepting the premise see I don't

561
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,670
know how to word these things as well

562
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:57,310
as you do sometimes But I I get

563
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,150
your point and but that's the thing it's

564
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:01,470
there's no debate to be had and even

565
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,110
if there was you're not asking For a

566
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:05,050
debate you're asking for a competition to prove

567
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:08,150
who's right and that's not up to us

568
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,230
to do in this way So you know

569
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,550
you present information, and you can take it

570
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:16,690
or not It's just that simple yeah It's

571
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:19,310
it's who in the who is listening regardless

572
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,890
of what stance they feel that they're leaning

573
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:25,050
towards or you know That wants to break

574
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,430
out of the trance that they've been in

575
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,710
their entire life right that's that's what I'm

576
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:31,150
interested in it Does it matter exactly so

577
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:33,230
subject matter is irrelevant and whoever it is

578
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,850
is irrelevant there you go precisely all right

579
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,710
So there's a follow-up to the cheese

580
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:40,510
question which I think you requested in response

581
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,410
to the question back from the Greek I

582
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:45,570
am sensitive to eggs Though less so from

583
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:48,730
my neighbors very fresh ones two of those

584
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,710
go down fine See I have the same

585
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,590
experience as this person by the way Just

586
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,430
just to say so I'd love to hear

587
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,530
this okay real quick, and I have avoided

588
00:18:56,530 --> 00:19:01,530
poultry No if the eggs say that they're

589
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,410
not a rate here's this here's you're ready

590
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,290
for this This is a drop in a

591
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:07,830
big one here Okay, if you go to

592
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,670
carton of eggs, and it says it doesn't

593
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:12,470
say specifically that it hasn't been irradiated.

594
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:15,370
It's been irradiated Even if they're organic free

595
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,930
-range Chickens that never been fucked in the

596
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:20,090
ass or all that stuff does it matter

597
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,090
this well now We just broke now.

598
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,750
We just breached the family hour now.

599
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,530
We're not a family show anymore, but anyway

600
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,090
It's it's pretty scary.

601
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,070
It's pretty scary because you think you're going

602
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:33,070
out and getting The best you know these

603
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,530
are organic free-range vegetarian bed, but they're

604
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:37,810
irradiated unless they say they're not irradiated just

605
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,790
means a high dose of x-ray for

606
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:43,150
whatever yeah, and That so that's why when

607
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,870
you get the ones that are not irradiated

608
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:47,190
Okay, think about it an egg is very

609
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,470
young on the outside extremely in on the

610
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:52,710
inside It's already balanced when you irradiate it.

611
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,390
It's extremely mean.

612
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,430
It's the most eating energy you can get

613
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:00,950
It makes the young it makes everything it

614
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,530
breaks up stuff on a very small level

615
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:06,450
torques the molecule Right so instead of the

616
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:09,110
molecule looking let's say like it should It

617
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:13,010
almost looks it's bent in half Your body

618
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:15,390
sees some of that energy or most of

619
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,730
energy is foreign And it's going to have

620
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,910
an opposite effect on you Then it should

621
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:24,290
so or it might you know again it

622
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,870
depends on If you're used to it or

623
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:29,990
not you know I mean So but anyway

624
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,710
to just I don't think I answered the

625
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:34,330
question, but the the question here is the

626
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:38,250
statement that whole food that hasn't been Transported

627
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,030
and tainted is better than the ones right

628
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:44,710
yeah, that's right Yeah, well and the other

629
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,250
thing is toxic right point.

630
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,870
Yeah, yeah Well, I was just gonna add

631
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,690
here because he has more that he was

632
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,410
answering to you about to give you more

633
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:54,830
context And I be this sort of fits

634
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:57,150
exactly with what you just said, but and

635
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:59,590
I have avoided poultry for almost 30 years

636
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:02,390
I find it disgusting especially if it slips

637
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:05,610
into a dish I ordered Fish is delicious

638
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:08,030
appreciate the response and the New York slice

639
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:11,470
analogy It was in NYC and specifically pizza

640
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,670
that I started having cheese issues in my

641
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:16,690
30s Around the time the average slice went

642
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:20,670
above 250 Okay, so interesting to me because

643
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,610
chicken has been one of those things that

644
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:25,610
I'm just saying it's David It says it's

645
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:28,250
chicken, but it doesn't say it's real chicken.

646
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:28,670
Okay.

647
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:29,970
You know kind of like you say it

648
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:31,330
says it's history It doesn't say it's real

649
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:36,290
history Okay, so They're bred to be for

650
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:36,770
their meat.

651
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:40,910
Yeah, right Not a real chicken all right

652
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,730
if you get a real chicken, and you

653
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:45,830
eat it that Might is a different experience

654
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,790
from what they say is chicken.

655
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,470
That's all I'm getting at I'm using your

656
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:54,550
history Thing about poultry is it's extremely dependent

657
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:57,290
on the feed just like a beef connoisseur,

658
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:57,590
right?

659
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:00,010
You know the Wagyu beef is because it

660
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:02,890
gets fed chocolate and beer let's say massaged

661
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:08,630
and premium Grass and whatever right that's what

662
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:11,130
makes the Wagyu the Wagyu right and also

663
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,670
they you know a breed of cow that

664
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:16,510
they select and most of the cheap Beef

665
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,570
is raised on garbage stock.

666
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,710
Hopefully they won't give it protein that comes

667
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:24,110
from cows, and then they do They finish

668
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:24,530
it off.

669
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:27,070
Maybe with grass or fatten it up But

670
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:31,090
yeah, but poultry it birds are especially sensitive

671
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:37,110
to their feed So yeah It's not gonna

672
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,590
taste good when I get a chicken.

673
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,550
I try to get an organic free-range

674
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,450
ends up being around 20 bucks for a

675
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:47,310
three-pounder or whatever and I Soak it

676
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,690
in salt water and ginger for two hours

677
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:52,290
three hours hour and a half depending on

678
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:54,590
the How I want to how long I

679
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:56,650
want to dry it for And I enjoy

680
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:57,670
a roasted chicken.

681
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:59,790
It ends up anyone who's seen photos of

682
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:00,230
what I've done.

683
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:02,630
It looks just like Chinatown, you know the

684
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,130
ducks that are hanging in the window.

685
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:09,310
Mm-hmm Yeah roasted that way so I

686
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:11,110
can go I can do without it.

687
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,310
I can do straight up veg.

688
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,730
I Just have let's say moments of weakness

689
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:19,430
But the food here has been tainted for

690
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:21,610
more than 50 years if I see 70s,

691
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:24,690
that's 50 years easily, right so Half a

692
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,610
century so you're gonna have to be careful.

693
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:26,830
Now.

694
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:29,370
Here's one way to fix it if you

695
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:31,450
can't get good food Guess what eat less?

696
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,950
You're not gonna wither away and die.

697
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:36,090
You'll get plenty of quote-unquote calories for

698
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:37,870
though, you know Hopefully anybody here knows it's

699
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:38,670
irrelevant, right?

700
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:40,310
Because what do they say need at least

701
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:42,450
1,500 or 2,000 calories of what

702
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:46,350
you know, so Yeah, so you just start

703
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:46,990
eating less.

704
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,530
So this is one thing that I suggest

705
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:53,410
Overall to people is start eating less Also

706
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:53,950
your food.

707
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,270
Well, it's kind of hard when you have

708
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:57,430
children and teenagers, especially right?

709
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:01,150
But for yourself if you can manage that

710
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:03,870
like for example If you go get a

711
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:06,090
slice and you're with someone split it tell

712
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:07,210
them to cut it in half again I

713
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,630
know it might just tamp up your appetite

714
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,550
You might be hungrier than you then you

715
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,690
before you started eating it, but wait Eat

716
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:17,510
very little wait 10 or 15 minutes and

717
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,170
see what happens Right.

718
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,310
So eat less if you have no choice

719
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,930
I learned this from traveling when I was

720
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:25,470
traveling with doing the mining and stuff It

721
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,990
was just truck stops and I was like,

722
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,470
no, no No, I wish these guys fill

723
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,430
up on these microwave pizzas and burritos.

724
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,450
I was like, no No, I'm just gonna

725
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:34,810
get a tiny amount of food and see

726
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:36,410
how well I do on it Yeah, I

727
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,690
did lose a little bit of weight looked

728
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,490
a little drawn after a month of that,

729
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:43,310
but I wasn't Feeling crappy as crappy as

730
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,570
it would have a fight more of it.

731
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:46,890
So yeah food is an issue I've been

732
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:49,230
anyone has been listening to Sonics from from

733
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:51,130
how even 20 years ago when I was

734
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:53,630
speaking to people I'm always bringing up food

735
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:55,710
is an issue here in the US, you

736
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:58,030
know in America It's crazy because we can

737
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,290
supply the entire we could supply 5 billion

738
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,030
people wherever there I don't think there's maybe

739
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:04,310
a billion people not even But we could

740
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,510
supply the entire planet with all their food

741
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,250
and still have plenty left over by the

742
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:12,290
way Yes, but unfortunately what is being supplied

743
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:14,930
for the most part is is making people,

744
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,930
you know fat so to speak But it's

745
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:17,610
not feeding them.

746
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:20,230
Well, so that's where we're at malnourished.

747
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,430
They're malnourished and yet they're in the yeah

748
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,570
It's the crisis gene.

749
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:27,270
Yeah, it has nothing to do with sugar

750
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:30,290
or corn, you know, it's funny listening to

751
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:33,450
see Sometimes I'll clear the computer and it'll

752
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:36,550
be on YouTube in the background autoplay and

753
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:38,890
some guy some doctor Some idiot came on

754
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:40,930
talking about it's the corn syrup, you know,

755
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,950
I'm like, oh my gosh, you know Yeah,

756
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:46,610
there's no single thing And the reason why

757
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:48,510
the medical system is as bad as it

758
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,290
is in the quote-unquote health care system

759
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:52,730
is Because the elites that run the world

760
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:54,250
or whatever you want to call them.

761
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,130
They would rather you have none of it

762
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,370
No health care.

763
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:59,630
No doctors nothing like that But they know

764
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,530
if they did if they did that and

765
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:04,490
banned it That people would get together and

766
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:06,690
they'd actually figure out really what's good for

767
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,770
you to do it And now they're gonna

768
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:08,970
have a problem, right?

769
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,270
It'll be underground, right?

770
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,790
So so what they do is they they

771
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:15,870
put on the facade that you're getting care

772
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:18,710
and you're getting knowledge and Whatever and food

773
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,510
or whatever, but they're actually destroying you little

774
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,790
by little so right you make them Oh,

775
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,570
you make them a bad offer so they

776
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:26,350
don't seek to discover something.

777
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,250
That is good.

778
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,190
That's all that is That's it.

779
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:31,410
Well, no you give them a good offer

780
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:34,630
Wait, where the substance and the actual material

781
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:38,170
and the knowledge is bad Yeah, it's actually

782
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:40,030
they're making good offers all the time, I'm

783
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:42,690
sorry It would be like they market it

784
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:45,190
as if it's a necessity and it's beneficial,

785
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:45,690
right?

786
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:47,010
Let's just say it that way instead of

787
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:47,430
an offer.

788
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,930
Yeah Yeah, and but people take it as

789
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,810
an offer all marketing is an offer, right?

790
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,710
Take it, you know, take this You'll get

791
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:54,650
whiter teeth, right?

792
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:55,590
That's an offer, right?

793
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:56,890
Even though it's we call it marketing.

794
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:59,790
So Although I did find it remarkable.

795
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:02,570
Somebody brought up the old 80s commercial where

796
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:04,450
the guy just literally puts a battery on

797
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:06,510
his shoulder And that's like the whole ad

798
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:10,690
Weird thing like the sub subliminal about that.

799
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:11,030
Yeah.

800
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:12,750
Yeah, you know, it was like go ahead

801
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,290
knock that off It was a chip on

802
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:15,510
my shoulder kind of thing, right?

803
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,990
Yeah, I got bodybuilder type athletic guy, right?

804
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,170
Something I think I remember that TV in

805
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:22,050
the background Yeah, TV was all you had

806
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,890
in the 80s and movies right and then

807
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,370
the end of ECR, right?

808
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:26,910
That's why it was worth it to still

809
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:29,390
travel to the ridiculous movie theater because at

810
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:31,870
least you got something different Anyways, or you

811
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:34,470
thought you did Interestingly, that's when they started

812
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:34,810
break.

813
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:35,210
Yeah.

814
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:38,490
Yeah dividing them up into plex Multiplexes.

815
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:38,730
Yeah.

816
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:41,090
Yeah, then the small theaters because they figured

817
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:42,890
instead of having one big theater will make

818
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:44,930
small for small ones We can run for

819
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:45,270
movies.

820
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:45,510
Yeah.

821
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:45,670
Yeah.

822
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:49,970
Yeah Anyways, interesting interesting the connection between the

823
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:53,610
Quran and the laws of Moses Correct me

824
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,990
if I'm wrong, but the most prominent philosophers

825
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:59,250
and scientists from the Persian Empire were actually

826
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,230
Jewish, right?

827
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:04,290
and also Jewish people really thrived in Spain

828
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:07,250
while it was under the Arabs people like

829
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:11,930
Ibn Ezra Ibn Ezra, sorry Mm-hmm.

830
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:15,770
Yeah, so that was just a commentary No,

831
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:16,350
that's fine.

832
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:19,010
But the Persians are not Muslim no matter

833
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:21,050
how you slice it They're still not Muslim

834
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:24,450
the Muslim the Islam pushed on Persia is

835
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:29,430
a CIA thing 100% 150% and

836
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:31,310
I know this because I know Persians and

837
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:34,450
Anyone who knows Persian or Persians or they're

838
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:36,050
not Muslim now, they play it as if

839
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:37,810
they are and of course, they're gonna transplant

840
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:41,450
that Right and push it because they do

841
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:44,250
have you know religious police in Iran, right?

842
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,990
Yeah, there is a such a thing as

843
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:48,030
religious police.

844
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:53,210
It's so Yeah No, it's a horrible situation.

845
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:54,870
The P the Persians have got it pretty

846
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:59,070
bad But Islam remember was just trying to

847
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,810
unify just like the Christianity was unified with

848
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:04,470
Catholicism like it or not Don't believe for

849
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:07,010
a second Protestantism and all that other stuff

850
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:08,910
was to protest the Vatican.

851
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:11,370
It was a charade It's it's all the

852
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:13,590
same stuff Don't believe for a second was

853
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,750
taken over co-opted and then kept you

854
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:16,910
know to see who right?

855
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:18,830
Don't don't believe any of that.

856
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:22,750
There hasn't been any real Sorting out of

857
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:26,270
anything over 500 years It's all these things

858
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:28,510
were settled 500 years ago, except I feel

859
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:32,190
bad for Iran Persians because they're not Muslim.

860
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:32,490
Hmm.

861
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:36,110
So so anyway, we got yet another Message

862
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:38,670
about the immune system and it seems as

863
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:42,090
though that is starting to you know, make

864
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:45,090
sense Yeah, if it's a system within the

865
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:47,230
body, where is it exactly located?

866
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:49,110
That's so interesting.

867
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:52,510
But hey, that's a huge business Just like

868
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,010
cancer.

869
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:55,890
Oh, yeah and take this or that supplement

870
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:58,470
to boost your immune system Okay, we know

871
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,130
about this and they're just saying you know

872
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:00,350
what?

873
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:02,490
This is great I'm glad you you kind

874
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:04,790
of gave me this idea and it just

875
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:07,690
makes perfect sense I wonder if you kept

876
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:09,370
up with the news recently though because I

877
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:11,770
got a question about that And I'll just

878
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,630
link it to this and it'll be the

879
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:16,050
last thing I ask you about tonight You

880
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:18,630
know Tylenol I got mixed feelings about this

881
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:20,630
whole, you know Tylenol is bad for pregnant

882
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:22,790
women now and maybe that's what caused autism

883
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,490
and I find that to be a very

884
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:28,970
weird Circumstance because Tylenol is almost useless as

885
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:32,090
a medication anyway, but yet it has been

886
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:36,230
heavily marketed Yeah, but hold on pregnant women

887
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:37,810
are bad for pregnant women what the hell

888
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:39,390
they do and getting pregnant They're gonna have

889
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:41,850
the next Messiah, you know, you know people

890
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:44,670
this is the two most common things I

891
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:45,350
get a message.

892
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,790
My wife is pregnant.

893
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,130
And at first, you know, what my first

894
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:51,930
response is it wasn't me and the other

895
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:56,950
response and the other response is You think

896
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,330
you're having a child because you think you're

897
00:30:58,330 --> 00:30:59,910
gonna have the next Messiah in other words

898
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:01,450
If you don't think you're making the next

899
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:05,210
Messiah or world Savior, why bother what's wrong

900
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:05,670
with you?

901
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:10,090
right, so So most of the people being

902
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:11,910
pregnant, they're just breeders, you know for more

903
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:15,310
normies It's kind of like guppies You ever

904
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:17,210
you know, you know, this is a guppies

905
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:18,230
and rabbits, right?

906
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:20,330
you don't believe it or not cats never

907
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:23,750
made it to that category, but Cat can

908
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,050
can in like three years three or four

909
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,410
years Hundred cats if you look at you

910
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:31,550
know, not many lips Sorry, you're getting a

911
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,390
little bit of electronic disturbance there.

912
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:37,690
It sounds like you're walking between zones Yeah,

913
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:41,210
okay so cats, I'm sorry Your cat point

914
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:43,430
was Good.

915
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,790
Oh The cat yeah, well they guppies and

916
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:48,110
cats guppies and rabbits are known for being

917
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:50,070
big breeders But cats are also are very

918
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:52,910
big breeders And they never made the list

919
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:55,370
Anyway aside from the breeding thing in the

920
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:59,010
Tylenol 80s I remember they tainted the Tylenol

921
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:01,190
and some people died right because they wanted

922
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:03,810
to promote the safety seal thing Yeah, and

923
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:05,570
one of the jokes back then was when

924
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:07,030
someone pissed you off you told him go

925
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:10,950
take a Tylenol Yeah, no twice that's basically

926
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,930
tell them to go kill themselves, right yeah

927
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:15,110
there was two it was almost like the

928
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:17,210
anthrax scares There was like two of those

929
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:20,030
Two waves of it and the funny thing

930
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,550
is if you think about it people go

931
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,630
Oh, they always solve the crimes and those

932
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:26,710
crimes as yet still remain pretty much unsolved

933
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:29,870
You know, I find that fascinating because it's

934
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,070
like was it done at the factory.

935
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,350
Did somebody do it at the store?

936
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,530
Maybe somebody tainted it, you know personally and

937
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:37,950
it's a mess anyway Yeah, I usually write

938
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:39,490
it, you know, it was the s e

939
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:43,630
e hyphen e y e a y e

940
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:46,430
E-y-e and a y-e CIA,

941
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:47,270
right?

942
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:49,210
I mean their whole thing is to terrorize,

943
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:52,250
you know, or You gotta understand.

944
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:55,050
I Think the the CIA is more of

945
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:59,590
a European ex-nazi Influence and for sure

946
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,870
the FBI is created by the Jewish Mafia.

947
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:06,290
That's goes on undoubtedly, you know Intuitively, right

948
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:13,850
So so between those two organizations Another organization

949
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:16,110
that's like that is the poverty for media

950
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:18,270
is the Poverty Law Center.

951
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:18,950
What's it called?

952
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:21,710
Oh, it's the southern if you're anti-semitism

953
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:26,490
Right, yeah, that's like a spinoff of intelligence

954
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:29,250
agencies and then you have the then you

955
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:32,490
have the main media ones Put it this

956
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:37,530
way Zuckerberg Organization and Musk's organization can pull

957
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:40,930
off operations like Traditionally that were left for

958
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:43,350
the FBI and the CIA right and they

959
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,230
would never get their finger pointed at them

960
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:49,730
now They would have to be more Anyway

961
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:53,530
more implicated and they're not so But anyway,

962
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:54,150
we got away.

963
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:57,350
So Tylenol is it it's acetomyophen ibuprofen mix,

964
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:57,730
isn't it?

965
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:01,030
No, it's just the acetaminophen basically Which Trump

966
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:03,110
had trouble pronouncing but I found it funny

967
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:05,330
because it was like really the only thing

968
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:07,949
I've ever found Tylenol useful for is to

969
00:34:07,949 --> 00:34:11,250
Reduce a fever a little bit but outside

970
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:11,730
of that.

971
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:13,770
It's not very useful I mean, it's not

972
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:15,850
even the best over-the-counter, you know

973
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:19,290
analgesic type, you know pain reducer.

974
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:23,489
It's garbage Yeah, so yeah garden variety ibuprofen.

975
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:26,170
Sometimes I take them by the fistful believe

976
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:27,550
it or not and they work You know,

977
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:31,650
yeah, but that's a different yeah ibuprofen is

978
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:35,449
different but the thing is Acetaminophen is sort

979
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:37,389
of like an additive that they continue to

980
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:39,429
sell because take a look at your Percocet

981
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:43,350
They're loaded with acetaminophen, you know compulsory everybody's

982
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:47,110
everybody's, you know Percocet prescription came with acetaminophen

983
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,850
and nobody asked you you know what I'm

984
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:49,050
saying?

985
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:51,230
It's just one of those things and there's

986
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,650
a bunch of stuff out there that has

987
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:55,409
acetaminophen mixed in it And it's just an

988
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:58,390
ingredient that they turned into a marketable, you

989
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:59,510
know capsule or whatever.

990
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:02,210
So that's all I see So now they're

991
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:06,470
throwing Tylenol into the dumpster fire, you know,

992
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:08,330
meaning what a dumpster fire the term is

993
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,630
used for Yeah, this is RFK jr You

994
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,290
know being in charge of the you know,

995
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:15,150
the Health Department and all that So but

996
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:17,190
that's their latest announcement is that it causes

997
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:17,690
autism.

998
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:20,950
I'm just telling you Yeah No, no, no,

999
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:22,390
no, it's irrelevant.

1000
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,410
It's irrelevant.

1001
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:29,110
It's the Yeah There's such a thing called

1002
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:31,490
medical Darwinism if you're dumb enough to believe

1003
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:32,830
their treatments and go for it.

1004
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:35,630
You shouldn't be Here or you should you

1005
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,610
shouldn't you shouldn't be procreating, you know the

1006
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:40,790
whole concept of the Darwin Awards and Survival

1007
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,590
of the fittest if you do anything that

1008
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:45,470
they suggest you you're you're going down as

1009
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:49,930
not To having progeny or procreating or yeah,

1010
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:53,550
it's a test I think they're all laughing

1011
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:55,670
their asses off behind the scenes.

1012
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:58,110
Like I said, they've got a It's just

1013
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:58,990
a dumpster fire.

1014
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:02,070
But here's the thing if you know, like

1015
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:04,090
the stuff we're talking about, you know it

1016
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,950
So many people don't know it and create

1017
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,650
such a hoop to do about it that

1018
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:10,110
you can get don't get caught in their

1019
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,650
wake I mean try to live the best

1020
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:14,590
life you can Right do the best but

1021
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,970
sometimes when the entire majority like with the

1022
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:18,850
mask stuff, right you get caught in the

1023
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:20,730
wake it's like they create this vacuum and

1024
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:23,170
it could suck you in and you don't

1025
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:25,690
want to be like, you know, Fighting to

1026
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:27,450
get out of that vacuum being sucked in.

1027
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:29,350
So you have to be very very how

1028
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:29,810
would you say?

1029
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:33,330
Much on the on the sidelines as much

1030
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:35,350
as possible without looking like you're on the

1031
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:37,350
sidelines when they're looking for people on the

1032
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:40,870
sidelines Right, so right and the other thing

1033
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:42,350
to keep in mind is some a friend

1034
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:43,670
of mine always used to say I always

1035
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:44,830
wanted to Run this by you.

1036
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:45,990
I might have done it in the past

1037
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:48,130
But he said that you know what there'd

1038
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:49,710
be a lot less idiots around if it

1039
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:52,370
wasn't for the invention of you know velcro

1040
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:54,990
Attached shoes and bicycle helmets.

1041
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:56,490
We might live in a world of less

1042
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:59,010
idiots and He used to tell me that

1043
00:36:59,010 --> 00:36:59,490
all the time.

1044
00:36:59,530 --> 00:36:59,970
What do you think?

1045
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,750
No, I don't think that has much to

1046
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:06,490
do with it Not at all, I know

1047
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,850
how to fix I've discussed already how to

1048
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:10,790
fix it here It's not my job to

1049
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:11,210
do it.

1050
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:13,630
If I was given the job is it's

1051
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:14,690
kind of like was it?

1052
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:18,270
the poppy bush About when they asked him

1053
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,590
if he was gonna run for president.

1054
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,310
He says you have to be really dumb

1055
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:27,070
to do that job and in if Want

1056
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,570
to want to do that job and even

1057
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:32,750
dumber to do it something like that But

1058
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,330
no they were it's pretty easy to fix

1059
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:37,670
any society, it's brutal It's going to be

1060
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:40,910
brutal And when you get that brutal you

1061
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:42,690
don't want to hire psychopaths
