1
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,180
Sonic Event 236, I think, and I got

2
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,480
to tell you, I got a few different

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,219
numbers dancing in my head just before I

4
00:00:15,219 --> 00:00:15,800
pressed record.

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,920
So it is what it is.

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,680
But off the cuff anyway, whoa, you doing

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,440
laundry or something?

8
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,060
What's going on?

9
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:23,380
Greek?

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,260
Oh, no, just messing around with the headphones.

11
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,100
Nice.

12
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,280
Sensitive, sensitive.

13
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:28,840
You have an oversensitive mic over there.

14
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,440
Sorry about that.

15
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,460
No, no worries at all.

16
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:30,780
Yeah, it is.

17
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:31,880
I was just curious.

18
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:32,280
Cool.

19
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,660
Look, it's better you have an oversensitive mic.

20
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,540
Yeah, I got a fan in the background.

21
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,120
I'm in the office having a cigarette with

22
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,360
an exhaust fan on, so.

23
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,620
Well, I don't hear the fan.

24
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,540
So cool.

25
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,880
Sensitive, but not too damn sensitive for the

26
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,100
room.

27
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,120
Anyway, you want to start with the questions

28
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:49,620
at least?

29
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,780
I mean, one of them is going to

30
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,940
be extensive commentary, actually, so I'll skip around

31
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,780
and let you pick and choose where you

32
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:56,580
want me to go on it.

33
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,860
But short ones.

34
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,500
We'll begin there.

35
00:00:59,500 --> 00:00:59,920
That's fine.

36
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:00,320
Okay.

37
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,180
Actually, before we start, I just want to

38
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,900
congratulate, there's a new person in Chatango that's

39
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,540
doing weather work, I guess, from the weather

40
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,000
seminar.

41
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,240
I don't know if it was from the

42
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,960
original one or from the one they picked

43
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,760
up on Patreon.

44
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,900
Either way, single-handedly making rain near Detroit.

45
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,960
So congratulations.

46
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,320
And thanks, Greek, was one of the comments,

47
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,080
and I'm glad I could help.

48
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,900
Okay, well, I don't know if I have

49
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,820
the same person thanking you, but somebody else

50
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,760
thanks you in the commentary in a moment.

51
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,440
So we'll see, maybe it is an overlap,

52
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,980
but we're not going to discuss their identity

53
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:32,280
here.

54
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,820
Anyway, so, and there's also progress being made

55
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,940
as far as creating a forum.

56
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,600
So instructions were sent in a message.

57
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,580
Hopefully we'll hear about that soon.

58
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,160
Looking forward to it, actually.

59
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:47,800
Okay.

60
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:48,940
So it's a short one.

61
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,800
Ken Wheeler, or Ken Wheeler's, I got an

62
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,720
S on there for some reason.

63
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,260
Ken Wheeler talked about those water helixes for

64
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:56,720
years.

65
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,860
Cool to see one done professionally.

66
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,900
That was the whole of the comment.

67
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,240
He didn't talk about anything with what we're

68
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:04,540
doing.

69
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,220
He doesn't apply the block wall to anything.

70
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,400
He goes to the edge.

71
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,820
He has a video a few years ago

72
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,040
about how to structure water.

73
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,920
This huge, like, thousand-dollar magnet, which, and

74
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,840
the tiny little, I don't want to make

75
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,860
fun of them, but I just, no, I

76
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,100
couldn't watch the rest of the video.

77
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,440
That's not how you structure water, but that's

78
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:27,760
fine.

79
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,460
We called it water helix.

80
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,040
Actually, Daniel Sala came up with that name

81
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,600
a while back, because before that it was

82
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,440
the scale-a-rater.

83
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,420
Because remember in the 1950s, you had refrigerator

84
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,420
and sink-a-rater.

85
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,740
Everything was a rater, right?

86
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,340
Right.

87
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,120
Back in the early days of home appliance

88
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,480
lore, it was a rater of some kind.

89
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,980
It was either a rater or a tor,

90
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,320
right?

91
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,200
Because you got garbage compactor, and there was

92
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,540
some name for a dishwasher that was like

93
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,080
something tor, and you know, et cetera.

94
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,480
So it was either a rater or a

95
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,100
tor, it seems like.

96
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:04,680
Go ahead.

97
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:06,440
Hmm.

98
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,240
Refrigerator is the most common one.

99
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:10,860
Oh, yeah.

100
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,440
Cooler-a-rater, you know.

101
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,640
So I figured scale-a-rater, because I

102
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,400
wanted to use a 1950s theme.

103
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,060
So we came up with water helix for

104
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:24,140
the same reason that Alexandra Watkins discusses.

105
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,060
She's in San Diego.

106
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,220
She has Eat My Words as her site,

107
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,880
and she names company products.

108
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,760
She named Wendy's Baconator and Spoon Me the

109
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,300
Yogurt Place.

110
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,600
I'm in correspondence with her.

111
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,900
We'll probably do a barter of some kind,

112
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,040
yeah, because she could use one.

113
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,740
But she's quite popular.

114
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,400
She's the first person to start a firm

115
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,080
that just names products for companies.

116
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,380
Before that, you went to an advertising house,

117
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,580
and they assigned someone in marketing.

118
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,780
That's all she does.

119
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,720
It's called Eat My Words.

120
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,200
Look her up.

121
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,840
She has some cool videos.

122
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,000
And the reason why I went to water

123
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,840
helix is because you couldn't talk to Siri

124
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,880
and say scale-a-rater.

125
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,400
It would do scale-rater, like the Raiders,

126
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,280
you know, football team.

127
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,120
Oh, geez, yeah.

128
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,080
You could never spell it.

129
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,920
So when you have something like that, I

130
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,900
just voice the text, messes it up, just

131
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,160
spell it out letter by letter, letter by

132
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,420
letter.

133
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,060
It'll be all caps, but it'll still get

134
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:16,300
it.

135
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,940
We have another site called Hydrophos, H-Y

136
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:24,600
-D-R-A-P-H-O-S, Hydrophos.

137
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,940
And we're going to thank Lorone for naming

138
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,360
that and putting that site together.

139
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,200
That's more like the luxury brand site.

140
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:39,880
And I'm actually looking at, like, packaging, I

141
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,700
don't know if you guys know about Jean

142
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,640
Le Couture watch reverso.

143
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,960
Like any dildo that goes on and gets

144
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,360
a watch gets a Rolex, right?

145
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,280
But people who know watches get a reverso.

146
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,760
It's like a polo player's watch.

147
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,500
It's the only watch that, let's say you're

148
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,820
going to do something that might damage the

149
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,160
bezel of your watch, you actually pull it

150
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,060
slightly to the left and then flip it

151
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,280
upside down and the backside is exposed to

152
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:03,620
the metal.

153
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,820
It's kind of neat.

154
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,420
I'm sorry.

155
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,340
I literally pictured a dildo with a watch

156
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,060
on it and trying to figure out where

157
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,860
to place the watch on the dildo.

158
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,260
Actually, I'm just quoting somebody that I know

159
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,420
who's into watches, and most people have never

160
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,420
heard of a reverso.

161
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,740
But I like the packaging it comes in.

162
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,140
It's kind of like a wooden box that

163
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,540
has an inset and all that.

164
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,860
I've been working for the past week on

165
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,700
the packaging.

166
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,720
The Scalarators, we're only offering the Mark I,

167
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,800
the original one, and it's 15 grand if

168
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,980
you want one, not five, tripled in price.

169
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,560
Go figure.

170
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,780
How did things like that happen?

171
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,140
Well, silver is $45 now, isn't it?

172
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:44,900
Yes, it is.

173
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,460
It was trailing around $30 for a while

174
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,920
and gold's over $3,500.

175
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,000
So the Scalarator is $15.

176
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,560
Go figure.

177
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,440
How did that happen?

178
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,460
And soon to go up to $27 for

179
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,240
the same unit.

180
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,020
Yikes.

181
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,640
Anyway, did I just say that?

182
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,840
No, I didn't say that.

183
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,140
Did I?

184
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:01,440
Okay.

185
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,500
I think you did.

186
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,060
And we have five on order right now,

187
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,940
by the way, that people are waiting for,

188
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,400
so yeah.

189
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,600
I'm interested to see what happens because I

190
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,720
was recently talking to somebody about a branding

191
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,540
specialist, which is one title they can give

192
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,880
to somebody who does that, but I think

193
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,800
that's somebody who works for somebody like the

194
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,340
lady you're in contact with.

195
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,400
Yeah.

196
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,840
Alexandra Watkins.

197
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,600
Eat my words.

198
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,140
Look her up.

199
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,820
She's got a bunch of short YouTubes and

200
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,080
she's interviewed quite often.

201
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,840
It's borderline psychology.

202
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,500
She has a thing called SMILE.

203
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,120
It's an acronym for the name of your

204
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,220
product should qualify, like it should be easy

205
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,660
to remember, it should leave an impression, it

206
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,820
should be longstanding, it should be easy to

207
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,560
communicate, right?

208
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,520
So Hydrofos doesn't quite do that, but it's

209
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,120
the luxury.

210
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,360
Uh, and if you go look at luxury

211
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,140
websites, they hardly show you anything.

212
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,220
They're very dark, you know, and, uh, my

213
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,320
instructions to make the luxury website was one

214
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,240
image, one word really hard to do that.

215
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,500
So we ended up with just a few

216
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,720
words and a few images and it's really

217
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,820
top, top notch.

218
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,580
The person who did that is, it was

219
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,860
the first time doing it.

220
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,840
You think it was, it's better than the

221
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,100
pros.

222
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,180
I have a marketing person who does stuff

223
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:22,720
for Bentley, um, uh, she doesn't work.

224
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,180
She's working with us.

225
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,620
She does Bentley and, um, these big conventions

226
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:31,460
for luxury companies that there's, what's that famous,

227
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:36,420
uh, the champagne, um, not, not Dom Pérignon,

228
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,640
another one, and she has all these luxuries,

229
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,320
sunglasses, you know, like the 50,000, no,

230
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,960
no, no, no, not that better than Chris.

231
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,700
So you're, you don't see it often here.

232
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,020
You don't see it often.

233
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,060
It's a long name.

234
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,380
I think it starts with a T.

235
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:55,420
Um, anyway, uh, she's, uh, going to be

236
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,980
most likely, uh, doing the marketing and it's

237
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,360
amazing how heavily everyone's relying on AI and

238
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,640
I don't care a lot of criticism because,

239
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,240
you know, I came up with the, um,

240
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:08,360
AI aftertaste, you know, uh, you know, when

241
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,040
you look at something and it's obviously, uh,

242
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,760
AI, I call it AI aftertaste and, uh,

243
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,580
very much so, but here, as long as

244
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,100
it doesn't cause reputational damage, right.

245
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,140
In other words, by using overusing AI, is

246
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,200
it going to make, is it going to

247
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,380
downplay your product or cheapen your product or

248
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,960
reputational damage right now?

249
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,120
I don't think it will.

250
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,659
Um, so, and I'm not even really, this

251
00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:32,960
is not what I, I just want to

252
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,500
get the, the, the scale orator, the mark

253
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,900
one, the water device out there.

254
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,100
I want other people to do it.

255
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,820
I don't want to do it.

256
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,840
I've got a whole bunch of other stuff.

257
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,840
I mean, it's my baby.

258
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,920
Um, I've got to keep it, you know,

259
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,640
alive, but, uh, like I said, I'm putting

260
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,080
it out there.

261
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,460
Anyone wants to, you know, market, do it,

262
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,360
you know, whatever, come work with us.

263
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,880
No, no one works for me, but with

264
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,200
me, I'll let me know.

265
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,880
Um, but you got to have your ducks

266
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,440
in a row and you got to be

267
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,180
a high performance individual.

268
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,320
If you're not a high performance individual, you're

269
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,520
going to get kicked to the curb, like

270
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,340
in 15 seconds.

271
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,800
Um, so yeah.

272
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,880
Uh, anyway, all that aside, uh, again, I

273
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,120
just want to repeat thanking the person, uh,

274
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,160
you're welcome, uh, with the tank about the

275
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:16,760
weather work.

276
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,060
There's nothing better than to put out any

277
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,460
information and get in and have other people

278
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:22,840
do it.

279
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,260
You know, the information we put out is

280
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,200
not crap, right?

281
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,880
So when, and when people are actually doing

282
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,860
weather work and healing stuff, you know, regarding

283
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,240
the fitness of the body and food stuff

284
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,920
and all that, um, that's what it's about.

285
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,740
Otherwise just dead information.

286
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,740
It's like if one, if there's only one

287
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,440
person speaking a language in the world, that's

288
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,160
a dead language.

289
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,120
You need at least two people to have

290
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,760
the language lit alive, right?

291
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,420
So that's my point there.

292
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:50,820
Okay.

293
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,360
Let's go.

294
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,060
Let's go on with the comments and questions

295
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:53,500
or whatever.

296
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,320
Absolutely.

297
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,560
Let's begin with this one.

298
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,560
Uh, I thought the intelligence agency's topic is

299
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,760
a fascinating one.

300
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,160
Whitney Webb is a really good source.

301
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,180
That's their opinion and wrote a fascinating book

302
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,860
on the history called one nation under blackmail.

303
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,100
Definitely mentions the Jewish mafia families.

304
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,360
Um, Whitney is what, what, what, the Jewish

305
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,100
mafia, you mean?

306
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:17,420
Yeah.

307
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,500
Under black, you broke up there.

308
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:19,840
Sorry.

309
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,160
Under blackmail definitely mentions the Jewish mafia families.

310
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,300
Got it.

311
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:26,940
That's old.

312
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,440
Well, the, they run the money system, not

313
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,560
exclusively, but it's a myth that they run

314
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,400
the money system.

315
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,260
By the way, do you know how the

316
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,420
Jews run the money system?

317
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,360
Um, typically the money system, like from the

318
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,500
Medici, the Indian before that, you know, that

319
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,880
was centered around Rome or that part of

320
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,020
the world, let's say Europe.

321
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,360
Uh, they were very elitist.

322
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,620
If they didn't like you that it, you

323
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,740
know, if you didn't, you had to be

324
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,240
of a certain class to be in the

325
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,300
money borrowing and lending business, actually borrowing and

326
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,060
to deal with money.

327
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,520
And there were most of the population didn't

328
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,280
fit that way.

329
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,660
So the Jews were like, look at all

330
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,620
this business that we're leaving behind.

331
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,820
Let's go deal with the unwashed.

332
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,260
The one that these guys don't want to

333
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,580
deal with and just charge them like two,

334
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,780
three times the interest.

335
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:09,780
Right.

336
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,960
And if we make good choices, they'll pay

337
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,440
it back and we'll be ahead of everyone.

338
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,500
And that's how they got ahead.

339
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,400
They were like bottom feeders, you know, based

340
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,120
on the culture at that time.

341
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,220
Right.

342
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,660
So what they did, like, uh, someone gave

343
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,440
a good explanation about this a while back,

344
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,740
but I heard, and I already was privy

345
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,680
to this, but they basically, if the people

346
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,680
were very fastidious and diligent, even though the

347
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,780
interest was very high, if they get under

348
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,320
the, you know, pay it back as fast

349
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,520
as possible, less interest, you got yourself elevated.

350
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:40,920
Right.

351
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,060
You know, like if you had a real

352
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,120
good business thing and you just had to

353
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,040
get that influx of money, uh, pay the

354
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,800
high interest rate, you'll be better off, you

355
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,600
know, when you're done.

356
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,000
Right.

357
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,240
So they really helped a lot of people

358
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,660
that never would have been, uh, never would

359
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,940
have gotten any kind of alone.

360
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,840
And they took over, they took over just

361
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,480
like, um, uh, cheap goods, many, you know,

362
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,780
cheap goods are always going to, uh, be,

363
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,740
you know, overall make more quote unquote, uh,

364
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,840
market share than, than expensive goods.

365
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,160
Right.

366
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,080
Because of the populace.

367
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,520
So there were the cheap money lenders, but

368
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,700
ironically they were not cheap to deal with.

369
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,960
They were very high interest.

370
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,520
Uh, but you know, you just want to

371
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,340
get, get it over with this fast as

372
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:25,700
possible.

373
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:29,620
So, but that's basically, so whatever mob you

374
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,400
are, you're going to, you know, unless you're

375
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,380
dealing with that stuff.

376
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,400
But the FBI is a, is a Jewish

377
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,280
mafia creation.

378
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,760
You know, before that it was Pinkerton, I

379
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,240
think it was a Pinkerton or something else

380
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:39,660
like that.

381
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,440
Pinkerton was, uh, Pinkerton was, was guards that

382
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,200
eventually became the secret service.

383
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,700
The FBI was the Bureau of Investigation, but

384
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,820
there are various tendrils that go into it.

385
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,500
And then J Edgar Hoover kind of pulled

386
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,340
it together, which is a really interesting too.

387
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,980
And that involves the Pinkertons again.

388
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,620
And, uh, the people that wound up being

389
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,600
security also, it's another, another branch and I'm

390
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,620
trying to think of who they were.

391
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,900
It's a little longer name, but, uh, the

392
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,420
people that used to guard the trains, right.

393
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,220
They, they started guarding the trains because of

394
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,000
the train robberies.

395
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,220
It was those like Wells Fargo, like Wells

396
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,080
Fargo was involved.

397
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,360
Yeah.

398
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,860
The coach.

399
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:19,560
Yeah.

400
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,780
And those are all connected to names of

401
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,900
particular individuals.

402
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:26,340
Like, you know, particularly like, uh, the, well,

403
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,000
well, the one guy came, he had the

404
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,980
money system kind of on lock in England,

405
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:34,660
sent his son over here, you know, Morgan,

406
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,980
JP Morgan, his father was running things pretty

407
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:38,580
well in England.

408
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,540
And then he was disappointed with JP Morgan

409
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,680
when he came over here, uh, until he

410
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,360
did kind of a hostile takeover of things.

411
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,780
But there's a whole history that goes into

412
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,160
these things that later survive as, you know,

413
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,560
quote unquote, government agencies, even American express.

414
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,740
Well, they brought up the, uh, sorry.

415
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,580
No, go ahead.

416
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,760
They have a Bolshevik leaning, which is not

417
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,980
the FBI.

418
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,860
So that's the Jewish backing, right?

419
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,780
The Jews always back the Bolshe, you know,

420
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,980
the anti-culture, right.

421
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,100
To break down tradition and all that.

422
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:09,860
So anyway.

423
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:10,380
Yeah.

424
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,640
Well, they changed things in that way.

425
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,840
And that's why I was bringing it up

426
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,160
because also, you know, a lot of these

427
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,620
other, uh, like the intelligence agencies, American express,

428
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,120
right.

429
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,280
You think of it as a credit card

430
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,060
company, whatever today, but initially it was created

431
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,060
as a way to launder money for the

432
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,700
intelligence agencies anyway.

433
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,780
And now it survives as this other thing,

434
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,620
but it was really just a particular company

435
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,120
to shell the payments for black ops.

436
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,460
And before the, like HSBC for the CIA.

437
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,780
Yeah, exactly.

438
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,120
They, they create a financial institution for one

439
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,840
purpose and then it becomes something else, but

440
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,620
never loses its original purpose.

441
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:47,900
Right.

442
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,480
Um, well, there's still, yeah, it's, it's pretty

443
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,100
funny how all that works because no one

444
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,740
reads anyway, they rely on people like us

445
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,900
are actually even less reliable than us.

446
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,420
Let's say, cause anything you say, even if

447
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,640
we're reading it from a book, you have

448
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,760
to go verify it.

449
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,000
Right.

450
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,420
Um, on all these things, but no one

451
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,300
reads thankfully.

452
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,080
So all these guys are actually protected by

453
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,660
what they do.

454
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,340
So anyway, there you go.

455
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:12,740
Okay.

456
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,020
So this, this is kind of a funny

457
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:14,300
one.

458
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,540
A funny thing happened to me as I

459
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,560
was listening to a recent rated Y sonic

460
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,660
event, uh, I was hearing the discussion about

461
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,740
eggs from a chicken.

462
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,920
And I recalled another sonic, uh, from a

463
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,280
previous set that also had Ocelli and you

464
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,280
speaking about cross species breeding in the context

465
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,140
of the death penalty and Ocelli queuing up

466
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,440
the portion of that audio, asking why it

467
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,920
was required to move a man and the

468
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,560
animal to death, uh, in previous systems.

469
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,840
And I was curious about crossbreeding because I

470
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,260
was thinking about the egg, which contains all

471
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,020
these things.

472
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,900
Uh, is it possible in all animals are

473
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,340
only specific ones.

474
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:03,280
And I'm not asking as a hobby or

475
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,000
a request to participate.

476
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,100
I'm just asking because I imagine as most

477
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,780
things go, even if forbidden on this planet,

478
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,020
there is probably a place where it is

479
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:14,760
reveled in.

480
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,480
Uh, so, and I have a follow-up

481
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,080
to that, which is short, but your thoughts

482
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,460
on that.

483
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,740
I don't know about why, but here's the

484
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,260
thing, like the old Testament laws, why occasionally

485
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,720
there's a discernment piece in there tells you

486
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,040
why.

487
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,720
But you want it is, you know, these

488
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,700
things, most of the, you know, man with

489
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,980
a man, woman with a woman, why are

490
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,620
they put to death?

491
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,220
I don't know.

492
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,180
It doesn't state, it just says it's an

493
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,880
abomination and you just leave it at that,

494
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,160
right?

495
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,860
That's, that's where the, that's for the religious

496
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,100
police to deal with and you never want

497
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,000
to, right.

498
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,720
But here's the thing.

499
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,100
Let me just interject something about biblical law.

500
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,440
People look at it as being very, whatever,

501
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:58,300
uh, stringent and strict draconian, let's say, but

502
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,260
it's very difficult.

503
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,580
There's a lot of wiggle room.

504
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,140
It's very, very difficult to indict and execute

505
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,680
sentence someone.

506
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,900
You have to have two witnesses, right?

507
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,480
And, and even if you do have two

508
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,160
witnesses, they have to have like no outstanding

509
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,020
warrants or tickets or debts.

510
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,160
So go figure.

511
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:19,319
So you can have a hundred witnesses, but

512
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:22,440
if they all have outstanding debts, they're no

513
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:22,760
good.

514
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,640
So you could, you could, you could skate.

515
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:30,560
So imagine you're seen murdering someone like, you

516
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,280
know, you like road rage type thing, but

517
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,000
you know, carriage rage, I guess.

518
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:35,340
Right.

519
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,160
And you, you, you kill the guy and

520
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,680
the, and the entire, you know, let's say

521
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,300
town square sees it, right.

522
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,240
And talked about it for a few days

523
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,900
and come time for court, they all have,

524
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,400
uh, outstanding, um, uh, obligations.

525
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,440
So guess what?

526
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,560
They don't qualify.

527
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,540
So you, you, you, you skate, you walk.

528
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,400
That's right.

529
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,160
You get it.

530
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:01,900
Yeah, I get it.

531
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,800
It was very difficult.

532
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,960
It was very difficult to, to indict sentence

533
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,760
and execute someone properly.

534
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:10,440
Right.

535
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,040
Because very few people were, were, had total

536
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,720
clean records, let's say, or clean, you know,

537
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,460
nothing outstanding.

538
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,000
Right.

539
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,840
So the echo in us law in general

540
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,620
is that, you know, they say that you

541
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,600
have to have probable cause to swear out

542
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,060
a warrant.

543
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,760
And that probable cause could include the testimony

544
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,480
of someone.

545
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,180
But a lot of those things used to

546
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,620
say the testimony of someone in good standing,

547
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,760
that was a phrase that used to be

548
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:32,980
there.

549
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,460
And that's what I'm saying.

550
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:35,340
Yeah.

551
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,780
And it's up to you.

552
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,660
See, they'll like all the, there's no one

553
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,660
in jail legally or lawfully right now.

554
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,040
I, I know that for sure.

555
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:43,840
Why?

556
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,020
Because there has to be a warrant and

557
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,520
it has to be with the supplied or

558
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,760
a company with a sworn affidavit.

559
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,320
And no one's going to swear to it.

560
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,400
They'll affirm, they'll say, you know, whatever, best

561
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,100
of my knowledge, but it's not sworn under

562
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,140
the penalty of perjury without, you know, under

563
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,660
the laws of the United States of America.

564
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,540
You'll never get that.

565
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:01,820
Never.

566
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,260
No one will ever put their nuts on

567
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,960
the table like that or vagina on the

568
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,220
table.

569
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,380
If you want to say it like that,

570
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:07,960
no one.

571
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,480
So that puts no one in jail right

572
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,120
now is there lawfully for sure.

573
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,960
They're there kind of legally because they volunteered,

574
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,780
but that's another discussion.

575
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,200
Okay.

576
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,360
The thing about the crossbreeding, first of all,

577
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,860
most of the time, if not all of

578
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,840
the time, all of most of the time,

579
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:28,040
things that are a product of crossbreeding are

580
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,480
sterile animals, especially right.

581
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:35,900
So, um, and some plants, uh, but, uh,

582
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,340
typically I don't know much about the subject.

583
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,820
Um, I like, I like to speak on

584
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,640
things that I can, I can have direct

585
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,040
experimentation experience from experimentation, um, and, and good

586
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,480
observation without the, your senses being, you know,

587
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,340
in other words, objectifying the senses as much

588
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,860
as possible and using what's called real science.

589
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,180
Right.

590
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,420
You know, what, what do you see?

591
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:01,700
Right.

592
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,500
You know, like if it's raining yellow and

593
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,380
they're telling you it's just rain that, you

594
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,440
know, rain is not yellow.

595
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:06,800
Right.

596
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,640
So it can be acid rain near a

597
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,120
sulfur mill, but you're not, if you're not

598
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,320
near the sulfur mill, you know what I

599
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:14,500
mean?

600
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,680
So, well, there's probably a few things that

601
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,320
can, yeah, probably a few things that can

602
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,200
get into that reaction up there in the

603
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,800
clouds, which creates the water.

604
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,780
Cause as we discussed, it's not like a

605
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,600
cloud is a big bucket of water filled

606
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,960
or a pillow filled with water.

607
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,660
So the thing is a bunch of things

608
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,240
could probably get in there and cause a

609
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,080
yellow appearance to the water.

610
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,340
Uh, some of them probably more harmful than

611
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:38,400
others, but it is also direct experimentation.

612
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,980
So even if you don't know, so I'll

613
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,700
bring it up like that.

614
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,320
Now, here's the thing I've never really talked

615
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:43,540
about.

616
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,000
I've experimented a lot on myself.

617
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,000
Now I'm a lot of people from the

618
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,620
sixties, seventies and eighties would say, I experimented

619
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,900
a lot with, you know, stuff, right?

620
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,920
Drugs and all that stuff.

621
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:53,300
Yes.

622
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,040
Drugs or sex remedies.

623
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,320
Yeah.

624
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,960
Remedies and things like that.

625
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,240
Uh, I've experimented with, that's why when I

626
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,900
tell like, for example, someone recently all the

627
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,180
modern antibiotics, anything that's come out in the

628
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,000
past 15 years will kill you.

629
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,600
If you stay on it, I've tried them

630
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,940
and I'm like, oh my gosh, this thing

631
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,800
is total poison.

632
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,900
Talk about like, Ooh, I mean, horrible, horrible

633
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,920
stuff, you know?

634
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,460
Um, and people, you know, that's why when

635
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:22,120
you read, uh, they, by the way, one

636
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,820
way, the medical system and the financial system,

637
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:28,220
legal system are intertwined.

638
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,560
They're really the same thing.

639
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,160
And that's how they, uh, that's where all

640
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:32,780
their money is.

641
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,120
So they, they sacrifice.

642
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,300
We talked about famous people, celebrities being sacrificed,

643
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:41,040
but they actually sacrifice celebrities in mass, meaning

644
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,940
many of them, how many times ready died

645
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,220
of complications with diabetes, right?

646
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,040
You've seen complications with AIDS.

647
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,540
They never say died from diabetes or AIDS

648
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,160
or whatever, or complications from this.

649
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,620
It's because there's no such thing as diabetes

650
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,200
or AIDS.

651
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,820
It's the treatment that causes that condition.

652
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:58,440
Right?

653
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,380
So complications.

654
00:21:59,560 --> 00:21:59,720
Yeah.

655
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,580
Complications is the dummy.

656
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,340
You know, this guy's a total dummy.

657
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,260
He trusts us.

658
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,060
And if he finds out what we're doing,

659
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,280
it's going to be very complicated, but we,

660
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,800
so he died in the meantime, everybody give

661
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,080
him his sorrow and also having celebrities beaten

662
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:15,260
up.

663
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,520
The IRS does it all the time.

664
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,160
Every 10 years, they pick someone, you know,

665
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,260
and they put them in the media.

666
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,620
This guy owes us these taxes.

667
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,860
So you better pay your taxes.

668
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,660
Look what they're doing to Willie Nelson, right?

669
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,500
Um, all this stuff.

670
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,560
So they put the medical stuff in front

671
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:29,980
of people.

672
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,360
I assure you, like, uh, some celebrity died

673
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,300
of some, some, whatever I assure you, whatever

674
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,500
medications and treatments regarding that particular disease would

675
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,000
boom.

676
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,760
Like, let's say someone died of colon cancer.

677
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,880
Suddenly within a year, colon cancer treatments skyrocket,

678
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,200
right?

679
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,260
Because it was brought to their attention, right?

680
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,340
The public's attention.

681
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,840
It's all business guys.

682
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,720
And it's all bullshit.

683
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:52,500
Right.

684
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,160
Okay.

685
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:55,440
Sorry.

686
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:55,920
Go ahead.

687
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,460
Oh, just to circle back crossbreeding and eggs

688
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,240
and, uh, put to death and all that

689
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:02,500
stuff.

690
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,840
I don't know how kind of a mix

691
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,700
that is, but, um, yeah, remember eggs are

692
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,300
really potent.

693
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,660
If you speak to anyone that's Asian, especially

694
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,700
Vietnam or parts of China, they're like, you're

695
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,920
going to eat an egg or you ate

696
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,560
an egg yesterday.

697
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,080
Didn't you?

698
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,220
It's like a big deal.

699
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,900
It's not like a two egg breakfast with

700
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,020
hash browns and whatever, right here every morning

701
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,180
for most people or some people, let's say

702
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,220
it's a very big deal because when you

703
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,640
eat an egg, you're eating, even if it's

704
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,160
unfertile, you're eating the entire potential of an

705
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,080
entire chicken.

706
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,480
So when you eat chicken, you're just eating

707
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,020
the muscle.

708
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,320
Some people like gizzards and liver, but you're

709
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,440
basically eating the muscle.

710
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,980
When you eat the egg, you're eating all

711
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,980
the feathers, all the bones, all the feet,

712
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:43,280
right?

713
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:43,680
Yeah.

714
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,260
That was, that was actually part of the

715
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:45,460
rest.

716
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,800
That was actually part of the rest of

717
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,840
the follow-up here where they mentioned exactly

718
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,840
that because, uh, the Greek said that it

719
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,260
was hold on a second.

720
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:54,500
Okay.

721
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,820
The Greek said that an egg contains all

722
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:00,280
the things that basically make up a chicken.

723
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,600
Sorry if I paraphrased poorly.

724
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:07,240
But when you think about that combined with

725
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,660
whatever the element that is added to it,

726
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,460
it seems as though these things could not

727
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:15,680
come together because you have the whole of

728
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,580
a chicken say, and then the addition of

729
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:22,260
a human, it doesn't seem like it would

730
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,960
even coalesce in a, in a way energetically.

731
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,420
I don't know what they mean by that,

732
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,440
but they did bring up that.

733
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,860
That's why they were thinking of it.

734
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,740
If you have a whole chicken, I guess.

735
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:32,380
Yeah.

736
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:32,860
Yeah.

737
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,200
Yeah.

738
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,040
It's the potential of the chicken.

739
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,240
It's the potential.

740
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,620
If you do eat enough of chicken and

741
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,500
chicken, by the way, you will come, your

742
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,240
body will try to become a chicken and

743
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:43,980
it can't.

744
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,780
So you'll end up having maladies and, uh,

745
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,220
problems with your organs.

746
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,800
Um, you might, your legs will get really

747
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,200
weak.

748
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,180
Your limbs will get really weak, right?

749
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,000
Um, your skin will start to, uh, get

750
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,920
really pale and dry because, uh, all that

751
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,340
energy wants feathers and it wants, you know,

752
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,360
what a chicken looks like.

753
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,940
And that'll never happen with a human.

754
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:12,680
So it'll force you into a structure that

755
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,260
is unhealthy.

756
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,340
Let's say, right.

757
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,600
In other words, your, your fitness level is

758
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,980
going to, you're going to look like crap.

759
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,680
Um, yeah.

760
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,320
So it's, it's also by induction, you know,

761
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,480
when you, when you digest the chicken egg,

762
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,000
the body will only take what it can

763
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,160
induce, right.

764
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,600
What it can transfer to energy.

765
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,720
And there's things in that, that the body

766
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,300
will not, uh, ergo the fecal matter.

767
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,060
So if you just ate chicken eggs for

768
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,360
a week, within the third or fourth day,

769
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,120
you'll be pooping chicken eggs and you, and

770
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,680
whatever you're pooping is what the body cannot

771
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,800
induce, right.

772
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,320
Or use.

773
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,380
And that's where the rest of it would

774
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:49,620
be.

775
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:54,460
So, yeah, that's why vegetables and grains, anything

776
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:58,160
that is, uh, energetic at its time of

777
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,260
being ripeness or harvest still has an upward

778
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:06,380
energy is most positive for the human body.

779
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,660
Uh, okay.

780
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,420
So, uh, also they asked because, uh, there

781
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,540
was something in the news about the UN

782
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,080
recently, and there was a lot of news

783
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,660
about that.

784
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:18,120
Uh, regarding the UN, it got me to

785
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,800
thinking about these multi-nation agreements and meetings.

786
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,580
And I was curious if there is any

787
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:28,060
form of governance currently in existence that is

788
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:31,940
even remotely similar to lawful in its form.

789
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:32,200
Mm.

790
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,220
No, not at all.

791
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,960
There are like East Congo, Somalia.

792
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,540
Um, you could say North Korea and Persia,

793
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,040
but no, they're, they're in the system.

794
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,520
Also, they have a bar association in North

795
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:44,960
Korea.

796
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:45,920
Can you believe it?

797
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,580
So, I mean, they're done.

798
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,400
They're finished.

799
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,420
No, the new world order is in place.

800
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,620
It's just not, you know, that question is

801
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:57,840
the same as if the money system collapses.

802
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,220
Um, it collapsed already.

803
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:01,920
We're on credit.

804
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,280
Everyone's using credit.

805
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,520
Right, right.

806
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,180
Oh, yeah.

807
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,440
Everything has been captured.

808
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,700
But it's a, it's a, it's an imperial

809
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,320
thing.

810
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,380
Um, if we were speaking about the known

811
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,760
world during the 1500s, it was captured then

812
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,160
also.

813
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:18,800
Right.

814
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,520
So you, right.

815
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,640
So if you're in Europe, it was the

816
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,360
emperor and the pope that ran everything.

817
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,720
And the kings were suzerain to them.

818
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,280
And the emperor was suzerain to the pope.

819
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,460
And then you had all the colonies everywhere

820
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:30,940
else.

821
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,860
Guess what the colonies were suzerain to?

822
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,680
What would they were under?

823
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,760
The countries that were under the pope.

824
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:36,360
Right.

825
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:36,960
Right.

826
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,880
If you look at all the colonies all

827
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,800
over the world, whether it was Pacific, North,

828
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:43,700
South America, whatever, they're colonies.

829
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,720
They're under the parent country.

830
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,260
So the whole world was under that system

831
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,820
anyway.

832
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,900
So which is how you can make sense

833
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,600
out of the the old story that I

834
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,980
read about the pope drawing a line on

835
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:01,080
a world map, literally dividing it between Portugal

836
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,280
and Spain to rule because they were the

837
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,780
two most prominent military powers at the time.

838
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,880
But truthfully, it's the pope making the decision

839
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,880
as to who gets what, you know.

840
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,100
So what does that tell you?

841
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:14,500
Yeah.

842
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,180
At that time, that's who was running.

843
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,440
Yeah.

844
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,000
The Japanese empire back then was made aware

845
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,340
of that.

846
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,040
And they had to choose sides, whether to

847
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,000
fight one or join the other or whatever.

848
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:25,420
Right.

849
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,080
So there does seem to be an out

850
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,420
of step nature to the Asian cultures where

851
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,620
they're not ever quite, you know, like they

852
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:35,000
are truly separate from the rest of the

853
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,320
system.

854
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,720
Most of the time, it seems like.

855
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,760
But then again, they don't have the banking

856
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,700
systems now.

857
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:40,320
Yeah, right.

858
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,700
That's where I was going.

859
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,420
World War.

860
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,220
Yeah.

861
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,020
World War One and World War Two fixed

862
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:45,540
that.

863
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,280
Had nothing to do with wars.

864
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,720
There's no there's not been a legitimate war

865
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,220
in like, I don't know, a few hundred

866
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,940
years, if not a few thousand years.

867
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:54,600
Right.

868
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,700
So those are just political stuff.

869
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,780
Before we completely change subject matter, in my

870
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:04,000
mind, the last question is about, you know,

871
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,520
has the Greek read about this recent military

872
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:11,420
gathering of generals in America, supposedly calling upon

873
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:14,620
800 senior military people to meet in an

874
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:18,860
urgent fashion with our newly crowned secretary of

875
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,220
war?

876
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,660
And does he have any thoughts about this

877
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:26,040
as far as what is what is this

878
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,220
word?

879
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:26,600
No.

880
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,780
OK, sorry.

881
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:28,880
No, there isn't.

882
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,620
I don't have thoughts because I know senior

883
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,760
military people or new.

884
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,940
I am not in the kind of milieu

885
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,720
like that.

886
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,700
I do actually know people in the military

887
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,200
high up.

888
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,160
But back in the day, I've sat down

889
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,360
not once but twice with the commander, Army

890
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,500
commander of the field of Vietnam War.

891
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:52,140
Hello, Rip Westmoreland, saying that General George Westmoreland.

892
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,400
Yes, I mean, he's yeah.

893
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,380
So his son looks just like he's an

894
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,280
attorney in New York.

895
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,360
Oh, great.

896
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:00,840
Good attorney.

897
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,080
Yeah.

898
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,320
You know how many attorneys I know?

899
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,200
And that's why I speak on them the

900
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:04,560
way I do.

901
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,940
Did I ever tell you guys about cops?

902
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,940
Let me just interject the story here.

903
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:09,340
Sure.

904
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:13,280
A long time ago, Irish someone I so

905
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,340
I dated this chick back in high school

906
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:19,000
and she grew up with a milieu of

907
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,720
a group of Irish police.

908
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,340
They just loved them wherever we even because

909
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,040
even we weren't together when they saw me,

910
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:25,680
they gave me a hug.

911
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,920
Irish cops, right?

912
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:28,820
I knew them.

913
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,240
So anyway, one of them retired, the uncle,

914
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,040
and they invited me to the dinner.

915
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:34,840
Right.

916
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,080
And it was at the house.

917
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,200
They catered it all that.

918
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,800
So and they get a watch, just like

919
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,260
the movies.

920
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,320
You know, they get a watch, buy him

921
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,460
a watch engraved for service.

922
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,960
And he said, hey, Greek, why don't you

923
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,460
get married?

924
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:52,100
Have a son or child and we'll bring

925
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:52,960
him to the force.

926
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,520
You know, we'll help.

927
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,700
You know, if he wants to join the

928
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,020
force, you know, we're here for you.

929
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,000
And I said, this is members like 50

930
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,800
cops around me.

931
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,620
And I'm like, if I had a son

932
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,380
and he came home one day and said

933
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,420
that I want to be a cop, I

934
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,100
would cut my nuts off and donate them

935
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,480
to science so they could tell you what

936
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,040
went wrong.

937
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,060
Right.

938
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,260
This is a house full of and they

939
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,140
all looked at me and laughed.

940
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,660
Oh, that's so funny.

941
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,360
Mm hmm.

942
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,940
I was like, I was just supposed to,

943
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,980
like, kick my ass and kick me out

944
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:23,620
for saying that.

945
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:23,880
Right.

946
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:24,480
Right.

947
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,920
But anyway, I don't have that effect on

948
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,220
people.

949
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,160
I thought that was the end of me.

950
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:29,320
Right.

951
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,320
I was being kind of suicidal, but they

952
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,240
just thought it was funny.

953
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:33,580
Fair enough.

954
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,200
You're not supposed to be funny.

955
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,540
No, no, no.

956
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:36,960
Anyway.

957
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:40,120
OK, so I just learned, by the way,

958
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,120
if you want, while I read.

959
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,500
Anyway, that applies.

960
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,560
That applies to the generals, by the way,

961
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:44,820
too.

962
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,500
They're just are you joking?

963
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,060
My answer to the general things at South

964
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,800
Park would handle that a lot better than

965
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,200
I would.

966
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,940
But probably, probably.

967
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,000
It's just I did read that news story,

968
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:55,300
too.

969
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,240
And it is making the rounds pretty big

970
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,180
because it's sort of unusual that they call

971
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:01,100
generals from all around the world to meet

972
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,940
face to face with our secretary of defense.

973
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,940
But you don't know if you think that's

974
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:06,800
serious or whatever.

975
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:07,300
You don't know.

976
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,820
That means that you don't know generals.

977
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,560
Well, look, I don't know a lot of

978
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:11,680
them.

979
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,580
I've only known a couple.

980
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:13,020
Yeah.

981
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,060
Yeah, not you.

982
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,300
But I mean, generally what you're taught, they're

983
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,080
the opposite of what you think.

984
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:18,940
Oh, yeah.

985
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,480
Just think the opposite of what a general

986
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,580
should be and what he shouldn't be as

987
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:26,040
on the right is they're everything what what

988
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:26,780
they shouldn't be.

989
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,460
All of them.

990
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,040
Right.

991
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,040
No, fair enough.

992
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:30,820
Doesn't matter.

993
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:31,160
Yeah.

994
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,220
It's just that these meetings are generally not

995
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,380
conducted face to face.

996
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,820
So that's what the big deal is about

997
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,220
in the news.

998
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:36,600
Anyway.

999
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,760
No pun intended.

1000
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,120
Yeah, they do not.

1001
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,180
They're not there for anything.

1002
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:43,580
But just imagine the most stupid shit someone

1003
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,740
in that position would do.

1004
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,760
And that's what they do.

1005
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,020
There you go.

1006
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,760
So this is a little longer.

1007
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,000
And what I was going to tell you

1008
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,300
is, if you want to, you can go

1009
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,540
ahead and open up your settings and click

1010
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,920
on the extra noise suppression beta thing there,

1011
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,440
because I think it'll help.

1012
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:57,980
For me?

1013
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:58,880
Yeah, for you.

1014
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,540
And while I read this, maybe it'll actually

1015
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,260
change the sound of me reading.

1016
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,680
If you know, go ahead.

1017
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:11,860
The book, The Greek Couldn't Recall in Etheric

1018
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:16,100
Formative Forces in Cosmos, Earth and Man, written

1019
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:19,940
by Gunther Waxmuth, which is spelled W-A

1020
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:22,320
-C-H-S-M-U-T-H.

1021
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,160
And Rudolf Steiner's secretary.

1022
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,060
Right.

1023
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,380
He's about to say that.

1024
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,420
Assistant and close collaborator.

1025
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,920
He describes Rudolf Steiner as.

1026
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:36,200
Anyway, he found it at archive.org, provides

1027
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:36,700
an address.

1028
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,760
I'm sure you have a copy, though, Greek.

1029
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,020
But if you want the address, we'll give

1030
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:40,460
it to you.

1031
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:45,840
Is this work, Waxmuth outlines the four ethers

1032
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,200
Steiner described as actually at work in nature

1033
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:49,840
today.

1034
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:55,880
Warmer ether, lighter ether, tone of sound, chemical

1035
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:00,660
in parentheses, ether, life and life ether.

1036
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,980
Yeah, yeah, I like that, but we don't

1037
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:05,840
know for sure.

1038
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:10,659
Do they all react differently with experimentation and

1039
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:11,360
experience?

1040
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:14,320
That's to be discovered still.

1041
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:18,100
I think that's a really good prognostication kind

1042
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,560
of thing, like to think of it that

1043
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:20,860
way.

1044
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:21,480
Right.

1045
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,199
There's a little more to it.

1046
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:23,780
Approach.

1047
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,020
Yeah, there's a little more to it.

1048
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:29,139
Together, these form the nonphysical energy matrix that

1049
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:33,219
underlines underlies, excuse me, all life on Earth.

1050
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,320
Steiner also spoke of a fifth ether now

1051
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,600
beginning to emerge.

1052
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:43,000
Moral ether, a future oriented ether formed through

1053
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,560
human moral development and ethical striving.

1054
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:51,719
It reflects the spiritual transformation of the etheric

1055
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:52,560
body.

1056
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,480
While Steiner did not list seven ethers, many

1057
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:05,600
anthroposophical thinkers interpret

1058
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:10,260
this cosmology to imply that seven ethers will

1059
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:15,140
ultimately unfold in line with humanity's spiritual evolution.

1060
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,780
Now, I'm going to add a comment here

1061
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,220
real quick and then turn it over to

1062
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,840
you, because what's funny is I kind of

1063
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,700
saw this in the crappy Ghostbusters 2 movie,

1064
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,100
which I did not like.

1065
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:29,240
But there was a sludge, kind of a

1066
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,820
supernatural slime starting to form under New York

1067
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,400
City, and it was all being formed by

1068
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,020
the negative energy being exerted by the people

1069
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:39,520
above.

1070
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,480
And it's just the first reference that came

1071
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,700
to my mind in media of something like

1072
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:49,940
this, where your energetic actions begin to take

1073
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:53,360
a somewhat physical form, but it's a metaphysical

1074
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:57,740
form also, and become representative in this very

1075
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:01,220
real and elemental way.

1076
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,440
So it's not a good representation, but it's

1077
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,780
a loose way to look at it.

1078
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,720
I'm curious about that.

1079
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,840
So yeah, no, I don't see it that

1080
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,480
way right now.

1081
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,660
Humanity is like you ever walk into the

1082
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,780
bathroom where someone forgot to flush and you

1083
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,880
look at it, you're like, oh, no.

1084
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:20,280
And no matter what, you just push the

1085
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,540
handle on the chrome handle on the porcelain

1086
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:22,820
ball.

1087
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:23,340
Sure.

1088
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:23,980
Right.

1089
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,060
If you think that material is workable, go

1090
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:27,760
for it.

1091
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,580
We're in the credits for a while.

1092
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,140
I've been talking about we're in the credits

1093
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,220
since 1998.

1094
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:35,520
You're pre-destruction phase right now.

1095
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,220
It's the hammer has been cocked, and it's

1096
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:39,560
ready.

1097
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,820
The trigger has been pulled.

1098
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,300
It's just that 0.3 seconds before it

1099
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:43,900
strikes.

1100
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:47,760
No, there's I don't see any kind of

1101
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,220
whatever, whatever I see in this, like of

1102
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,440
anything positive coming out of the human collective,

1103
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,700
even on the micro groups that they're supposedly

1104
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,060
errands or evolved or whatever.

1105
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,520
No, I don't see anything happening at all.

1106
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,520
I'd say there's less than 100 people, if

1107
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:07,060
not maybe 1000 people within reach, possibly, if

1108
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,460
you spent the rest of your life trying

1109
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,100
to find them available.

1110
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,920
It's so piss poor.

1111
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:16,580
I'm giving what I to the best of

1112
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,680
my knowledge, the most accurate thing of what's

1113
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,320
going on.

1114
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,400
Just finish up whatever you're doing.

1115
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,220
Right.

1116
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,640
And do the best at it.

1117
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,380
Finishing it up and helping whatever you can.

1118
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:30,000
You notice that and say, however, whatever you

1119
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,700
can, because all of it's going to be

1120
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,900
changed and transformed.

1121
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,100
It's the end.

1122
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:37,540
If any kind of transformation or positive growth

1123
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,220
was going to come out, it ain't here.

1124
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:42,300
No, you're in the you can have a

1125
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,900
beautiful bathroom or a crappy bathroom in Penn

1126
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:46,940
Station, let's say.

1127
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,060
Actually, I heard they just redid Penn Station.

1128
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,800
The bathrooms are very pleasant now.

1129
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:55,920
But what I'm saying, yeah, it was like

1130
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,420
a $3 billion project.

1131
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,620
So it doesn't matter if that fancy there's

1132
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:03,420
right there at Bryant Park by the library,

1133
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,320
that bathroom cost a quarter of a million

1134
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,560
dollars a year to maintain.

1135
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,020
They even put flowers in there.

1136
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:08,660
You've been in there.

1137
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,880
I don't know what I'm talking about.

1138
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,140
I don't think I've been in the park

1139
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,640
right by the library.

1140
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:14,720
Oh, my gosh.

1141
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:15,640
Yeah.

1142
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:16,580
Marble anything.

1143
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:16,980
Anyway.

1144
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:21,780
So whether it's a crappy bathroom or a

1145
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:25,760
fancy bathroom, the floaters in the tank have

1146
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,040
to anyone that sees it right away, pull

1147
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:28,480
the handle.

1148
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,460
That's where you're at with humanity.

1149
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,320
All right.

1150
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,280
Now, the only exceptions are the ones that

1151
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,040
will like brochures talks about make their escape.

1152
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,800
But not out of the bowl.

1153
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,600
Nobody wants the church to fall out.

1154
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:40,840
Right.

1155
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,180
Because then you got to call the janitor.

1156
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:42,920
It's more work.

1157
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,240
What I mean is keep yourself as clean

1158
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:50,400
as possible and enjoy the ride in the

1159
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:50,700
meantime.

1160
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:55,020
But no, this I see nothing altruistic like

1161
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:55,840
Steiner.

1162
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,880
First of all, my comments on Steiner.

1163
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,600
He's way too airy fairy for me.

1164
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,480
His audio like I got to turn him

1165
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,480
off after 15 minutes.

1166
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,280
This has got to go.

1167
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,160
This is not real.

1168
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,020
I mean, this is too airy fairy for

1169
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:09,380
me.

1170
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,380
And it's not real.

1171
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,640
But the core at the core, if you

1172
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,900
were to do a bullet point on what

1173
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,240
he talks about, yeah, it's pretty good.

1174
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,880
It's very accurate in many ways, especially when

1175
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,920
you're talking about agriculture.

1176
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,560
But he's got the spirit stuff wrong, completely

1177
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,020
wrong.

1178
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,920
In my in my opinion, because who who

1179
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,800
has the spiritual stuff completely right.

1180
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:31,340
Right.

1181
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,040
So for my estimation, like an example would

1182
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:39,940
be this is what happens when you die.

1183
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,100
OK, these are the possibilities, like it or

1184
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,600
not, believe it or not or whatever.

1185
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,760
And I'll stand behind this anytime.

1186
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,800
When some people die, they go somewhere that

1187
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,560
looks like heaven.

1188
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,900
They call heaven, whether it is or not.

1189
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:57,720
Some people go to where you might consider

1190
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,500
to be a hell.

1191
00:39:59,140 --> 00:39:59,620
Right.

1192
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:05,040
Other people are brought back here like what's

1193
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:05,900
called reincarnation.

1194
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,180
Others are just rubbed out like a Dixie

1195
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,840
cup at the office cooler.

1196
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,060
Crumble it, throw it away.

1197
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:11,500
That's it.

1198
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:11,880
They're done.

1199
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:12,360
Never.

1200
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:13,580
Nothing.

1201
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:14,300
No, nothing.

1202
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,180
They're just erased.

1203
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:16,660
Right.

1204
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,320
No one's talking like that.

1205
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,220
I did a lot of long talks about

1206
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:24,280
that, about how actually a great majority of

1207
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,760
the people that you see are just going

1208
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,420
to be just intermittent.

1209
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,280
So you want to spend time with the

1210
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,740
NPCs when they're when they're done here, they're

1211
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,080
done.

1212
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,760
They're never to be seen or heard from

1213
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,920
again on a spiritual realm or cosmic realm

1214
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,080
or anything.

1215
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,640
And a lot of the airy fairy people

1216
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,120
that I knew in the 80s that put

1217
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,260
me on to a lot of the stuff

1218
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,760
that I talk about, because if you saw

1219
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,180
transcripts or heard me talk in the 1980s

1220
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:50,320
and what I'm saying now, you'd be like

1221
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,420
saying the same stuff pretty much.

1222
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:52,760
Right.

1223
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:55,280
Can't be because we've been influenced by events

1224
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,280
and constant study.

1225
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:56,560
Right.

1226
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:01,540
But the notion that most people will cease

1227
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,480
to exist when they exist on this plane,

1228
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,740
just look at them.

1229
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,380
Just look at them right now.

1230
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,720
There is no humanity, as people say.

1231
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,400
No, it's it's an expression.

1232
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,940
Everybody is an expression of a same species,

1233
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,580
let's say the human species.

1234
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:24,380
But within how that's expressed, as I just

1235
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:26,340
laid out for you, I'll say it again.

1236
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,500
Some go to a heaven, some go to

1237
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:28,900
a hell.

1238
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,540
And I didn't say heaven or hell, something

1239
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:33,400
that's like that, whether it's real or not.

1240
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:36,320
You know, remember, you can spend a thousand

1241
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,260
years somewhere in one minute, our time.

1242
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:38,800
Right.

1243
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:41,560
When you break that consciousness thing.

1244
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,000
OK, so some go to heaven, some go

1245
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,100
to something called a hell.

1246
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,900
Most are going to believe, I believe, or

1247
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,460
let's say some will be rubbed out.

1248
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:52,540
Let's put quotes around 90 percent will be

1249
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,060
rubbed out, never existing again.

1250
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,600
And then some are brought back.

1251
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,600
And that's those are basically when I talk

1252
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,340
about I used to speak for hours on

1253
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:04,820
this, on how it would work that way

1254
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:06,060
and why it works that way.

1255
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:10,040
Because the cosmic sense, the spiritual sense is

1256
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,320
quite rational and logical.

1257
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:12,780
Right.

1258
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,960
So, for example, give me an example, like

1259
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,680
bad people would go to a bad place

1260
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,720
if they were to exist in a place

1261
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,540
after here.

1262
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:21,240
Right.

1263
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:24,880
So but most people say someone like Mother

1264
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,200
Teresa would go to heaven.

1265
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,040
Right.

1266
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:30,660
No, she thinks she was a good person.

1267
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,260
What makes you think she was good?

1268
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:35,380
She made like certain bishops, like mega wealthy

1269
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:38,020
by child trafficking or Gandhi.

1270
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:38,840
Right.

1271
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:40,100
Right.

1272
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,500
Are you you're aware Mother Teresa was a

1273
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,500
total scumbag, right?

1274
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,840
Yeah, I've been through this with you before

1275
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,800
and believe me, I did other research.

1276
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:50,360
But the thing is, I'm just agreeing with

1277
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:50,600
you.

1278
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,240
Like when you said, oh, people would say

1279
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:52,440
that.

1280
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,400
Yeah, they would say it.

1281
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,360
It doesn't mean it's true.

1282
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:57,360
But what I'm trying to say, but what

1283
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,260
I'm trying to say when I say some

1284
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:00,780
people would go to heaven, it's not who

1285
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:01,540
you think.

1286
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:03,140
Right.

1287
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,560
And some people would go to hell.

1288
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,040
It's not who you think, because you've been

1289
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,500
so led down and deceived.

1290
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:09,020
Right.

1291
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,640
About all these and the popular.

1292
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,660
Because you usually think of someone popular.

1293
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:16,480
Right.

1294
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,220
But start thinking about the people that you've

1295
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:20,020
met in your life.

1296
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,760
Will your grandma go to heaven or hell?

1297
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,420
Will she be rubbed out, never to exist

1298
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:23,720
again?

1299
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:24,780
Or is she coming back?

1300
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:26,440
Right.

1301
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,280
I'm just saying that don't think of Willie

1302
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,340
Nelson or Mother Teresa or Gandhi.

1303
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:31,600
No.

1304
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:35,580
Think about the people you've actually experienced when

1305
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:36,800
you think about these things.

1306
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,300
Don't don't put together this altruistic thing like,

1307
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,820
oh, this person was really good.

1308
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:42,840
So they're no, no, no.

1309
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:45,400
Always deal with the people that you've met.

1310
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:46,780
You know what I mean?

1311
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:47,780
Because that's direct.

1312
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:51,020
And because talk about your senses being deceived.

1313
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:51,600
Right.

1314
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,020
Anything in the media is a lie.

1315
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:53,680
It has to be.

1316
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,300
Otherwise, no one would listen to it.

1317
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,940
So when you start looking at the people

1318
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:00,880
that you've experienced, you get a sense of

1319
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,600
things and just put it together that way.

1320
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:06,260
But again, to go back to the spiritual

1321
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:06,620
thing.

1322
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:07,300
No, there's nothing.

1323
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,400
No, it's it's all going to be redone.

1324
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,220
And you're going to start right back at

1325
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:11,600
the beginning.

1326
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:13,500
That's where I agree with archaics right back

1327
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,720
to an Adam and Eve primitive.

1328
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,480
And you're always going to have those that

1329
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,680
are outside coming back in.

1330
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:18,960
Right.

1331
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:22,460
You know, like the Freemasonic compass and square.

1332
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,740
That's the builder race.

1333
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:24,060
Right.

1334
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,380
That's to commemorate, venerate that.

1335
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,820
You know, once everything is destroyed, there's an

1336
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:30,860
injection of people that know how to rebuild

1337
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:31,280
things.

1338
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:31,520
Right.

1339
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,060
There's a few movies that were like that.

1340
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,960
The Truman Show was even like that.

1341
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:36,220
Right.

1342
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,900
So the behind the scenes on the Truman

1343
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:41,380
Show were very technically advanced compared to the

1344
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:43,080
people in the town that he lived with.

1345
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:43,360
Right.

1346
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,680
So how long this goes on and the

1347
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,160
structure of it, I don't know.

1348
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:50,760
But and you also have to find out

1349
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,560
what what your fascination is.

1350
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,160
Give me an example.

1351
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:57,940
What I've been interviewing people like product developer

1352
00:44:57,940 --> 00:44:58,680
for Pfizer.

1353
00:44:59,160 --> 00:44:59,380
Right.

1354
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:01,560
What doesn't matter.

1355
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,100
Your product developer, your product developer doesn't matter

1356
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:04,980
what product is.

1357
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:05,220
Right.

1358
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,820
Just to see if I could bring some

1359
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:07,620
people on board.

1360
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:08,140
And you know what?

1361
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:10,080
The first thing I these are corporate types.

1362
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:11,400
Do you know what?

1363
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,180
The first thing I went into this last

1364
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:14,400
time because I told you what the best

1365
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,780
resume for me would look like.

1366
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:16,000
Right.

1367
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,020
But these corporate types, you know what?

1368
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:21,360
The first question I asked them is to

1369
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:21,920
go figure.

1370
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,440
You can imagine what a corporate what kind

1371
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,120
of interview questions they're used to.

1372
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:25,380
Right.

1373
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,300
Once we do the meet and greet, you

1374
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:28,540
know what?

1375
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,040
I asked him.

1376
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,060
First thing I asked him, these corporate people,

1377
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:31,720
what's up?

1378
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:32,560
What's your super?

1379
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,100
What are your superpowers or your superpower?

1380
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:36,020
What's your superpower?

1381
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:37,300
They're like, huh?

1382
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:38,220
What?

1383
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:39,540
What?

1384
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,620
Everybody's got a superpower.

1385
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:43,580
Everyone's an X man.

1386
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,740
Everyone is a superhero.

1387
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:46,960
Saturday morning, whatever.

1388
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,220
You just it's all latent.

1389
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:49,340
Right.

1390
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,300
Why do you think everyone relates to those?

1391
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:53,500
There was a TV show called Heroes.

1392
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,200
I don't remember that about 20 years ago.

1393
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:56,840
Isn't that amazing?

1394
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
20 years ago.

1395
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,500
I love that because it was just yeah,

1396
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,480
it was just people out of like little

1397
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,320
sleepy towns.

1398
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:03,680
Right.

1399
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,060
Whatever nonchalant.

1400
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:05,340
Right.

1401
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,540
And they were tapping in X-Men was

1402
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:08,740
another.

1403
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:09,820
There's a bunch of them.

1404
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:10,700
Right.

1405
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:11,480
What are your super?

1406
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:12,840
What are your superpowers?

1407
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:14,160
That's what that's what I you know.

1408
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,860
So when you know your superpowers, right, you

1409
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:17,780
apply them.

1410
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:18,320
Right.

1411
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:21,760
And if you don't have any superpowers, well,

1412
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,440
you know, anyway, by the way, the best

1413
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,220
resume, the person I'm looking for has dropped

1414
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:29,140
out at the eighth grade.

1415
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:30,860
I've been on the FBI most wanted list

1416
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:32,420
between 2015 and 2020.

1417
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:35,480
And I have my own art studio right

1418
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,820
now, and I'm trying to make the rent.

1419
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:39,720
That's the perfect resume.

1420
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,840
If you know anyone like that, I'll take

1421
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,020
it.

1422
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:44,360
But but anyway, that was a kind of

1423
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,820
a long, indirect answer to the Rudolf Steiner

1424
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:49,120
stuff and the ether stuff.

1425
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:51,480
But I'll tell you what we started off

1426
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:55,660
by thanking someone who thanked about doing the

1427
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:56,180
weather work.

1428
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:57,440
I don't know how they picked it up,

1429
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,160
whether it sounds I'm presuming it's more from

1430
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,100
the the when you posted it.

1431
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:02,300
Right.

1432
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:03,000
I think you and.

1433
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:04,620
Yeah, I think.

1434
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,580
Yeah, I think they may have started it

1435
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:07,880
and then they continued it.

1436
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:09,400
And I was curious if you wanted me

1437
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,660
to post more because I only posted the

1438
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:12,760
couple that you told me to.

1439
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:13,760
And I have a few more.

1440
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,400
I have a few more audio.

1441
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:16,720
So, you know, good.

1442
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:17,800
No, do it.

1443
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:18,480
I'm sorry.

1444
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,660
Yeah, make it complete.

1445
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:22,160
Because if people are actually if one person

1446
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,940
can use it and have effects with it,

1447
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:25,100
make give them the whole thing.

1448
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:27,000
It was by the way, it was just

1449
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,960
an I think people that have been listening

1450
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,260
for a while have showed up.

1451
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:33,240
They know when we announce a webinar, it's

1452
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:33,740
not a seminar.

1453
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:36,540
It's a webinar because webinars, seminars in person.

1454
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,940
But quite a few people showed up and

1455
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,140
quite a few people have done.

1456
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:43,620
I don't know really how much they should

1457
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:44,280
say exactly.

1458
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,080
But when someone responds back with results, I

1459
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,180
mean, that's a big deal.

1460
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,300
That's a big deal.

1461
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,260
For example, with the weather here, we have

1462
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:55,060
monsoons in Tucson Southwest.

1463
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:56,660
So it's very dry in the desert.

1464
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,900
But it rains every afternoon, pretty much for

1465
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:01,120
all of July and August.

1466
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:01,380
Right.

1467
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,280
We didn't have anything like that this year.

1468
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:05,040
So I waited for a monsoon season to

1469
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,700
officially end about a week and a half

1470
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:07,020
ago.

1471
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:09,060
And guess what I did after the monsoon

1472
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:09,400
season?

1473
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:10,700
I brought the monsoons.

1474
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:12,840
It's been raining every day or every other

1475
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,940
day for a week and a half.

1476
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:17,020
And they're like, we have more rain in

1477
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,080
the past week and a half than we

1478
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,280
have in the past six months.

1479
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:19,780
Yeah.

1480
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:23,560
And that's when you do it, because if

1481
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,780
you do it during monsoons.

1482
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,960
It's all second guessing.

1483
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,000
But when they say monsoon season is over,

1484
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:30,500
here comes the dry weather.

1485
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,740
And then you start making rain on call.

1486
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,000
Today, we had a 5% chance of

1487
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:35,160
rain.

1488
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,420
Today, we had not one, but two thunderstorms

1489
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:39,040
that lasted 15, 20 minutes.

1490
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:43,340
You know, with 5% chance of rain,

1491
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:44,960
the streets running like a river.

1492
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:45,860
I love it.

1493
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,300
Yeah, right.

1494
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:49,140
Actually, there was two people that thanked you

1495
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:49,920
regarding weather.

1496
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:51,540
And somebody else thanked you for a different

1497
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:52,120
device.

1498
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:54,180
But I got to find it, because now

1499
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:56,300
I've lost track of where the screenshot was.

1500
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,320
And I can't seem to find it.

1501
00:48:57,980 --> 00:48:59,300
But two people did thank you.

1502
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,440
Well, it couldn't have been a battery.

1503
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:01,060
Yeah.

1504
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:01,600
No, it wasn't.

1505
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,220
We could have ruled out it's not battery

1506
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:03,820
-operated.

1507
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,860
If it's battery-operated, it's got to be

1508
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:08,900
the silver, aqueous argentum.

1509
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,060
No, I think it might be literally a

1510
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:12,980
scalerator and weatherwork together.

1511
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:16,040
Oh, that's fantastic.

1512
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:17,500
So, and they were thanking you for it.

1513
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:18,920
Actually, Troy, do you want to take that

1514
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:19,120
one?

1515
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:20,020
Yeah.

1516
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:21,060
Anyway, go ahead.

1517
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:21,780
No, I was just saying.

1518
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:22,220
You're welcome.

1519
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:22,760
Thank you.

1520
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:23,000
Yeah.

1521
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,260
I just wanted to let you know that

1522
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:24,960
that is there.

1523
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:26,260
And I'll find it for next time to

1524
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:27,920
make sure I read exactly what you said.

1525
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:31,780
And we'll leave it at that and just

1526
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:34,780
ask you one final question, I guess, which

1527
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:34,960
is...

1528
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:37,380
Let me see where this is.

1529
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:38,220
I know I had it.

1530
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,840
This is just one of those times where

1531
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:41,280
I'm just not...

1532
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:43,360
Things just clicked off on me.

1533
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:44,200
It's okay.

1534
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:44,780
You know what?

1535
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:46,960
I know that one of the last questions

1536
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,960
was, again, about society and the way it's

1537
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:50,320
going.

1538
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,680
And they talked about some of the things

1539
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,140
that you mentioned real quick there about who

1540
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:58,500
it is I should choose to waste my

1541
00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:59,240
time with.

1542
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,360
There you go.

1543
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:02,880
You already kind of gave that advice.

1544
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:07,480
And they said, but at the same time,

1545
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:09,360
isn't there something to...

1546
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:11,600
Because they asked in that ether question there,

1547
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:15,580
isn't there something to building this positive ether

1548
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:17,840
that seems to be described there?

1549
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:20,000
Is that going to be worth anything?

1550
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,900
Because I'm paraphrasing now, guys.

1551
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:22,200
Sorry.

1552
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:23,700
No.

1553
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:25,400
No, there's no positive ether.

1554
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:26,080
But that's okay.

1555
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:26,560
Continue.

1556
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:29,200
Because it seems to me like everything we

1557
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,040
do is going to be mopped up anyway.

1558
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:33,320
If everything is going to be sort of

1559
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:36,400
swept away, then it causes them to ask

1560
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,040
the nihilistic question, does any of it actually

1561
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:39,420
matter?

1562
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,620
No, of course not.

1563
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:43,880
This is a waste of time.

1564
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:44,660
It's not a school.

1565
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:45,200
It's whatever.

1566
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,640
If you think it's a prison, when you

1567
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,220
leave here, you're just in the prison yard,

1568
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:48,500
right?

1569
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,860
So it depends on how you see it.

1570
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,500
But the ether is the potential and everything

1571
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:58,500
else, the matter, the heat, the chemical tone,

1572
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:00,720
ether, the life ether is the expression of

1573
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,420
that potential.

1574
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:04,720
It's how much of that potential is expressed,

1575
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:05,660
right?

1576
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:10,540
Manifested is what it is.

1577
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:13,260
There is no positive or negative about it.

1578
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:15,620
I don't believe in the good and bad

1579
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:16,860
and the positive and negative.

1580
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,300
That's why I'm so much into picking a

1581
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:20,940
law form and sticking with it.

1582
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,360
Because, you know, the bank robbers that are

1583
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:26,260
getting away with the cash are the good

1584
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:28,100
guys and the cops are the bad guys

1585
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:30,000
for busting them and shooting at them.

1586
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:30,880
Right.

1587
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:35,340
But to the cops, the bank robbers are

1588
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:36,220
the bad guys.

1589
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:37,820
And they're the good guys, right?

1590
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:38,240
You see?

1591
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,400
So who's really good or bad?

1592
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,780
Because the bad guys are more like Robin

1593
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:43,900
Hood, right?

1594
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:46,360
All the money that, you know, I have

1595
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,820
talked about anyone who has a checking account

1596
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:50,860
or a debit card is paying 100%

1597
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:51,640
banking fees.

1598
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,120
You do understand that, right?

1599
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:54,740
Suckers, right?

1600
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,840
So why don't you negotiate with the bank

1601
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,300
that when you write a check for $100,

1602
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:01,820
they just debit you $10, not the full

1603
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:05,500
100, because the money is created a transaction,

1604
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:07,860
not on anyway, right?

1605
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:09,720
So who's going to complain?

1606
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,260
By the way, you remember how bank robberies

1607
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:12,880
used to be in the news all often,

1608
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,600
at least, you know, back in the day?

1609
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,360
Now, never, never, right?

1610
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:17,400
Occasionally.

1611
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:18,480
Because I think people are wise.

1612
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:20,600
Occasionally, what's happening?

1613
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:21,000
Is there any?

1614
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:22,880
And not lately.

1615
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:23,680
Wow, weird.

1616
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:25,500
Yeah, sorry about that.

1617
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:27,120
I don't know why, but there's a little

1618
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,160
disruption between us.

1619
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,200
We'll figure it out in a sec.

1620
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,720
But the bank robberies were a little more

1621
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:36,060
common, say, up until, I would say maybe

1622
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:39,020
15 years ago, they sort of stopped dead.

1623
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:40,820
I haven't heard about any of them since

1624
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:41,040
then.

1625
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:44,680
No, not at all.

1626
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,260
I mean, I think if people knew what

1627
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:47,760
was going on, there's no reason to rob

1628
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:48,160
a bank.

1629
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,060
They're the ones that are robbing everyone with

1630
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:52,040
100% fees.

1631
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:54,900
But 100% fees, meaning, you know, just

1632
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:56,680
look up what 100% bank fees mean.

1633
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,100
And that's what you're, yeah.

1634
00:52:58,180 --> 00:52:59,620
So the way to fix that, by the

1635
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:01,880
way, just as an example, is just write

1636
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,320
a letter to the bank and stop using

1637
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,120
the bank checks.

1638
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,660
Use a money order.

1639
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:07,500
Use cash, right?

1640
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:10,120
And just you could put the banks out

1641
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,320
of business in three days.

1642
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,440
You mean you, meaning like a small percentage

1643
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,640
of the population, like 10% would do

1644
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:16,900
that.

1645
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,500
So yeah.

1646
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:19,500
So anyway.

1647
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:22,380
Yeah, just to clarify on that question.

1648
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,620
Sorry, just to clarify on that question that

1649
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:26,460
I started before.

1650
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:28,260
And yeah, we got to figure out something's

1651
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:29,520
disrupted between us again.

1652
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:31,200
Moral ether.

1653
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,240
Yeah, moral ether is the phrase that was

1654
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,260
used in that book.

1655
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:37,140
And it says that it's emerging.

1656
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:38,160
Yeah, I don't get that.

1657
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,880
Well, just let me give you a definition

1658
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:40,440
real quick.

1659
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:41,820
And this is why I think they were

1660
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:42,620
asking the question.

1661
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:46,260
A future-oriented ether formed through human moral

1662
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:49,140
development and ethical striving.

1663
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:53,620
It reflects the spiritual transformation of the etheric

1664
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:54,600
body.

1665
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,940
So that's why I think they were asking

1666
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:00,380
about building positive because that sounds positive.

1667
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:02,020
No, no.

1668
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:03,100
Positive for who?

1669
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:06,900
It, yeah, it, this, that's the kind of

1670
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:09,920
stuff like Jack Fresco was asked.

1671
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,600
You know, when you get your Venus project

1672
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,480
going and what if you have someone that's

1673
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:15,080
hoarding and not complying, how are you going

1674
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:15,580
to treat with them?

1675
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:16,940
We're just going to shame them.

1676
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,400
We're going to put their name, right?

1677
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:20,800
So if you don't go along with that

1678
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,820
moral ether, how are they going to enforce

1679
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:23,180
that?

1680
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:25,960
We'll just shame them, put their name in

1681
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,720
the paper that they're not moral or whatever.

1682
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:28,500
Get out of here.

1683
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,920
There's no, there's no thing like that.

1684
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:34,500
There's a vitality that drives everything.

1685
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,560
And that vitality does not exist until it's

1686
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,700
manifested or expressed.

1687
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:42,900
So there's a very, very big difference.

1688
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,660
It's kind of like water.

1689
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:45,740
You know, you go there with a pail.

1690
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:46,880
How much water are you going to take

1691
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:47,600
out of the source?

1692
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:49,100
Whether it's a spring, a well, or a

1693
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:49,620
river, right?

1694
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,320
The ether is always going to be moving.

1695
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:55,040
It's what is manifested, right?

1696
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:57,500
And you need that mechanical side.

1697
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:00,740
That Wilhelm Reich was a much better, his

1698
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:02,660
writings on the ether or the organ were

1699
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:05,880
way better than Steiner, if you're going to

1700
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,820
go off into the altruism or whatever.

1701
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,600
But anyway, yeah, this is a complex subject.

1702
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,420
And it's, I can go on for a

1703
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:15,260
long time, give lots of examples from the

1704
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:17,600
point of view that I've, I can, I

1705
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:23,560
can express, but, but yeah, I mean, it

1706
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:25,200
can, as you could see, it could go

1707
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,740
on with no real term in it.

1708
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:28,960
So fair enough.

1709
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,040
So what you're telling me, though, is that

1710
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:34,180
ultimately, though, Fresco's solution was the equivalent of

1711
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:36,720
putting a kid in a dunce cap, which,

1712
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:38,360
you know, we used to see in cartoons.

1713
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:39,960
And, you know, at the end of the

1714
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,280
day, what did that actually accomplish?

1715
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,360
OK, you shamed them.

1716
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:44,680
Everybody points their finger.

1717
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:46,460
Oh, you're dummy, you're dunce.

1718
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,860
And that's how, you know, they used to

1719
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:50,080
handle children in cartoons.

1720
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:52,000
I've never seen the dunce cap thing done

1721
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:52,440
in life.

1722
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,720
But then that person goes into the military

1723
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,440
and the military finds out history.

1724
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:57,280
They did that to him.
