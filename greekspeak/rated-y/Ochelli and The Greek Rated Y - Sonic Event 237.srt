1
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,160
Geez, 237 rated Y, I think that's the

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:11,480
number.

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,740
Greek, how are you?

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,460
I'm doing all right.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm going to be pretty busy soon.

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,620
It looks like it's what the last day

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,440
of September and I just found out that

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,580
the lab is ready for occupancy in October

9
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,440
1st and I thought that was a little

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,960
ways but I found out today.

11
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,400
So, that means that's tomorrow and I'm in

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,180
Tucson and the lab is in California.

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,100
Oh shit, how do you do that?

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:37,960
That's not a problem.

15
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:38,120
Anyway.

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,320
That's not a problem at all.

17
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,320
You can be there quickly.

18
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,380
It's easily done if somebody wants to make

19
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:43,920
sure it happens.

20
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:45,460
Right?

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,800
Yeah, it's a big raw space.

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,820
We haven't signed on it yet but it's

23
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,240
like 99% and it's a big, like

24
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,500
I always said, bunch of parking, big roll

25
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,160
-down gate, very tall ceilings, concrete floor, white

26
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,440
walls.

27
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,920
I mean, you can't really blow stuff up

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,519
in there but it's pretty good.

29
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:05,720
Yeah.

30
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,840
And now, it's just looking for the people

31
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,620
and anyone that comes over and decides to

32
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,960
work with me will learn a lot.

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,220
You're going to learn a lot, a lot

34
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,600
because I see what's going on in the

35
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,300
world and what people do and I'm like,

36
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,440
oh gosh, if you only just spend a

37
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,180
few hours, we'd talk about what you did

38
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,440
in a different way.

39
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,900
One thing I want to interject, and maybe

40
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,860
I have, when we get into the space

41
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,920
there, it's going to be like Laguna Beach

42
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,560
area, Orange County.

43
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,520
What I want to do every weekend is

44
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,260
have a gathering of young people where they

45
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:46,740
learn everything just like night, play music, kind

46
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,160
of like a rave but not a rave,

47
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:48,420
right?

48
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,380
It could be a rave, whatever.

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,980
Just younger people, 70 and younger, right?

50
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,880
No, I'm just joking but anyway, young people

51
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,240
because they're not learning.

52
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,060
What's that?

53
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,620
I didn't expect a 70 there.

54
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,080
That was funny but okay, go ahead.

55
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,880
Yeah, sorry.

56
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,400
Yeah, but either way, yeah.

57
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,080
You know, if we're supposed to live very

58
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,900
long but we don't.

59
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,100
So we're going to learn how to, you're

60
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,100
going to learn about hygiene, you're going to

61
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,520
learn about the money system, you're going to

62
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,860
learn about food, you're going to learn about

63
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,300
the human body, you're going to learn about

64
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,320
history, you're going to learn about religion and

65
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,780
a lot of those things are not good,

66
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,280
by the way.

67
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,360
So basically, you learn how to wash your

68
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,540
bum right and how to prepare a good

69
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,960
meal and all the stuff we talk about

70
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,060
here in person and you will learn, you'll

71
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,940
actually be able to hear what the best

72
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:40,040
reproduced music sounds like through, you've never heard

73
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,320
anything like it because usually when you hear

74
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,480
reproduced music, a song you like from way

75
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,900
back then, you know, the band is not

76
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,180
there.

77
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,540
You've never heard it.

78
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,740
You've heard it through your car, your headphones

79
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,120
or your home stereo, your laptop, whatever.

80
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,300
But you've never heard it with the stuff

81
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,200
that I build, the acoustic counter space stuff

82
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,240
and you'll be quite amazed just on that.

83
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,960
So yeah, when I'm ready for that, but

84
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,540
that's one of the things because someone asked

85
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,700
me like, what do I really want to

86
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:05,920
do?

87
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,980
I said, what I want to do is

88
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,980
influence young people.

89
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,960
And that word is a bad word now

90
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,020
influence like social media and all that.

91
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,320
But I mean, they're not getting anything from

92
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:14,920
their parents.

93
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,880
Heck, they're not getting anything from school.

94
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:17,620
Right.

95
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,180
Grandma ain't teaching them nothing.

96
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,580
I mean, they there's this they can so

97
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,260
you get, you know, the concept, the pro

98
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,600
it's an old cliche junk in junk out.

99
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:26,900
Right.

100
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,320
So they've been getting junk their whole lives.

101
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,100
And yeah, and it's the younger people, the

102
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,760
phrase, the older people, hang on.

103
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,180
The phrase used to be garbage in garbage

104
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:38,520
out.

105
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:38,800
Right.

106
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,260
And that was a computer thing.

107
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,260
And that was supposed to be about, look,

108
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,500
the programming you put in, if it sucks,

109
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,860
then you're going to get a suck result.

110
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,340
I mean, that's pretty much what it what

111
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,700
it means, which is funny, because the first

112
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,380
the first question I want to run by

113
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,400
you before we get into just a couple

114
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,360
more is kind of about that, because they

115
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,020
said, you know, there must be a way

116
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,380
to access.

117
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,160
Let me read this.

118
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,700
There must be a way to access the

119
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,420
digital side of things as far as the

120
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,480
signature and how it creates money.

121
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,480
In other words, every single physical mechanism has

122
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,160
been made to have a digital one.

123
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,079
And if it was easy to access that,

124
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,560
that would be something that could indeed break

125
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,020
the system entirely.

126
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,480
That's how they worded it.

127
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:25,380
Yeah.

128
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,820
But the system is already broken.

129
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,220
It's based on credit.

130
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:30,760
Right.

131
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,580
I think I've gone.

132
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,040
Let me know.

133
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:32,380
OK.

134
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,860
Gold is for the nobility sovereigns like countries,

135
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,660
kings, very, very wealthy captains of industry The

136
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,820
common people use silver as an exchange.

137
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:43,760
Right.

138
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,920
Now, here we go.

139
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,500
The the the poor below the common people

140
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,600
or whatever you want to classify them as.

141
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,980
They do barter.

142
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,240
They do barter.

143
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,000
Slaves do credit.

144
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,980
Slaves do credit.

145
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,080
So everything is credit.

146
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,020
So defaults you into a slave category no

147
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:03,860
matter who you are.

148
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,500
Now, through the years, I've been so surprised

149
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,380
to find people of, let's say, billionaire types

150
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,520
that don't know how the money system works

151
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,580
at all.

152
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,520
As a matter of fact, that was not

153
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,180
going to mention his name, but Mike Finley.

154
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,520
But he he controls a lot of the

155
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,540
helium in the US.

156
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,180
For example, I think like 75 percent of

157
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,560
all the helium in the world comes from

158
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:25,960
the US.

159
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,820
And if you control 75 percent of that,

160
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,600
that's like controlling half of the helium in

161
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:29,920
the world.

162
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:30,200
Right.

163
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,100
That's like rough math.

164
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,360
He was selling a small bunch of oil

165
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,300
wells, like nine hundred and thirty six oil

166
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:39,600
wells.

167
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,280
Is that a bunch?

168
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:40,880
That's more.

169
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,740
That's a pretty big bunch.

170
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,000
Right.

171
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,520
And for a German company.

172
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,220
And by the way, the Germans and Norwegians

173
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,040
are buying up all the little wildcat wells,

174
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,560
you know, like little families that have these

175
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,640
little, you know, little companies.

176
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,460
This never makes the news.

177
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,120
I was surprised.

178
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,740
And they bought up all the ones in

179
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:01,160
the Colorado, New Mexico, Texas area, Northern Arizona,

180
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,480
you know, Four Corners, all that.

181
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,220
And now they're buying up all the ones

182
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,740
in Montana, which, by the way, Montana is

183
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,420
putting out oil that is so clean, like

184
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,360
the old Penn State oil that was around

185
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,500
150 years ago that it was so clean

186
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,420
coming out of the ground.

187
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,820
You could put it into your engine ready

188
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,400
to go.

189
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,480
That's how clean it is.

190
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,920
Low sulfur, almost no sulfur.

191
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,320
And we're I think we're we're the largest

192
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,740
oil producer in the world right now.

193
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,140
Again.

194
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,120
Right.

195
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:26,540
People.

196
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,880
I mean, these are facts.

197
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,140
Right.

198
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,580
I mean, you know, but you're not aware

199
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:30,920
of them.

200
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,620
So I was talking to these people and

201
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,540
this one guy, he was selling these oil

202
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,800
wells, by the way, to go back to

203
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,340
a nine hundred and thirty six oil wells

204
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,600
to Norwegians.

205
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:45,000
And it was the deal was broken up,

206
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,080
but he was getting ready for to get

207
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,020
thirty six million up front for to start

208
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,460
the deal.

209
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:51,760
Right.

210
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,400
So I'm over at his house.

211
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,520
He's like, oh, the bank just called.

212
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,740
I got to go down to the bank.

213
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,120
I'm like, OK, cool.

214
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:57,840
Can I come with you?

215
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,320
Sure.

216
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:58,920
Sure.

217
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,520
So go down there and they come out

218
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:00,840
with this.

219
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,760
You know what the commercial checkbooks look like.

220
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,000
Right.

221
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,840
It's like the big checks with the big

222
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,880
loose leaf binder.

223
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,420
Yeah.

224
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,500
That's got all the checks.

225
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,220
You tear them off.

226
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:08,480
Yeah.

227
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,700
It's got a whole separate ticket.

228
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:09,900
Yeah.

229
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,900
That tells you that that's supposed to be

230
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,100
the corporate ones.

231
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:13,440
Yeah.

232
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,020
Yeah.

233
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,960
So they come out with that and it's

234
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,140
covered with like blank pieces of paper all

235
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:18,420
over.

236
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:18,920
You don't even.

237
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,960
And they just ask him to sign here.

238
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,720
They're actually covering the check.

239
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,220
And he signed it.

240
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,140
And I'm like, it's not my business.

241
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:26,620
Right.

242
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,960
I'm not his agent.

243
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,580
So I'm just watching all this.

244
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,620
I said, what the hell are you doing?

245
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,120
This is the third time.

246
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,660
This is the third time they've asked me

247
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,200
to do that.

248
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:35,840
I was like, what?

249
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,940
You're signing checks made out to the bank

250
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,340
and they're taking your credit.

251
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:42,800
I don't care.

252
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,700
No one's.

253
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,280
Yeah.

254
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,200
Because right.

255
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,460
Remember, the thirty six million from the Germans

256
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,080
bank is never going to be transferred to

257
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,440
him.

258
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,480
He's creating the.

259
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:51,940
Right.

260
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:52,320
Right.

261
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,600
His own bank is creating it.

262
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:54,380
Right.

263
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:54,500
Right.

264
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:54,760
Right.

265
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,300
So he didn't quite get it.

266
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,460
He says, well, that's how it is.

267
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,860
You know, I'm willing to deal with.

268
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,800
I'm like, you're being totally royally ripped off.

269
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,820
And that's when I noticed that people are

270
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,600
under a trance.

271
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,660
That's where the Satanists, you know, regard the

272
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,740
people as the unwashed or the dead or

273
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,200
the masses, the unclean and all that, you

274
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,240
know, because of their behavior and their attitude

275
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:19,960
and all that.

276
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,800
By the way, the non Satanists, if you

277
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,300
read the Bible, it doesn't hold the masses

278
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,820
in any regard at all.

279
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,540
By the way, I think you understand that,

280
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,940
you know, even if you haven't read it,

281
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,900
you can just open to any page and

282
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,700
you'll see that the masses are in very

283
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,380
low regard.

284
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,140
So, yeah.

285
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:37,679
So there are billionaires that are in the

286
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,140
low regard on every side.

287
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:40,919
Yeah.

288
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,380
And if you don't mind, there's no way

289
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:42,900
the digital.

290
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,240
If you don't mind me saying, look, the

291
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,800
thing that jumps out of me right away

292
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,600
is that only a moron would sign a

293
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,160
check if they don't even know what the

294
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,340
numbers are on the check.

295
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,960
Because you're telling me basically.

296
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,280
Exactly.

297
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,000
It's all covered.

298
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,840
I mean, but that's like, even if you

299
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,960
don't think that, you know, let's just say

300
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,840
I reject all this stuff about the monetary

301
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,160
system that you've talked about.

302
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,400
Right.

303
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,180
And I'm thinking to myself, I'm going to

304
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,420
write a check that we're going to draw

305
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,020
funds out of my account and all that.

306
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,440
And you know, and I'm I would have

307
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,260
to see the numbers before I place a

308
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,140
signature on it.

309
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,540
I mean, why would you?

310
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,300
Seriously?

311
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:15,780
What?

312
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,560
OK, sorry.

313
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,640
I just had to throw that in.

314
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,080
But go ahead.

315
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:18,640
I mean, I know.

316
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,280
But you read how many times, how many

317
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,920
times have people told to read and there's

318
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,360
like all this fine print and then you

319
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,480
don't want to read this, not just sign

320
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:24,620
it.

321
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,660
But anyway, just to mention an old friend,

322
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,440
Sam, it's not too personal.

323
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,420
But when he was hearing me saying that

324
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,320
rich people were morons, he didn't quite get

325
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:32,460
it.

326
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,740
And he says, I don't think that's true.

327
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,120
And he was traveling around Europe, staying with

328
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,700
people, you know, doing barter and, you know,

329
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,520
whatever he did.

330
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,200
He traveled all over Europe, stayed all over

331
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,460
places and I don't get too personal.

332
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,940
But one day he calls me out of

333
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,340
the blue Skype and he's like, I want

334
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,540
to talk to you about what, Sam?

335
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,080
He's like, you know, when you said that

336
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,280
rich people are morons.

337
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,180
That's true.

338
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,860
And I'm like, well, what makes you turn

339
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,340
around and think that now is because I'm

340
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,500
staying with a very wealthy family and they're

341
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,140
total idiots.

342
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,260
And I'm like, oh, good.

343
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,140
So thank you.

344
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,960
I didn't I wasn't looking for approval or

345
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,440
confirmation because I already knew that.

346
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,580
But I'm glad you're coming around to see

347
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:09,700
it.

348
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,140
Right.

349
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,080
I mean, what's it worth?

350
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,360
Right.

351
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,140
So it's kind of like the Bible again.

352
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,200
If you hear what I'm saying and you

353
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,440
I'm not asking you to take it because

354
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,240
I said it.

355
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,640
Be skeptical.

356
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,380
But when you start seeing what I'm saying

357
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,780
is actually how it is, you don't have

358
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,200
to come back and tell me, well, that's

359
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:27,600
how it is.

360
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,420
I already know that.

361
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,600
Otherwise, I wouldn't be saying it.

362
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:29,860
Right.

363
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,360
I'm trying to give it objective information.

364
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,460
I'm trying to objectify.

365
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,020
Are all wealthy people morons?

366
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:37,640
No.

367
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,920
It's like it's back to the calories.

368
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,620
You know how I say calories don't apply

369
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,760
unless you're pooping charcoal.

370
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,120
You know, there might be someone pooping charcoal

371
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,280
and calories apply to them.

372
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,700
I will never say calories never, ever apply

373
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,880
to humans, all humans.

374
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,300
I always say very specifically, it doesn't apply

375
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,320
to you unless you're pooping charcoal.

376
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,060
There might be someone out there that every

377
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,220
time they poop, charcoal comes out.

378
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:01,520
Right.

379
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,520
So anyway.

380
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,580
Well, then one wonders.

381
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,720
I try to be objective.

382
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:05,180
Yeah.

383
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,820
I'm going to tackle a couple other questions

384
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,180
here because you raised up a bunch of

385
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,580
people asking questions about, you know, people being

386
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,700
gotten rid of basically in the cleansing that's

387
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,020
to come as far as I can tell.

388
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,720
And I got to tell you, that's one

389
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,120
of the weirdest things because this idea that,

390
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,960
you know, basically it's all got to go.

391
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,160
I think some of it has to remain.

392
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,120
I think that to be in an absolute

393
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,060
circumstance, like even some of the bad people

394
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,380
are going to still remain here.

395
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,140
Even some of the stupid people.

396
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:33,760
It always does.

397
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:34,840
It has to.

398
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,360
It always does.

399
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:36,740
Right.

400
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:36,920
Yeah.

401
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:37,160
Yeah.

402
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,380
But.

403
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,680
But that's that's not complicated at all.

404
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,940
That's not complicated.

405
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,520
That's pretty.

406
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,720
Shouldn't say obvious.

407
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,860
You know, look, you know, the FDA approves

408
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,700
a certain amount of rat feces in hot

409
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,280
dogs because when they investigated all of the

410
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,580
hot dog factories, they all had rat feces.

411
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,280
And they said, if we shut them all

412
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,320
down, there'll be a real the next American

413
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:56,900
revolution.

414
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,220
Can you imagine no more hot dogs?

415
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,200
So they said, well, let's leave.

416
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,880
Let's leave a minimal.

417
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,440
Yeah.

418
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,420
Ask people what they're doing.

419
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,180
Fourth of July for it's for barbecue and

420
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:05,920
hot dogs and hamburger.

421
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,180
Right.

422
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,640
So you can't have a revolution.

423
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,600
So they allow a certain amount of excrement.

424
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,080
This is you could look it up.

425
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:12,460
I don't know.

426
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,120
After Kobe, they took a lot of stuff

427
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,820
offline, but I've showed people or they do

428
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,940
allow they don't call it.

429
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,980
They call it digest animal digest.

430
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,360
They don't call it feces.

431
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,160
They don't call it extra.

432
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,640
They call it animal digest.

433
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,460
What is an animal digest?

434
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,380
Think about it.

435
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,100
Where does the digestion happen?

436
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,140
What is digestion?

437
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:33,580
Right.

438
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,280
So anyway, it's called animal digest for now

439
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,480
is allowed.

440
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,380
You'll actually see animal digest in pet foods,

441
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:40,700
too.

442
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,340
Oh, yeah.

443
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,620
Well, almost anything.

444
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,660
If you check in the ingredients and allow.

445
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,440
Yeah.

446
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,420
I'm like peanut butter.

447
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:47,760
Peanut.

448
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,780
So, in other words, peanut butter is another.

449
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,540
There's going to be.

450
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,300
I'm sorry.

451
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,160
You know.

452
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:54,660
Yeah.

453
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,100
Well, there's a guy that talked about, you

454
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,340
know, like there's no evolution because the food

455
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,360
storage industry relies on no evolution.

456
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,940
If you put peanut butter away for 100

457
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,280
years or a thousand years, you'll open it

458
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,860
a thousand years or a hundred years later.

459
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,300
Guess what?

460
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,100
It's still peanut butter.

461
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:09,380
Right.

462
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,320
So.

463
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,440
But here's the interesting part about that.

464
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,080
It's very easy.

465
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,860
And they're not really going to be gotten

466
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,120
rid of, but there's a whole bunch of

467
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:18,740
possibilities.

468
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,900
Like I mentioned, you might go to somewhere

469
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,520
that you think is heaven or somewhere you

470
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,540
mean think is hell.

471
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,900
And I've given a lot of talks that

472
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,980
you are actually dead right now and you're

473
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:28,380
in hell.

474
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,020
Right.

475
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,280
But that's I lean on that the most.

476
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,440
You're in hell right now, believe it or

477
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:35,720
not.

478
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:39,320
And the one good antidote or comparison for

479
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,360
that would be there was a Twilight Zone

480
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,040
with a bank robbery shooting pool.

481
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,240
He's got women around him.

482
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,140
Guy comes up to him with notepad.

483
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,180
What do you want to do next?

484
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,100
I'm getting bored here.

485
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,020
I want to go rob a bank.

486
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,000
OK, well, tell us exactly.

487
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,140
Do you want to get away or do

488
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:52,860
you want to get caught?

489
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,060
He's like, no, what do you mean?

490
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,100
I just want to go rob a bank.

491
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,220
Says, well, you have to tell us.

492
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,440
Are you going to get caught or are

493
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,020
you going to get away?

494
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,140
He says, I don't want to know.

495
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,980
It is what we have to know.

496
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,280
Do we have to set it up that

497
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:03,440
way?

498
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,600
And he's like, well, look, if this is

499
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,540
heaven, I don't want to be here.

500
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,980
And he's like, what makes you think you're

501
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,600
in heaven?

502
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:08,840
Yeah.

503
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:09,580
Right.

504
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,580
So you remember that one?

505
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:11,800
Yeah.

506
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,460
Every woman.

507
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,840
That's an old Twilight Zone.

508
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,060
He gets all the money, wins every bet.

509
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:16,360
Yeah.

510
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:16,740
Everything.

511
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,040
And then he gets he's like, I'm bored

512
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:18,380
with this.

513
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,620
I want to go to the other place.

514
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,900
And they're like, you're already there.

515
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:21,900
Yeah.

516
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,060
Yeah.

517
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,000
You already are in hell.

518
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,640
So, yeah, that's why nothing ever gets done.

519
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,820
That's why, you know, it's all about wasting

520
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,200
time.

521
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,340
But this is not the biblical.

522
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,520
This is not the biblical hell or there

523
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,800
is no biblical hell, by the way.

524
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,080
There's variations of bad places to go.

525
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,360
But the Christian hell, I believe that we

526
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,720
are like the ancient Greeks believe you're actually

527
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,200
dead.

528
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,980
And this earth existence is a passing to

529
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:46,900
the next existence.

530
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,320
Right.

531
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:50,200
So I'm very firm believer in that in

532
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,540
terms of from a philosophical point of view,

533
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,220
from the from the codex and the laws

534
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,320
that I live by, it's I'm waiting for

535
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,600
the resurrection of the dead.

536
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,880
That's that would be like if you had

537
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,500
to do what do they call a declaration

538
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,480
of your faith.

539
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,360
Right.

540
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,480
So if I had to do that, it

541
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,400
would be the resurrection.

542
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,660
What you're talking about is at the heart

543
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,180
of various secret societies, to be honest with

544
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:12,520
you.

545
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,760
This is a very interesting through line through

546
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,980
various ethnicities.

547
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:17,940
Which which part?

548
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,660
The whole thing about which part?

549
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,020
The one that we're living in hell or

550
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:21,620
the resurrection?

551
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,420
That you're already dead.

552
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,800
And as a matter of fact, you declare

553
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,180
yourself dead again.

554
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:27,180
And you.

555
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:27,680
Yeah.

556
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,300
And all that.

557
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,160
I mean, that is something that they get

558
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,900
you to accept in order for you to

559
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,260
join.

560
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:33,620
You know.

561
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:34,620
Oh, yeah.

562
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,560
They do the mock the mock death.

563
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:36,780
Yeah.

564
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,220
They have you lay in a coffin or

565
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,660
the gesture of slicing the throat.

566
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:41,180
Yeah.

567
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:41,540
That's all.

568
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,480
It's very macabre.

569
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:42,700
Yeah.

570
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,060
Yeah.

571
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,060
But even if you pay careful attention to

572
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,420
what's said in Sicilian during a making ceremony,

573
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,760
my friend, you're dead already.

574
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,900
That's that's the thing.

575
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,180
Well, they tell you, may I may I

576
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,640
be in the most worst way killed if

577
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,820
I betray my family, betray the family and

578
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,560
betray my oath?

579
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:58,760
Yeah.

580
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,480
Yeah, exactly.

581
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,860
And that's the whole thing about burning a

582
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:01,060
saint.

583
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,320
And that's that's the pagan ritual.

584
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,460
But the additional part of it is you

585
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,020
have the gun, you have the world.

586
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,480
And guess what?

587
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,820
You know, I tell you when to wield

588
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,020
the gun and that's all you need to

589
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,440
know because you're already dead.

590
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,240
And that's the thing.

591
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,820
They say that in Sicilian.

592
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,100
I don't know if all of them do

593
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,020
it because, you know, white people don't know.

594
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,540
There's literally like an octopus of mafias over

595
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,480
there and there's eight organizations.

596
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,620
But anyway.

597
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,140
Sorry.

598
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:25,380
Yeah.

599
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,620
We're getting away from the question.

600
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,160
But I want to bring up also the

601
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,180
as we're getting away, the thought came in

602
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:30,920
when you mentioned the mob.

603
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,320
What was that secret service agency in the

604
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,020
Soviet Union?

605
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,400
The U.U.R.G. or U.G

606
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,580
.R.U. Something like that.

607
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,400
U.R.G. The G.R.U. Yeah.

608
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,800
When you were sworn in, they showed you

609
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,040
film footage or video of people that betrayed

610
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,200
the organization, burned alive, burning alive and burned

611
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:52,560
alive.

612
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,800
They showed you actually it's kind of like

613
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,100
that Bill Hicks comedy where when you get

614
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,680
elected, they take you to the basement and

615
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,800
they show you a shot of the Kennedy

616
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,720
assassination you've never seen before.

617
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:03,740
Right.

618
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,900
So anyway.

619
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:06,560
Yeah.

620
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:08,280
So to go back to it, there's no

621
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,160
elimination that just to go over, you might

622
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,339
go to a place that you think is

623
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,280
heaven, a place that you think is hell.

624
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,980
You you might be sent back here or

625
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,720
you might just be erased, just like a

626
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,660
Dixie cup at the water cooler at the

627
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:24,300
office, completely disposable, whatever you have, that's it.

628
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,700
And it doesn't matter to you at that

629
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,180
point because you're not the one doing it.

630
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:27,400
Right.

631
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,280
And then, of course, which I didn't mention

632
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,060
last time is the resurrection of the dead.

633
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:32,460
Right.

634
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,400
Which is sort of like the Christian, not

635
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,360
even Christian, because Christians don't emphasize the resurrection

636
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,680
at all.

637
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,280
They emphasize going to heaven or hell.

638
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:40,820
Right.

639
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,680
So and then what, you know, after the

640
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,120
resurrection.

641
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:48,760
So anyway, no, there's no there's no getting

642
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,860
rid of people.

643
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,460
It's called I used to call it the

644
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,100
mop up crew.

645
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:52,420
Remember?

646
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:52,940
Right.

647
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,060
Yeah.

648
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,100
It's mopping up.

649
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,600
And I know for sure most people here,

650
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,940
most people here on this planet, especially the

651
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,120
New Agers and the woke or liberals don't

652
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,180
like it, aren't worth crap.

653
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,120
Most most.

654
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:05,700
Yeah.

655
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,480
I would say at a rate of ninety

656
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,180
five to ninety nine percent of the people

657
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,640
that I met are not worth a damn.

658
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,560
Mm hmm.

659
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,440
Right.

660
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,960
So if you need a hundred people, you'd

661
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,500
very for it.

662
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,100
Most likely one will have some kind of

663
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,040
whatever.

664
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:20,820
And guess what?

665
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,640
If you're happy with ninety nine percent of

666
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,080
the people that you're around, you're one of

667
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,600
them.

668
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,620
So it's fine either way.

669
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,480
Right.

670
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,280
So who's what?

671
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:29,860
Who's them?

672
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,520
You know.

673
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,020
Anyway.

674
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,140
Look real quick.

675
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,160
I'll just address something that's actually addressed to

676
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,320
me.

677
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,040
It's about the JFK assassination and something that

678
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,940
Dick Gregory said.

679
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,640
He gave an interview and said that JFK

680
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,000
actually survived the head wound and remained a

681
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,200
vegetable until he died in nineteen seventy two.

682
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,640
Look, the problem with Dick Gregory is this.

683
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,940
He didn't do any of his own research.

684
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:55,840
He used his comedic and his public profile

685
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,280
to try and make awareness for the Kennedy

686
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:58,820
assassination.

687
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,920
But the people that led him at different

688
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,440
times told him different things and he repeated

689
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:04,800
it.

690
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:08,280
So Dick Gregory is a very inconsistent guy

691
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,580
when it comes to this.

692
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,900
So I just by the way, I lost.

693
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:14,300
I lost the last 30 seconds or 10

694
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,700
seconds after I finished speaking.

695
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,380
I heard like a buzz and then everything

696
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,080
disappeared.

697
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:18,620
Wow.

698
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,860
So Dick Gregory comes up from a question

699
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,580
or a comment or you did you interject

700
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,000
that?

701
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:23,240
Yeah.

702
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,140
I already took care of it.

703
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,400
I took care of it anyway.

704
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:25,980
OK.

705
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,120
It was one for me.

706
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:27,940
All right.

707
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:28,580
So how about this?

708
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,480
The Greek was talking about 90 percent of

709
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,560
humanity because it's part of the same question

710
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,540
here will be annihilated.

711
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,040
But shouldn't the benevolent God start with demon

712
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,360
and evil spirits?

713
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,080
That's the way the question is worded.

714
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,520
The benevolent and malevolent is like Republican and

715
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:46,900
Democrat.

716
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,520
It's a political thing.

717
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,480
So it depends on how you look at

718
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,080
it.

719
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,620
See I try.

720
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,820
And how you look at it.

721
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,140
Yes.

722
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,560
You know, this started a private message started

723
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,500
at one point.

724
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,840
And he said, you know, isn't it kind

725
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,520
of cruel to just sort of erase people?

726
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,940
And I said, actually, I think that's an

727
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:02,620
act of mercy.

728
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,420
You know, that was my comment.

729
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,860
And I said, I bet the Greek will

730
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,000
agree with you if you ask him.

731
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,400
And I thought he was going to ask

732
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,680
this question in the regular chat there.

733
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,480
But he did not.

734
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,440
So anyway, I just want to point it

735
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,420
out when you're when you're erased.

736
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,940
It's like when you cut a leg off

737
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,460
octopus.

738
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,420
The octopus is still there when people are

739
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:22,980
erased.

740
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,220
They're also they're erased because initially there's one

741
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:28,980
human spirit.

742
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,700
Let's say let's say we do it from

743
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,000
a grammatical point of view where you have

744
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,360
a category of species.

745
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:35,700
Right.

746
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,700
So there's one category for species called feline.

747
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,060
And then you have all the different feelings,

748
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,600
which are an expression of that species or

749
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,060
that spirit expressing itself different ways, just like

750
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,340
clouds and snowflakes express themselves.

751
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:50,800
Right.

752
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,740
We don't categorize each specific cloud because they're

753
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,860
all different, just like we don't categorize.

754
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,180
I think there's categories for snowflakes, but things

755
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,160
that are very individual.

756
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,540
So they go back.

757
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,200
But when they go back, there's no sense

758
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,700
of loss because that category is still here.

759
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,340
The human category is still here.

760
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,120
I've been speaking to people or communication people

761
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,900
that are much into the draconian reptilian thing,

762
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,260
their world.

763
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,400
And I'm like, I'll I'll be I'll do

764
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:21,560
it.

765
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,680
I'll become a Draco or a reptilian.

766
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,320
I would definitely trade the human avatar for

767
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,780
that to be one of them.

768
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,960
No problem as long.

769
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,960
But if I find out they're just as

770
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,560
dumb as humans or the same, they suffer

771
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,320
the same maladies, I don't want to do

772
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:35,520
it.

773
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,120
So I am looking for a better.

774
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,560
I am not a defender of humanity at

775
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,960
all, at all.

776
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,220
I am looking for a place where there

777
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,580
is more right than wrong and right and

778
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:46,800
wrong.

779
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,520
It's not like checking a box and you

780
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,360
check the wrong one where things that are

781
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,200
known are actually done and implemented.

782
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,040
Right.

783
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,980
But when we talk about the financial stuff,

784
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,400
right, we have the most power.

785
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,200
Everyone is a millionaire and a billionaire, but

786
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,200
no one is acting that way because they

787
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,980
don't know it is the information out there.

788
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:07,280
Yes.

789
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:07,820
Is it hidden?

790
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,280
No.

791
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,140
You've just been misdirected.

792
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,660
So I don't want to be in a

793
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:15,660
in an existence where it's only deception and

794
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,380
misdirection.

795
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,620
That's the norm.

796
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:18,740
Hell no.

797
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:19,580
Right.

798
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,400
So if the Draco don't have that shit,

799
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,460
I'll sign me up.

800
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,620
I'll go there because it has nothing to

801
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:25,760
do.

802
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,340
I'm not attached to the human form.

803
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,800
I'm attached to more altruistic.

804
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:33,880
Let's say not moral, but things that are,

805
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,240
let's say, you know how we talk about

806
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,320
universal principle.

807
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,440
Where is deception and all this stuff that

808
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,740
you see here as the norm?

809
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,920
Part of it can be accounted for using

810
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,760
universal principle.

811
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,480
But to me, it's very much against it.

812
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,840
It's completely out of balance.

813
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,420
So I'm not I'm the wrong person.

814
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,120
I will not defend humanity at all.

815
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,560
Like I've said in the past, if there's

816
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,500
a mop up crew of angels that are

817
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,780
executioners to come here to eliminate most of

818
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,700
humanity, I would say to them, hold on

819
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,840
a second before you start.

820
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,280
Come over.

821
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,500
I'll make you some finger sandwiches and power

822
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:09,900
drinks.

823
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:10,700
Right.

824
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,060
You get it.

825
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:13,720
Yeah.

826
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,500
You know, so so you have more energy.

827
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,520
I am not a defender of humanity.

828
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,220
Yeah.

829
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,240
No, absolutely.

830
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,340
I totally understand.

831
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,860
Anyways, can you please ask the Greek to

832
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:27,240
clarify if eggs have the same energetic effect

833
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,740
on the body when we bake with them?

834
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,100
After the last Sonic, I won't look at

835
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,920
eating eggs as a meal the same.

836
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,240
No.

837
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,280
So they don't change.

838
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,020
No, they don't.

839
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:37,780
It's OK.

840
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,220
They know it changes.

841
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,580
You know, it changes the egg a lot,

842
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,740
but it adds itself.

843
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,860
You know, anyone who works in a hardware

844
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,240
store that does color pigment will understand that,

845
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,220
like someone who knows color.

846
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,420
And you will look at, let's say, the

847
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:53,440
the orange part of the card or the

848
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,160
green, let's say where the greens are.

849
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,140
You'll see like this green has more yellow.

850
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,600
The other one has more blue in it.

851
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:58,840
Right.

852
00:23:59,060 --> 00:23:59,260
Right.

853
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,340
You get it.

854
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:00,700
Right.

855
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,920
So, you know, like you'll have a different

856
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,640
purples, which is blue and red.

857
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:05,560
Right.

858
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,020
If you put a little bit of red

859
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,980
in the blue, you're not going to get

860
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:08,320
purple.

861
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,500
And if you put a little bit of

862
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,900
blue into the red, you're not going to

863
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,360
get purple.

864
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:16,700
So it depends when you're combining baking when

865
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,600
I say because baking, there's quiche also.

866
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:18,900
Right.

867
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:19,420
Right.

868
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,120
Remember, you know, it's like a pie and

869
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:22,880
you use to thicken.

870
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:23,200
Right.

871
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,020
Like a custard.

872
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,740
Custard is made with that.

873
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,920
You can make it without animal product at

874
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,260
all.

875
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,300
Actually do enjoy it more sometimes.

876
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,500
I never tried that.

877
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,220
It changes it.

878
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,160
Just just like it changes it in a

879
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:37,620
way.

880
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,780
Very similar.

881
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,380
Like no one's ever been at a hamburger

882
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:44,060
shop and was asked, you want cucumber with

883
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,200
your your burger or they include cucumber.

884
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,100
They never say that.

885
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:47,760
What do they say?

886
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:48,760
Pickle.

887
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:49,720
Right.

888
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,440
But what's a pickle made of?

889
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,280
You know, the American pickle, it's cucumber.

890
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,620
But you ever notice?

891
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,300
Yeah, they never say cucumber.

892
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,460
They say pickle.

893
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,100
And you're supposed to know.

894
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,560
But how about cucumber?

895
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,880
No, I don't want cucumber on the road.

896
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,480
Give me the pickle.

897
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,480
Boy, if someone was visiting this planet and

898
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,540
they got a job at McDonald's or wherever

899
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,520
they make burgers, forget about McDonald's, please.

900
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:14,560
And, you know, they would be asking the

901
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,700
humans if they wanted a cucumber, right, because

902
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,560
that's what it is.

903
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,660
But look how different it is.

904
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:20,340
Right.

905
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,580
Banana chips, by the way, dehydrated plantain chips

906
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,200
in New York.

907
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,640
They're very popular at the bodegas.

908
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,940
I don't remember the hang.

909
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,360
You get a beer and some plantain chips,

910
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:29,600
right?

911
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,680
That is not the same as eating a

912
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,420
fresh banana.

913
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,660
It's completely different, completely different energy.

914
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,880
So when you say don't eat tropical foods

915
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,460
at a certain times of the year, banana

916
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,420
chips would be OK.

917
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,160
I wouldn't overdo it, but it will not

918
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,140
have the same effect as having a banana.

919
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:45,840
Right.

920
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:46,440
Right.

921
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,340
And vice versa.

922
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,800
Eating plantain chips to cool down and because

923
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,180
it's hot is not going to work like

924
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:55,840
a fresh banana.

925
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:56,180
Right.

926
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:02,580
So, yeah, you got to understand the let's

927
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:05,540
say in the terms of alchemy, the alchemists

928
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:08,720
thing is to transmute using what?

929
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,360
Water, fire and light.

930
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,200
Right.

931
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:14,740
Right.

932
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,560
That's what they use.

933
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,720
That that was where me and then they

934
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,220
have elixirs and philosopher's stone and those special

935
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,200
adjuncts and things.

936
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,120
But the the the alchemist's kit, basic alchemic

937
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,760
starter kit is fire, water and light.

938
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:28,980
Right.

939
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:29,820
So what is cooking?

940
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,160
Fire and water, isn't it?

941
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,420
So you're really it's really in front of

942
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:35,640
you.

943
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,220
And, you know, one of the things I

944
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:42,680
do by, for example, demonstrate cooking when you

945
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,740
have a proper setup is I have I

946
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,520
put butter, olive oil and a bunch of

947
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,600
oil in a pan and in a wide

948
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,640
pan, turn up the heat and it starts

949
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,000
to get the oil gets really hot.

950
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,160
And you see the oil in the pan.

951
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:53,460
Right.

952
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,840
So watch this, guys.

953
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,400
I take a fresh lemon.

954
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,920
I hold my hand about a foot above

955
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,160
and I drop the lemon juice in.

956
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:02,880
And you see this flash and a fog

957
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,140
you can't see through the mist.

958
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:04,460
Right.

959
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,480
Then I said, quick, look at the pan.

960
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,040
The pan is clean.

961
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,560
Like you just washed it and dried it

962
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,300
ready to put it away.

963
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,260
What happened to that oil?

964
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,560
Just a few drops of lemon juice in

965
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:13,800
there.

966
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:14,780
What happened?

967
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:15,920
Right.

968
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,820
You try that experiment.

969
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,220
I got some oil in a pan, you

970
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,260
know, like you're going to fry something and

971
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,820
throw some lemon juice in there and wash

972
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,640
all the oil disappear.

973
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,820
I mean, it's squeaky clean.

974
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,620
How did that happen?

975
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,360
I'm right.

976
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,320
So just, yeah, picturing it.

977
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,220
But OK, yeah, I got to try that.

978
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,160
Yeah.

979
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:32,460
Yeah.

980
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,600
It's pretty amazing how clean the pan is.

981
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,500
You're like, wow, you wouldn't get it that

982
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,300
clean unless you use like scoured it with

983
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,440
soap and a brillo pad.

984
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,060
So, yeah.

985
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,920
So this is what's going on constantly when

986
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,560
you're cooking, but you're not aware of it.

987
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:45,760
Why?

988
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,740
Because you're used to it.

989
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:47,720
Right.

990
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,580
So when you start looking at what's really

991
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,260
going on.

992
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:51,480
Right.

993
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,600
So anyway, go ahead.

994
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,780
OK, so, you know what?

995
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,120
We'll try and close out with this one.

996
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,540
I've got more, but, you know, I'll organize

997
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:58,920
them more.

998
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,900
And we'll go at it again sometime in

999
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,940
the very near future.

1000
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,760
Anyways, if we could talk more about how

1001
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,200
to quiet the mind and repel intruding thoughts,

1002
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,760
if there are any specific techniques we can

1003
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,620
use, I listen to an older sonic where

1004
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,520
he says when concepts and words are shut

1005
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,040
off, experience only shapes colors and energy patterns.

1006
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,400
This happens to me during mushroom trip.

1007
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,180
So so well, this person only sees that

1008
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,240
really during mushroom trips.

1009
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,960
But but yeah, but it only seems to

1010
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,720
make energy and color patterns.

1011
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:33,980
Right.

1012
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:35,660
Yeah.

1013
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,180
Well, the mushroom trips, LSD, DMD, all that,

1014
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:42,360
I consider the mental lubrication the epitome of,

1015
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,280
let's say, a sage or a good way

1016
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,020
to whatever guru or whatever is to do

1017
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,660
that without the lubrication.

1018
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,120
Right.

1019
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,140
You know, without that extra.

1020
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,020
In other words, you're doing it anyway.

1021
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,780
There's just too much friction for you to

1022
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,800
to to say that it's the it's operating

1023
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,380
properly.

1024
00:28:59,380 --> 00:28:59,820
Right.

1025
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,000
So you add the mushroom, you add the

1026
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,460
whatever.

1027
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:02,840
Right.

1028
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,740
Let's call them what hallucinogenic.

1029
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,060
They're like lubrication.

1030
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,560
And so the resistance, the friction of being

1031
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,960
able to get into that realm is eliminated,

1032
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,360
they're not really doing anything.

1033
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:16,100
You know, the LSD, the mushrooms, the psilocybin,

1034
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,100
all that stuff doesn't is not what's causing

1035
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,400
you to the different mind, the hallucinogenic or

1036
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,720
the different state of mind.

1037
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:23,960
Right.

1038
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:26,640
It's a component that the body requires when

1039
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,060
you can't do that without it.

1040
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:28,440
Right.

1041
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,100
So either way, it's fine.

1042
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:34,140
But this it's a very easy scenario.

1043
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,760
You can't stop it because it's like a

1044
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,080
river.

1045
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,120
If you if you eliminate it internally, you'll

1046
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,240
still notice it passing by and you'll reject

1047
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:43,740
the thought.

1048
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,520
It's kind of like stopping a river.

1049
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,420
You can't there's an old saying you can't

1050
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,740
stop a river, but you can pull yourself

1051
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,840
away from that river.

1052
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,280
And the way you do that is when

1053
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,240
the body is still, the mind starts going

1054
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:55,760
fast.

1055
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,440
That's why a lot of people, when they

1056
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,320
lay down, their mind starts racing what happened

1057
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,500
all day or what they're going to do

1058
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:00,880
tomorrow.

1059
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:01,540
Right.

1060
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,740
Now, when you're physical, when you're when you're

1061
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:08,320
doing physical work like jogging or construction or

1062
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,680
whatever, your mind, it you can't mind really

1063
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,320
quiets down.

1064
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,800
So when the body is active, the mind

1065
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,440
goes quiet.

1066
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:16,540
Right.

1067
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,740
You'll see this in movies all the time.

1068
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,700
There was a film I was actually describing

1069
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,280
this to someone and watching a black and

1070
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,200
white film back in the 30s when doctors

1071
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,440
were just regular people.

1072
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,000
Right.

1073
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,480
And this couple brings their young child to

1074
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,040
the doctor's house to have it checked out,

1075
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,500
and he's not home.

1076
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,300
But then they hear hammering on the roof

1077
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,980
and the doctor's up there fixing his roof.

1078
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:40,300
Right.

1079
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:40,700
OK.

1080
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,380
Because you could.

1081
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:45,340
And they're explaining from the ground what's going

1082
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:45,600
on.

1083
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,060
He says, I can't think about what you're

1084
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:47,640
saying right now.

1085
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,700
And I'll be right down because I'm working

1086
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,120
right now.

1087
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,240
You see exactly that.

1088
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:51,520
Right.

1089
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:55,100
So someone running a marathon or doing physical

1090
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,680
activity or a UPS driver, that's hustling to

1091
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,100
get everything delivered out of the truck and

1092
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,680
not think about other things.

1093
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,200
The mind actually they can, but it's very

1094
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:04,580
minimal.

1095
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,080
You can try it.

1096
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,740
Start doing physical activity.

1097
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,540
And you still will have thoughts if you

1098
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:13,180
know that mental internal whatever come up that

1099
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,280
you hear that's not really your voice anyway.

1100
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,300
But they're easy to reject.

1101
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,860
It's easy to push out and have a

1102
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,880
very clear mind while you're doing physical exercise.

1103
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,780
That's why in ancient Greek philosophy, a lot

1104
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,480
of thing was met their artist on means

1105
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,560
like do everything in moderation and be our

1106
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,660
style, you know, which is very high up

1107
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:29,980
on it.

1108
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:34,500
So the physical part, the physical gymnasium of

1109
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,820
the body, the gymnasium or the working out

1110
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:39,780
of the body quite helps the mind.

1111
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:43,120
And then the other way around also working,

1112
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,560
working things out when the body is quiet

1113
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,860
in the mind, then the stress levels and

1114
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,320
you know how to direct the body.

1115
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,540
The body needs direction from the mind.

1116
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:51,840
Right.

1117
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,460
So you need to do both.

1118
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:58,400
It's OK to let a lot of thoughts.

1119
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,300
If you can't clear the thoughts out of

1120
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:01,660
your head.

1121
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,100
The advice I give people is now that

1122
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:07,000
we can surmise mostly they're not your when

1123
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,520
it's when the thought sounds like it's in

1124
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,620
your voice in your head, it's not you.

1125
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,580
All you do is start thinking or tell

1126
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,540
yourself when the thoughts are there.

1127
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,860
What did you say or what do you

1128
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:18,780
have to say next?

1129
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:21,780
And then they stop soon as you acknowledge

1130
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:24,040
it from a third party perspective.

1131
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,160
You can even say it out loud.

1132
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,420
The voices stop because they don't want to

1133
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,600
be acknowledged that way.

1134
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:30,980
Right.

1135
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:31,620
They're external.

1136
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,240
There is some you know, you're being messed

1137
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:33,460
with.

1138
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,860
Walter Russell used to have a thing.

1139
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,960
He dealt with it by just getting up

1140
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,280
from his desk or whatever he was doing

1141
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,080
and walking up to the door, holding onto

1142
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,780
the knob and open door and saying, get

1143
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,080
out and then slam the door.

1144
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,160
Right.

1145
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:47,820
Right.

1146
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:50,080
I mean, that sounds pretty nutty, but that

1147
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:50,900
worked for him.

1148
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,160
But he never got into the stuff we're

1149
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:53,940
talking about.

1150
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:54,920
And either did.

1151
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,080
I don't know if Steiner did.

1152
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,140
But I can't stand Steiner.

1153
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,780
Like if I met him, I'd probably punch

1154
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,400
him in the face.

1155
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,620
And he'd say, what did you do that

1156
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:02,840
for?

1157
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,160
I said, I don't know, because you just

1158
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,680
look like you deserve that, you know, for

1159
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,500
no reason at all.

1160
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,280
I'm not that I'm not a violent person.

1161
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,840
I'm just saying he's too airy fairy or

1162
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,020
whatever.

1163
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,500
But if you read Steiner or whatever and

1164
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,800
have someone else read it and give you

1165
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,820
all the salient bullet points, that's what you

1166
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:17,060
want.

1167
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,200
You don't want to go through his.

1168
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,420
I don't.

1169
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:19,860
I can't.

1170
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,200
I just because you know what?

1171
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,460
He didn't know a lot anyway.

1172
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,060
He didn't know a lot.

1173
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,600
He got he got he put himself on

1174
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,900
a track that worked for him and to

1175
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,240
get followers and all that.

1176
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,660
And it's fine.

1177
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,660
You know, this is where Ken Wheeler says

1178
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,360
like Tesla never defined a field.

1179
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,260
Right.

1180
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,220
And he's true.

1181
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:40,920
He never did.

1182
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,220
He didn't know what if he couldn't define

1183
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:42,540
a field.

1184
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:46,520
So there's there's there's something for everyone and

1185
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,700
everyone, like I said, I've been interviewing people

1186
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,160
now for a couple of months on and

1187
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,980
off about working on building scale orators and

1188
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,280
stuff.

1189
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,620
And the first thing I ask them, what's

1190
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,160
your superpower?

1191
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,300
Could you imagine someone from the corporate world

1192
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,420
on an interview?

1193
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,580
You know how they get prepared.

1194
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,620
And the first question they get is, what's

1195
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,300
your superpower?

1196
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,140
Boy, did you know how far I threw

1197
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:05,640
them off?

1198
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:06,480
Right.

1199
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,280
You ever see a woman that, you know,

1200
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,139
she's got her best outfit on or whatever.

1201
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,900
She gets out of the cab to go

1202
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,920
into the venue and her heel breaks off.

1203
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,179
You ever see their face when that happens?

1204
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,239
They're like, oh, shit.

1205
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:18,880
Right.

1206
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,840
Or can you imagine with that?

1207
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,000
This is what this is what I do

1208
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,920
to people on that, because I don't want

1209
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,560
the pre-made stuff.

1210
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,440
I want to know what you really and

1211
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,300
if everyone's.

1212
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:30,239
So when I ask people, what's your superpower?

1213
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,159
Aren't I by presumption, at least presuming that

1214
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,340
everyone has a superpower?

1215
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:36,800
Yes, I am.

1216
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:37,980
You're right.
