1
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,320
Rated Y, Sonic Advent 2, 3, 8, and

2
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,860
how is it today, Greek?

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:13,380
How are you?

4
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:15,860
It's going all right.

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,860
We're trying another mobile device.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,120
It's coming through all right.

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,360
I think this one is an iPhone 13

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,720
mini or something like that.

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,420
So it's moving ahead, or I think it's

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,060
more than that.

11
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,440
It's higher because I had a 13 mini

12
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,540
before, so this is the one next to

13
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:38,120
it, but above that are younger and, yeah,

14
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,240
sound issues.

15
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,680
Remember, I just use these.

16
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,420
I mean, today I was out for four

17
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,600
hours hunting down materials, and guess what?

18
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,900
I got home and the phone was hanging

19
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,440
on the wall just like it was back

20
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,500
in the old days, right?

21
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,520
Why would I say that?

22
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,780
Because that's not how it is for most

23
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,600
people, and also I would say that because

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,220
when I had a full little flip phone,

25
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,680
it was in my pocket all the time,

26
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:04,220
right?

27
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,160
So anyway, ironic how things go.

28
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,620
Matter of fact, there were some people that

29
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,680
were worried about head cancer from making so

30
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,900
many calls, cancer of the head and this

31
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:15,180
and that.

32
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,260
That was the big deal because of the

33
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,640
batteries, and the funny thing to me was

34
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,980
I said, what about your legs?

35
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,860
And the thing that it's much closer to

36
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,200
if you're a man, that's what I was

37
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,000
wondering about because if it's radiating your head,

38
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,920
what's it doing when it's three inches from

39
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,960
the center point?

40
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:31,760
Yeah, lower.

41
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,620
Well, it's the transmitter, not the battery.

42
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,500
Yeah, it's the transmitter, not the battery, just

43
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,940
like the history channel radar operators in World

44
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,880
War II noticed chocolate bars in their pockets

45
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,740
were melting, right?

46
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:49,200
It was because the waveguide was there, and

47
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,420
the portable radars, and the ones on ships

48
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:53,820
and stuff.

49
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,740
So either way, it doesn't matter.

50
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,140
So I run into people that lived into

51
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:06,540
their 90s without anything other than a scrap

52
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,039
like a scraper, a bruiser, fat lip, black

53
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,080
eye, no illness at all, and the world's

54
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,400
not any better off.

55
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,680
The whole thing is kind of odd, but

56
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,600
it's not once you figure it out, and

57
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,040
when you figure it out, or more of

58
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,680
it, it gets even more odd, right?

59
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,940
What I mean is the public perception of

60
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,400
things, like I don't really know, like I

61
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,840
was talking to some people about taxes today,

62
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,980
they didn't know anything at all.

63
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:33,600
They didn't even bother.

64
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,120
I said, you know, these manuals are huge,

65
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:35,420
right?

66
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,620
Thousands of pages or thousands of laws, do

67
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,180
you think it's all futility?

68
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,420
It's for them or for you?

69
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,280
Don't you want to even get the cliff

70
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,040
notes on it or anything like that?

71
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,200
It's like no one is interested in anything.

72
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:49,540
I'll tell you why.

73
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,180
Because when you're cattle on a ranch, and

74
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,020
all you see is cattle, you think that

75
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,880
there's a head cow running the ranch, right?

76
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:00,580
Oh yeah.

77
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,560
Actually, there isn't.

78
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,520
Cows are not running the ranch at all.

79
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,140
The same with humans.

80
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,620
The humans are not being run by humans

81
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,280
at all.

82
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,200
And it's amazing how the parallels go with

83
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:13,420
cattle.

84
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,100
In Greek, they call it mouskaria, mouskaria, it

85
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,620
means like cattle.

86
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,480
So it's interesting, you know, that's why when

87
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,160
you deal with them, like with the Scalarator

88
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,840
and other things that I'm doing, putting out

89
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,880
to deal with the public or, you know,

90
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,000
procurement, let's say, or getting it out to

91
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,460
the public.

92
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,040
You always want to, if you can, most

93
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,900
people can't because they've never been around it,

94
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,720
start off in the luxury end, and I've

95
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,420
talked about this, because you can charge the

96
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:42,820
most.

97
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,980
The people who are willing to pay high

98
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,720
prices for stuff are the least pain in

99
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,420
the ass, right?

100
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,540
Believe it or not.

101
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,000
Like most of the time, you won't even

102
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,680
run into them.

103
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,580
It'll be someone that they have go buy

104
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,820
it for them and, you know, handle that

105
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,840
part of the aspect of their life, chore

106
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,220
boys or chore girls.

107
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,180
And yeah, most of the people that I've

108
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,380
discussed this with behind the scenes, oh, no,

109
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,720
you can't get into luxury, you can't, and

110
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,500
I sat back and I was like, why

111
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,380
would they say that?

112
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,240
Oh, oh, they think they're well off, but

113
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,060
they've never been around, you know, the higher

114
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,300
bred people.

115
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,700
They've never been around it.

116
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,320
I have, so I know how to do

117
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:24,700
it, right?

118
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:25,780
Well, yeah.

119
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,820
And I've also given the, yeah, you don't

120
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,000
want to, yeah, the cattle, yeah, you want

121
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,980
to deal with the higher cattle if you

122
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,520
can, because there's still cattle.

123
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:35,180
Absolutely.

124
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,360
And obviously the quality of the stupid rectangle

125
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,320
you're on right now, you know, allows for

126
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,220
serious dynamics in your voice because, boy, I

127
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,820
could hear a lot of qualities today that

128
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,760
I didn't necessarily hear last time we talked.

129
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:46,620
Anyways.

130
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:47,820
Yeah.

131
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,040
From the, from the, from the other, yeah,

132
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,640
the audio, the chip is better, but here's

133
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,980
the other thing I wanted to say also,

134
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,760
or just to, just to add to that,

135
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,660
what was it?

136
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,220
Well, I could keep adding to it.

137
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,840
But when you're going with the luxury, like

138
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,080
Ford or GM can make a luxury car

139
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,240
better than Rolls Royce.

140
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,300
Well, how do you think they're going to

141
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,900
do against Rolls Royce?

142
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,640
Not very well.

143
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,840
No one's, I mean, someone will buy it.

144
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,540
Now what if Rolls Royce made an economic

145
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:18,880
sedan?

146
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,060
How many people want to buy that?

147
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:22,700
Yeah.

148
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,560
A lot of people.

149
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,300
So you got to start off, you can

150
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,460
go from the luxury down.

151
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,340
As a matter of fact, most of the

152
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,520
counterfeit stuff, I mean, there was House of

153
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,400
Gucci movie with Lady Gaga and whatever.

154
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,260
I streamed that.

155
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:34,960
I watched it.

156
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,680
It was actually a good film to show

157
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,260
you the idiosyncrasies of these people, like the

158
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,620
wife and the Gucci wife.

159
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,940
She went up Northern Harlem back in the

160
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,880
eighties to buy the Gucci knockoffs made in

161
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,180
China and she brought some back.

162
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,200
This is in the film.

163
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,860
She was impressed at the quality and they

164
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,260
were like, what are you talking about?

165
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,960
Look at the quality.

166
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:57,960
Look how good it is.

167
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,140
Right.

168
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,600
So anyway, you've heard that before.

169
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,460
The Gucci bags were vinyl for a while,

170
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:02,720
right?

171
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,700
$1,200, $1,500 bags made of vinyl,

172
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,000
right?

173
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:06,500
Oh, sure.

174
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:06,820
Sure.

175
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,180
I mean, they're not the knockoffs.

176
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:09,700
Yeah.

177
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:09,900
Yeah.

178
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,520
Not the knockoffs.

179
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,140
The originals.

180
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:11,400
Right.

181
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:11,640
Yeah.

182
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,060
There's also a similar story about how coach

183
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,880
purses became a thing, which is a very

184
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,980
similar story, right?

185
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,800
Where somebody saw that and they just, it's

186
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,700
a better introduced that brand.

187
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:21,920
Yeah.

188
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,400
The coach.

189
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,140
Yeah.

190
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,160
But by the way, you've, you've brought this

191
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,140
up again, coach is a better value than

192
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:27,960
the other ones, right?

193
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,820
In other words, the price per value, in

194
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,580
other words, paying 10 times more for a

195
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,680
bag is not going to be a 10

196
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,620
times better bag.

197
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,600
It's actually an excellent value.

198
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,120
Right.

199
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:37,640
Right.

200
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,820
So, but for most people, coach would be

201
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,040
a, a, whatever.

202
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,340
So yeah, I'm just, I bring this up.

203
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,300
I'm still looking for people to work with.

204
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,880
It's if I had a hundred people here

205
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,460
is if a hundred people approached me with

206
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,580
Greek, I want to work with you on

207
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,920
procuring and having acquisitions and on the scale

208
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,460
orator and other things that that's fine.

209
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,080
We can, we can work with everyone.

210
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,060
Everyone was plenty for everyone.

211
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,640
I don't know if a thousand people came

212
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,100
and said, I want to work with you,

213
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,160
but definitely 20, 30, 50, a hundred.

214
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,600
We got plenty of room for that many

215
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,100
people to get involved to expand it because

216
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,740
I don't want to talk about the scale

217
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,680
orator too much, but there's nothing like it.

218
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,800
There is.

219
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,040
Yeah.

220
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,120
That's why I've encouraged people to make them

221
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,620
short.

222
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,660
There is a specific question about a scale

223
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,380
orator in the, in the questions here.

224
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,080
I got a lot to get to actually.

225
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,380
So here's the thing.

226
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:33,760
Okay.

227
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,340
Let's do it though.

228
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:34,900
Let's go.

229
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:35,480
Let's get rolling.

230
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,180
Yeah, definitely.

231
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,120
God's trade in blood is a simple comment

232
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,100
regarding about, you know, how things are traded

233
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,280
off, but you know, pulling from the random

234
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,080
stack, if you will, comments are good too.

235
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,980
This was a good one.

236
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,480
This is referring to one of the Sonics.

237
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,820
I like the Greeks mentioning of the afterlife

238
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,560
and it's tie into the previous mention of

239
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,300
having a child.

240
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,340
Now I started this comment before, but didn't

241
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:58,800
finish it.

242
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,180
In terms of people being wiped out, I

243
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,340
constantly think of that about myself, if I'm

244
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,080
so quote awakened and quote, to understand everything

245
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,260
the Greek is saying, but am I really

246
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,340
doing anything worth saving?

247
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,780
And we started talking about this, you know,

248
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,480
how things survive and what legacy is before,

249
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,880
but, but I hadn't finished it because there

250
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,860
was another response.

251
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,340
Okay.

252
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,800
The Greek and Hillman talk about Bible from

253
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,180
completely different perspectives.

254
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,880
They are the only two people alive right

255
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,600
now who have anything interesting to say about

256
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:33,780
it.

257
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,460
How could there be a winner?

258
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,200
Their perspectives hardly overlap, if at all, that

259
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,260
would have been obvious if Bocelli read the

260
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,420
rest of my question.

261
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,680
I'm honestly just looking to learn.

262
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:46,980
All right.

263
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,840
Let's just hold on right there.

264
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,420
I don't disagree in any way with Hillman

265
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,440
if he sticks to what the text is,

266
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,800
because remember, let's, let's forget about the Bible.

267
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,340
Let's say we, people were talking about, um,

268
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,780
will be Dick, right?

269
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,200
We can't start inventing stuff.

270
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,040
We have to lift off all the data

271
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,140
and every, and whatever can be known from

272
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,140
what is written and authored, right?

273
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:12,620
Or preserved.

274
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,360
Let's say, you know, like, um, there were

275
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,780
several books when they were put out in

276
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,880
the 1800s that are still popular now had

277
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,880
different introductions.

278
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,520
Like the wizard of Oz had like a

279
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,940
30 page or 20 page introduction, right?

280
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,100
And they remove a lot of those.

281
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,380
So does the, the original King James versions.

282
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,540
They had very long introductions.

283
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,520
If you read those introductions, you'll see really

284
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,100
what, what the version is about.

285
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,060
So as long as Hillman sticks to the

286
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,580
text, we're fine and not confabulate, not, you

287
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,260
know, well, this could mean this and because

288
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,520
it could mean this, then it means this,

289
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:45,860
right?

290
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:46,660
You see?

291
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,860
So I've watched a little bit of his

292
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,260
stuff.

293
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,440
The, the, the, let's put it in a,

294
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,540
those are some really, if you read the

295
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,100
Bible, those are some really tough Jews, man.

296
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:58,780
Right?

297
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,540
So, um, you know what I mean?

298
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,860
I mean, it was pretty rough.

299
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,900
Uh, there were tough people, uh, and all

300
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,420
around and calling them Jews for the joke

301
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:08,640
part.

302
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,020
But the concept of calling someone a Jew

303
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,020
is very recent, less than 500 years.

304
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,520
So it just reminds me of a lot

305
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,380
of Jack Ruby quotes.

306
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,880
Cause you know, I read those often and

307
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,500
the stuff I do.

308
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,000
So it's just one of those things.

309
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:19,720
So continue.

310
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,480
Jack Ruby said, is it a Jack Ruby?

311
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,160
Is it a Jack Ruby quote?

312
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:24,440
Yeah.

313
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,580
Those are some really tough Jews.

314
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:25,860
Yeah.

315
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:26,600
Tough Jews.

316
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,880
Jews are just as tough.

317
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,240
You got to know how tough we are.

318
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,220
He was constantly on that according to people

319
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:31,760
around him.

320
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,260
So it's just, yeah, but you don't, the

321
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,080
problem comes when you try to prove it,

322
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:36,280
right?

323
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,840
That's what toy mafia does.

324
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,260
Right.

325
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,580
Like new mafia, toy mafia.

326
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,400
They, they're, they're actually brutal and they're more

327
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:46,140
dangerous and, um, uh, more established mafia because

328
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,740
they're trying to always prove themselves anyway.

329
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,700
So how do I know that?

330
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,920
Anyway, uh, those are, those are extremely private

331
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,880
stories that go on, but exactly, which is

332
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,780
why Jack died with parts of his fingers

333
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,180
missing, but please continue.

334
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,560
You know?

335
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,200
Yeah.

336
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,500
I mean, like give you an example of

337
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,060
toy mafia.

338
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,060
I remember I met, I said, Tommy, what

339
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:05,340
happened?

340
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,300
He had an arm, half body cast.

341
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,440
You ever see where like every part bone

342
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,000
in the arm is broken and the cast

343
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,160
has to go to the shoulder and you

344
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,620
have a strut going across.

345
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:13,900
Right.

346
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:14,740
Oh, absolutely.

347
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,240
And I'm like, what?

348
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,000
Yeah.

349
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:17,920
I said, what happened, man?

350
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,840
He said, I got into a fight with

351
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,240
my brother.

352
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,680
I said, God damn, you guys fight pretty

353
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,140
rough.

354
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:26,180
So anyway, um, yeah, what I want to

355
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:29,860
say is, uh, we got to stick to,

356
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,580
if we're talking about something that is limited

357
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:37,000
and confined, um, not constrained, but confined to

358
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,980
a certain body of work.

359
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,120
As long as we stick to the body

360
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,900
of work, Hey, I'm willing to listen.

361
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,680
And if I don't know about it and

362
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,300
it's there, Hey, I'm all for it, you

363
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:45,540
know?

364
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,960
So, um, yeah, uh, give you an example.

365
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,080
The meta when David and Goliath metaphor, if

366
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,480
you translate the meaning of the way the

367
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,820
words are being used in their interchange, um,

368
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:06,100
first thing Goliath said to, uh, David was,

369
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,580
why are you sending this dog?

370
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,580
Now a dog back in those days was

371
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:13,060
slang for a male prostitute, right?

372
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,160
And then, um, when David retorts, I'm going

373
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,560
to cut off your flesh and give it

374
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,760
to the birds while cutting off your flesh

375
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,960
meant cutting off his penis.

376
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,120
So that, so the real inter interchange, more

377
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,440
realistic interchange, I should say between David and

378
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,600
Goliath is Goliath's David for the first time,

379
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,900
it says you sending this male prostitute and

380
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,460
David says, I'm going to cut your off

381
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,640
and feed it to the birds.

382
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,060
Wow.

383
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:38,380
Wow.

384
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:41,080
That's a lot more whatever than what you

385
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,000
get Sunday school.

386
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,400
Right?

387
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,460
So more, more, that's the way those words

388
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,020
are being used.

389
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:46,200
Yeah.

390
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,040
More vivid and precise when you say it

391
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:48,520
that way.

392
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,200
The other way it sounds kind of ambiguous.

393
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,380
Like, yeah, it's whitewashed.

394
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,640
So when Hillman says they were doped up

395
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,980
and whatever, sure, man, fuck.

396
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,460
If I could find something to dope me

397
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,940
up that I could still function shit.

398
00:12:59,060 --> 00:12:59,420
Why not?

399
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,260
I need dope just to sober up.

400
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,780
Like in other words, when I, uh, I

401
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,640
don't do any of that, but I do

402
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,880
Kratom coffee and cigarettes, but when I run

403
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,100
into people on any level and talk to

404
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,780
them about what they're doing, what they believe,

405
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,300
I'm like, you gotta be fucking high to

406
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,720
think that maybe I gotta get high to

407
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,900
make sure like I'm on their level or

408
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,340
something, you know, go talk to an attorney.

409
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:21,840
I like, yeah.

410
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,540
Are you high?

411
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,140
What are you talking about?

412
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:24,380
Right.

413
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,000
Or just to realistically do stuff.

414
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,700
When you investigate many armies, you'll find, uh,

415
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,360
like I, I used to say, every war

416
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,680
is a drug war because the armies that

417
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,720
are savage and really crazy and just taking

418
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,400
lots of risks, it turns out a lot

419
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,560
of them were high on something, you know?

420
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,220
Uh, and, and I mean, throughout history, it's

421
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,680
not a matter of ethnicity or particular one

422
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,480
army over another.

423
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,380
It's just, if you check deep enough, they're

424
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,280
high on something, you know, that was for

425
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,160
the physicality of it, you know, to be

426
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,020
able to, you know, whatever, but, uh, I'm

427
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,100
talking about the mental part.

428
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:55,620
Oh yeah.

429
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,440
But, uh, in other words, when I, when

430
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,380
I hear people speaking and what they're thinking,

431
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,880
by the way, when they, when they say

432
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,280
they think they're actually telling you what they

433
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,740
feel and when they say it, I feel

434
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,880
it's what they're thinking.

435
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,780
They're so confused.

436
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:06,380
Well, right.

437
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,300
Let's continue.

438
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:07,640
Yeah.

439
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,360
But both are true because look, even psychologically,

440
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,000
you know, just like, uh, you, you get

441
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,320
your liquid courage, right?

442
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,660
Because if you weren't already intoxicated, you wouldn't

443
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,400
even, uh, venture to do certain things, you

444
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,640
know, inhibitions drop and you go, okay.

445
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,980
And a lot of chemicals can do that.

446
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,720
Not just booze.

447
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,500
So anyway.

448
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,060
Yeah.

449
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,320
No, I've had, by the way, I've had

450
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,360
several people in business circles call me at

451
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,740
night and I could tell they were drinking

452
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,900
and even you can hear the bar in

453
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,360
the background.

454
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,500
Then I'm like, all right, so you're at

455
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,740
a bar, you had a few drinks, so

456
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,500
you needed that to, to, uh, get up

457
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,440
enough courage to say something that you wanted

458
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,040
to say before.

459
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:40,740
So go ahead.

460
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,260
Right.

461
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,420
And then there's like 10 seconds of silence,

462
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:43,760
right?

463
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,040
Okay.

464
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,880
Then, you know, like they didn't say what

465
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,220
I just presumed was wrong.

466
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:49,300
Yep.

467
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:49,680
Anyways.

468
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,040
No.

469
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,500
And there's a lot of, and there's a

470
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,260
lot of times where it's just fascinating because,

471
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,600
you know, once you tell them the thing

472
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,780
that they thought they, you were getting surprised

473
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,260
with, you know, they got to re, you

474
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,700
know, kind of regroup and go, oops, I

475
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,820
thought I was clever here.

476
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,520
Well, that was a, that was a, well,

477
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,900
that was a buzzkill when I told him

478
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,160
that.

479
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:04,500
Right.

480
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,900
So now we're back to anyway.

481
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,140
Cause they practice, you know, people in that

482
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,800
position often, uh, behave as though they invented

483
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,660
that, you know, like as if that's not

484
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,260
right.

485
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,980
I mean, that's, that's the kind of amusing

486
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,280
part anyways, um, Greek in, in regards to

487
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,620
relationships and picking someone to waste time with,

488
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,980
uh, you mentioned before finding someone trainable, would

489
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,200
you ever use nine star key or astrology,

490
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,640
uh, slash anything occult to determine compatibility?

491
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:33,640
Yeah.

492
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,100
Yeah.

493
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,620
And if you see, for example, the, the

494
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,340
issue would come up when you see, let's

495
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,360
say you're incompatible.

496
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,940
Now, you know what to look out for.

497
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,260
So you nip it at the bud.

498
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,300
So when you, let's say you're with someone

499
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,860
who is antagonistic to you, a nine star

500
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,280
key.

501
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,460
Well, nine, it doesn't mean they will be,

502
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,580
but nine star key says they shows they

503
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:52,800
will.

504
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,600
So then you look out for the qualities

505
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,240
of how, uh, what properties that type of

506
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,620
person has and you nip it at the

507
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,120
bud real early and you steer it away.

508
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,280
It's like, for example, uh, let's go back

509
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,020
to look at, look at, just look at

510
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,460
that as an element, uh, that, that needs

511
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,580
to be spread or contained.

512
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,120
For example, fire.

513
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:10,840
Oh my gosh.

514
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,540
Fire is heat.

515
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,060
A hot and destructive.

516
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:13,580
Right?

517
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:13,840
Yeah.

518
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,100
But look, if you don't have some kind

519
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,800
of fire or heat in a living space,

520
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,940
it's considered inadequate.

521
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:19,500
Isn't it?

522
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:19,840
Right.

523
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:20,200
Right.

524
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,780
So it's all the same with water.

525
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,680
Water is destructive.

526
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,860
You know, more flood damage is done than

527
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,360
anything else.

528
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:26,620
Yeah.

529
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,260
But if you don't have running water in

530
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,540
a, in a living space, it's considered inadequate

531
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:31,960
now.

532
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,220
Right?

533
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,500
So you could look at these things in

534
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,320
nine star key.

535
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,320
Let's say someone that might be damaging to

536
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,880
you according to nine star key, but you

537
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,860
contain it just like you contain the water

538
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,540
and you contain the fire where you live.

539
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,020
Right.

540
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,000
So, okay.

541
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,020
Uh, Greek, please elaborate on pushing DC electrical

542
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,920
current through weather devices as mentioned by TJC

543
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,480
in loom of the future.

544
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,840
Yeah, I wouldn't do that, but we've, some

545
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,900
things mentioned in there he wouldn't do and

546
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,540
didn't work.

547
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:02,500
Fair.

548
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,359
I remember I was having interchange with him

549
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:06,240
to for about up until about a couple

550
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,359
of weeks before he died.

551
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,200
And it was a couple of weeks cause

552
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,119
she, she, she, the wife put him in

553
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:16,859
hospice by the way with a, the wife,

554
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:17,520
it was really funny.

555
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,599
This is kind of personal, but, uh, I'll

556
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,359
put it out anyway.

557
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,579
I know his daughter's still alive.

558
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:22,720
I don't know if the wife is probably

559
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,000
is, uh, the second wife or third, is

560
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,200
it?

561
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,780
But anyway, I'd call Trevor sometimes and he

562
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,760
would be really excited.

563
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,320
Actually, he called me more than I called

564
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,340
him towards the end and, uh, he'd be

565
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,080
kind of excited.

566
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,760
And I say, Trevor, you sound cheerful today.

567
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,000
He says, yeah, now's a good time to

568
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,160
talk cause she's gone shopping like, Oh no,

569
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,100
you have one of those.

570
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,160
What's the nine star key on his way.

571
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:45,360
Right.

572
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:45,820
You get it.

573
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,760
Anyway, tie that up.

574
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,020
I just had to say that cause you

575
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,180
know, the relationship thing.

576
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,100
No problem.

577
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:50,520
Okay.

578
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,840
So any comment on DARPA's Atmosense project, especially

579
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,260
in conjunction with the magics, all caps, MAGICS,

580
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,540
uh, program.

581
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,380
Say that again.

582
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,000
Okay.

583
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:04,280
Sorry.

584
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:04,880
Repeat that.

585
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,180
I mean, I heard it, but I didn't,

586
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,160
it didn't calculate.

587
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:07,560
Go ahead.

588
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:07,960
No problem.

589
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:12,960
Any comment on DARPA's Atmosense project, especially in

590
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,120
conjunction with the all caps magics MAGICS program.

591
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,360
Okay.

592
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,440
Well, I got that.

593
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,120
Uh, okay.

594
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,340
I got it the first time then.

595
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,380
No, no comment.

596
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,020
I don't know anything about that really.

597
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:26,480
Yeah.

598
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,920
I'll tell you the same.

599
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,640
Anyone that works in any government position or

600
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,280
whatever, if you're not a different species, you

601
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:36,560
will.

602
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,820
And they're, they're mostly idiotic wasting time, right?

603
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,380
They don't want anything because everyone's looking at

604
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:46,080
government projects to leak out and get, and

605
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,040
it's all misdirection and inadequacy.

606
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,420
It's never, you never, no, they don't have

607
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:50,780
anything.

608
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,960
So it's marketing, right?

609
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,060
Right.

610
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,340
And quite a bit of a magics and

611
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:59,400
majestic programs, honestly, are fabrications and falsehoods that

612
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,860
people just invented in order to create intrigue.

613
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,120
And I don't mean the government.

614
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,140
I mean, just common people invented them to

615
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,920
have something to say that was supposed to

616
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,360
be important.

617
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:07,880
Yeah.

618
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,800
There's, there's the Jason, the Jason group is

619
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,900
more is, is the magic group, by the

620
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,460
way, when they say magic, they're talking about

621
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,440
the Jasons, but that's another whole other story.

622
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,240
Right, right.

623
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,000
But what I'm saying is the stuff that

624
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,700
you find under that label is typically a

625
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,880
fabricated nonsense.

626
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,080
So, yeah, but there are, there, there are

627
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,520
groups.

628
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,040
It's just like the, think of when I

629
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,380
say groups, like they're not even government, but

630
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,020
they sound governmental, right?

631
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,300
Council on foreign relations and the other one,

632
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,880
the technocratic one council farm relations is political.

633
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,800
And what's the other one that's more technocratic.

634
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,540
Trilateral.

635
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,180
There's two of them.

636
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,300
Trilateral.

637
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:47,860
Yeah.

638
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,100
Right.

639
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:48,580
Trilateral.

640
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,660
Those are the technocratic ones.

641
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:50,960
Yeah.

642
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,220
They're, they're right down the street from in

643
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,380
Washington, DC, from all the main, whatever.

644
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,760
Even Hillary Clinton once was quoted that, uh,

645
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,800
you know, how do you like your job

646
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,440
as secretary of state?

647
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,600
It's not so bad because the council of

648
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,460
foreign relations is just right down the street.

649
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:04,940
Oops.

650
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,260
Exactly.

651
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,460
So, Hey, the boss, the boss is in

652
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,620
the office next over.

653
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,000
So it's easy to get to, right?

654
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:12,500
Yeah.

655
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,100
The boss is down the street.

656
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:14,440
Yes.

657
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:14,740
Right.

658
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:15,420
Okay.

659
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,880
So, so there are some exceptions to morons,

660
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,120
but they're still moronic too.

661
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:19,720
Yeah.

662
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,620
So, right.

663
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,000
Yeah.

664
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,980
In a class of their own, so to

665
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,200
speak.

666
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:23,580
All right.

667
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:23,860
All right.

668
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,560
Also, I'm sure it's not just me, but

669
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,940
the Israeli government, uh, trying to turn all

670
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,700
the nations against them.

671
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,860
And on that note, is it, uh, is

672
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:38,240
it three I Atlas or three I, uh,

673
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,380
a benthos, uh, the three I Atlas thing

674
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,120
is about the comments.

675
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,420
I never, I'm sorry.

676
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,260
The three, I don't know anything about that,

677
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,740
but it's about the upcoming, sorry, the upcoming

678
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,260
comments.

679
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,760
Uh, Greek is what they're asking about because

680
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,080
there's a bunch of, yeah, the one, the

681
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,820
one that's coming.

682
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,100
Yeah.

683
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,480
That they want to shoot with a nuke

684
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:56,880
or something.

685
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,240
Well, look, there's three of them.

686
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,300
Well, that's going to hit the moon.

687
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,720
There's a cluster of three of them.

688
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,800
And that's the three.

689
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,460
I'd be.

690
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:02,720
Yeah.

691
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,600
I talked about that a while back, but

692
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,180
it may not be that, but, but, uh,

693
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:07,400
okay.

694
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,060
Regarding the leadership in Israel, that's first chapter

695
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,000
of Isaiah.

696
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,680
And I kept bringing that up, that as

697
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,200
long as they have prime ministers, it's going

698
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,440
to be pretty bad for them.

699
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,560
And he might be the last prime minister

700
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,380
who knows.

701
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,300
I think there's one more after him and

702
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,960
he position of Samson, because there's a repeat

703
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,080
of judges and judges and the prime ministers,

704
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,080
uh, paralleling.

705
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,460
And then after that, they have a monarchy.

706
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,460
So they're doing that.

707
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,400
So in a way to fulfill prophetic stuff

708
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,300
in the first chapter of Isaiah or second

709
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,880
chapter is it where it talks about, I

710
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,460
will return to you, your former judges.

711
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,020
And then you will be known as a

712
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:42,660
righteous nation.

713
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,980
So as long as they have prime minister,

714
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,020
a minister, a judge is a ministerial power.

715
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,580
So prime minister is the prime judge.

716
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,940
So as long as they have prime ministers

717
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,860
and as they wrap that whole series of

718
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,940
prime ministers up until they get to a

719
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,780
monarchy, they're going to get worse and worse.

720
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,740
I discussed this decade ago, two decades ago.

721
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:00,840
Right.

722
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:01,420
Yeah.

723
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:01,800
Yeah.

724
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,800
And I recall it as the second decade.

725
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,140
Cause I remember you saying you'd already been

726
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,600
talking about it for a decade by the

727
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,480
time you and I started talking anyway.

728
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:08,600
Right.

729
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,220
So where can I send my signature and

730
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,820
my trust number to acquire the water Helix

731
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,540
question mark.

732
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,100
Also using the logic of the consumption of

733
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:17,400
eggs.

734
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:20,340
Could the same be said about eating seeds?

735
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:25,390
The last part, uh, the consumption of what,

736
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:27,010
what eating seeds or eggs.

737
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:27,690
Yes.

738
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:27,970
Yeah.

739
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:28,630
Pretty much.

740
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:29,810
But it's different.

741
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:30,790
It's different.

742
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:31,030
Right.

743
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,750
Remember, uh, plants can't walk.

744
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:34,790
Plants can't move.

745
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,010
They're in a dream state.

746
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:36,450
Right.

747
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:39,090
And, uh, animals can move and they're always

748
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:39,570
in envy.

749
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:40,930
Right.

750
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,510
Did I ever say that?

751
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,870
I don't think I've ever said that before.

752
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:44,490
Only in private.

753
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,490
I was talking to someone about the animalistic.

754
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:47,990
I found some notes.

755
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:51,750
Uh, there's the, you know, the plant energy

756
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,550
that moves the, that's how we get day

757
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:54,930
and night.

758
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:55,430
Right.

759
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:56,870
When a plant wants to go to the

760
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,230
light and then when it gets too much

761
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,110
light, right.

762
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,270
One, you know, uh, goes back around.

763
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:03,050
That's what keeps things moving is the plant

764
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,690
vegetative force.

765
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:07,370
And then you have the animalistic force, which

766
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:08,770
can move things.

767
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:11,630
Um, and it's, they're envious.

768
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:14,290
Like if you see a chicken with a

769
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,990
caterpillar hanging out of its mouth and it's

770
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,410
walking through a bunch of chickens, what do

771
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:18,610
you think the next thing is going to

772
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:18,890
happen?

773
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:19,690
And what do you want to guess?

774
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:21,270
Another chicken's going to come up and pluck

775
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,070
it right out of its mouth.

776
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:22,350
Right.

777
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:22,730
Yep.

778
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:25,250
So, yep.

779
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,550
And then get pecked for it.

780
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,670
So they're all full of envy.

781
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:31,590
Um, so you're not going to, so put

782
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,150
that together.

783
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,950
I'll keep it cryptic like that.

784
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:36,390
But yes, the principle is the same, but

785
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,450
the result is very different.

786
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,870
By the way, we talked about, we talked

787
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:42,070
about universal principles.

788
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,070
So the top of the higher, the body

789
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:46,910
parts of the body, the higher they are

790
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:49,750
when you stand, the more young they are

791
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:52,290
and the lower the parts of the body

792
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:52,830
are more yin.

793
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:55,910
So the digestive system, the highest part of

794
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,370
the digestive system is the teeth.

795
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:59,410
That's got to be the most young and

796
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:01,410
they are by definition.

797
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,830
And as you go down to the, to

798
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:08,070
the, uh, colon, it's the most yin.

799
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:09,550
And then finally you end up with a

800
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,570
young enclosure, right?

801
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:16,030
Um, so that's how the foods go down

802
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:16,230
too.

803
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,730
So in other words, the, when you eat

804
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:20,850
oils and sweets, which are very yin, they're

805
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,370
going to be more attracted to the teeth

806
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:23,190
and stomach.

807
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,670
So the stomach is where the oils and

808
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,470
sugars, most of the work on them is

809
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:27,870
done there.

810
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:29,350
That's why your gallbladder is there.

811
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:30,670
For example.

812
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:34,430
So once you understand universal principle, you'll see

813
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:36,410
the body is set up according to universal

814
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:36,850
principle.

815
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:40,010
Just like if you understand the combustion engine

816
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:42,570
and how it requires cooling and power transfer

817
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:44,570
and fuel, it's very large.

818
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,010
If you don't build it according to a

819
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:47,690
certain rationale, it won't work the same with

820
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:48,410
the human body.

821
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:51,630
When you see universal principles, the hot top

822
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:52,930
part of the body is more young than

823
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:53,810
the lower part.

824
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:57,290
And then any intake has to be processed

825
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:57,850
accordingly.

826
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:59,950
So the most yin intake gets processed at

827
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:02,450
the most young part of the body.

828
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:04,610
Then you can go ahead and factor in

829
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:06,870
the eggs and the seeds and the energies

830
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:07,770
thereof, right?

831
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:10,830
So that could be, that's another, that's a

832
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:14,310
really long sonic to get into, but chew

833
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,510
on that for a while.

834
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:17,990
I'll stay cryptic with it.

835
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:18,770
Why not?

836
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,470
If some individuals are wiped out at quote

837
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:24,550
death end quote, and some continue elsewhere, is

838
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:27,510
this place then more of a sorting mechanism

839
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:32,670
that the cosmos uses to identify quality individuals

840
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,070
and get rid of the rest?

841
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:37,170
Like a job interview question mark, you consider

842
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:39,670
20 people, but you move on with two

843
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:40,190
or three.

844
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:44,350
By the way, reincarnating on this planet would

845
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,930
be the highest form of punishment.

846
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:49,090
I would rather choose complete annihilation.

847
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:50,510
Here's that term again.

848
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:53,490
And somebody followed it up by saying, I

849
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:55,810
thought reincarnation was a prank question mark.

850
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:58,170
Yeah.

851
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,150
Well, if there, here's the thing that most

852
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:02,550
people that talk about reincarnation don't get into

853
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:02,830
that.

854
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,990
If you, if there is reincarnation, let's say

855
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:06,590
wholesale, guess what?

856
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:09,550
If you're here, you're in the afterlife.

857
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:12,830
Think about it, right?

858
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:15,130
You know, cause there's talk about the, the

859
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,410
afterlife is a category.

860
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:19,170
Reincarnation is a category, but people avoid putting

861
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:19,930
the two together.

862
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:22,550
And it's the only rational combination one can

863
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,570
come up with.

864
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:25,950
If you are a reincarnated being, that means

865
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:30,730
you were incarnated, excarnated and reincarnated.

866
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:33,090
So that would put you into the afterlife

867
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:33,670
category.

868
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:36,430
So some people then would be living if

869
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:38,190
they are reincarnated in the afterlife.

870
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:41,850
And there's no mention of the afterlife of

871
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,470
such a thing.

872
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:47,130
So it's pretty, it gets confusing, but I

873
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,650
would agree with most of his statements.

874
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:52,530
And yeah, I, I don't know what to

875
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:55,490
say about these topics because the only firsthand

876
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,890
experience I have is being incarnated.

877
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,630
So at least to the memory that you

878
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,190
can recall.

879
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,770
And, but again, what about it?

880
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,770
I'm incarnated right now.

881
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:05,170
Right.

882
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:08,590
What about reincarnation being a prank in general

883
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,350
though, directly?

884
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:11,870
I mean, is that a fair statement as

885
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:12,090
well?

886
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:17,650
No problem.

887
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:20,190
No, I don't think it's a prank.

888
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:23,910
It's a function that is considered right.

889
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:24,770
Over-considered.

890
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,530
Over-considered.

891
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:30,590
Well, maybe, maybe it depends on your position

892
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:30,950
again.

893
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:31,350
Right.

894
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:32,250
Out of fear.

895
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,590
I think a lot of people cling to

896
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,630
it as like a solution to their fears

897
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:38,010
is what we really see a lot, right?

898
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:38,950
Yeah.

899
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,830
None of the Eastern texts talk about reincarnation

900
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:42,190
that way.

901
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,690
They just say that you will live and

902
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:45,210
then you die and then you're judged on

903
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:45,790
your works.

904
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:49,570
So that's in your Hindu texts and, you

905
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:50,390
know, all these other texts.

906
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:52,150
It doesn't say that you're keep coming back

907
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:53,310
and this and that and the other.

908
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:54,990
But anyway.

909
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:58,550
Well, like most things, common misconception always, right?

910
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,710
You know, next time you'll come back as

911
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:02,790
a horsefly because you're, you know, full of

912
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,390
crap this time, so you'll chase it next

913
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:04,650
time.

914
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:04,830
Yeah.

915
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,510
That's like the 72 virgins.

916
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,650
If you're more right in heaven, that's not

917
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:08,930
anywhere.

918
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,450
But I mean, that's much later on in

919
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:10,830
commentary.

920
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,690
These are just commentaries people make.

921
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:15,430
And when we went, I went over all

922
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:15,990
those things.

923
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,790
It wasn't definitive as those were all the

924
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:18,390
possibilities.

925
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,190
You know, you're you come back, you die,

926
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:22,530
come back or you die and you're annihilated

927
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:23,870
or you die and you go to something

928
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,110
like I have it or you die and

929
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:27,450
go something like a hell or you could

930
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,490
be in like a purgatory state, a holding

931
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:29,930
pattern.

932
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:31,370
Right.

933
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,350
So I just brought up all the possibilities

934
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,750
and the rational combinations.

935
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:37,170
Fair enough.

936
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:37,550
Okay.

937
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:37,990
Okay.

938
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,990
So does the Greek have any strategies for

939
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,170
dealing with tailgaters?

940
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:44,190
I live in northern Virginia and drive, respectively,

941
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,350
and close to the speed limit.

942
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:49,350
And it just isn't fast enough for people

943
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,170
that want to go 10 to 20 miles

944
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:51,630
over.

945
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:52,230
Oh, yeah.

946
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:52,730
Yeah.

947
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:55,130
Well, that's a commute.

948
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:55,490
Okay.

949
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,370
Everything is about communication.

950
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:00,450
So like one thing that I'll give you

951
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:01,570
to set the mindset.

952
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,850
One thing I don't like is two things

953
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:05,930
I don't like with drivers is they at

954
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:08,610
an intersection, you're not sure what to do.

955
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:10,590
They don't at least hand wave you like,

956
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:11,090
go ahead.

957
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,870
And they just look straight like they're dead.

958
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,730
The other thing is not using a turning

959
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:15,330
signal.

960
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,490
I'm not talking about codes and laws.

961
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:20,450
Like, for example, if you slow down when

962
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:22,350
someone wants to cross the street, you just

963
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:24,890
stand there like a zombie looking forward.

964
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:27,570
They don't know if you're going to if

965
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:28,950
they should cross and you're going to hit

966
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,990
the gas and run them over or you're

967
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,690
actually there waiting for them to cross.

968
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:34,470
But if you look, give them eye contact

969
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,650
and then wave them over.

970
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:36,950
Right.

971
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:37,790
What does it mean?

972
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:39,150
They won't want to run you over to

973
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:39,790
the toy mafia.

974
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:40,130
Right.

975
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:43,750
But anyway, so the communication, the reason you

976
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,170
use turning signals to communicate.

977
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:47,330
So if someone's tailgating, hit your hazard lights

978
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:48,970
on blink, blink, blink.

979
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:49,230
Right.

980
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:52,490
That means that you're you're slow.

981
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,690
It's the purpose of the hazard lights is

982
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:59,970
that originally was that person can't go fast

983
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:01,410
or slow moving vehicle.

984
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:03,250
And it's hazardous to be on their tail

985
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,190
because they could stop.

986
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:04,670
Right.

987
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:05,890
So just put your hazard lights.

988
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:07,450
I've done that several times and they go

989
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:08,050
around you.

990
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:10,690
And if it's a single lane, just give

991
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:12,570
them enough room if they gesture to go

992
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:13,110
around you.

993
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,590
Don't use a turning signal.

994
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,190
Use the hazard lights and they get the

995
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,750
signal that they should go around, that you're

996
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,050
slow.

997
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:25,010
They might get pissed off, but that'll that'll

998
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:28,670
communicate that you're not intending to go faster

999
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,350
because of their tailgating.

1000
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:33,270
Now, the tailgater is communicating to you.

1001
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:35,710
How do you buy the virtue of tailgating?

1002
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:36,630
Right, right.

1003
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:38,750
So you communicate back.

1004
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:42,110
Yeah, you communicate back with the hazard lights.

1005
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:42,770
So, yes.

1006
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:43,290
OK, next.

1007
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:43,990
There you go.

1008
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:46,470
OK, but the same question still going.

1009
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:49,690
I'm considering putting a mirror inside, not outside

1010
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:50,270
the car.

1011
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,390
Referring back to your discussion about smart mirrors

1012
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:56,450
or smart meters, excuse me, in the trunk

1013
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:59,030
facing traffic behind me to see if it

1014
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:01,430
is any kind of mental deterrent.

1015
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:03,470
What are your thoughts on that?

1016
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:03,950
Yeah, it could be.

1017
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:05,770
I would try it.

1018
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:06,010
Yeah.

1019
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,350
Mirrors are very potent.

1020
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:12,370
In certain traditions, when especially in what's called

1021
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,750
Jewish traditions in parts of the world, when

1022
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:17,630
they would do their cedars and prayers on

1023
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:19,850
Sabbaths and holidays, they go around the house

1024
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:21,950
and cover all the mirrors.

1025
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:25,210
Have you ever seen that or heard of

1026
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:25,410
it?

1027
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:26,270
Well, I've seen a lot.

1028
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:28,510
They cover the mirrors because they're portals, right?

1029
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,230
No, I've seen that a lot.

1030
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,530
They have the black mirror lower.

1031
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:32,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

1032
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:34,870
And you see in a lot of older

1033
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:36,750
places where people are not supposed to be

1034
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,070
lurking and people get spooked, you definitely see

1035
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:41,750
like what looks like bedsheets over the mirrors

1036
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:44,950
even because they absolutely must be covered.

1037
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:48,070
Some people say it's for cleaning purposes, but

1038
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:50,230
no, I think it's exactly what you're talking

1039
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:50,450
about.

1040
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:53,150
Yeah, they consider them to be portals.

1041
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:54,090
Yeah, exactly.

1042
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,010
Okay, I don't think anyone is going to

1043
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:58,310
be annihilated if the gods put us here

1044
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:01,010
with all our faults and an evil system

1045
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:04,590
we've been living under from the time began.

1046
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,290
From, wait, from the time began.

1047
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,130
That's how they wrote it.

1048
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,090
Okay, it would.

1049
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:10,390
That's okay, we got it.

1050
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:14,870
One fair that the gods will give humanity

1051
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:16,650
a utopia as a compensation.

1052
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:20,210
You know, it seems very transactional here, this

1053
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:20,690
discussion.

1054
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:22,510
You know, you're gonna get a utopia.

1055
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,250
You're in an evil system.

1056
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,670
There's a bunch of preconceived judgments there, right?

1057
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:28,090
I mean, or am I wrong about that?

1058
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:29,790
Yes, that's okay.

1059
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:31,870
Utopia means no man's land, by the way,

1060
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,710
literally in Greek, or good.

1061
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:37,290
Yeah, or it means the best of the,

1062
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,930
it could also mean the best of the

1063
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:43,370
place, which is interesting how it parallels no

1064
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:45,930
man's land, but I'm not sure.

1065
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:46,950
I'm not sure.

1066
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:49,650
I'm a big proponent of the NPCs that

1067
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:50,950
a lot of people you run into are

1068
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:51,690
not even real.

1069
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:54,710
Yeah, they will bleed if you cut on

1070
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:54,910
them.

1071
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:56,530
But they're not real.

1072
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,970
They're just like you'll walk around the corner

1073
00:32:58,970 --> 00:32:59,570
and they're gone.

1074
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,790
Like they were just there for a reason

1075
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:05,910
that to play a temporary role.

1076
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:07,730
So those would be like more illusionary.

1077
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:11,330
But I run into people that are vacuous,

1078
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:12,150
hollow vessels.

1079
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:15,070
So okay, so like they're being bred for

1080
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:15,990
food or something.

1081
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:16,850
So right.

1082
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:19,690
So hi, Mr. Chuck, could you ask the

1083
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:22,450
Greek about catalysts and how you could go

1084
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:23,930
about choosing catalysts?

1085
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:26,830
What's the method of determining what type of

1086
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:29,710
catalysts you need to go along with, or

1087
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:32,550
excuse me, alongside of resin beads?

1088
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:33,230
Thanks.

1089
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:35,490
And then he says that might be too

1090
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,510
non-expressed enough.

1091
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:40,650
So maybe he could talk a bit more

1092
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:41,890
about on catalysts.

1093
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:47,430
Well, catalysts would be platinum group metals for

1094
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,210
many things.

1095
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:52,130
Magnetite has catalytic properties and so does zeolite,

1096
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:54,070
even though it's considered an adsorber.

1097
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,510
That's in the water dimension.

1098
00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:00,110
The platinum groups are go after like the

1099
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:04,190
sulfur, oxygen, hydrogen compounds, and they do make

1100
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:04,630
changes.

1101
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:08,730
Catalysts also nickel beads, water and oil don't

1102
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:09,150
mix.

1103
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,250
But if you run it over a nickel

1104
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:14,550
beads and it has enough motion, you end

1105
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,050
up with vegetable shortening, right?

1106
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:16,949
Where it does mix.

1107
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:20,310
So there's catalysts in the body as well.

1108
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:24,270
The oxygen is actually a catalyst.

1109
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:28,170
You're actually a nitrogen breather, not an oxygen

1110
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:28,830
breather.

1111
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:32,949
That's very rational, easy to prove because what

1112
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:35,290
we're breathing is more than 70% nitrogen.

1113
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:38,969
So we're nitrogen breathers by majority, right?

1114
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:41,850
Statistically, but we need that oxygen in there

1115
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:45,449
to catalyze the reaction in the lungs.

1116
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:46,989
Right.

1117
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:50,949
And yeah, so you're actually hydrogen based, not

1118
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:53,449
carbon based, by the way, it's very simple

1119
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:55,929
because you're mostly water.

1120
00:34:57,270 --> 00:35:00,210
So I think a water based creature, not

1121
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:01,230
a carbon.

1122
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,770
So all these things are, this is a

1123
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:06,410
big, it's a very big, big open subject.

1124
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:06,970
Right.

1125
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:09,070
And the other thing is, I think some

1126
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:11,870
people accidentally mix what a conduit and a

1127
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:12,830
catalyst is.

1128
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,710
There is a bit of a difference, although

1129
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:17,010
some people use them interchangeably as well.

1130
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:20,310
Well, conduit is just a transport, right?

1131
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:20,570
Right.

1132
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,130
Transport.

1133
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:24,130
So the thing that you can transport within,

1134
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,450
it's like the road is a conduit for

1135
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:27,850
the things that roll on it.

1136
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:28,490
And, you know.

1137
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:30,270
Yeah, but did that come up?

1138
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:31,610
Did the conduit come up?

1139
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:32,270
Did I miss that?

1140
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,270
No, I'm bringing it up because I think

1141
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:36,710
sometimes people use the word catalyst because catalyst

1142
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:39,450
is more of an active thing than just

1143
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:41,210
the road being there as a way that

1144
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:42,050
something can travel.

1145
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:42,410
Yes.

1146
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:45,010
So there's a difference between a conduit and

1147
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:45,470
a catalyst.

1148
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:48,150
I think people often transpose the two is

1149
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:48,630
all I'm saying.

1150
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,830
They use one for the other is all.

1151
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:52,170
All right.

1152
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,110
What else you got?

1153
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:53,490
Okay.

1154
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:54,170
Okay.

1155
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,490
So garbage in, garbage out.

1156
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,930
That's a 3D printing thing.

1157
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:57,310
All right.

1158
00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:00,990
When we brought it up though, not really.

1159
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:05,190
He says 3D printing and Euclidean geometric, you

1160
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,030
know, imagination.

1161
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,570
But that's not always true.

1162
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:09,490
I've seen it used in the early computer

1163
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:10,970
language back when we were dealing with.

1164
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:13,190
Now, Greek, this will bring back memories, Pascal

1165
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:15,450
and logo and, you know, and all that

1166
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:15,730
stuff.

1167
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:16,810
Fortran.

1168
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:17,590
Yeah.

1169
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:18,470
It's even older.

1170
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,170
Fortran.

1171
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:19,810
And yeah.

1172
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:20,430
Well, sure.

1173
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:20,850
C++.

1174
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:21,970
Yeah, exactly.

1175
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:24,270
So all those languages, right?

1176
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:25,730
Computer languages.

1177
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:28,430
We were using that terminology and the people

1178
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:31,130
that even introduced us to that when they

1179
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:32,990
had classes on the different things.

1180
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:34,850
They use garbage in, garbage out.

1181
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:37,290
I've heard that used scientifically many different ways,

1182
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:41,290
even people testing the consistency of batches of

1183
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:41,650
bullets.

1184
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:44,010
I've heard him talk about garbage in, garbage

1185
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:46,850
out in reports in the 1970s that I've

1186
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:47,050
read.

1187
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:51,010
So, you know, this is not like confined

1188
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:53,030
to one thing, garbage in, garbage out or

1189
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:53,950
3D printing even.

1190
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,870
Am I right or wrong about that?

1191
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:58,490
Well, yeah, you could take it even further

1192
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:02,170
that if a society's diet, what they eat,

1193
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,590
the quality goes down too low.

1194
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:05,210
They become low quality also.

1195
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:06,670
Yeah.

1196
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:07,650
I mean, yeah.

1197
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:07,950
Okay.

1198
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:08,310
What else?

1199
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:08,770
Okay.

1200
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:11,150
So does the Greek use the credit system

1201
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:13,490
he talks about to pay all his bills

1202
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:14,250
and purchases?

1203
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:17,530
The only time I've heard about reptilians is

1204
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:19,170
with the Space Force PSYOP.

1205
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:22,470
These are all put together like one after

1206
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:22,810
the other.

1207
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:25,830
But anyway, you want to address the first

1208
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:27,590
question, then we'll go on to the Space

1209
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,050
Force thing.

1210
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,070
Yeah, I don't have any bills.

1211
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:33,290
So I will soon.

1212
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:35,550
But that's already, we've already set it up

1213
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:38,010
to be, yeah, we'll be using the Bill

1214
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:38,530
of Exchange.

1215
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:39,090
Yeah.

1216
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:43,650
I did a financial group and I've did

1217
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:46,170
more than a few, quite a few hours

1218
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:48,830
every time discussing the mindset for it to

1219
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:49,110
work.

1220
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:52,910
I brought up quite a few things here,

1221
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:56,870
even on the Sonics, that it's all about

1222
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:57,370
accounting.

1223
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:58,650
There is no money, right?

1224
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:04,870
You're in a temporary situation and it's kind

1225
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:08,270
of like when you, let's say you're taking

1226
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:11,170
care of a bunch of kindergartners and it's

1227
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:12,990
coming around 10 o'clock and you don't

1228
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:14,210
have plans for lunch.

1229
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:17,570
So you ask someone to count how many

1230
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:20,570
children there are and what we should get

1231
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:21,310
for lunch.

1232
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:23,030
It hasn't happened yet.

1233
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,250
You write it all down.

1234
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:25,950
And then when you write it all down,

1235
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,310
then you have to compare it to a

1236
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:28,830
menu because you can go get some lunch,

1237
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:29,070
right?

1238
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:32,390
It's all, no one's ever gotten any kind

1239
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:36,190
of, it's functioning on a temporary emergency basis.

1240
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:41,130
The emergencies have been called off mostly, but

1241
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:43,410
you're still operating as if there's nothing there

1242
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:44,590
and there isn't anything there.

1243
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:45,710
So you got to understand accounting.

1244
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,370
The easiest way to understand accounting is if

1245
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:49,930
somebody sends you a bill and you don't

1246
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:51,110
know what to do with it, send them

1247
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:52,270
a bill for a dollar more.

1248
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:55,410
It doesn't really change the liability because it

1249
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:57,890
has to be more than a dollar to

1250
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:59,510
change the liability and just tell them to

1251
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:03,950
apply that to their bookkeeping to settle everything

1252
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:06,490
and to give them a little tender in

1253
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:06,650
there.

1254
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:07,390
Tell them what to do.

1255
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:07,950
It's like that.

1256
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:10,650
If they don't settle that, you're going to

1257
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:11,890
go to a debt collector.

1258
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,930
You know, watch what happens, right?

1259
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,350
So yeah.

1260
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:17,570
So remember, this kind of knowledge is going

1261
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:21,250
to be foreign because the whole system relies

1262
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:21,570
on it.

1263
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:22,890
It's a temporary system.

1264
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:25,070
By the way, the entire system, the government,

1265
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:30,770
everything financial operates day to day because they're

1266
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:32,470
not supposed to be doing what they're doing.

1267
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:34,570
And so every day, like at the end

1268
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:36,950
of closing, whatever business they're doing, like, wow,

1269
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:38,370
I don't believe we got away with it

1270
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:39,610
for another day.

1271
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:41,810
We're going to see what happens tomorrow.

1272
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:45,590
You know, recently, by the way, I saw

1273
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:48,710
a YouTube video advertising and starting to tell

1274
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,770
people that, look, this is how your birth

1275
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:51,450
certificate works.

1276
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:54,290
And it sounded very similar to what you've

1277
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:54,890
been explaining.

1278
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,050
And they want you to click through a

1279
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:57,130
website and go see them.

1280
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:57,910
Have you seen that?

1281
00:39:58,430 --> 00:39:58,710
Yeah.

1282
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:01,790
No, no, they're doing that because it's not

1283
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,230
really the birth certificate.

1284
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,590
This works even without a birth certificate.

1285
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:09,310
But the birth certificate is more the Mississippi

1286
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,530
220 rule.

1287
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:13,970
I know Missouri 220 rule states that a

1288
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:15,970
birth certificate is a real estate document.

1289
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:18,950
But it's a document that certifies that there's

1290
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:21,330
it's as good as any real estate document.

1291
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:22,910
Like a deed to a house or something.

1292
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:26,570
I think it's Missouri or Minnesota 220.

1293
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:27,370
One or the other.

1294
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:28,490
You can look up.

1295
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:31,010
I think it's Minnesota 220 or Missouri 220

1296
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:35,030
that a birth certificate equals a real estate

1297
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:37,750
deed or, you know, to real estate.

1298
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:41,110
So yeah, but the birth certificate is very

1299
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:41,810
fundamental.

1300
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:45,790
But that's not, you know, the Social Security

1301
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:49,430
number, which gives you the right to create

1302
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:50,030
securities.

1303
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:51,350
And you're the only one who could create

1304
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:51,790
securities.

1305
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:53,470
Banks and corporations can't.

1306
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:55,610
They're what's called debtors in possession.

1307
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:56,070
Right.

1308
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:58,250
Now, look, this was in conjunction with the

1309
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:01,110
mention of going to the reserve window and

1310
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:03,810
all that to go utilize your certificate to

1311
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:05,490
draw on credits that are already.

1312
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:06,710
No, you can't go there.

1313
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:08,210
No, you can't go there.

1314
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:10,610
They've set it up as an intermediary only

1315
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:11,010
to go.

1316
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:11,610
Yeah.

1317
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:14,190
I'm just saying that it is similar language

1318
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:16,710
and it sounds very similar to what it

1319
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:16,890
is.

1320
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:18,290
And I've never heard that before.

1321
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:20,210
Anybody say anything like this in public?

1322
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:22,590
It's very new to my mind.

1323
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:23,910
And I just happened to catch an ad

1324
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:24,410
about it.

1325
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,410
But it covers a lot of ground here

1326
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:28,270
where they're talking about this is the beginning

1327
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:29,010
of your paperwork.

1328
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:31,810
And eventually what you got to know is

1329
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:34,750
there's a receivership here and you draw on

1330
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:36,710
a line of credit based on the number.

1331
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:38,870
So it's just one of those things where

1332
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:41,230
they tried to compress this into like 60

1333
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:41,710
seconds.

1334
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,710
And I just found it interesting that there's.

1335
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:46,630
Yeah, well, it's it's everything is prepaid.

1336
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:49,490
The Social Security number used to be called

1337
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:50,950
an exemption because you're exempt.

1338
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,870
But everyone wants to get paid twice.

1339
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:54,750
So when you get a bill from a

1340
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,870
corporation or a government that's already been paid

1341
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:57,930
for, they just want to see if they

1342
00:41:57,930 --> 00:41:58,930
get you to pay for it again.

1343
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,910
I gave the Starbucks analogy before.

1344
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:01,670
Right, right, right.

1345
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:05,430
So, yeah, I'm just saying that somebody's offering

1346
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:06,850
this as like we can show you how

1347
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:08,570
to do it on the commercials.

1348
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:09,090
But anyway.

1349
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:11,230
Oh, yeah, it's been over this.

1350
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:13,070
That's been going on for 30 years now.

1351
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:14,050
Fair enough.

1352
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:15,690
But I never saw you and the reptilians.

1353
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:20,510
Yeah, well, there's the reptilian aspect of it

1354
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:23,450
is mentioned in a lot of ancient texts

1355
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:25,210
throughout.

1356
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:29,330
And I'm fond of them, by the way.

1357
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:31,290
But if I find out they're as dumb

1358
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:33,150
as humans, then I'm not so fond of

1359
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,210
them, if you get my point.

1360
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:35,270
No, fair enough.

1361
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:37,530
There's a reason why Farrakhan used to talk

1362
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:38,990
about the great wheel in the sky and

1363
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:39,510
all that, too.

1364
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:43,130
Um, OK, so where can I send my

1365
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:44,390
signature and my trust number?

1366
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:45,850
Now, I asked that before, but I don't

1367
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:48,450
think we got it because they want, obviously,

1368
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:52,130
just go to for business on the water

1369
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:56,890
helix, the scalarator, just go to WWW water

1370
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:57,850
helix dot com.

1371
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:58,830
And there's an email there.

1372
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:00,970
And I answer them all the time.

1373
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:03,410
You know, within 24 hours, you'll get an

1374
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:03,670
answer.

1375
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:08,570
I've had several people correspondence with, oh, yeah,

1376
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:09,550
I'll get one pretty soon.

1377
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:10,170
And they never do.

1378
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:10,750
That's fine.

1379
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:14,030
You got to remember, if you want a

1380
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:16,190
device, there's quite a bit of friction and

1381
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:20,890
funneling involved, meaning we we do have some

1382
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:21,470
in stocks.

1383
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:23,990
But I want to make sure that the

1384
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:27,330
match is, you know, made well.

1385
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:28,950
Like if you're selling a Cadillac and someone

1386
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:31,350
wants it to haul garbage, but they don't

1387
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:32,810
tell you that till the last day, do

1388
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:34,010
you still want to sell it to them?

1389
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:36,610
No, because.

1390
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:36,910
Right.

1391
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:39,590
So in other words, I want to find

1392
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:42,290
out what kind of water quality you have.

1393
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:44,590
And if it's a good match, it has

1394
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:45,990
to be installed properly.

1395
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,930
The unit itself is extremely durable, but proper

1396
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:52,650
installation doesn't necessarily mean getting a plumber either.

1397
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:55,630
It's location sensitive to a degree.

1398
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:59,490
Uh, so we I've actually rejected and let's

1399
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:02,750
see about three three people already based on

1400
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:05,290
the it wouldn't be a good match functionally,

1401
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:06,350
not because.

1402
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:12,090
Oh, you went away.

1403
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:14,310
Can you hear me?

1404
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:15,430
Let's see.

1405
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:19,150
OK, Greek, you're still there, but your your

1406
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:19,910
audio is gone.

1407
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:26,400
Let's reload Jitsi and see what we get,

1408
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,520
because you seem to have gone away.

1409
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,580
And I'd like to catch the recording here

1410
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:33,820
and try and end this properly.

1411
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:37,540
But then again, pretty close to concluding there

1412
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:38,240
in that statement.

1413
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:41,200
So let's just see if I can rejoin

1414
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,140
you already in progress.

1415
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,280
Let's find out.

1416
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:52,520
So there you are.

1417
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:52,920
Hello.

1418
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:54,860
Yeah, yeah.

1419
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:55,340
Can you hear me?

1420
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:55,600
Yeah.

1421
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:57,780
You suddenly were making no noise, so I'm

1422
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:58,520
sorry about that.

1423
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,140
OK, I don't know what that was.

1424
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:04,140
There was a loud sound outside to hear.

1425
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:05,120
Who knows?

1426
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:06,740
So many got blasted.

1427
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,340
Are we still are we still rolling?

1428
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:09,620
Oh, yeah, we are right now.

1429
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:10,920
OK, cool.

1430
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:11,720
Yeah.

1431
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,740
So for the scale orator, it's just a

1432
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,060
matter of making a good match.

1433
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,640
And like I said, there's about three people

1434
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,400
that I've denied an offer to or an

1435
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,540
acquisition because it wouldn't be a good match.

1436
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,000
One of them was for character.

1437
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:26,960
The other two was for, you know, it

1438
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,180
just wasn't needed.

1439
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:31,420
Like, for example, if you're in Atlanta area,

1440
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,040
you don't need it because you have a

1441
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,440
TDS of 20, which is if you measured

1442
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:40,300
rainwater, it would measure a TDS of 20.

1443
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:41,240
Right, right.

1444
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,300
So it would improve it would improve the

1445
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,260
water quality and make it more like healing

1446
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:48,520
water if you bathed and had a lot

1447
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,200
of water features.

1448
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:52,340
But there's no need to remediate to mitigate

1449
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:54,140
scale, like I say on the site.

1450
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,040
Yeah.

1451
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:56,640
So we have another site.

1452
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,840
It's a luxury site.

1453
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:01,320
Basically, the idea between the luxury site was

1454
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:04,060
one image, one word.

1455
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,480
It's hard to get away with that.

1456
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,200
So it has like three words on it.

1457
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:09,340
And some images like you would expect if

1458
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:11,980
you go to Hermes or Ferrari or Rolls

1459
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:13,680
Royce website, what you expect there.

1460
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,140
All the luxury sites are about the same.

1461
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,480
And and that one I don't talk about

1462
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,600
very much because it's going through certain channels

1463
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,920
doesn't mean that it's a secret.

1464
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,820
I just don't bring it up.

1465
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,560
And on the Sonics.

1466
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:32,640
So there you have it.

1467
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:33,540
So anything.
