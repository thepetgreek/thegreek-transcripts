1
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,600
Rated Y, 239, and that's the sonic event.

2
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,580
Anyway, Greek, how are you?

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,380
Yeah, you asked me, got anything or get

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:19,640
started.

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:20,600
Just a little bit.

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,820
A little member is a good fella.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,940
When a kid comes in here and insults

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,540
me, I know you did a little bit.

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,160
A little bit.

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,680
Do you remember at the bar?

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:30,280
Well, anyway.

12
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:30,860
Oh, yeah.

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,700
Oh, yeah.

14
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:32,780
I'm not talking about it.

15
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,760
So he's like a little bit.

16
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:34,520
I got a little bit.

17
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:35,560
Talk about this.

18
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,560
Get into it if you want.

19
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,580
The shine box.

20
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:38,040
I've been out.

21
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:38,540
Issue.

22
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:38,880
Yeah.

23
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:39,660
The shine.

24
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,200
Go get your fucking shine box.

25
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:41,660
Exactly.

26
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,680
I told that to people.

27
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,420
And I was wondering if they saw Goodfellas

28
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,100
and half the people that I've told that

29
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,880
to did not see Goodfellas.

30
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:49,940
So I had more effect.

31
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:50,460
Really?

32
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,500
And actually, if you saw Goodfellas, it would

33
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,620
have even more effect.

34
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,120
I would think so.

35
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,000
I don't know.

36
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:56,700
Look, you know what?

37
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:57,360
I remember.

38
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,600
Interesting when people get the references and when

39
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,100
they don't.

40
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:00,400
Right.

41
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,840
Which, by the way, I want to let

42
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,900
you know, so I just want to let

43
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,320
you know really quickly, there's a lot of

44
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,120
thank yous for apparently they had sort of

45
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,200
eureka moments about certain things that we worked

46
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,420
toward in the past couple of Sonic.

47
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,660
So I just want to let you know.

48
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,780
And I was asked specifically to make sure

49
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,640
that you were thanked on behalf of a

50
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,600
bunch of subscribers, that they had gotten something

51
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,200
really interesting out of the past couple.

52
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,180
They didn't describe it to me, but they

53
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,700
wanted to know, wanted you to know that

54
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,720
they were really felt awakened in the past

55
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,440
couple of Sonics.

56
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,900
So, you know, take or leave as you

57
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,160
wish.

58
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:34,780
Anyways.

59
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,880
Well, like I like I like reciprocation.

60
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,900
So I'm into Kratom, Bolly Green.

61
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm into really good.

62
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,760
I get only organic coffee, organic cigarettes, American

63
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,260
spirit.

64
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:50,020
I got about a six to seven hundred

65
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:54,700
dollar a month cigarette Kratom coffee budget.

66
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,740
And that's why I'm doing these Sonics.

67
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,500
It doesn't cover that, by the way.

68
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,560
So it kind of lets you in on

69
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,600
how well we're doing.

70
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,600
We're not, you know, rolling in dough here.

71
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,340
But I'd like to cover the the coffee,

72
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,280
cigarette, whatever.

73
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,760
And I mean, I don't know how much

74
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,760
the semi-athletic Latin call girl goes for

75
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,240
these days.

76
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,240
I hear it's pretty high.

77
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,180
That's another that's another request.

78
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,360
So anyway, I haven't been in the market

79
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,620
for that in a while.

80
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,300
So I don't know.

81
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:24,540
Yeah.

82
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,900
I'm going to bring up just a little

83
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,220
bit.

84
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,520
Sure.

85
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,520
Hey, listen.

86
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,620
I never have.

87
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,000
I'll tell you a quick story.

88
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:31,520
OK.

89
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:31,940
Back.

90
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:33,840
Good.

91
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:34,600
OK.

92
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,820
Well, what I was going to tell you

93
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,060
is I say, hey, listen, go ahead.

94
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:37,560
Good.

95
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:37,800
Shoot.

96
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,440
I got you.

97
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,600
There's a little delay, I guess.

98
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,080
I'm sorry.

99
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,560
Waiting for the resurrection of the dead.

100
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,180
That seriously touched my spirit.

101
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,720
That was one of the comments.

102
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,660
But I want to get to another interesting

103
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:47,940
thing.

104
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,440
Somebody asked about collaboration when it came to

105
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,900
teaching young people because they already do that

106
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,920
and they would like to do it because

107
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,460
you mentioned something about going to the West

108
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,300
a bit and possibly getting into that.

109
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,140
Now, they may have the resources to bring

110
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,280
you some of those young people.

111
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,340
I don't know.

112
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,700
But how should they get in touch with

113
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,780
you if that sounds?

114
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,400
That sounds really weird.

115
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,000
And by the way, just think about that.

116
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,280
Bring you some young people.

117
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,040
That sounds weird.

118
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,000
I would rephrase that.

119
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:15,780
But that's OK.

120
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,660
Fair enough.

121
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,020
Young people mean 70 and younger.

122
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,540
OK, let's classify.

123
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,260
Sure.

124
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,820
But no, that's fine.

125
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,240
Look, I'm pretty good at advertising amongst the

126
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,640
those who need to know.

127
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,500
Like we've gotten pretty good shows on the

128
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,020
show.

129
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,600
Let's see people showing up for the webinars

130
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,380
on the weather and whatever else we did.

131
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,540
Scalarator word will get out.

132
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:44,320
We're going to have music, food, talk, powwows,

133
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:50,480
stuff like that, because, look, I don't know.

134
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,960
I don't know where young people are getting

135
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,780
their information from, but they're getting crap.

136
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,640
Where are they going to get it from

137
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,460
their parents, their co-workers, their professors?

138
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,260
Oh, come on.

139
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,800
Give me a break just to show them

140
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,200
how to search and see what's right and

141
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,480
basically learn how to read.

142
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:05,680
Yeah.

143
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,040
And that's let me just tell you, there's

144
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,400
a story.

145
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,220
I'll skip the story for another time has

146
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,120
to do with call girls.

147
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,180
The other thing I want to mention, I've

148
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,800
been out in the world, I'm getting like

149
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,579
right now I'm putting the cases together.

150
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,300
I mean, it has to look really and

151
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,079
feel luxury.

152
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:23,480
That's why when I offer the finished product

153
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,280
to someone, tell me how you feel about

154
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:25,420
it.

155
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,440
Then tell me what you think.

156
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,820
And right, because it's the feel.

157
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,600
So I'm going through all these processes, actually

158
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,820
spiritual processes.

159
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,960
You know, when you water clean stuff spiritually,

160
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:36,360
right?

161
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,900
So I'm actually everything that I'm doing gets

162
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,560
washed several times, even when the interior of

163
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,200
the case put together, which leads me to

164
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,460
this requires a lot of acquisition of materials

165
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:46,860
and stuff.

166
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,260
So I've been going around town, different places,

167
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,800
and they know me for coming in there.

168
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,820
They're like, oh, this guy's here.

169
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,000
He's got you listen to him.

170
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:53,660
And I'm like, OK.

171
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,440
But I hear the response back from people

172
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,580
all walks of life.

173
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,200
You know, people say about hope for society,

174
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,940
make the world a better place, all that

175
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,220
stuff.

176
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,780
It's a done deal, folks.

177
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,880
Let me just say it.

178
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,200
I can say it in three or four

179
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,020
different languages.

180
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:09,980
Let me say it again in English.

181
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,240
Where you're going as a society is a

182
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:13,760
done deal.

183
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,420
There's no hope about it.

184
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,800
There's no let's change it.

185
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,440
Let's make it better.

186
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,720
It's a done deal.

187
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,480
It's fucked.

188
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,640
You guys, meaning the society at large, is

189
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,200
fucked and you don't know it and you

190
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,780
don't care.

191
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,540
Right.

192
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,860
And you're just going to keep going the

193
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,440
way it is.

194
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,780
And this has been going on for a

195
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,120
long time, but it's a done deal.

196
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,160
I just want to say that.

197
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,660
In other words, nobody's changing.

198
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,320
Nobody's doing anything.

199
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,240
There's a there are fortunately have been around

200
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,680
the exceptions, right?

201
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,680
The subs and other people.

202
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,840
But at large, you know, like I said,

203
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,440
broad sweep through town, various suppliers, various walks

204
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,800
of life and even running into, you know,

205
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,020
what you call your professionals.

206
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,040
It's a done deal.

207
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,100
We're talking dumb as dirt and anything that

208
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,340
goes, anything that they put on you, meaning

209
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,160
your controllers, you're going to take it standing

210
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,460
up, sitting down, however.

211
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,900
And there's no going to be very little

212
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,460
blowback.

213
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,820
The blowback is marginalized very quickly.

214
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,220
What's coming is coming.

215
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,700
And as far as I can say, it's

216
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,380
well deserved because remember, we live in a

217
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,300
voluntary world.

218
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,720
So this is not a grim message, but

219
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,640
you always got to do what you know

220
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,520
needs to be done.

221
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,220
And to finish off with this, what I'm

222
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,000
doing is a catch me if you can.

223
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,760
He's having lunch with his dad.

224
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,260
The two mice fall in a bucket of

225
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:34,520
cream.

226
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,200
One decides to drown and the other one

227
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:42,140
got so was so dominant or so persevering

228
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:42,820
on getting out.

229
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,580
He churned that cream into butter and walked

230
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,400
right out of the bucket.

231
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:46,800
Right.

232
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:47,560
Right.

233
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,960
So but there's still mice.

234
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:49,380
Right.

235
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,520
And they say it's a rat race.

236
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,280
I'm not in a rat race.

237
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,020
I'm not a rat.

238
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,340
Right.

239
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,800
But anyway, you got to put the work

240
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,020
where the work needs to be done.

241
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,740
Like Gorgeous said, it's called a lot of

242
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,000
people have called it the work.

243
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,360
So I'm going to keep doing the work.

244
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,620
And yeah.

245
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,500
So anyway, that's cool.

246
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,540
The resurrection of the dead.

247
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,920
What was the other thing you said?

248
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,000
Well, I had another thing lined up and

249
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,800
it is Greek said plants are in a

250
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,620
dream state and chickens parentheses animals in an

251
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,360
envy state.

252
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,520
So does eating animals make you take on

253
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,080
those attributes, focusing on plants would lead to

254
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,980
more dreamlike existence and possible interacting other dreamlike

255
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,640
realities?

256
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,060
That's the way they wrote the question.

257
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,940
But I get the point of it.

258
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,420
You do, too.

259
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:32,820
I'm sure.

260
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,200
Well, think of it.

261
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,780
You know how water takes the shape of

262
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,400
its container.

263
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,520
These other energies are going to take your

264
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:39,920
shape.

265
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,600
So how compatible are they?

266
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,320
You're not going to turn into a plant.

267
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,620
You're not going to turn into a chicken.

268
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:49,320
And those attributes, attributes from those various inputs

269
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,320
that you have will not change you because

270
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,880
we talked about predominant energies, your physical body

271
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,440
and the way it functions is a predominant.

272
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,780
It will affect that.

273
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,060
Sure.

274
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,020
Like, for example, it's very well known that

275
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,400
meat eaters and people that are vegetarian have

276
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,960
are very different in many cases in their

277
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,660
demeanor and their quality of fitness on and

278
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,780
on ability to recover.

279
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,620
It's very, very well known.

280
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,040
Whether it's discussed or documented is irrelevant.

281
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,240
You can experiment on yourself.

282
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,740
But does it mean, you know, if one

283
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,540
eats just the carnivore, you know, one of

284
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,720
these vegetable, they're going to turn into either

285
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,000
one?

286
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:26,200
No.

287
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,160
But is there an influence?

288
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:27,720
Yes.

289
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,140
Just like drinking really good water versus just

290
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,039
straight tap water.

291
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:31,720
Is there an influence?

292
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:32,240
Yes.

293
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,580
Is it subtle?

294
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,020
Yes.

295
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,679
If you add up enough subtle things, do

296
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,860
they become something major?

297
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:38,320
Yes.

298
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:39,960
Well, for sure.

299
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,700
And look, even when people look at things

300
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,560
like the consumption of alcohol, right.

301
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,260
And somebody who drinks constantly and drinks like,

302
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,700
you know, rotgut crap, boy, you can tell

303
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,420
that person when they walk in a room

304
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,520
versus somebody who actually partakes of, you know,

305
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,200
a bit of fine liquor every now and

306
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,080
then drinks.

307
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,020
You know what I'm saying?

308
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,840
Like, I remember the hanging out with the

309
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,220
crowds up on the Upper East Side.

310
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,700
They drank the best liquor and they were

311
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,100
alcoholic.

312
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:05,840
You couldn't read.

313
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,300
They didn't look like a typically an alcoholic

314
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,340
you'd expect to look.

315
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:09,740
Right.

316
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:10,720
Right.

317
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,460
But even the people that decide to consume

318
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,200
a little bit, it becomes different.

319
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,440
You see, so the pace and the quality,

320
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,240
these are two different aspects of what can

321
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,400
affect the outcome.

322
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,300
And I think food and all of it,

323
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,480
it's all relative.

324
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:23,880
Right.

325
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,700
I mean, in this way.

326
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,340
Qualitative.

327
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,160
Qualitative.

328
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:26,700
There you go.

329
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,240
Quality.

330
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:27,680
Everything.

331
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,340
They don't deal with quality.

332
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,160
Everything's quantity.

333
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,480
You know, like when you look at the

334
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,160
nutritional information or when they talk about color,

335
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,600
there's no such thing as color.

336
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,180
It's photons hitting your eye and all this

337
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:39,520
stuff.

338
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,460
Yeah.

339
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:41,560
Yeah.

340
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,100
There's a reason for it, though.

341
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,740
And we've talked about it.

342
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,120
This is not a good place.

343
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,260
Is it a bad place?

344
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,920
Well, that's speculative and open for suggestion and

345
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,460
subjective.

346
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,740
But is it a good place?

347
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,860
Absolutely not.

348
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,880
You mean in this entire existence here?

349
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,620
It's not good, but it doesn't necessarily mean

350
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,400
it's bad.

351
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,180
The best you're going to get is not

352
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,160
good.

353
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,720
You know what I mean?

354
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:08,320
Right.

355
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,980
That's the best this place could be, is

356
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,600
not good.

357
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,520
And down from not good would be what?

358
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,540
Is not good less than fair?

359
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:15,740
Yeah.

360
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,620
I'd say so.

361
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:16,820
Yeah.

362
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,380
I would say so.

363
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:17,740
Yeah.

364
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:18,940
Yeah.

365
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,720
So then you go, not good, bad, very

366
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,540
bad, nightmarish, hellish.

367
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:22,980
Right.

368
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,440
Those are the levels that you exist in

369
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:24,660
here.

370
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,060
Right.

371
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,320
And then some of the things that we're

372
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,860
dealing with, right, I mean, like I was

373
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,740
reading this whole study on how like, you

374
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,400
know, if a man has like more testosterone

375
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,500
in his system, he's more likely to select

376
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,120
red things, you know, stuff like that.

377
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,600
And I'm going, does that apply to food?

378
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,140
And yeah, it does.

379
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,980
And that's why they put red food coloring

380
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,960
in a lot of things.

381
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,280
And I'm looking at it going, oh, well,

382
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,160
that's just brutally obvious.

383
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:47,600
But yeah.

384
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,340
But, you know, but at the same time,

385
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,040
red is a dangerous thing, because in nature,

386
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,220
things that have red on them usually are

387
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,020
problematic for us.

388
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,520
You know, walking upright, you know, can be

389
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,400
cultural also.

390
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,000
Like we look at red as alert and

391
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,200
green is as go and in Asia, it's

392
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:08,780
the opposite.

393
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,300
Green is alert and red is go.

394
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,160
Doesn't mean the traffic, you know, they have

395
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,700
all adopted similar, you know, no matter where

396
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,600
you go in the world, a red octagon,

397
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,020
all right, red octagon means stop, regardless of

398
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,020
what language.

399
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:24,640
Right.

400
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,940
So there's universal, I call it image training.

401
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,480
That's why I like the doctor who so

402
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,880
much with the psychic papers, you know, is

403
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,460
if someone walks up to you, commands you

404
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,500
and flips open a wallet and closes it,

405
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,000
you see a shiny piece of metal in

406
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,700
there, you intuitively based on all the cultures

407
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,000
in the world, stop and obey them.

408
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,880
You know, so you can literally mess around

409
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,920
with people who just get a badge on

410
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,380
a wall, flip it open, flip it closed.

411
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:52,700
Right.

412
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,020
And they say, oh, he's an authority.

413
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:55,440
Right.

414
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,000
I've seen people get away with that with

415
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,900
the appeal to authority, which is based on

416
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,940
a flip of just a piece of metal,

417
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,960
you know, in a wallet.

418
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,280
And it's not even in particular in its

419
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,020
like aspects.

420
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,620
It just generally resembles a badge.

421
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,940
Therefore, they begin to submit.

422
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:13,600
I mean, yeah.

423
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,440
And back back east, like Brooklyn, Bronx, New

424
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,160
Haven, Connecticut, was it Oceanside, New Jersey?

425
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,060
Is there an ocean side?

426
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:22,740
There is.

427
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,660
I think so.

428
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,020
Or.

429
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:24,600
Yeah.

430
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:24,880
OK.

431
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,960
These are places where I know not firsthand,

432
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,240
but pretty close people that work like civil

433
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,520
service jobs, bus drivers, whatever.

434
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:33,880
And they were bored.

435
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,580
So they went out and bought a Crown

436
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,840
Vic black with one of those lights that

437
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,380
the police have searchlight on it, the wheels

438
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,260
that make it look like police tires and

439
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:43,600
blue.

440
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,160
And just for shits and giggles, like they

441
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,020
say, they would pull over people with flashing

442
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:51,000
lights and impersonate a detective and people would

443
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,760
follow through and they would just do that

444
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,480
for their own thrill.

445
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,860
The reason I mentioned those places is because

446
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,600
I know people who were doing that in

447
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,160
those areas that got caught for impersonating an

448
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,280
officer, you know, right.

449
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,100
So because they got a high, they got,

450
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,040
you know, for domination or whatever.

451
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,400
So yeah.

452
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:08,960
Yeah.

453
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,520
By the way, for in terms of domination,

454
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,560
actually, I won't mention a name.

455
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,260
I think I told the story once the

456
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,040
psychiatrist and the psychologist that I've known, I've

457
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:18,540
dated them.

458
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,600
And I think I mentioned they're they're the

459
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,460
nuttiest people, by the way, and I've dealt

460
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,260
with one recently.

461
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:27,200
I actually canceled a scalerator.

462
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,660
I refused to sell to them because they're

463
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,160
too crazy.

464
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,460
They're actually a famous YouTuber.

465
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,080
You could piece that together.

466
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,940
But one of them, I remember with one

467
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,440
and actually two separate ones kept coming, says,

468
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,500
we have a problem at the university, City

469
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,320
University of New York, right at the psychology

470
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,020
department.

471
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,260
All the women used to notice that when

472
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,280
they came back, if their locker changed their

473
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,280
shoes, there was this gooey, sticky substance in

474
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:55,800
their shoes.

475
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,060
And but that's not the end of it.

476
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,800
We found out that they put a camera

477
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,240
in there.

478
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,720
And one of the other psychology professors was

479
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,200
ejaculating in women's shoes and they busted him.

480
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:06,460
Right.

481
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,040
Yeah.

482
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,880
The other one who was a psychiatrist with

483
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,500
the drugs, we went out for a nice

484
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,740
dinner movie kind of thing.

485
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,480
And she ordered the cab to go down

486
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,900
to the meat district, a lower west side.

487
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,500
And there's a building kind of funked up,

488
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,040
funky black steel door.

489
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,620
And you walk in, there's a smell like

490
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,060
a lot of strong body odors.

491
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,460
It was an S&M club and you

492
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:33,020
could see people's leathered up, whatever, going from

493
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:33,920
room to room.

494
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,420
And it was like a club that had

495
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,860
the red velvet and all that.

496
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,160
And I'm like, what are we doing here?

497
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,120
She goes, you'll find out.

498
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,200
And I said, I'm going to the bathroom.

499
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,240
And I went around and left and never,

500
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,940
never made contact with her again.

501
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,200
She was into S&M, right?

502
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:46,780
Yeah.

503
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:50,160
So what I'm trying to say is these

504
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,020
people, the shoemakers' children have no shoes is

505
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:55,700
right on.

506
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,760
But not with, here's the thing, not with

507
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,420
the shoemakers.

508
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,580
I bet all the shoemakers' children have great

509
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:01,840
shoes.

510
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,700
But with the lawyers, they're screwed up illegally.

511
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,480
The doctors are screwed up with fitness, health

512
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,040
and all that.

513
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,800
With very little exception, the psychologists are all

514
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,200
crazy.

515
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,540
So it depends on what level, right?

516
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,200
Again, are there any of those professions that

517
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,180
I mentioned good?

518
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:19,980
Absolutely not.

519
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:20,780
Are they bad?

520
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,940
Take it.

521
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,640
It's up to you to decide how bad

522
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,000
you want to take it.

523
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,880
But anyway, let's go back to the thing

524
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,860
about the, I mentioned the Doctor Who.

525
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,260
These are all authorities.

526
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,620
I'm not anti-authority.

527
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,860
It's just that we've been hijacked, right?

528
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,700
And it's the norm.

529
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,420
But the Doctor Who, the psychological papers or

530
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,360
psychic papers was just a blank piece of

531
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,080
paper and whoever he flashed it to, anywhere

532
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,180
they were from, they saw it as an

533
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,300
authority figure, right?

534
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:52,500
So once you understand that, you can follow

535
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,980
suit with whatever you're doing.

536
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,500
I mean, that's what, how many times have

537
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,980
you heard of a story of an old

538
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,420
man that looks semi-homeless going to a

539
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:07,260
high-end jewelry store, orders up a $50

540
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,500
,000 necklace, he's got cash in a brown

541
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,080
paper bag, and they're all making fun of

542
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,060
him, even with the cash.

543
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,160
Then the next day he comes back in

544
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,520
a $3,000 suit out of a Rolls

545
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,320
Royce, and he tells the people, hey, that

546
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,740
was me yesterday, I just, I'll keep buying

547
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,280
jewelry from you as long as you promise

548
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,680
me you treat everyone with equal dignity, right?

549
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,220
Those kinds of tests.

550
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,440
So there's no reason for that.

551
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,440
But that doesn't, I mean, where's the standard,

552
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:35,880
right?

553
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,820
I know you don't watch video shorts much,

554
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,500
but there's a modern version of it now

555
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,680
where a guy goes around and acts like

556
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,880
he's deaf and signals, I need something to

557
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,340
eat, can I have some money, and the

558
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,300
people that are mean to him and mock

559
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,920
him and swing their hands at him and

560
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,000
stuff like that, he walks away, and he

561
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,780
goes over to somebody else, and the person

562
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,740
that gives him the money, he takes it,

563
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,480
he starts to walk away, he turns back,

564
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,000
and then hands him back the money, and

565
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,140
then hands him a pile of money.

566
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,980
And this is like- Right, as a

567
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,339
reward.

568
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,740
Yeah, it's a common short.

569
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,800
And then the other person that just waved

570
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,420
him off is usually close by, and they're

571
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,380
like, oh, can I have some?

572
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,280
And he's like, yeah, no.

573
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,960
Yeah, yeah, it's like a public demonstration.

574
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,140
Right, right.

575
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,460
It's actually a very popular YouTube short now,

576
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,060
or whatever, TikTok, whatever the video shorts are,

577
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,079
it's all over the place now.

578
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:22,720
Yeah.

579
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,079
Well, this is very Daoist also.

580
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,680
In other words, when you have irony like

581
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,320
that, it's very much in the Daoist economy.

582
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,560
When you read Daoist stuff, there's a lot

583
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,640
of irony in there.

584
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,200
No, and Aesop's Fables remind me of that,

585
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,100
too, some of them, the deeper ones, because

586
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,280
- Ironic and cautionary.

587
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,480
Cautionary.

588
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,340
Ironic and cautionary.

589
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:46,320
Yeah.

590
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,760
Anyways, here's another one.

591
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,840
I live in a state that has the

592
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,440
softest water in the country.

593
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,140
He says, I'll post some pictures of interest

594
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,540
for my four-year-old hot water cylinder,

595
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,620
which has, let's see, whatever, oh, stalagmites growing

596
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,760
on the fittings, rust stains coming out the

597
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,000
top and down the sides, and severely restricted

598
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,520
flow.

599
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:15,000
And then a response- So you started

600
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,060
off by saying it's soft water, it's very

601
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,420
mild water?

602
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:18,920
Yeah.

603
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:20,680
Okay.

604
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,800
That's possible.

605
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,180
That's angry water.

606
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,500
That's the water getting angry, running through pipes,

607
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:25,720
yeah.

608
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,720
Yeah, and he also states, just because the

609
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,860
local water authority provides figures and data about

610
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,740
the quality of the water does not make

611
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,160
it true.

612
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,000
So it's a bit of a mixed thing

613
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,100
he's saying here, where to me it's like,

614
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,020
yeah, you definitely got some angry water there,

615
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,080
but man, I've seen some very corrosive kind

616
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,260
of stuff happen with supposedly clean water, and

617
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,020
there you go.

618
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,220
Yeah.

619
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,140
I know the suburbs around Atlanta, Georgia have

620
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:55,060
basically rainwater, like 30 or 40 TDS.

621
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,180
If you were to try to collect rainwater

622
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,620
in a clean pot and measure it with

623
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,140
a TDS meter, it would be up to

624
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:01,940
20 or 30.

625
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,560
So what I do, for example, with the

626
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,840
device, if you don't have hard water, you're

627
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,360
low on the list, even though you'll get

628
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,920
one, but we've also discovered the device creates

629
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,620
healing water.

630
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,740
So you know how people used to travel

631
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,800
to springs and spas for therapeutic purposes?

632
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,200
You can make tap water therapeutic with this.

633
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,940
But I don't want to make those kinds

634
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,640
of claims, right?

635
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,420
That's much later.

636
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,060
That would be another direction to go in.

637
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:27,660
But yeah.

638
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:28,920
Right.

639
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,740
But anyway, is that person, is he just

640
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:34,500
wondering why the unsightly plumbing, or is he

641
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,060
having an issue with the water quality?

642
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,220
Oh, no, I just read it there as,

643
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,120
like, I'll send you the pictures of, I

644
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,620
just read what he said, which is that,

645
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,260
you know, it says that he has this

646
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,280
kind of water and they say it's soft,

647
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,760
but that's what happens.

648
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,540
And meanwhile, soft water, right?

649
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,740
Don't trust the authorities.

650
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,580
That's what happens.

651
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,480
Water is trying to break out of a

652
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,320
cage is one of the alien second one

653
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,560
where they capture the alien.

654
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,640
And it's like, really, they think they got

655
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,380
it contained and the thing is almost strong

656
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,100
enough to break out of the steel box

657
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,620
that it's in or titanium or whatever.

658
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,020
Right.

659
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,040
You want to leave the room.

660
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:11,680
So yeah, water will do that if it

661
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,360
can't break out the water, the optimum container

662
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:15,900
of water.

663
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,380
When in motion, when in motion is look

664
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,020
in the mirror, look at the capillaries around

665
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,580
your eyes or the roots of a tree

666
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,480
or a lightning bolt, you know, that Lichtenberg

667
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,340
configuration.

668
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,480
That's the optimum movement for water when it's

669
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,100
at moderate speeds, at super high speeds, it's

670
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:32,740
slightly different.

671
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,540
At very low speeds, it's slightly different.

672
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,920
The optimum container for water when it's still

673
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,340
is ovoid, not elliptical, but ovoid.

674
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,340
So those two rules are very simple to

675
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:43,740
apply.

676
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,160
And the biggest enemy to water quality, immediate

677
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,340
enemy is light, light and heat, and then

678
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,500
air in that order.

679
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,240
Yeah.

680
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,520
That's why all the water that most people

681
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,640
buy or most of the water that most

682
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,800
people buy is in clear containers subject to

683
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,040
light.

684
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:00,320
Yeah.

685
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:00,840
Go figure.

686
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:01,480
Right.

687
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,040
Not good.

688
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,480
All of that you covered years ago on

689
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,780
that special episode, which we have reposted for

690
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,440
you subscribers here on the Patreon at the

691
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,620
Greek's request, it's there.

692
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,620
So it's that special water episode, just so

693
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,220
you guys know.

694
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,220
Also by the way- Yeah, it's offered.

695
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,160
Yeah, go ahead.

696
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,000
No, it's still offered.

697
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:18,240
Yeah?

698
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:18,620
Yeah.

699
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,460
No, you're still offering it on the Patreon.

700
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,980
I'm putting it on the Patreon for them.

701
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,960
And also I put up some more of

702
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,680
the weather work as you requested that I

703
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:26,980
had.

704
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,560
I had the second seminar, two hours, so

705
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,640
I put that out as well.

706
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,100
And trying to give the subscribers- And

707
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:33,760
there's a third one.

708
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,340
Oh, I don't- I think there's a

709
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,080
third one also.

710
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,420
I don't think I have the third one.

711
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:40,420
I ask Master Bruce would let you know.

712
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,320
Ah, okay.

713
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,340
I will check with him because I don't

714
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,080
have the third one.

715
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,260
But I do have the first two and

716
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,280
they're up there for you guys.

717
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:46,720
Okay, that's fine.

718
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,220
Yeah.

719
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,340
And- That's fine.

720
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,500
It's such a thing as too much information.

721
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,340
Even putting one out a month is fine

722
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,040
because it takes a while to digest.

723
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,320
But if you have a sense of urgency

724
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,820
that you got to get some weather work

725
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,100
done, it's good to have all of them

726
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:00,280
available.

727
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,280
So anyway.

728
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:02,840
Absolutely.

729
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,940
Hey, I just wanted to let you know

730
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,760
one other thing is that people did start

731
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,900
discussing the cabbage.

732
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:10,620
They finally got the steak cabbage and a

733
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,580
few other recipes.

734
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,420
Cabbage roast.

735
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,280
Cabbage roast.

736
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:13,600
Sorry.

737
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,320
What was the steak?

738
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,100
What was that?

739
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,580
What was the- Broccoli steak.

740
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,340
Broccoli steak.

741
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,500
Okay, I got it mixed up.

742
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:19,980
Yeah, go ahead.

743
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,140
Yeah.

744
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,920
And the names have nothing to do with

745
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,540
how it looks or trying to look like

746
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,200
roast or steak.

747
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,640
It's just the feeling that you get.

748
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,380
When you feel like a roast, do the

749
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:30,700
cabbage.

750
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,040
When you feel like a steak, do the

751
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,420
broccoli.

752
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:33,800
There you go.

753
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:34,720
And- It's just feeling.

754
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:35,280
Yeah.

755
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,260
And they're sharing this back and forth now.

756
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,060
They're trying it.

757
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,640
And I'm just letting you know that people

758
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,660
are going back in the old Sonics and

759
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,540
going and doing some of that stuff as

760
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:43,780
well.

761
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,500
So by the time- Yeah.

762
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,320
It's all method.

763
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,660
It's all method.

764
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,220
Just because you've had cabbage doesn't mean you've

765
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,080
had it done this way.

766
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,920
The method, it's the method that changes.

767
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,820
Like I've said, if you cut carrots three

768
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,560
different ways, you're going to get three different

769
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,700
flavored carrots, depending on the cut, you know?

770
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,540
So exactly.
