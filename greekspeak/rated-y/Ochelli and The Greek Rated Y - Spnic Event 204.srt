1
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:11,740
Alright, Rated Y, Sonic Event 204, and we're

2
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,060
on the Jitsi again, but I don't know,

3
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,200
it was a little bit of a hot

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,080
noise to start with, and hopefully it's in

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,840
good shape now, I think we're good, Sonic

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,700
should sound good.

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,340
Anyway, how you doing, Greek?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,860
Hey, pretty good.

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,600
Well, you know, on my end, this is

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,840
internally, you sound like one of those morning

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,800
shows where they have an echo, real loud,

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,380
but it's fine.

13
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,560
If you did the test and the recording

14
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,900
sounds acceptable, check it out, yeah.

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,960
Yeah, remember the morning shows in Asia, oh

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,560
baby, I'll tell you, that's the one that

17
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,040
took up TV last night, it was really

18
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:40,280
good.

19
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,820
And the more you speak, the more the

20
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:43,940
echo is, so I hope I can hear

21
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,040
what you're saying, but let's start off with

22
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,240
some questions if you got any.

23
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,000
I actually do.

24
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,540
Let's get to those, because that's usually the

25
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,100
most important thing, to get things kicked off.

26
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,880
Anyway, this one I barely understood, but let's

27
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,620
deal with it anyway.

28
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,140
In the code of Hammurabi, every punishment seems

29
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,220
to deal with death.

30
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,820
Greek mentioned that on Earth it builds up

31
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:09,320
a karmic tension for each death, so would

32
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,060
the code basically cease that karmic bond if

33
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,760
everyone just followed it and wasn't punished?

34
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,400
Or would that code be placed knowing humans

35
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,400
would break it and build up the karmic

36
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,000
death cycle?

37
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:23,140
Both.

38
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,620
Both, if you can say it that way.

39
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,740
The thing is, there's laws, and if there's

40
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,220
a, let's say, this is just how it

41
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:37,360
goes, everyone's got personal quote-unquote feelings and

42
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,160
ideas about it.

43
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,020
When something is a death offense, it should

44
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,760
be carried out, and when it's not, it's

45
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,560
actually worse sometimes, like when someone murders and

46
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,480
they're not doing it deliberately, right?

47
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,800
Yeah, it also goes down, they should be

48
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,860
put to death if they murder deliberately.

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,560
But then there's a fun aspect there, you

50
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,760
go to war and shoot 100 people and

51
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,820
you're given a medal, right?

52
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,720
So there's no natural aspect, it's 100%

53
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,680
spiritual based on law, and your law comes

54
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,300
from your god.

55
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,020
Right, and even within the text of what

56
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,560
I've understood, right, I gotta throw this in,

57
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,940
there is the possibility that you could commit

58
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,160
a killing that is not a murder, and

59
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,160
murder is a crime.

60
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,820
Yeah, by accident.

61
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,220
Well, not necessarily by accident, like even if

62
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,520
it is intentional, defending oneself is okay, right?

63
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,480
Yeah, that's right.

64
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,400
I mean, the idea, or defending others, even,

65
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,660
defending your home, defending weaker people.

66
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,620
Yes, it's intense.

67
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,440
Look, even if you say you killed someone

68
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,120
in self-defense, if there's evidence or witnesses

69
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,160
that you had malice towards them before, it

70
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,720
could become first degree, let's say.

71
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,080
Okay, but if it just so happens, you

72
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,640
know, a stranger happens upon you and is

73
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,160
violent, you put him down.

74
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,560
Yeah, self-defense is adequate, yeah.

75
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,780
But there's also more to it, like the

76
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,620
karmic side, you know, I'm using that word

77
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,460
loosely, the way people understand it, because when

78
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,540
you read, you know, let's say the ancient

79
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,200
writs about karma, it's very extensive, it's not

80
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,200
just what people think.

81
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,880
No, it's not a simple action and reaction,

82
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,100
it's not just that.

83
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,100
No, it's not.

84
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,440
But putting people in prison, for example, for

85
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,740
stealing is unlawful.

86
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,480
When you steal, there's no prison or jail,

87
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,940
what you do is you have to pay

88
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,700
back twice, let's say, what you stole, the

89
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,340
value, and if you don't have the money

90
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,720
to do that, or the value to do

91
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,960
that, you have to work it off, so

92
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,180
you literally become that person's servant until it's

93
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:27,800
worked off.

94
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,160
So it's not just murder, and when it

95
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,560
comes to law and the karmic side, the

96
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,120
spiritual side on how the earth reacts, it's

97
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,900
any mal-act that's not done according to

98
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,180
law.

99
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,620
So you know, like I always say that,

100
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,180
first of all, no one is in jail

101
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,740
or prison lawfully, or even legally, and having

102
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,920
people the way they do it, it's all

103
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,520
unlawful, because it's all commercial.

104
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,480
But if you look at the Code of

105
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,380
Hammurabi and other stuff, it's all commercial too,

106
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,660
like if someone builds a house, and it

107
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,220
falls on the owner's son, and he dies,

108
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,360
and we have to kill the son of

109
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,800
the builder, so it's commercial again.

110
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,940
These kinds of laws and things are for

111
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,600
nation-building, I've always talked about this.

112
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,920
When you read a lot of ancient writs,

113
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,680
it's for nation-building, kind of like the

114
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,680
Constitution of the U.S., or the Constitution

115
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,900
of a country, you got a new country,

116
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,900
okay, you got your post office set up,

117
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,920
okay, well, where's your Constitution, or when you

118
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,320
start a company, where's your charter, what are

119
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,440
you setting out to do?

120
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,340
Most of these laws, really, initially, were setting

121
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,700
up a new entity, if you could call

122
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,660
it that, and it had the rules for

123
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,220
that entity.

124
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,460
So right now, what's going on, mostly, is

125
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,820
adjustment of laws, or getting away from them.

126
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,140
It's good you brought that up, because I

127
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:57,400
was listening to Jonah Bay's recent audio, I'm

128
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,620
really enjoying Jonah Bay, I'm almost at the

129
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,780
point where I can endorse him, he's that

130
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,760
good, believe it or not.

131
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,040
Which one is Jonah Bay, is that the

132
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,780
guy who's telling you the West is poisoned,

133
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,840
or is that the other one?

134
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,260
No, no, that's Middle Nation, that's another guy.

135
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,220
I wouldn't endorse him, because I think he's

136
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,320
putting too much cultural pressure on people.

137
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,240
Just to switch over, that guy at Middle

138
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,740
Nation, Saeed, I think his name is, I

139
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,540
recently found out he was in prison for

140
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,920
murder during the Egyptian rebellion, or the Arab

141
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,760
Spring, and he was released for some reason,

142
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,840
and some people like him, some people don't.

143
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,920
I'm just saying his commentary, because it's culture,

144
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,100
is valid, mostly.

145
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,160
But with Jonah Bay, he brought up a

146
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,700
court case, United States versus Johnson, 1947, where

147
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,940
the essence is, the only rights you have

148
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,380
are the ones you can defend, and this

149
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,200
case was specifically about being a belligerent defendant.

150
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,820
So when you go to these courts, which

151
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,740
are, they're not courts, they're like Article One

152
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,480
courts, they have no power in law or

153
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,060
equity, it's all contract courts.

154
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,680
They give you charges, anything you say can

155
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,780
and will be used against you.

156
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,080
The idea of being a belligerent defendant is,

157
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,220
you go in there and you cuss them

158
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:06,420
out.

159
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,120
You say, what you're doing is unconstitutional.

160
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,000
If they arrest you, you have habeas corpus,

161
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,040
unrightful imprisonment, all this stuff, until you get

162
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,720
to the Supreme Court, and you just basically

163
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,200
cuss them out, right there.

164
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,200
And I've heard a recording of a young

165
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,580
man, Caleb, he went into court, cussed out

166
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,880
the judge, and she was like, well, the

167
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,040
judge was threatening him, he says, I don't

168
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,340
care what you say, if you're a public

169
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,300
official, you're fired, you know, that kind of

170
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:28,520
stuff.

171
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,980
And if they put you in jail, habeas

172
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,420
corpus, and it's really a quarter of a

173
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,460
million dollars if they jail you unlawfully, but

174
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,420
that's another story.

175
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,560
I kind of like, when you listen to

176
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,120
a lot of the stuff like Batman back

177
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,480
in the days, I know some people might

178
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,100
have never heard of him, but he was

179
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,000
like, don't be belligerent.

180
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,380
Actually, the Supreme Court says, if you're not

181
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,000
belligerent, and you accept anything they say, basically,

182
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,340
now you take liability for it, because by

183
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,160
the way, what they're doing in the current

184
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,420
legal system, the police, the lawyers, attorney generals,

185
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,320
all the courts, except for the Supreme Court,

186
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:02,340
is illegal and unlawful in that venue.

187
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,160
But if you switch it over to commercial,

188
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,160
you're writing contracts, right, it's all commercial.

189
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,440
So it's pretty heinous, it's pretty horrible, what

190
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,080
they're doing.

191
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,880
That's why I say, I can almost say

192
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,100
with little exception, no one is in jail,

193
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,460
well, I can tell you for sure, no

194
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,940
one is in prison legally, or lawfully, I

195
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,640
mean, no one is in prison lawfully.

196
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,020
Some might be there legally, because they agreed

197
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,620
to it, they'd rather be in prison than

198
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,260
doing other things, and that's fine, then it's

199
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,700
not really prison, it's a, what do they

200
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,080
call, what did they call people when they

201
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,680
put them in the Fed, it was club

202
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,760
fed, right?

203
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,480
Voluntarily.

204
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,720
So it's that bad, but no one really,

205
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,500
look, the stuff I've been talking about, I've

206
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,480
been saying for two decades, three decades now,

207
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,500
no one knows what's going on, no one

208
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,460
pretty much knows anything with little exception.

209
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,380
So any subject you approach, even if you

210
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,820
don't know about it, you could say, oh,

211
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,600
let's see how they're running this shit backwards,

212
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:56,980
right?

213
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,660
Let's say there's a new subject we, you

214
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,000
and I, never heard of, and someone brings

215
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,260
it up, I say, I never heard of

216
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,460
this, and we go look into it, and

217
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,780
before I even look into it, I say,

218
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,380
let's see how they're telling us what the

219
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,300
opposite of what it really is, and you'll

220
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,740
be pretty much on point if you do

221
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:11,840
that.

222
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,720
Now, some people might say, oh, that's really

223
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,080
sarcastic or pessimistic, well, look, I didn't make

224
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,920
this shit up, right?

225
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:17,460
Yeah.

226
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:17,700
So.

227
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:18,740
I got you.

228
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,140
Anyway.

229
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,520
Like, for instance, a new business could be,

230
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,500
you know, documents that you print that are

231
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,100
actually, you know, to replace other things that

232
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:26,940
people think they need.

233
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,000
You know what I mean?

234
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,820
Like the guy who turned around and created

235
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,200
that, what is it, the Republic of Contra

236
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,760
or whatever, they're on the tip of Florida.

237
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,159
You ever see that?

238
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:36,620
Oh, you can do that.

239
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,260
Micronations?

240
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:37,600
Yeah.

241
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:37,799
Yeah.

242
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,159
I like Slow Jamistan.

243
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,000
Yeah.

244
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,780
That one, well, there's that, and there's another

245
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,039
one.

246
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,260
That's the DJ.

247
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:42,720
Yeah.

248
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,020
Yeah.

249
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,360
Well, there's one in New Mexico.

250
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:44,520
This is quite a few.

251
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,620
There's about 10 of them.

252
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:46,880
Oh, yeah.

253
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,840
There's one in California, one in Mexico, one

254
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,440
in Florida.

255
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:50,660
Yeah.

256
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,760
There's one in Arizona, too, isn't there?

257
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:51,880
Nevada.

258
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:52,540
Nevada.

259
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,040
Yeah.

260
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:53,400
Okay.

261
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,440
Yeah, yeah.

262
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:54,680
Okay.

263
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:54,980
Yeah.

264
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,780
They don't get much publicity.

265
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,200
I don't think they want it, but they

266
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,860
do button it up according to law, you

267
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,000
know?

268
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,060
Well, that's the thing, is that they actually

269
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,500
usually don't get messed with, and they tell

270
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,540
them, look, as long as you kind of

271
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,720
abide by U.S. laws also, it's fine,

272
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,540
which is weird to me.

273
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,180
Yeah, which is fine to a degree, which

274
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,460
if someone says, you know, you need to

275
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,500
abide by U.S. laws, fine, because when

276
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,120
you read the U.S. laws or definitions,

277
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,300
it's fine.

278
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,060
Yeah.

279
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,760
I'm not a fiction, right?

280
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,460
I'm not this.

281
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:23,840
I'm not...

282
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,220
Yeah, it doesn't...

283
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:25,560
Yeah.

284
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,340
The craziest thing is, well, they say, like,

285
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,960
the United States is in District of Columbia.

286
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,280
It didn't say United States is District of

287
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,120
Columbia, it says it's in District of Columbia,

288
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,460
so you go around District of Columbia, Washington,

289
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,600
D.C., 10-mile square area, three-and

290
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,480
-a-half by three-and-a-half miles,

291
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,620
whatever it is, drive around and keep asking

292
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,060
people, where's the United States?

293
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,120
You'll never find it.

294
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,600
It's in a file cabinet somewhere.

295
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,380
So their laws are totally, totally fine.

296
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,780
All of it, it's all perception, it's a

297
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,220
perception, what do you call it?

298
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,160
Perceived reality.

299
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,160
Perception, what do they call it when people,

300
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,220
consensus reality, which is when you get people...

301
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,600
Yeah, media, the media is very, very important

302
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,980
on...

303
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,580
Forget about any body of knowledge, it's the

304
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,740
media, you know, that really controls it.

305
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,980
Before the media that we have, it was

306
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,260
the church and, you know, stuff like that.

307
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,480
So, yeah, it's pretty bad.

308
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,160
It's pretty bad.

309
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,100
It's like herding cattle.

310
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,260
What I see, and if you've been around

311
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,980
cattle or whatever, like when there's a young

312
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,700
calf, it's not even a year old and

313
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,420
it starts to snow or rain, the calf

314
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,920
freezes, like, what the hell is this?

315
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,100
I've never seen this before.

316
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,580
They have to go out and get it

317
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,600
because it's standing in the muddy field, frozen,

318
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,540
stiff, scared stiff.

319
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,300
The rancher has to go out and bring

320
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,880
it back in because it never saw rain

321
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,520
before, right?

322
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,000
Right.

323
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,420
That's how I see most people, and especially

324
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,280
professionals, when I interact with, quote unquote, doctors,

325
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,880
lawyers, whatever, and bring up anything that they're

326
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,680
supposed to be doing, just ask simple questions.

327
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,300
They kind of freeze up and they're like,

328
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,760
oh my gosh, you know, I never thought

329
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,000
of that.

330
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,700
I mean, God damn, you're working on people

331
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,120
or you're a lawyer, you don't know any

332
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,420
of this.

333
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,260
Oh my gosh.

334
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,600
You know, it's pretty, it's like the calf

335
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,200
that gets, you know, never saw rain before

336
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,760
and it's scared stiff, you know?

337
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,380
It's pretty bad.

338
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,200
I always find it amazing when somebody's called

339
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,880
a doctor, but they really do not know

340
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,780
how to dress a wound properly, you know?

341
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,000
Well, they don't know anything.

342
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:19,480
What the hell are you doing?

343
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,120
Yeah, they're just serving a position.

344
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:21,420
Yeah.

345
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,940
Anyway, one other piece of commentary came in.

346
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,900
I like the casual mention of the coming

347
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,620
global cooling age.

348
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,120
I don't know what that's from anyway, but

349
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,360
he says Florida orange groves will become Florida

350
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,160
apple orchards and no more gators.

351
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,460
What do you think of that?

352
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,100
Well, the thing is, I would, I would

353
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,540
lean heavily on the archaics doctrine and narrative

354
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,420
about the Phoenix coming and going into a

355
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,960
vapor canopy in 2040, the beginning of a

356
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,980
vapor canopy, like all the volcanoes, you know,

357
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,600
one big, large volcano puts out more emissions

358
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,980
than all the cars in the world do

359
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,860
in 10 years, right?

360
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:01,400
So imagine hundreds of volcanoes going off, blocking

361
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,720
out the sun, greenhouse effect, and then ice

362
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,780
forming on that greenhouse on the outside, right?

363
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,120
So you're basically one of those, one of

364
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,700
those Christmas balls that you shake and it

365
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:10,940
snows.

366
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,920
That's what the earth, you know, our environment

367
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,900
will be like a snow globe, purple sky

368
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,720
snow globe.

369
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:15,960
Yeah.

370
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:16,300
Yeah.

371
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,160
Well, I don't buy ice age.

372
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,620
I buy the vapor canopy.

373
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,540
I'll lean on the vapor canopy, which is

374
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,320
neither ice age or heat wave.

375
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,840
And the way I would say that is,

376
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,500
I don't know if anyone's all here listening

377
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,180
old enough.

378
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,740
If you bought a car in the late

379
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:36,280
seventies, the on the speedometer, it accentuated 55.

380
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,760
It had it in orange or had a

381
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,460
circle around it or a square on it

382
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,520
because you're supposed to drive.

383
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,820
And if you find out why they put

384
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,820
drive 55, it's because that was the most

385
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,700
efficient speed for the cars they had then

386
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,620
to use less fuel.

387
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,420
So because we were going into an ice

388
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,040
age, we didn't want to accelerate it.

389
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,920
That was the reasoning.

390
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,140
If you've seen old cars that you might

391
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,960
remember, they see 55 miles an hour, accentuated

392
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,820
on the speedometer.

393
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:00,520
Yeah.

394
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,100
That was because of the coming ice age.

395
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,700
So I think that if you're confused about

396
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,920
this, that means you're you're OK, because you

397
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,980
should just focus on what has the most

398
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,400
evidence.

399
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,800
And believe it or not, the only person

400
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,960
out here or, you know, entity or collective

401
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,300
of information that has the best data set,

402
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,120
as they would say, is Jason Breshears of

403
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,500
Archaic.

404
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,460
He has the best historical data set.

405
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,480
You can't argue with it too much.

406
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,340
You know, the chances of it not happening

407
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,080
the way he's saying it's going to happen

408
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,860
is very slim.

409
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,720
So I would lean on that information.

410
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:36,620
Fair enough.

411
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,520
I also figured that that had to inspire

412
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,920
that Sammy Hagar song, right?

413
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,880
I can't drive 55.

414
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:42,840
Remember that?

415
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:43,860
Yeah.

416
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,560
Well, I wasn't a big Sammy Hagar fan,

417
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,040
but I figured you might have heard it

418
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,880
on the radio or whatever.

419
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,080
So look, I have one last piece of

420
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,880
feedback only, and then I'm done with the

421
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,140
feedback.

422
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,500
But it was kind of long.

423
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,280
And what they said is that they've been

424
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,160
listening for a little while and they decided

425
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,140
they wanted to listen to as much as

426
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,120
they could and go through rated Y.

427
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,100
They had gone through other, you know, permutations

428
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,400
of your sonics before.

429
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,440
And they said, you know, I want to

430
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,820
start applying this stuff, but I'm a little

431
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,360
concerned.

432
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,700
Now, I responded back immediately and said, look,

433
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,060
if I'm you, if you value the people

434
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:20,660
and things around you, don't because how socially

435
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,400
you want to be.

436
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,180
That's the thing, because you're going to immediately

437
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,000
change all that if you really engage with

438
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,020
every single level of this stuff.

439
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,500
And but they wanted to ask you, where

440
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,360
should I start if I want to start

441
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,780
engaging now that I've taken the time to

442
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,380
listen, evaluate, go with it, and now I'm

443
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,980
going to start changing things accordingly.

444
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,260
And I went, hmm, OK, so I'll just

445
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:43,860
throw it to the grease.

446
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:44,340
Simple.

447
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,420
That's real simple.

448
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,080
And the answer is that what are the

449
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,780
basic needs?

450
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,420
Food, clothing, shelter, by example.

451
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,980
So all the little tips and tricks and

452
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,960
hints and methods that I put out regarding

453
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,680
food, clothing and shelter start demonstrating that to

454
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,000
others.

455
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,000
If you have a household or whatever, and

456
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,340
they'll see, oh, wow, how come this, you

457
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,040
know, he's doing everything so much better and

458
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,120
then introduce the more subtle things, the spiritual

459
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,120
stuff, the lawful stuff, the other concepts slowly,

460
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,300
like, you know, and food, clothing, shelter, also

461
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,020
human body.

462
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,540
You know, I've had quite a few testimonials

463
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,420
over the years about people getting injuries and,

464
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,880
you know, everyone around them is like, oh,

465
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,200
you got to go to the emergency room,

466
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,060
you know, like a laceration or something.

467
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,880
And they're like, no, no, no.

468
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:24,800
Do this.

469
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,940
And like they show me a photo.

470
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:26,800
It's pretty gruesome.

471
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,180
And then like three days later, it looks

472
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,020
like nothing happened.

473
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,280
You know, with the electrical tape and paper

474
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,720
towels, you know, that's you don't have to

475
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,080
use that.

476
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,400
But that's the basics of it.

477
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,580
And so then when you build up, by

478
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:41,720
example, food, clothing, shelter and the human body,

479
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,880
people then will tend to be more accepting

480
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,740
and more, let's say, swayed over.

481
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:46,440
Oh, yeah.

482
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,880
With the cooking and everything.

483
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:48,940
I get all that.

484
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,760
But what happens is when you get to

485
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,920
a certain point, though, and you start going,

486
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,140
well, now I'm against the medical convention because

487
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,100
I'm telling you, you know, the heart's not

488
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:57,580
a pump.

489
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,120
OK, but hold on.

490
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,660
You don't have to be against it.

491
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,060
You could be you could run parallel to

492
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:03,300
it.

493
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:03,780
Right.

494
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,000
Because remember, I've always said these idiots in

495
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,540
the medical community, they've done a lot of

496
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,200
grunt work.

497
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:09,720
Right.

498
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,320
So if someone digs a big ditch, you

499
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,020
just don't go fill it just because just

500
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:13,500
leave it there.

501
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,440
It might be good use.

502
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,920
You may want to throw them in the

503
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,780
ditch right later.

504
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,960
And so, you know, so leave it open.

505
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,140
So so a lot of the things that

506
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,860
they have, like, you know, with anatomy is

507
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,400
valid, but they don't know how it works

508
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:26,660
at all.

509
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,060
And you know what they do, but they

510
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,560
won't tell you because it's we're at war.

511
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,420
We're an information war.

512
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,200
People don't know that, you know, the United

513
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,080
this country lost a war in 1871 and

514
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,540
even lost again.

515
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,720
Imagine a country like Iraq, right?

516
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,240
They invaded one in 91 and then they

517
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,540
invaded again in 2003.

518
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,880
That's what happened to the US.

519
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:51,060
They came in 1871, started the war, and

520
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,900
then they invaded again in 1933.

521
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,820
All administratively, all on paper, which is more

522
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,880
lethal, because if they blew up your homes

523
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,860
and killed your people, it would be very

524
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,500
easy and functional resistance.

525
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,520
But if they do it sneaky using paperwork

526
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,079
that they know and also they're going to

527
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,380
dissuade you from reading it, they're going to

528
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,280
win every time.

529
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,220
And that's how it works.

530
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,740
And just like whenever a fiat currency is

531
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,800
introduced as the only currency, it's the end

532
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,380
of a nation.

533
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,260
That's a maximum of law.

534
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,060
That's not even whatever.

535
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,119
So you're at war.

536
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,500
You just don't know it.

537
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,380
But it's a different kind of war, right?

538
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,700
It's an informational war.

539
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,820
So you run parallel to it.

540
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,800
You know, one of the best things to

541
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,100
do, the national the Germans did, this national

542
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,600
socialist is about 30 percent of the equipment

543
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,880
they had was salvaged from the other side.

544
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:41,920
Right.

545
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,120
OK, so you want to you want to

546
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,520
maintain a battle, let's say, break, you tactically

547
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,920
succeed and strategically succeed, but you want to

548
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,220
save as much of the equipment as possible

549
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,740
so you don't have to manufacture it from

550
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,380
the ground up.

551
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,400
It's kind of like the concept of the

552
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,500
neutron bomb kills all the people, but it

553
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,060
leaves all the infrastructure intact.

554
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,560
That's what they did.

555
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,580
And it's still going on today.

556
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,780
But they're killing you in many, many ways

557
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,740
that you don't even realize.

558
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,160
And now it's pretty obvious that they don't

559
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,880
mind killing you off.

560
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,220
I think the U.S., by the way,

561
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,340
is pretty close to a zero population growth,

562
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:13,980
isn't it?

563
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,260
Well, in other words, for every person that's

564
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,100
born, one person dies pretty close to that.

565
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,080
Well, no, it's it's at a point where

566
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,720
we're below replacement, OK, where you don't have

567
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,140
below population growth.

568
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,240
It's below replacement.

569
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:29,520
So you're replacing, say, one point two for

570
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,140
every two people kind of thing.

571
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,660
So that I see.

572
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,220
Yeah, that's the the math.

573
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,520
That's about so for every so every person

574
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,200
that first.

575
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,820
So for every person that's born, two people

576
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,280
are dying.

577
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,320
Almost hard to say.

578
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:42,740
Almost.

579
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,340
So we're not interesting.

580
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:48,420
Yeah, that's pretty bad when you consider, you

581
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,960
know, how humans typically are.

582
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,040
But that's that's another discussion, really, because there's

583
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,040
plenty of room for everyone.

584
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,900
You know, the entire population of the earth

585
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,860
could be put in Texas.

586
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,200
Right.

587
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,320
In a suburban setting.

588
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,580
So and by the way, I think I've

589
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,900
been pushing around videos.

590
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,500
There's some people that have been doing research

591
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,820
in China and people that defected from the

592
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,460
communist CCP.

593
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,920
If you look hard, they'll tell you there's

594
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,880
really like anywhere between three hundred and fifty

595
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,520
to four hundred and fifty million people in

596
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,240
China, not one point, whatever billion.

597
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:15,540
Right.

598
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,820
I've been saying that for more than 20

599
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,220
years.

600
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,620
And the reason they put up the figure

601
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,440
is because they've discounted their birth certificates.

602
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:21,900
Right.

603
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,660
So they need more.

604
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:22,940
Right.

605
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,440
So anyway.

606
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:25,520
Yeah.

607
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,380
So this is the population of who knows

608
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,360
what it is because the information is held

609
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,020
by the bankers and we know the bankers

610
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,080
always give us accurate information.

611
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:33,480
Right.

612
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,800
So, yeah, no, they don't confabulate.

613
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,220
Right.

614
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:38,700
Yeah.

615
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,180
But back to the question.

616
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,480
Try to do by example.

617
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,920
But yeah, I find I tell people if

618
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,920
you're in a relationship, marriage or whatever, whatever,

619
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,240
there's like a 70 to 90 percent chance

620
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,740
rate that if only one of you wants

621
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,840
to do this stuff, the relationship won't hold.

622
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,340
Right.

623
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,500
Now, I've heard of people that, you know,

624
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,660
like some new people, I would love your

625
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,000
stuff.

626
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:03,960
And are you married?

627
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,220
Yeah.

628
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,700
Oh, but she loves it, too.

629
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,420
OK, cool.

630
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,820
Because if she wasn't into it, it's over.

631
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,300
It's just a matter of time.

632
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:10,540
Right.

633
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,520
You're going to diverge.

634
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,680
I mean, it's just going to.

635
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,880
Yeah, it's a matter of time.

636
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:14,220
Yeah.

637
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,020
And the stuff I put out is is

638
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,600
better than what they're doing.

639
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,520
Otherwise, I wouldn't be putting it out.

640
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,240
It's pretty obvious.

641
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,800
I mean, to to once you put it

642
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,880
in practice, that it is a better method.

643
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,820
And the only reason I'm doing Sonics is

644
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,860
because 99 percent of the stuff I talk

645
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,460
about, I can't find anywhere else.

646
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,080
Right.

647
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:36,640
So so you're creating it and that's all

648
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:36,880
good.

649
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,260
So anyway, that's all the feedback I've got

650
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,380
for for this one.

651
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:40,720
Yeah.

652
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,280
Well, we got we did something different.

653
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,940
The last two Sonics was a part one,

654
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,460
part two of of the testament of the

655
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,280
robustness of the human or the man and

656
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:51,560
women.

657
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,100
Right.

658
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:52,480
Right.

659
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,820
And things you should be concerned about.

660
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,860
What I got into the basics, food, clothing,

661
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,280
shelter.

662
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:01,260
Someone did post regarding food, a cauliflower recipe

663
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,660
on the Greek chili and the Greek Chitango,

664
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,200
which is the right idea.

665
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,020
I did.

666
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:11,020
I've done a broccoli recipe and a cabbage

667
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:11,500
recipe.

668
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,160
The cauliflower.

669
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,620
I do something similar.

670
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,600
I haven't done it in a while.

671
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,560
The idea of using a lot of fat

672
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,000
with cauliflower, as in the video, is very

673
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,540
good.

674
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,800
So but that's the idea.

675
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,300
You can make a single vegetable, an entree

676
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,620
if you prepare it.

677
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:24,980
Right.

678
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:29,800
And yeah, that's that's definitely the idea.

679
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,240
And thank you for whoever posted that.

680
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,420
The other thing that's been showing up in

681
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,540
the chili and the Greek Chitango is this

682
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,200
the voices.

683
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,040
A lot of the some of them are

684
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,920
really some people apparently are when you're more

685
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,440
like one of the comments was, you know,

686
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,640
I kind of knew something about that a

687
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:47,960
little bit.

688
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,580
I sensed it.

689
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,980
But when the Greeks are talking about it

690
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,260
now, I really zeroed in on it.

691
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,460
I really see it clearly.

692
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,320
And a lot of negative stuff comes from

693
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,720
these things, kind of like look out for

694
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,200
Charlie.

695
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,880
You know, these finds these hidden voices are

696
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,560
always negative.

697
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:05,380
Yeah, that's basically the what's happening here.

698
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,180
But it doesn't mean you have to succumb

699
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:08,560
to it.

700
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,760
Now, it's OK to succumb to it and

701
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,860
let it flow through.

702
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,220
But but and it's also not OK to

703
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,220
always be fighting it.

704
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,420
And one of the things that I always

705
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:20,200
found is when I catch that, like chatter

706
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,940
in the head, I just stop and tell

707
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,320
myself, OK, so what did you say?

708
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,020
Say that again.

709
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:27,560
And it stops because they rely on you

710
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,120
not acknowledging it as being separate from you.

711
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,280
And the moment you acknowledge that these voices

712
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,180
and inputs are not yours and you buy

713
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,720
it by saying, hey, say that again or

714
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,920
I'm not having that bullshit or whatever.

715
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:40,920
They stop.

716
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,240
They literally stop because their whole memo is

717
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,800
to not be recognized as a separate entity

718
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,700
from who their, you know, their victim is.

719
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,160
And we're all victims to a degree.

720
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,600
The thing that I posted is the Mandela

721
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,060
effect.

722
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,160
Holy crap.

723
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,820
I needed a part, by the way.

724
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,580
It's an oil pressure sensor.

725
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,160
And I started looking around all the typical

726
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,600
places and it's discontinued, discontinued, discontinued, not available,

727
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,200
not available.

728
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:09,020
Even I went to Chrysler, discontinued, called the

729
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:09,260
dealer.

730
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:09,680
Are you sure?

731
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,680
Yeah, it's discontinued.

732
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,940
So I found a place that they could

733
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,220
order.

734
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,920
It came from another part of the state.

735
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:15,860
They came in.

736
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,860
It was the wrong piece.

737
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,580
It didn't fit.

738
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,660
I was like, damn, you know, the sensor

739
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,080
just the terminals were off and all that.

740
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,960
And then I was like, all right, let

741
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,440
me go back to the computer and start

742
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,120
searching again.

743
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,720
And I went through every place that I

744
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,580
had previously searched now had it.

745
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,280
Every single outlet had it.

746
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:34,680
Wow.

747
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,080
And I was like, OK, all right.

748
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:36,540
All right.

749
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,040
Now, I'm not that far off with my

750
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,900
memory because I remember spending an hour going

751
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,180
to many, many sites, looking up, cross-referencing,

752
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,140
making phone calls.

753
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,520
It was discontinued, discontinued, not available, not available.

754
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,180
I ordered the part that comes in.

755
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,160
It's the wrong part.

756
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,820
Will not fit, even though they assured me

757
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,620
it's the right one.

758
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,220
I start everything from scratch again.

759
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,200
And now suddenly it's available even at like

760
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,620
AutoZone or O'Reilly's.

761
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,380
It's just there, you know.

762
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,840
And I'm like, how can this be?

763
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,760
So at least on AutoZone or O'Reilly's,

764
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:05,780
you can go in and look at it

765
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,300
directly and know it's the right or wrong

766
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:07,500
part.

767
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,700
I did get it today.

768
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,700
I mean, I got it today and it

769
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,660
is the right one.

770
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,680
But how could it be?

771
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,780
I clearly remember last week it didn't exist.

772
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,460
It was actually more than two weeks ago

773
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,780
because well, because it didn't exist.

774
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,620
And I got the wrong one.

775
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,100
I actually repaired the old one, which exploded.

776
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,600
And the repair wouldn't hold because it's plastic

777
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,300
against metal.

778
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,560
And it has to be crimped a certain

779
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:28,900
way.

780
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:32,000
But anyway, I just sat down and took

781
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,080
a deep breath and laughed.

782
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,860
And I said, you mother effers.

783
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,820
See, I don't really you really mess with

784
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,560
us this much.

785
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,480
Now, this sounds very personal, right?

786
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,400
Because it's not like everybody remembers the Empire

787
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,820
State Building looking like this.

788
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,940
And now it looks like that.

789
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,980
This is very personal, meaning just me, myself.

790
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,640
And I had to meditate as I did.

791
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,480
I really recall I haven't had a notepad,

792
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,180
you know, taking notes that I couldn't find

793
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:55,380
it.

794
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,360
So and the notes were still there.

795
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,460
A bunch of other stuff changed also last

796
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,360
week or this week.

797
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,380
Something you see.

798
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,720
I often tell people that, look, when you

799
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,420
hit a wall like that, that you don't

800
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,920
think you should be hitting, walk away from

801
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,700
it, go back to it later and just

802
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,500
try it again.

803
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,220
Just from the beginning again.

804
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,600
Well, here's the interesting thing.

805
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,400
That's not this is not the case because

806
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,080
it was established in the past that this

807
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,100
thing was discontinued.

808
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:21,900
I gave up.

809
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:22,180
Right.

810
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,880
And then when the part that I got

811
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,880
disposed to work didn't fit, I said, well,

812
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,480
I got to start all over again.

813
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,000
And when I did, I noticed there's nothing

814
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,400
to stop because I noticed suddenly it's available.

815
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:33,920
Right.

816
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,640
So it means the entire world around it

817
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,220
changed.

818
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,020
So, you know, I didn't I couldn't do

819
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:41,480
anything.

820
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,400
I didn't have to do much because now

821
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:43,960
it's available.

822
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,620
No, all you had to do is continue

823
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,320
to try, though.

824
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,940
Somebody else might have said, OK, forget it.

825
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,280
Now I'm going to change my entire plan

826
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,280
because I can't get this part.

827
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,360
You know what I mean?

828
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:51,580
Right.

829
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:51,820
Right.

830
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,520
But I went back and started again the

831
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,260
logical thing.

832
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,380
Let's just start looking again.

833
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,920
And suddenly it's available everywhere.

834
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,580
That means that something happened to this entire

835
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,780
reality that flipped.

836
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,460
It changed.

837
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,520
And I'm just wondering if anybody else has

838
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,500
been noticing major changes.

839
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,480
And I don't think they're major.

840
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,920
Like, you know, the Empire State Building now

841
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,320
has two towers instead of one or where

842
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:12,980
nothing like that.

843
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,480
In personal, you know, I have had this

844
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,600
several times when I was actually made a

845
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,320
template.

846
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,000
Do you tell me the Empire State Building

847
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,840
has two towers literally or are you just

848
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,560
making that up?

849
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,040
No, I'm just making it up.

850
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,960
It's not obvious.

851
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,760
In other words, that's something that's happening.

852
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,260
And what I'm trying to say, it's happening

853
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,460
on an individual basis.

854
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:33,560
You're being screwed with individually instead of something

855
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,560
everyone can see.

856
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,900
Like, you know, like you get it's not

857
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,440
like the Golden Gate Bridge is now green

858
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,160
and everyone says, yeah, it's always been green.

859
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,460
No, I remember it being red.

860
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,740
And 10,000 people say, yeah, it was

861
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,100
red.

862
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:46,980
What's not green?

863
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,820
It was never green.

864
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,480
And then you have the rest of the

865
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,360
population saying, you guys are crazy.

866
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,700
It's always been green.

867
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,540
It's nothing like that.

868
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,060
It's very, very, very specific.

869
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,000
The only way I can make it more

870
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,300
substantial is to put out who else was

871
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,920
looking for this part two weeks ago, found

872
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,620
it's discontinued, but now it's available.

873
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,700
You know, I mean, that's going to be

874
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,880
too narrow of a call out.

875
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:07,220
Right.

876
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,840
So what I'm saying is these these things

877
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,580
that are happening are very, very personal to

878
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,100
an individual.

879
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:13,980
Right.

880
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,000
It's kind of like you will go home

881
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,980
one day and your bathroom, instead of being

882
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,200
pink or blue, is now green or yellow.

883
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,400
And but who are you going to tell?

884
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,920
Because, you know, maybe you and one or

885
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,940
two other people know that, you see.

886
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,380
Hmm.

887
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:28,460
Right.

888
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,720
So I think it's it's messing around on

889
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,340
a on a personal level.

890
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,640
But I'm not saying that there isn't, you

891
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,420
know, the Bernstein bears or remember, this was

892
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:41,000
it was like Haas avocados was H.A.

893
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,300
H double A.S. Not H.A. S

894
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,700
.S. A lot of people do remember a

895
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,460
lot of these things.

896
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,900
I think it's it also happens on an

897
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,220
extremely personal level.

898
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,680
Right.

899
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,440
Well, I went through your body moving to

900
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,300
another side.

901
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:54,700
Right.

902
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:55,580
I know.

903
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,840
I believe that that kind of thing happens.

904
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,900
Also, you know, I had a weird thing

905
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,300
with the World Trade Center where, you know,

906
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,680
we ended up talking a whole bunch of

907
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,100
9-11 stuff and people had this crazy

908
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,260
idea about when the World Trade Center opened

909
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:06,820
for business.

910
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,300
And I told them there's no way that's

911
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,040
possible because I remember getting a lunchbox with

912
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,480
King Kong on it when I was seven

913
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:13,960
years old.

914
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:14,400
Yeah.

915
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,740
And it was a World Trade Center.

916
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:16,860
Nineteen seventy nine.

917
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,060
And he was standing one foot on each

918
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,560
one of the World Trade Towers is the

919
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,020
way they depicted him on the lunchbox.

920
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,860
And they were like, that can't be because

921
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,540
it wasn't open.

922
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,060
And, you know, it wasn't even available to

923
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,580
be a picture in nineteen seventy nine.

924
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,960
I'm like, yes, it was.

925
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,960
And it was seventy three, I think.

926
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:31,640
Yeah, right.

927
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,600
But some of these other people had a

928
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,200
memory that it didn't open till the 80s.

929
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,200
And oh, my gosh, that's pretty bad memory.

930
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,040
That can't be.

931
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:39,780
I mean, what's this?

932
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,080
I mean, that's a fact that's really, really,

933
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,480
I think, too far off that.

934
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,120
That's a weird.

935
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,740
These edits are more subtle than that.

936
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,200
Yeah.

937
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,300
No, I'm just saying I've seen extreme weird

938
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:49,980
things like that.

939
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,020
And I was like, you almost made me

940
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,740
nervous when you said something about the two

941
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,180
you know, like spikes coming up on the

942
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,480
world, on the Empire State Building.

943
00:28:59,780 --> 00:28:59,880
Yeah.

944
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,120
Yeah.

945
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:00,620
Yeah.

946
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,540
Which would be weird.

947
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,420
But because I've seen that my whole life

948
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,780
and I know it's a singular point.

949
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,440
So what I'm trying to try to underscore,

950
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,240
I think it's a lot of the changes

951
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,620
are very, very personal, like like, for example,

952
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,680
a good example would be you have a

953
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,740
mole on your on your left shoulder and

954
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,880
now you've always considered that and known it.

955
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,240
And then one day you look and it's

956
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,620
now it's no longer on the left, the

957
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,160
same exact moles on the right shoulder.

958
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,360
So who are you going to substantiate that

959
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:26,600
with?

960
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,360
Only people who know that you have that

961
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:28,800
bowl there.

962
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,040
Right.

963
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,240
So it's very personal.

964
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,200
So I'm bringing this up because it ties

965
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,740
in with the voices somehow.

966
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,840
Same general subject.

967
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,960
But the voices are something to consider because

968
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,840
it really stands the entire psychological industry on

969
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,300
its head.

970
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,420
You know, all the stuff they're saying that

971
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,980
they can't substantiate and tell you why someone

972
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,000
has schizophrenia or anything like that.

973
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,820
It's all external input and they won't they

974
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,600
can't go there anyway.

975
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:00,760
It's a fraud of an institution, the psychology

976
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,380
and psychiatry, especially.

977
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,940
They don't I mean, they're morons.

978
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:10,880
I mean, how can you have something like

979
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,980
psychology or psychiatry when the regular medics think

980
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,200
the heart is a pump?

981
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,420
I mean, you got to go back to

982
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,540
the basics, you know, and they don't know

983
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,900
about the biological vacuum.

984
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:24,520
I want to do also when I do

985
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,280
get some time.

986
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,660
And by the way, right now, the water

987
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,980
stuff that I'm working on is expanding and

988
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,580
expanding and I'm getting proposals for projects and

989
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,580
I'm trying to just stay on the engineering

990
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,060
side, just doing design work.

991
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,540
But unfortunately, I do have to build things

992
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,140
also.

993
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,460
It's here.

994
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,640
One Mandela effect is dealing with engineers.

995
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,780
And every time you you have a meeting

996
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,000
on something and then you meet with them

997
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,440
again and they ask you the same questions

998
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,880
as if you didn't have the first meeting.

999
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,520
Now, should I count that as a Mandela

1000
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,320
effect or a mental defect?

1001
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:56,180
But anyway, I have to carry a lot.

1002
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:01,160
I mean, but either way, the things are

1003
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,680
not up to snuff and you can't fix

1004
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:03,920
them.

1005
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,640
So but what I wanted to do when

1006
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,480
I do get an opening with the for

1007
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,860
time, if it's possible, is actually get a

1008
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:15,080
bunch of people that have medical training together

1009
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,060
and do like a webinar thing with them.

1010
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,300
So bring up the basics, you know, the

1011
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:22,820
biological vacuum, all the tissues are nonpermeable.

1012
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:23,600
Right.

1013
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,060
The lung tissue is not permeable.

1014
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:25,440
Right.

1015
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,400
When I say nonpermeable, you know what I

1016
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:27,620
mean.

1017
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:27,940
Right.

1018
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,860
It's closed.

1019
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,560
Nothing goes through a closed system.

1020
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,060
Yeah.

1021
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,820
But the system is open from the mouth

1022
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:34,380
to the anus.

1023
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,300
And then you have certain other things that

1024
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:40,600
may be glands that have poor extrusion anyway.

1025
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,600
And when I put out the information, ask

1026
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,300
a small audience of medical people that have

1027
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:50,680
the training in anatomy, especially for feedback in

1028
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,300
real time.

1029
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,420
And I'll be, quote, unquote, I'll be nice,

1030
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,200
but I'll be pleasant and try to give

1031
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,900
more explanations.

1032
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,740
And I have put this out to half

1033
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,020
a dozen people in medical training.

1034
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,420
No one is coming forward at all.

1035
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,020
They don't want it.

1036
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,320
And I'm like, I won't show your face.

1037
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,580
I won't give your name, maybe your voice.

1038
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,720
But just with the voice alone, I think

1039
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,500
you can identify people anyway.

1040
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,260
Mostly.

1041
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,000
Yeah, you can.

1042
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:10,680
You can.

1043
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,180
Yeah.

1044
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,860
So I'm not getting any takers.

1045
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:13,620
And that's fine.

1046
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,280
I do comprehend why.

1047
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:17,800
Because it's very, very subtle.

1048
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,500
Imagine, you know, imagine how bad it is

1049
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,460
for their reputation.

1050
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,660
You know, imagine saying you're so and so,

1051
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,080
whatever.

1052
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,100
And you I heard you in the audience

1053
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,840
with the Greek and we have to side

1054
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,420
with the Greek.

1055
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,580
He's got all the you know, the facts

1056
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,320
and the data sets, let's say, for what's

1057
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:32,740
going on.

1058
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,380
And you're a doctor and you didn't know

1059
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:34,700
this.

1060
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,320
Oh, shit.

1061
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,080
So I get it.

1062
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:36,700
I get it.

1063
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:36,980
Right.

1064
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,240
I still get messages from medical people saying

1065
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:41,720
Greek.

1066
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,320
I never.

1067
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,060
It's amazing.

1068
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,480
Yeah, it is true what you're saying.

1069
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,920
And, you know, so and there are voice

1070
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,700
filters out there.

1071
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,300
If these guys wanted to, they could like

1072
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,440
mask their voice if they wanted to.

1073
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,500
Yeah, whatever.

1074
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,620
But that's just the thought.

1075
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,920
I mean, and what why would you structure

1076
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,220
something like that anyway?

1077
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,200
Like anyone's going to learn anything from it,

1078
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:00,400
right?

1079
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,080
It's too late, you know, for that kind

1080
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:02,460
of stuff.

1081
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,540
But again, you don't have to go against

1082
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,440
any of it.

1083
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,820
You run parallel, just like with the legal

1084
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:11,080
idiots, you know, just stick to the Constitution.

1085
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,280
Right.

1086
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,320
You have all the you have protected rights,

1087
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,340
meaning not that the Constitution gives you rights.

1088
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:18,780
It doesn't.

1089
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,080
The Bill of Rights supports certain things, right,

1090
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,620
which most people don't even know what they

1091
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:23,800
are.

1092
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,980
That is the Constitution, because it has limitations

1093
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,720
on what the governing body should do.

1094
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,160
That is your protection.

1095
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,660
Is there your protection via the Constitution?

1096
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:36,520
Is there a limitation holding them to their

1097
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,180
limitations is what protects you?

1098
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:38,340
Right.

1099
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,340
So they stay inbound.

1100
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,500
They don't go out of bounds.

1101
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:41,340
Right.

1102
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,680
So when you do that, anyone in the

1103
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,040
legal systems thinks you're going contrary, but you're

1104
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:46,420
not.

1105
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,900
You're using the supremacy clauses.

1106
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:49,360
Right.

1107
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:49,820
And right.

1108
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,820
In common law, which is court decisions and

1109
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,660
the Constitution, you're running parallel to it.

1110
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,420
So don't touch me.

1111
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,520
In other words, you're going to keep the

1112
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,960
legal stuff where it belongs and the law

1113
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,100
stuff where it belongs.

1114
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:00,420
Right.

1115
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:00,940
Right.

1116
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:01,880
If running power.

1117
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,600
So you don't have to go.

1118
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:05,500
So with the medical, the legal or anything,

1119
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:09,340
even personal relationship, don't go contra, just run

1120
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,219
parallel to it and do it better.

1121
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,159
And, you know, show that's where the show

1122
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:15,659
by example or demonstrate, you know, something better

1123
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:16,219
comes from.

1124
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:16,940
Yeah.

1125
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,179
Hey, last thing you need to send me

1126
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:21,520
that schematic on the aqueous Argentum.

1127
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,980
Oh, yeah, I'll do that.

1128
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:23,440
Yeah.

1129
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:23,699
Yeah.

1130
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:26,719
You got you got activity requesting that.

1131
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,320
Let's say I've got I've got like two,

1132
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:28,719
I think.

1133
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:29,679
And I want to put them in.

1134
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,020
I'll put them in touch with Joe also,

1135
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,000
just because he's got one that works already.

1136
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,400
And with the schematic, then they take it

1137
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:35,940
from there.

1138
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,159
Right.

1139
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:37,600
Yeah.

1140
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,440
Yeah, exactly.

1141
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,420
And if you don't know how to put

1142
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,560
together a basic circuit, there's plenty of people

1143
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:41,980
that do.

1144
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,440
Even if you went to an electronic supply

1145
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,400
place and show them the diagram, I need

1146
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,000
these parts.

1147
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,900
They'll actually put it together for you right

1148
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:50,219
there.

1149
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:50,800
Usually.
