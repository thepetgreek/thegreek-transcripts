1
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,000
The Sonic Event 2.2.2 Rated Y.

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,380
Anyway, how are you doing today, Greek?

3
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,120
Oh, I'm doing okay.

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,780
I just want to let people know, if

5
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,460
you're sending me messages and stuff and I

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,420
haven't responded yet, I will get to it.

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,240
I'm only one and a half people here.

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,940
So I will catch up to your messages.

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,640
I'm not one to get a lot, fortunately,

10
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:33,420
but I'm not really in the public like

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,680
other people are, you know, my subs or

12
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,560
anything like that.

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,580
But getting more emails than I usually do,

14
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,200
usually.

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,200
And most of them I've seen through the

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,500
subject is I want to be down for

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,220
the audio or sonic counter space webinar, which

18
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,640
is going to be a shorty.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,220
But, you know, yeah, you'll get you'll if

20
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,160
you found out about it from me speaking

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,220
here, you'll find about when it is, maybe

22
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,360
we'll do it in a couple of weeks.

23
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,220
It's gonna be a real short one.

24
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,860
And this is because it could be so

25
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,120
short.

26
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,220
I mean, it's really a false back inside

27
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,900
of a container, or an enclosure, whether it's

28
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,860
a room, or a speaker box, or an

29
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,740
audio, you know, a dashboard or whatever.

30
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,920
It's a very small, thin module, it's mimics

31
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,920
the back of the wall or enclosure in

32
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,940
a certain way, it's couldn't be any simpler.

33
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,880
And don't try to wrap your mind around

34
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,900
what how it works.

35
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,600
But once until you build one and employ

36
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,940
it, and then you're going to be Holy

37
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,280
crap, I can't believe the sonic difference.

38
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,960
This little thing does all that.

39
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,160
Wow, you know, we're really onto something now.

40
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,120
Nice.

41
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,100
Well, other thing I want to get into,

42
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,040
which I've been holding back for a few

43
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,160
years, I've been just to inject this out.

44
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,000
And you don't have to give feedback.

45
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,480
But in the future, if fine, if you're

46
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,600
interested, I might be doing more of a

47
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,400
webinar, I should have done the cooking, but

48
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,320
I, I'm not going to do that.

49
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,460
It's it's too involved.

50
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,880
I don't want anyone to think that we

51
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,900
can do three, three hour talks about how

52
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,500
to become better cooking, and you will be

53
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,160
so so kind of investing some time on

54
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,500
my own.

55
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,460
I said, that's maybe too big, but something

56
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,020
like that.

57
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,780
But the other thing is people have been

58
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,080
talking about free energy, not so much as

59
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,860
they did in the 1015 years ago.

60
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:25,180
Remember?

61
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:25,820
Right?

62
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,360
Yeah.

63
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,760
Well, for the past couple of years, I've

64
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,560
been sitting on something that let's just say

65
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,600
you put 40 watts in you get 800

66
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,360
watts out.

67
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,260
It's very easy to build.

68
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,020
It's mechanical.

69
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,380
Well, easy, right?

70
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,600
To who?

71
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,620
And what I'll do is I'll explain the

72
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,120
principle.

73
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,900
And what it involves, basically, is you're going

74
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,500
to be mimicking, do you remember those flashlights

75
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,280
that you shake?

76
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,660
It looks like, right, back and forth, and

77
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,180
they charge?

78
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:56,740
Yeah.

79
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,700
Okay, it's just like that, except the device

80
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,960
is motionless, you don't have to move anything.

81
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,240
Except for perpendicular to it, you have a

82
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,000
small rotor that rotates.

83
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,920
In essence, the I'll give the beans out

84
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,360
right here.

85
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,020
You go to like an industrial catalog, and

86
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,080
you find out, look up for your house,

87
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,960
which 10 kW 10,000 watt generator usually

88
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,220
can do your average house, your average house,

89
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,360
you know, like the ticky tacky houses you

90
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,160
see in the row.

91
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,360
Right?

92
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,040
Nothing too special means you could still use

93
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,780
a clothes iron and whatever, you know, like

94
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,160
a lot of people live off the grid,

95
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,420
they can't use dishwashers and irons, it shuts

96
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,660
down their whole system, right?

97
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,260
Or blow dryers, you can still use a

98
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,060
blow 10 kW.

99
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,060
So you look up what a 10 kW

100
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,380
generator requires, like the armature, the stator, the

101
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,920
windings, how much material, how much does the

102
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,860
thing weigh, right, you'll see 140 pounds, okay,

103
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,640
you need 140 pounds worth of material.

104
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,000
Right?

105
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,980
And it basically works on the principle of

106
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:03,740
the scalarator.

107
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,300
And when you see how it works, you're

108
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,640
going to get pissed because you're gonna wish

109
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,780
you figured it out yourself.

110
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,700
And you realize this is a planet of

111
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,200
idiots.

112
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,760
And no other people haven't figured out how

113
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,760
simple it is to take to increase your

114
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,220
input.

115
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:21,600
Because right now, the input is how efficient

116
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,540
like, oh, this is really good.

117
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,700
80% efficient, that means you're only wasting

118
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,880
20%, right?

119
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,880
So right, well, this thing is eight is

120
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,040
over 800 900.

121
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,620
Actually, I think it's 2400% efficient, something

122
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,240
like that.

123
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,500
Because you put in 40 watts and you

124
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,600
get 800 out.

125
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,180
So if you if it was 200%

126
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,460
efficient, you put if it was 100%

127
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,200
efficient, you put 40 watts and you get

128
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,400
40 watts out, right?

129
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,660
200% efficient, you put 40 watts in

130
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,960
80, you get 80, and so on.

131
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,860
And so you do the math.

132
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,600
So yeah, so it's 10 times 200.

133
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,220
Right?

134
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,340
2000% efficient.

135
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,240
And it's gonna, it's on the it's the

136
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,920
principle of scalar, it looks nothing like the

137
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,340
scalarator.

138
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,040
It's the principle.

139
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,320
And the thing that's winding, basically get the

140
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,860
thing that gets the generator moving is a

141
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,180
little light bulb battery, or one of those

142
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,560
little cell phone, solar panels that is just

143
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,400
designed to cell phone, you've seen those old

144
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,040
portable solar panels.

145
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,280
Yeah, you got some sort of interference happening,

146
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,680
you're probably stepping near something.

147
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,760
But I am I'm walking around.

148
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,780
So anyway, that I wasn't gonna I've been

149
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,080
holding on to this for quite a few

150
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,500
years, like two years, it feels like I've

151
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,860
been holding on to it for 10 years.

152
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,560
And I've been giving hints and private calls

153
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,520
and no one's biting and I'll do a

154
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,080
thing on how to build in how it

155
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,920
works and all that.

156
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,860
And now people say, I just want to

157
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,120
just finish off this thought.

158
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,680
Oh, that's free electricity.

159
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,120
Don't be an ass.

160
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,060
You already not only do use everyone have

161
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,340
free electricity, but you're actually getting paid to

162
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:01,860
use it.

163
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,720
How do I know that?

164
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,460
Are you getting a bill at the end

165
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:04,940
of the month?

166
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,340
That's a payment made to you.

167
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,000
But according to the contract, you gave it

168
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,280
up to them, you said that you're going

169
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,140
to pay all the electric companies bills.

170
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,880
And what I mean by that is if

171
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,860
the electric company board of directors wants to

172
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,520
go to Vegas, Vegas, Vegas and have a

173
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,120
core cocaine and prostitute party for the whole

174
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,720
week at $10,000 a night hotels, you're

175
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,900
going to pay for it, you agree to

176
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,540
it in your contract.

177
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:34,940
Right?

178
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,700
So you do have free electricity and you're

179
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,040
getting paid to use it.

180
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,560
But right now they've got you in a

181
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,500
position where if you don't pay them twice,

182
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,620
they're going to shut it off.

183
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,800
So you got bigger problems than getting free

184
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,820
energy, free electricity.

185
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:50,800
You see what I mean?

186
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,440
This, this device has nothing to do with

187
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,540
having free power for your house.

188
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,440
It has to do with putting power in

189
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,480
a remote location.

190
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,660
You get it?

191
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,240
Okay.

192
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,760
If you put, if you put a generator

193
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,500
in a remote location, they need some kind

194
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,360
of fuel, doesn't it?

195
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:05,300
Yeah.

196
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:05,800
Generally.

197
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:06,920
Yeah.

198
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,500
Or you could put it, but remember there's

199
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,460
no motion to it.

200
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,360
So it's really quiet.

201
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,100
You know what generators, you always know there's

202
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,540
a generator in the area, right?

203
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,900
What they call electrical generator.

204
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,740
This thing makes the noise of a little,

205
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,120
uh, one of those Walmart rechargeable fans that

206
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,420
you get that are totally silent.

207
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,820
You hold it up against your neck to

208
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,380
cool you down.

209
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,320
So you're telling me this thing will make

210
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,920
less noise than your central air or whatever

211
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,660
in your place.

212
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,600
It makes about the same noise as a

213
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,680
laptop fan does.

214
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,480
Oh, wow.

215
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,220
That's like nothing.

216
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:37,620
Yeah.

217
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,140
Okay.

218
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:38,720
Yeah.

219
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,600
No, no, no.

220
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,460
If we were saying this and proving what

221
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,260
we're saying now, which we can, uh, 20

222
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,760
years ago, you know, get us killed, right?

223
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,640
We go missing, right?

224
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:48,420
Generally.

225
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:48,720
Yeah.

226
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,700
That's usually what was the legend.

227
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,480
I always heard.

228
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,720
Yeah, for sure.

229
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,420
Yeah.

230
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,080
So I just wanted to bring these things

231
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,140
up, uh, because there's a lot going on

232
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,720
in my world and my world is your

233
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,400
world and your world is my world or

234
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:03,700
whatever.

235
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,480
I think you guys, I can share it.

236
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:05,720
Right.

237
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,680
So should be able to.

238
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,200
So one thing at a time, what do

239
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,200
you got, what do you got for tonight?

240
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:11,800
Yeah, sure.

241
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,360
No problem.

242
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,620
No, in no particular order.

243
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,560
I'll just pull them up.

244
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,780
Uh, here's a weird one.

245
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,220
If you could spend a day with a

246
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,140
biblical character, who would it be?

247
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,580
If any, that's a good question.

248
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,940
The question is, uh, yeah, we'll get once

249
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,440
you get, here's the thing about that.

250
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,420
I'll tell you whenever someone I've asked that

251
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,179
question before, uh, when you have a King

252
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,640
James, uh, it's been asked.

253
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:33,840
Yeah.

254
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,059
If you, um, look at the King James,

255
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,140
the English Bibles, it has these very American

256
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,080
Franco American names like John Peter, you know,

257
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,300
Isaiah, right.

258
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,460
Uh, David, right.

259
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,140
All this stuff.

260
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:46,480
Yes.

261
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,220
Uh, what's interesting to add a little more

262
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,580
knickknack to the party.

263
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,060
When you find out what their real names

264
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,420
were in the language, remember names are exempt

265
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,300
from language, right?

266
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,480
So if your name is, uh, whatever, whatever,

267
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:03,960
and in, uh, Czechoslovakian, no matter where you

268
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,920
go, your name doesn't change according to the

269
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,300
translation.

270
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,120
Your name is not translated, right?

271
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,800
They're they're exempt from translation.

272
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,800
Well, it would be, I'll tell you who

273
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,140
it would be.

274
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:14,740
Yes.

275
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:16,660
Yes.

276
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,100
Okay.

277
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,340
Well, that's interesting again, because I was just

278
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,340
going to say, look in different languages, they

279
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,240
tell you there's a different interpretation of a

280
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,100
name sometimes.

281
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,600
And like when I hear Yesha, I think

282
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,780
to myself, that's Joshua, which is, you know,

283
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,460
except there's no J in the language that

284
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,600
that originated in.

285
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,520
Yeah, that's right.

286
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,740
So you would have a phonetic equivalent, right?

287
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,700
A phonetic equivalent.

288
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,200
I mean, uh, look, okay.

289
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,680
So my first name, Charles, fine.

290
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,760
Uh, but you might find Carlos.

291
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,600
You might find, uh, it should be, but

292
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,420
here, the proper thing, it would be Charles.

293
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,540
They wouldn't change it.

294
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,420
That would be the proper thing, but sometimes,

295
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,340
but if they change it, it's a nickname

296
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,540
just like, remember, there you go.

297
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,600
Well, that's, I was just going to say,

298
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,480
that's why I'm called Chuck.

299
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,060
But yeah.

300
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:57,360
Okay.

301
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,500
Fair enough.

302
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,340
A nickname, but that's the weird thing.

303
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,980
But then there's the legal name.

304
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,280
And then there's your name, which is different.

305
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,920
Yes, absolutely.

306
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,520
Okay.

307
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:07,900
Good.

308
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,260
I just wanted to hit that point.

309
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:09,900
Thank you.

310
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,060
Um, I would be, I would say that

311
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,240
that's who it would be because you have

312
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,440
to be pretty, pretty cool to walk around

313
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,760
with your head shaved and all the hair

314
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,580
shaved off for two years.

315
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,780
Yeah, that's, that's something.

316
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,240
I mean, you know, that's like that movie

317
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,660
powder.

318
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,220
Anyway.

319
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,320
Yeah, I'm out of shit.

320
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,580
I feel like doing that right now.

321
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,960
It doesn't, it's not that bad when you

322
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,880
shave off the hair, I guess.

323
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,100
Uh, anyhow, speaking of possession, uh, cause we

324
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,060
did talk about possession on a recent, uh,

325
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,220
Sonic, uh, what happens to people when they

326
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,920
have a so-called alcoholic blackout, they still

327
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,860
walk around, speak with people, maybe get into

328
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,800
a fight or do whatever stupid things, but

329
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,620
they don't remember anything the next day.

330
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,200
Is there a spiritual component there and possession,

331
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,120
or is it just simply intoxication by alcohol?

332
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,520
I am asking because not all the people

333
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,460
who get wasted experience of blackout.

334
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,440
Like for instance, I've been able to black

335
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,100
out, but I get no hangover now.

336
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,340
Uh, but blackouts are real super rare for

337
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:06,560
me.

338
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,200
And then again, there's other people that have

339
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,640
like, you know, they touch alcohol, they blackout,

340
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,740
they don't remember anything.

341
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,840
And sometimes I think they're making it up

342
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,360
and it's just an excuse, but go ahead.

343
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:16,660
Okay.

344
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,100
So that was your interjection.

345
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,400
That wasn't the whole question, right?

346
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,160
No, not at all.

347
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,400
I gave you the rest of the whole

348
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:21,740
question.

349
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,080
You know, he didn't pause enough there and

350
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,320
I didn't get enough air in between, but

351
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:26,900
I get it.

352
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,140
Okay.

353
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,260
So the general thing is that, well, I,

354
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,380
okay, let's just go back to the beginning

355
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,480
of the question, blacking out.

356
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,420
That's no different than someone waking up in

357
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,320
the hospital because they went through the windshield.

358
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,800
What I'm trying to say about that in

359
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,600
the spiritual world is they always tend to

360
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,200
look for people that are incapacitated somehow.

361
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,420
Uh, I know this, um, from observation and

362
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:53,120
accounts that when people are ill, uh, uh,

363
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,980
unstable mentally, you know, their mind is unstable

364
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,600
or they've been through physical trauma.

365
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,980
They're more apt, uh, to be, uh, oppressed,

366
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,740
influenced and possessed.

367
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,020
That's why a lot of people that have

368
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,320
severe drug addictions that were the point where

369
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,260
they, it, what would you call it?

370
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,220
Causes them physical and mental trauma.

371
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,160
They are more apt to being possessed because

372
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,680
they will almost always go into someone that

373
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,460
is disabled.

374
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,520
Okay.

375
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,360
Well, that makes sense.

376
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:24,540
Yeah.

377
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,440
Somebody who suffers trauma usually is more susceptible

378
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,220
to outside influence, all that kind of stuff.

379
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,860
Look, typical thing, right?

380
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,620
When people go, Oh, now I'm getting psychic

381
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,140
understandings after I got a head trauma, I

382
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,260
got hit by something.

383
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,980
I got these entities influence you directly.

384
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,140
That's because you're changing.

385
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,200
We we've been over this before once.

386
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,640
And then they, they, they fool you.

387
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:51,380
They hit you.

388
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,240
It's true.

389
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,460
I mean, you get to the point where

390
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,880
the cops want to talk to you to

391
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,800
find a missing body.

392
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,040
That's a bonafide, you know, what do you

393
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,380
call them?

394
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,000
Clairvoyant.

395
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:00,360
Right.

396
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,000
Uh, that's because they're doing it with you

397
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,120
because they don't want you to start figuring

398
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,740
out things.

399
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,200
They'd rather distract you with that.

400
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,140
I'm not saying it's a bad thing, uh,

401
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,960
but you know, just, just keep things in

402
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,500
perspective.

403
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,280
Well, it's like most things, it's not a

404
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,040
good or a bad thing.

405
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,160
You just have to know how to use

406
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:16,280
it.

407
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:16,520
Yeah.

408
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:18,820
Yeah.

409
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:19,920
Who's worse.

410
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,840
They're bank robbers or the cops that catch

411
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,620
the bank robbers.

412
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,180
You know, I mean, they're both, uh, both

413
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:25,800
as illegal.

414
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,040
They're both the police or everything.

415
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,040
The police do is just as illegal as

416
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,240
what the bank robbers are doing.

417
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,260
So everyone's going to applaud the police, right?

418
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:34,900
Mostly.

419
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,180
Yeah.

420
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,860
Except in the time, but they're both equal.

421
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,520
So, well, that's why I see no problem

422
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,540
with people celebrating people like John Dillinger when

423
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,320
he was robbing banks.

424
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,240
Cause it was kind of like, eh, why

425
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:44,580
not?

426
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,760
You know, he was so good at it

427
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,720
that he, he was supposedly shot here in

428
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,600
Tucson, but they shot some poor bastard in

429
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,900
the theater and said it was Dillinger.

430
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:52,920
Dillinger got away.

431
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,220
It was actually, it was, uh, well, just

432
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,560
like you've heard, uh, Ralph Epperson stuff about,

433
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,620
uh, the guy who shot Kennedy really became

434
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,960
a Senator, changed his name, right?

435
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,240
Well, there was that.

436
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,120
And there was also, uh, he had the

437
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,420
thing about the guy who shot, uh, Lincoln

438
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,140
actually.

439
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:10,560
Right.

440
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:10,820
Why?

441
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,200
I'm sorry.

442
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,040
Did I say Kennedy?

443
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:14,500
Lincoln.

444
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:15,660
Right.

445
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,120
Yeah.

446
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:16,700
Uh, booth.

447
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:17,540
Yeah.

448
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,120
Yeah.

449
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,400
And the guy who shot Kennedy, we don't

450
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,860
know who that is, but we have an

451
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,560
idea what, what fraternity they might've been in

452
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,300
most likely.

453
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:25,820
Right.

454
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,160
Right.

455
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:26,480
Okay.

456
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,760
I, I wasn't going to correct you on

457
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,280
the Kennedy thing, but yeah, I remember the

458
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,620
whole, there is a meme about Lincoln and

459
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,740
Kennedy back and forth.

460
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,260
Anyway, maybe that's where I got it.

461
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:34,640
Oh yeah.

462
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,600
Cause it's all backwards.

463
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,560
Uh, you know, a secretary named Kennedy and

464
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,080
Kennedy has a secretary named Lincoln.

465
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,060
Yeah.

466
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:40,580
Yeah.

467
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:40,680
Yeah.

468
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,620
That's so it's, it's interesting how that just

469
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,060
happened without even thinking about it.

470
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:44,280
You see?

471
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:44,820
Yes.

472
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,720
So, so anyway, uh, rolling the dice, when

473
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,820
you tell a normie about things outside of

474
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,020
their box, sometimes one will turn into an

475
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,340
agent Smith and really try to screw you

476
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:55,660
over.

477
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,820
Uh, that was something that they had to

478
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,340
say, because we're talking about, you know, trying

479
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,240
to talk to somebody normal, normal once in

480
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:01,480
a while.

481
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,740
And you talked about going out in public.

482
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,560
So that's where that came from.

483
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,320
Uh, what are your thoughts on that though?

484
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,600
I mean, they really try to screw you

485
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:07,820
over.

486
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,340
Is that just part of the game you

487
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:09,660
figure?

488
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,740
Or is that, yeah, it definitely, well, the

489
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,840
matrix is a, is a good movie on

490
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,140
many, many points, right?

491
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,500
Many aspects for a reason, you know, whether,

492
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,240
even if the normies say it, but a

493
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,160
real normie, by the way, like an NPC

494
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,580
won't see any value in the metaphors of

495
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,180
the matrix.

496
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,340
Do you ever notice that?

497
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:25,760
Yeah.

498
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,920
They just think it's an action movie.

499
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,900
So, uh, yeah, they try to screw with

500
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,320
you, but, uh, but don't try to screw

501
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,160
back because they can get pretty nasty.

502
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:36,860
They usually are.

503
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,400
We're talking about the majority of the people.

504
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,960
And unfortunately that majority is your family members

505
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,420
first.

506
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,000
Well, the important thing that everybody skips, even

507
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,540
when they're trying to over psychoanalyze everything else

508
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,300
is, you know, they tell them at a

509
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,440
certain point, Hey, look, don't forget all these

510
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,340
people you see, they are part of the

511
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,060
matrix now.

512
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:53,720
Yeah.

513
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,920
They're innocent people, but they're also part of

514
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,280
the matrix.

515
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,360
So maybe they're not innocent people.

516
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,740
So that's how you have to handle them.

517
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,900
Well, you see the lady in the red

518
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,220
dress look again, right?

519
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,540
And then she turns right.

520
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,000
Exactly.

521
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,320
But it's also part of your growing member.

522
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,700
This is not a real reality.

523
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,000
Um, I tested, I tested often.

524
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,160
Uh, but, but it's, it's a joke that

525
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,760
writes its own punchline.

526
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,720
Uh, when you test it, right.

527
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,680
So it's kind of like backfiring, but it's

528
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,540
not, it's not, it's not backfiring.

529
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,720
It's more like blowback.

530
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,140
That's the term.

531
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,880
The intelligence uses that blowback, like, you know,

532
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,120
cleaning something up, right?

533
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,860
Like when you botched something and you got

534
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,380
blowback and then you got to cover the

535
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,220
blowback and you got to cover the event

536
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,060
and all that problems coming back at you

537
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,900
for something you did, which is just normal.

538
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:43,900
That's just what happens.

539
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,440
Yeah.

540
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,200
And if here's the thing, if you deal

541
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,160
with a normie and they want to screw

542
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,300
with you back, what happened is it's a

543
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,160
good, it's a bad thing.

544
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,120
Cause they want to screw with you.

545
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,800
You don't want any malevolent energy, more malevolent

546
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,200
energy.

547
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,840
It's all malevolent here anyway.

548
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,720
Um, but what it actually means that you

549
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,000
slipped through the cracks because usually the system

550
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,500
prevents you from getting through to a normie

551
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,599
where they want to screw with you.

552
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,180
Right.

553
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,520
It usually separates, you create some kind of

554
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,700
distraction or a barrier where they just are

555
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,720
completely censored.

556
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:17,300
And they're like, when you're speaking that all

557
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,920
they hear is the Charlie Brown teacher voice.

558
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,240
Right.

559
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,599
Um, so, so somehow you got through to

560
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:25,800
them.

561
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,280
That's good in a way.

562
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,900
And also if they screw with you, you're

563
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,520
going to survive.

564
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,000
And even if you don't, it's still fine.

565
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,080
Um, that means that the system is getting,

566
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,760
the matrix is getting weaker.

567
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,840
Uh, right.

568
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,320
So, because typically talking to a normie, they

569
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,100
would just think you're crazy and brush you

570
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:43,460
off.

571
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,980
But if they want to screw with you,

572
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,620
there's a lot more going on than the

573
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,420
normal interaction with a normie.

574
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,840
Cause standard reaction is you're just an idiot.

575
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,400
Shut up.

576
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,860
It's like calling a call and show with

577
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,220
Hannity.

578
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,640
You're a loose nut or whatever, whatever he

579
00:17:59,640 --> 00:17:59,940
says.

580
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:00,680
Exactly.

581
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,500
So look, there's a long commentary here about,

582
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,300
uh, you know, the grandmother and they used

583
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,660
to do something about the eating.

584
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,340
You talked about, you know, uh, when it's

585
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,700
proper to eat certain things.

586
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,580
And what she says here is that it

587
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,700
seemed to work in reverse for her grandmother,

588
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,580
which causes another question to emerge.

589
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,200
And this is due to a conversation.

590
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,480
Everything is not one size fits all.

591
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,200
Is it possible that the exact opposite would

592
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,020
work with certain people compared to the way

593
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,420
you laid it out as far as when

594
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,040
to eat heavier, when to eat lighter and

595
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:35,400
when to transition, uh, yeah, but yeah, good.

596
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,760
No, you have to take into account the

597
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,800
constitution and condition of whoever is going to

598
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,600
be doing this, right?

599
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,360
Like, uh, an extreme example would be the,

600
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,900
the infant, the infirm and the elderly.

601
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,860
They typically, when you have an infant, someone

602
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,940
who's infirm or the elderly, they, you have

603
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,160
to make adjustments in that, in the family

604
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,600
for them.

605
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:55,780
Right.

606
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:56,340
Right.

607
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,000
Absolutely.

608
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,600
Yeah.

609
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,300
Even no matter where the moon is or

610
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,120
what the season is.

611
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,320
So you have to look at that.

612
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,140
Also, if it's the complete opposite, uh, it's

613
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,240
not, if you really have, um, the universal

614
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,500
principles are absolutes by the way, and you're

615
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,220
constantly being told there are no absolutes.

616
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:14,840
Yes, they are.

617
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,080
They are absolutes within the construct that we

618
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,760
live in within this, whatever reality we call,

619
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,600
we call reality universal principles are absolutes.

620
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,040
Just like when you're doing a math problem,

621
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:28,640
the numbers that you put in are absolutes.

622
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,760
In other words, they're going to work here.

623
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,060
They're going to work everywhere, right?

624
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,580
It's mathematics almost.

625
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,660
It isn't absolute.

626
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:40,320
So you're not diagnosing or assessing who gets

627
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,880
what, when, um, cause the principle is absolute,

628
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:44,920
right?

629
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:45,600
Okay.

630
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:46,980
I got it.

631
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,060
So they may change based on a condition,

632
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,460
but the principle is fine.

633
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,780
So in other words, it may be better

634
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,640
for one of those categories of types you

635
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,940
just brought up because they are the ones

636
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,360
that you definitely have to make an adjustment

637
00:19:59,360 --> 00:19:59,680
for.

638
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,840
They're saying to do the opposite.

639
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,860
That doesn't tell me that you see these

640
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,160
things.

641
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,900
Unfortunately, it's kind of like when you give,

642
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:11,520
when you talk about real history, people are

643
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,060
used to hearing it like a half hour

644
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:13,460
sitcom.

645
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,500
You know, they talk about for 20 minutes,

646
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,280
they talk about how bad everything was and

647
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,080
how it got fixed in the last two

648
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,680
minutes, right?

649
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,520
This is people are used to, uh, to

650
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,300
do real history.

651
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,260
It takes four hours to do an introduction,

652
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,980
four hours about any, just a single event,

653
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,600
four hours to pretty much go down and

654
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,180
what happened in four hours and how it

655
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:32,920
was covered up.

656
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,840
It's never, it's never simple.

657
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,620
Um, so these things are not simple, you,

658
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,840
but the, but you could, because they are

659
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,040
absolute universal principles are absolute.

660
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,220
You could break it down to what we

661
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,880
call expansive contractive, you know, yin and yang,

662
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,580
you know, up, uh, upward is yang, which

663
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,440
takes right.

664
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,140
This energy and downward is yin, which this

665
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,420
energy, the opposite would go to, those are

666
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,460
the principles, right?

667
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,480
So once you start applying those, uh, for

668
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,480
example, if the opposite worked for your grandmother,

669
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,860
she's probably either tall or short than normal,

670
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:08,500
right?

671
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,760
You take that into account.

672
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,860
She's not quote unquote, normal height.

673
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,980
So what would affect people of, um, of,

674
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,280
uh, in your family positively might affect her

675
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,440
negatively because she's extra tall or extra short.

676
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,540
Now, the reason I bring this up, I

677
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:27,180
recently visited someone's family and it was like

678
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,880
a nine, 10 and 12 year old child

679
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,540
at the door.

680
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,460
You know how the heights are, right?

681
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,040
And then the grandma came in and she

682
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,280
was as tall as the children.

683
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,380
That's really bizarre looking by the way.

684
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,780
Uh, and, uh, she was like almost 80.

685
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,980
So, you know, it's not, you know, definitely

686
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,360
we could have even been the great grandma.

687
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:44,980
I'm like, wow.

688
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,940
Um, the, the, obviously she grew up in

689
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,080
a very young environment in the mountainous area

690
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,780
and they did their posh students from Afghanistan.

691
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,140
Oh, well, there you go.

692
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:54,340
Right.

693
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,020
So yeah.

694
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,560
I mean, they go out and open toe

695
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,760
sandals in the snow.

696
00:21:59,440 --> 00:21:59,580
Right.

697
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,920
So yeah.

698
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,960
At, at 10,000 feet elevation, that's where

699
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,580
she was raised.

700
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,480
And the children were raised here and, you

701
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,160
know, gotten all the chemicals and they're way

702
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,220
bigger than they would have been.

703
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,960
That 12 year old girl would have been

704
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,720
the size of a, um, I mean the,

705
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,560
uh, the 12 year old girl in Afghanistan

706
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,140
would have been the size of the seven

707
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,100
year old here.

708
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,180
It's really small.

709
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:21,740
They're much smaller.

710
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:25,040
You ever noticed that yeah, certain people were

711
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,420
much smaller.

712
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,720
Remember, uh, if you've ever been to, um,

713
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,480
Charleston, Virginia or places where they still have

714
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,180
structures that were built in the 16 and

715
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,800
17 hundreds, you walk into the door and

716
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,120
you're like, why are the doors so short?

717
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,020
No, there's colonial parts of a Jersey that

718
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:38,720
still stand.

719
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,440
Like if you go to the Washington slept

720
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,480
here house, the original dimensions on stuff are

721
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,240
smaller.

722
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,300
They just were the preserved pieces of it

723
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:47,880
are smaller.

724
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,160
Yeah.

725
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:48,580
Yeah.

726
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,580
Cause they didn't have, um, they didn't have

727
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,280
all the chemicals in the environment, which are

728
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,120
what expansive.

729
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:54,940
Right.

730
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:55,780
Right.

731
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,940
And they're going to, they're going to really

732
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,660
get into the people that are young.

733
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,100
You're right.

734
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,720
They're going to really get into the people.

735
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,320
It's much like a marshmallow, right?

736
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,980
Because it's, it's still a lot of sugar.

737
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,440
But that sugar cube contains more sugar in

738
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,280
a smaller space.

739
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,360
It's just a giant marshmallow.

740
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:11,700
Yeah.

741
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,520
But the interesting thing about sugar though, it

742
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,160
will not really expand you.

743
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,280
It will actually deteriorate you because the sugar

744
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,580
being a natural chemical, let's say a refined

745
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,700
sugar, let's call it a chemical or corn,

746
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:27,140
corn syrup, refined sugar, or refined corn syrup,

747
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,940
or beat, whatever is all the same.

748
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,180
What happens is when it gets into the

749
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:34,880
body, that sugar wants to go and be

750
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,180
attached to starches and minerals and water, just

751
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,300
like it was when it was in the

752
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:39,800
sugar cane.

753
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,960
So you could pretty much see when you

754
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,820
have a refined food product, what it will,

755
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,840
how much it will deplete from your body

756
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,580
when you trace it back and see where

757
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,660
it was taken from.

758
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,200
So if it was taken from a sweetener

759
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,920
taken from a complex plant, it's going to

760
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,080
take more from your body than if it

761
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,660
was taken from, let's say a microbe or

762
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,720
a bacteria, which is very basic, it won't

763
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,440
take much to satisfy it.

764
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:04,660
Right.

765
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:05,120
Right.

766
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,020
You see my point?

767
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,440
So this is universal principle again.

768
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,720
And it always works.

769
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,820
That's, what's great about it.

770
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,960
So, and it's very rare that people start

771
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,280
hearing this kind of talk and, and get

772
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,560
it right from the very beginning.

773
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,540
It takes constant observation, practice and counsel and

774
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,040
discussion.

775
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,580
So my analogy wasn't, yeah, my analogy wasn't

776
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,400
about the content or the sugar.

777
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,320
My analogy was about how you take something

778
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,620
and you sort of blow it up bigger,

779
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,460
even though it's got less of what the

780
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,540
other thing has in it.

781
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,300
In other words, there can be a more

782
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:42,400
compact and efficient version of something as opposed

783
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,140
to the, something that's sort of just blown

784
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:44,420
up.

785
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,960
And a marshmallow is a great example because

786
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,240
that's basically like a sugar cube, blown up

787
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,160
a big old marshmallow.

788
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,380
And that's what people have become like big

789
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:51,820
marshmallows.

790
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,140
Yeah.

791
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,000
Mars, but actually marshmallow, believe it or not,

792
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,700
is, well, there's natural marshmallow is, I'm not

793
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,220
trying to be contrary.

794
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,480
It's actually a complex thing.

795
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,760
You ever see the ingredients in that?

796
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,520
Yeah.

797
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,460
But the, the old ones I'm talking about,

798
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,180
not the, you know.

799
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:03,560
Yeah.

800
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:04,420
Yeah.

801
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,260
I used to, we used to like, uh,

802
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,760
like when they used to catch fire, blow

803
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,260
them out right away with that carbon on

804
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,860
the outside or melted on the inside.

805
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,140
Never, never quite burned you caused any harm,

806
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,480
but it was a get tired of it.

807
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,280
I think white people have a thing called

808
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,380
s'mores or something.

809
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,800
I never had one of those.

810
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,920
So anyway, but yeah.

811
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:23,820
Yeah.

812
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,620
They take the hot marshmallow, they stick it

813
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,420
with, uh, you know, some Hershey bar or

814
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:30,420
something and a cracker and a cookie or

815
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:30,740
something.

816
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,000
Yeah.

817
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:31,800
I get it.

818
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,080
Yeah.

819
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,700
It lets you hold it.

820
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:32,880
Right.

821
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,200
Yeah.

822
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,060
But the universal prince, you got anything else

823
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,020
by the way?

824
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,680
No, the universal principles, that's why they call

825
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,720
them universal principles.

826
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,640
They work everywhere.

827
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,600
Uh, but the thing is, unless you, this

828
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,400
is my advice, unless you're actively discussing it

829
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,100
in groups or have a council or I'm

830
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,460
not going to study, I don't know where

831
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,300
you're going to go to study.

832
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,320
You're going to have to find a, an

833
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,240
old library because there's nothing online about it.

834
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,460
I mean, there is, there is stuff online,

835
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:03,940
but Oh my gosh, it's when people you're

836
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,300
not in the heyday of the internet.

837
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,400
Like what would you say the internet was

838
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,720
like between 2003 and 2013 for finding stuff.

839
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:11,980
Yep.

840
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:12,820
Yeah.

841
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,500
For using it.

842
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,380
Yeah.

843
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:14,900
Yeah.

844
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,480
So it's, uh, you know, I was speaking

845
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,420
with someone recently about, uh, they, they, they

846
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,260
knew Shizuko and Michio Kushi and all that.

847
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,240
I don't mean to be Jap, you know,

848
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,020
uh, Nipa, Nipa, Nipo centric.

849
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,520
Nippon is the proper name for Japanese.

850
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,360
Uh, where they used to call nips.

851
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:34,600
Right.

852
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,580
In world war two, um, the, uh, uh,

853
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,240
centric, but it is one, a good way

854
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:41,600
to start.

855
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,720
There's the Vita's the Vedas, uh, which is

856
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,280
a good place.

857
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,020
Also, if you can get through, no one's

858
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,720
really compiled them because the purpose of the

859
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,860
Vedas was to distract and destroy an entire

860
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,040
generation here when they brought it, the West,

861
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,480
the intelligence agencies forced it upon the movements

862
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,080
in the sixties and seventies, right.

863
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,080
It was to make people crazy.

864
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,780
So, but anyway, if you can get to

865
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,680
the core of stuff, I know someone that

866
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,180
was familiar with the same people that I

867
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:06,900
learned it from.

868
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,340
And I said, can you really do it?

869
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,060
And can you teach it?

870
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,020
Because the reason I'm asking you is maybe

871
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,640
we should get together and do like a

872
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,280
couple of short once a month groups where

873
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,880
people can come and discuss, you know, quote

874
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,040
unquote macro macrobiotic principles or Taoist principles, universal

875
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,260
principles, because you can't go online and find

876
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,000
much, you know, you go online and tell

877
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,400
you, well, this is a list of yin

878
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,000
things and this is a list of yang

879
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,380
things.

880
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,260
So what?

881
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,640
So what?

882
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:34,340
Right.

883
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,100
Right.

884
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,040
I mean, it's like going to military and

885
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,520
these are the lists of the weapons that

886
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,000
we have.

887
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,360
And this is a list of the weapons

888
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,000
the enemy has.

889
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,500
So what, how do you use it?

890
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,960
This is what we have in the grocery

891
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,360
store.

892
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:44,900
Okay.

893
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:45,920
Yeah.

894
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,060
It's amazing.

895
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,020
It's like, just because you go grocery shopping

896
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,400
doesn't mean you could cook the stuff when

897
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,980
you get home.

898
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:51,340
Right.

899
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:51,880
That too.

900
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,580
And the only way to do it is

901
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:57,000
with direction and people sharing experiences because you,

902
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,260
then you'll learn how to combine things, combine

903
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,180
your point of views, your observations, and being

904
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:01,660
objective.

905
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,640
To give you an example, like one thing

906
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,560
with the water device.

907
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,220
Now, what we're doing is I have, yeah,

908
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,960
I'm going to say at a university greenhouse

909
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,860
type situation, agriculture and another university that does

910
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,960
hydrodynamics and what, and approaching them and saying,

911
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,460
I want you guys to check this device

912
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,040
out and just tell us what it does.

913
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:24,780
We, because we can't really say what it

914
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,800
does because we invented it.

915
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,700
But when I say we, the corporate me,

916
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,600
uh, we invented it and have been observing

917
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,760
it and real happy with it.

918
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,400
So I can no longer be objective.

919
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,720
I can only be subjective.

920
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,600
It's kind of like a chick started laughing

921
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,080
when I talk.

922
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,400
It's like, like when you have a child

923
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,160
or a kid, um, and someone asks you,

924
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,840
tell me about your child or your kid.

925
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,580
You're going to say they're great.

926
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,080
They're smart.

927
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:48,920
They're good looking.

928
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,520
They're intelligent.

929
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:50,140
Right?

930
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,320
But if you drop them off with someone

931
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,440
who's never seen them before, they're going to

932
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,840
give you a much more objective reassessment of

933
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,460
your child or kid than you would, because

934
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,700
every parent tends to think their children are

935
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,260
good looking, smart and whatever.

936
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:04,640
Right?

937
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,720
So you see the point?

938
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,540
So if I don't tell you anything about

939
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,060
it, just drop it off and you tell

940
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,960
me, and then I can have a more

941
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,300
intentional.
