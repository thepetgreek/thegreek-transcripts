1
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:24,130
This is Sonic Event 1, and why am I saying it?

2
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:26,990
Because we are now in Rated-Y territory.

3
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:32,290
What do I mean? Well, if you're hearing this, then you know what I mean.

4
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:39,410
This is the exclusive thing that you signed up for, so here we are.

5
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:45,570
And it's going to be a little different than the older episodic events,

6
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:49,550
because they were described as episodes, and then they were described as chapters.

7
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,990
I forget why it is that was done, but that kept things in order.

8
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,570
And yet again, this is something else.

9
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:02,150
So this is Sonic Event 1 of Ocelli in the Greek, Rated-Y.

10
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,810
Anyway, as I said, a little bit different.

11
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:12,610
Yeah, it's going to be, let's say, 1 to 999, let's say.

12
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,910
It'll be easier maybe to do the number.

13
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,050
Each Sonic Event has a number, so we can easily say, hey, that's on Sonic Event 3,

14
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:26,690
or on number 4, or number 5, and we'll say 1 through 999.

15
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,690
So there you go.

16
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,150
Look, it's just a matter of filing them away and putting them in order.

17
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,990
But are they to be filed away?

18
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:40,470
We've covered a lot of territory and haven't been doing it that much lately,

19
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,870
although you appeared on my show a few times, and that was done for the public,

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,970
and this was sort of proposed.

21
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:52,630
And I'll tell you, I'm actually really excited because, again,

22
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,610
you talk about different things privately than you do publicly, you know.

23
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,310
We can, yeah.

24
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:04,530
Rated-Y, as in a pun on after Rated-X, and also WH-Y.

25
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:10,230
I was thinking of just doing two asterisks, you know, and then the Y, but Rated-Y.

26
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:14,950
And the whole thing is about we're going to be asking why, actually,

27
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:19,050
who's we, if you ask why, you're at the right place,

28
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,670
because we're all trying to figure it out.

29
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,550
The only thing is when you sort it out and you can present it and communicate it,

30
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,010
it doesn't mean you've figured it out.

31
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,570
It just seems like it just shows that you can do that.

32
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,470
You can sort things out and communicate them.

33
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:37,190
So by all means, I want to stay open with whoever is listening to this

34
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,530
to give us feedback, questions, all this, that, and the other.

35
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,870
We're still putting this together.

36
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:47,650
So basically, to reach Chuck at Ocelli.com, right, you'll have a contact.

37
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:53,950
And to reach me at UncommonSenseRadio1 at gmail.com, which is the number one.

38
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:58,590
And eventually, we'll probably have an email that does both of us or something,

39
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:04,110
but we also rely on feedback from whoever is here to either stop talking

40
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,850
about something or talk about something else a little bit more, so.

41
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:08,570
Right.

42
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,690
You know, if you're on my website, pretty easy.

43
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:16,110
There's a little email icon somewhere that you'll be able to,

44
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,770
I think it's up in the upper right-hand corner most likely, if you need to reach me.

45
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,890
And we will share our contacts with each other.

46
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,710
So if you do just find your way to write to me or you find your way to write

47
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:31,930
to the Greek, we'll figure it out, obviously, and share these things as we talk,

48
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:35,110
well, without recording it for the most part.

49
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:40,310
But that way, we'll have some guidance as to what is being received, I guess.

50
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,530
And that's an important thing.

51
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,790
And I like how we start off with the question why.

52
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,630
Got to tell you, I've explored a lot of different topics over the years,

53
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,710
a lot of mysterious things, you know, in some people's minds.

54
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:58,050
They don't understand what happened during an event, this or that.

55
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:01,490
I mean, I always go to the JFK thing because that's something I spent a lot of years on.

56
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:05,690
So I'm very familiar with the ins and outs of it.

57
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:12,430
And, you know, one of the questions that's almost never asked is why did this happen?

58
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,210
You know, people want the details.

59
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:20,290
People want to get into the more exciting parts of this or that or the third thing.

60
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:25,950
But quite often, they don't ask why this extraordinary event occurred,

61
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:30,530
this interesting event, this rarefied event, whatever it might be.

62
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,990
I mean, it could be a solar eclipse or it could be an assassination

63
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,710
or it could be a political movement.

64
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,550
A lot of people don't ask why something happened.

65
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:44,350
And I always find that to be a little disheartening

66
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:49,070
because I think it's often the most important question, you know,

67
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,350
and everything else sort of follows after it in my mind.

68
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:52,830
I don't know.

69
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,350
Maybe I'm wrong about that, Patrick.

70
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,650
No, it's not.

71
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,050
Well, no, it's not about being right or wrong on that.

72
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:02,710
It's just what can we put together to see why that's happening.

73
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:11,830
And if we harken back to a lot of the older Ocelli in the Greek sonics,

74
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:16,430
you'll see me basically using the term moron and juvenile and whatever,

75
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:17,770
those kinds of terms.

76
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,210
I'm not using those as pejoratives.

77
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,270
I just, if I could find a better word to deliver, you know,

78
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,690
the cause of the message, I will.

79
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:29,750
But in essence, this is a very, very juvenile society,

80
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,090
a very juvenile, meaning childish.

81
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,750
You know, if you're in the biblical text, the ancient text,

82
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,930
men are referred to as children, right?

83
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:41,050
If you've watched anything like in the public media,

84
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,690
they speak to you like you're a child.

85
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,530
It goes that way all the way across.

86
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:52,570
So the juvenile nature of society and the way humans have been,

87
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,550
let's say, all the way back is the status quo.

88
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:02,430
So one way to look at the why is to not only why it happened, okay,

89
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,610
like we could talk about, let's say 9-11 was a textbook.

90
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,670
This is very serious about this.

91
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,930
It was a textbook nuclear demolition textbook.

92
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,770
I mean, if you were to look in a textbook how to do it,

93
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:14,870
that's exactly what happened.

94
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,550
But it doesn't seem so obvious.

95
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:20,810
But once you understand how a textbook nuclear demolition works,

96
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:21,590
it's all underground.

97
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,430
There's a lady that puts out a book, I forgot her name, doctor or whatever,

98
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,110
about using weapons from space and all that.

99
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,710
And when they asked her about it being nuclear, she says,

100
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:32,470
oh, blinded by the light.

101
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:36,810
Well, she fails to recognize that it's all of the,

102
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:40,850
90% of the nuclear testing after it began started to go only underground

103
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:44,290
and be studied what happens with nukes underground only.

104
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,910
And that's how they decided to use them.

105
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:51,030
So why did I bring that up as an example?

106
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:56,610
So I can very emphatically show you how it was a nuclear demolition.

107
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,470
But I can't tell you why, right?

108
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,710
Why they did it.

109
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,770
There could be many reasons.

110
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,590
You could speculate whether it was economic, social engineering,

111
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:10,750
whatever, religious, to get the, let's say, some kind of ritual or whatever.

112
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:14,050
That's very difficult to surmise.

113
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:16,550
And the same thing with the assassination with JFK,

114
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,010
which is your specialty, Chuck.

115
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:23,110
We know he was, anyone, you know, even just hearing about it

116
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,070
in the public media, it was a gunshot wound and it was fatal.

117
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,750
And then you could backtrack and then it's like, who did it?

118
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,510
We could pretty much figure out who did it.

119
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:33,590
In other words, there was more than one shooter, right?

120
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:36,070
And where they shot was not what we're being told.

121
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:38,830
But why, again, was it financial?

122
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:39,750
Was it personal?

123
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:44,030
Was it purely, you know, purely any one of those things, political or whatever?

124
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,910
No, we don't really know.

125
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:52,610
So exploring the why is difficult, but until you establish how,

126
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,250
what really happened, right?

127
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,210
And then the why is the preferential part.

128
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,290
Well, not only is it the preferential part, and, you know, again,

129
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:06,710
I urge you to add to this, but the why can also give you a roadmap,

130
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:11,530
a path forward, because once you understand the why of something occurring,

131
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,110
then it'll make sense when other things happen.

132
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,630
See, pattern, recognition of patterns.

133
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:22,170
I mean, this is part of the nature of the beast, so to speak, right?

134
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:22,990
This is all of us.

135
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,150
We recognize patterns.

136
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:29,090
So if we know the why of exactly why an event occurred,

137
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:33,330
if we know what the motivation was for it to happen,

138
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:36,030
and we know that that motivation persists,

139
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:40,010
then we can get an idea about, well, what might come next,

140
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,929
what also might be part of that pattern.

141
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:48,290
So isn't that a way of unlocking not only historical events

142
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:52,230
and understanding their motivation, but also understanding things moving forward,

143
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,310
or do you think I'm off about that?

144
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:58,870
No, not too off, but the thing is, I think that historic events repeat,

145
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,390
and I'm going to give a plug here, which is unusual.

146
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,310
There's a guy named Jason Breshears,

147
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,950
and I'm sure most people listening might have heard.

148
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,010
He has a channel called Archaics.

149
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:15,090
He's a Texas country meets the internet, so some people don't like to listen.

150
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:20,190
I particularly like to listen only because he has an intelligent,

151
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,710
let's say, dissertations.

152
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,430
He's a chronologist.

153
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:31,790
He has something called palindromes, which is a palindrome is like 6-1-6.

154
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:33,410
When you run it forward, it's 6-1-6.

155
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,930
If you run it backwards, it's 6-1-6 in time.

156
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:40,330
But the interesting thing that caught me with him is that he said

157
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,650
that 1998 is a very key year for doing palindromes.

158
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,890
Now, if anyone's listened to Ochoa in the Greek,

159
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,050
I think since the beginning, even before we got together,

160
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,530
I was always hammering what year?

161
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:55,250
1998 as the end of time, and everything after that is the credits, right?

162
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,190
So that perked me up.

163
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,550
He's got a couple of interesting things,

164
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:01,150
and the other thing that he turned me on to, or the audience,

165
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:08,850
that was, I think, his major work is every 138 years,

166
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,230
something appears in the sky.

167
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:15,210
And every fourth time, the 552 years, it does a lot of damage.

168
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:18,230
That's where you get the red rains, the mud flood, people disappearing,

169
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:22,990
you know, stuff written about worlds in collision,

170
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:28,370
and a lot of the Charles Fort that I've also mentioned speaks about that.

171
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:33,370
I'd never had the 138 Phoenix cycle.

172
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:38,590
Last time it happened was 1902, but all the elite went underground

173
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:41,070
because it goes after the elite, basically.

174
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,790
And this has been going on since time immemorial.

175
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:51,450
But I kept always saying there's several biblical chronologists

176
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:56,170
that I've looked at, and there's something called a cursed earth period.

177
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:59,970
It's every 440 years, and I've always discussed the 400 year,

178
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,850
not in depth because I'm not a chronologist, you see.

179
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,950
He's a chronologist, and he's got mapped out.

180
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:08,090
He spent 27 years in prison accessing old books.

181
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:08,890
That's a lot of time.

182
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:13,170
So when you get to the biblical stuff with him, I'm just going to,

183
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,910
because people, I know, once they start looking,

184
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,510
they're going to say that we're very contrary in a lot of things.

185
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:25,650
He has taken his biblical comments a little too far in terms of not like personal,

186
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:30,170
but in other words, he has not dealt in the documents long enough

187
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:33,010
or objectively enough with the original languages.

188
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:37,870
And he's basically taken the academic, let's say, side,

189
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:41,630
which is it was all written much later by other authors and all this.

190
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:44,290
And he doesn't know that there was no crucifixion.

191
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,670
He doesn't know about this and that.

192
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:51,530
So on the religious side, he falls pretty, he's confabulated a lot.

193
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:55,130
And what I mean by that, and this is by no way a negative criticism

194
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,230
this is just an objective criticism.

195
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:02,830
What happens when you introduce a subject in public or private to a group of people,

196
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:07,030
and you're the only one that knows about that, anything about that subject,

197
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,890
and it's just very surface to the others.

198
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,990
You can pretty much say anything about that.

199
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,510
And if you sound authoritarian and start making stuff up,

200
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:17,610
the other people will believe you because you, you know,

201
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:20,230
the first two details you brought up impressed them so much.

202
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,390
So the rest you could confabulate, you know,

203
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:27,510
make up stuff and make something that's hyperbole or whatever sounds factual

204
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,790
and the people will believe it.

205
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,030
Well, they do that all the time in the public media.

206
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:36,190
And in what they call the education system, which I call the cognitive,

207
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,890
you know, there's cognitive dissonance.

208
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:42,170
But I call the education system cognitive depravity.

209
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,090
So he doesn't like the education system either.

210
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:47,610
So a lot of people are saying I need to go listen to him in that way.

211
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:50,770
But I and then I come back with all the comments that I gave now

212
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,850
because he's blowing up.

213
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,250
In other words, he had 300 subscribers a year ago,

214
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:55,950
and now he's at 90,000 on YouTube.

215
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,710
Archaics, Jason Brashears.

216
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:04,410
I'm plugging him as a chronologist with the 138-year Phoenix cycle,

217
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,390
and the next time it's coming is 2040.

218
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:12,670
So I just wanted to give this, because this is, as we're starting out in our first episode,

219
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:15,070
so why is he referring us to go listen to other stuff?

220
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:19,550
Well, the reason why is because that is the only thing that has come across my table,

221
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,690
let's say, or keyboard in the past decade or more,

222
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:26,810
maybe 20 years or so, that I find worth absorbing.

223
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,550
The Phoenix phenomenon, because it lines up very much,

224
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:33,090
if you understand, if you read a lot of the biblical texts,

225
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,890
all these phenomenon that are going to be happening,

226
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:40,430
it lines up very much with his quote unquote chronology.

227
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:43,030
And it gets into a lot of the vapor canopy,

228
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,250
which I have not done publicly,

229
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:48,790
which was the time of Noah, where we lived in,

230
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:51,150
basically there was an ocean in the sky,

231
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,530
and it collapsed during the major flood.

232
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:57,610
That's why people all over the world have that flood myth, right?

233
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,790
So anyway, I just wanted to bring him up,

234
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,230
because I might be referring, as we go on,

235
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,450
to some of his work in terms of the palindromes.

236
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:13,230
And what caught my ear is someone was actually astute enough to say,

237
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,630
hey, look, he says 1998 is a critical year.

238
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,990
Haven't you been saying that, right?

239
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,370
I think, Chuck, you remember also.

240
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,330
He's saying the fall of 1998 was when time ended,

241
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:26,090
meaning time as time progressing into new eras and new epics, right?

242
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:29,810
So in other words, the movie ended at 1998,

243
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:31,250
but the film is still running.

244
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:35,030
Well, that always happens when the movie ends,

245
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,330
the film is still running, right?

246
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:36,750
Right.

247
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,330
It's called the credits.

248
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:39,170
Right.

249
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:43,950
Although sometimes they have a post-credits scene

250
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:47,950
or a, you know, during the credits scene that they add in.

251
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,690
You know, the bonus piece,

252
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:54,730
which gives you an indicator, usually, of something that's yet to come.

253
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,310
And it's funny, because when we did this a few years ago,

254
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,230
I hadn't thought of it.

255
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:04,150
But do we have sort of a post-credit or during the credit extra scene

256
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:05,990
that's going to come up here?

257
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,310
Because I'm thinking to myself often what happens,

258
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,070
and many people have made this observation,

259
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,290
it's not just me, but quite frankly,

260
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:18,250
Hollywood does indicate a lot of things prophetically.

261
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,690
You know, they normalize things and talk about things

262
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,070
quite ahead of when they happen,

263
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,390
and they present it as fiction.

264
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,530
And then a lot of people notice later,

265
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:32,190
you know, that was in a movie 10 years ago, 20 years ago, et cetera.

266
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:35,290
So I'm wondering if somebody caught onto that

267
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:36,830
and actually said, you know,

268
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:39,810
there's going to be something that's going to be easily observable

269
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:43,970
that'll be presented during the credit part of the film,

270
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,390
which, you know, runs a few minutes.

271
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,710
You know, at the end of any film, it runs a few minutes,

272
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,230
even when they shorten the credits, right?

273
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,030
Well, let's look at it from this point.

274
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,310
From a universal standpoint, you know,

275
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,810
the cosmic censorship or the cosmic realm,

276
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:00,690
which is beyond our world, let's say,

277
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,930
I'm not talking about space, I'm talking about, you know,

278
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:05,050
we could have a parallel world here.

279
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,430
It's just a different type of physicality, right?

280
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,470
The spiritual world and all that.

281
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:13,710
In that order, you know how you have, let's say, local,

282
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,690
the way you do things in your town,

283
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,790
and then you have the state, and then you have the federal,

284
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,190
then you have international law?

285
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:22,350
This would be more on the side of international law.

286
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:25,250
Like, it's the entire world encompassing,

287
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:28,030
not what each little geographic area has,

288
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,510
is what I'm trying to say here.

289
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:32,210
In a cosmic perspective,

290
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,650
knowledge and information is just that.

291
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,930
It's not separated as fact or fiction.

292
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:42,330
So, if you have a notion that, let's say, I don't know,

293
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,510
you could pick in your own mind,

294
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,950
we don't even have to give an example,

295
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,230
something that they've shown in Hollywood as fiction

296
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,490
that later has come true,

297
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,630
or is parallel to something that comes true.

298
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,550
Let's say the movie The Matrix, right?

299
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:53,470
Or something like that.

300
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,450
A lot of people have been saying

301
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,790
we're in a matrix kind of thing.

302
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,450
Okay, from a cosmic perspective,

303
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,130
when information is given,

304
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,210
it doesn't matter if it's fact or fiction,

305
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:07,970
is the recipient received a notion

306
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:10,990
or a concept of something that they didn't have before?

307
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:13,410
And what that concept they received,

308
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:16,329
is it done with enough accuracy and detail

309
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:18,410
that they actually, you know,

310
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,810
it forms a complete thought, right?

311
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:23,510
It's very much, let's say another way to say it,

312
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:24,630
it's in your face, right?

313
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:29,890
So, there is no fact or fiction in the cosmic perspective

314
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:33,390
because when you think that anything can be possible,

315
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:35,690
the, what you think, let's say,

316
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,690
if you went back in time

317
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,670
and talked about some of the technology we have today,

318
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:41,610
that was thought as being impossible, you see.

319
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:46,150
So, when Hollywood shows this, you know,

320
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:49,190
like the elite invented science fiction, right?

321
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:53,090
Not to show particular type of alien or particular type,

322
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,870
but just to show that we're not bound by gravity,

323
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:58,230
we're not bound by this material, you know,

324
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,130
like creatures walk through walls, things like that.

325
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:05,270
Okay, that is all, we have not done that openly in public,

326
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:09,270
but since we understand that a flying saucer

327
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,250
come down and land,

328
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:13,330
whether it's marked as fiction or not is irrelevant

329
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,110
from a cosmic perspective.

330
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:18,510
So, you can say that humans know about flying saucers

331
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:21,850
landing with little beings from Mars on the earth

332
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,050
from a cosmic perspective.

333
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,450
They already aware of that,

334
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,190
whether it's fact or fiction is irrelevant.

335
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:29,230
And that's understood by Hollywood

336
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,130
because Hollywood is like, you know,

337
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,190
or the media is what?

338
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,170
The third or fourth,

339
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:35,230
that would be the fourth branch of government, they say,

340
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:35,670
right?

341
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:36,410
Something like that.

342
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:38,070
Fourth estate, they often say, yeah.

343
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,410
Fourth estate, okay, there you go.

344
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:42,370
So, one thing I wanna stress,

345
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,370
and I have been in the past,

346
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,110
especially with previous sonic events,

347
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:50,110
is I bring up some things that sounded really askew

348
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,290
or tangential and not possible.

349
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:53,770
And when people looked into it,

350
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,010
and actually some of the things

351
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,850
that I said that you can do,

352
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,970
things that were never thought of or seemed impossible

353
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:02,110
are now brought down to the practical level.

354
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:03,510
So, in the beginning,

355
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,730
it's marked as fiction or opinion,

356
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,330
and then it becomes something usable.

357
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,610
And we're gonna get into that.

358
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:12,050
I might wanna read some of a email I got recently.

359
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,030
Someone is a writer,

360
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:17,190
and he's basically, when he found out we're redoing this,

361
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:18,630
he was like, why bother?

362
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:21,250
You know, it's like none of the alternative media people

363
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:25,230
have done anything that means a hill of beans or anything.

364
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,710
Everything's still the same, right?

365
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:30,510
So, obviously, he didn't listen to a lot of the other stuff

366
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:33,490
that I've done, and I don't blame him at all,

367
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:35,950
because here's an interesting thing.

368
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,970
When you tell people what to do,

369
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,650
they don't like that, so they don't do it.

370
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:42,370
If you give them a hint on doing something,

371
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,490
they may not get the hint and they don't do it.

372
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:48,590
So, there's something in between telling someone

373
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:51,270
they should do this or may do this or could do this,

374
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,530
and just talking about it as a hint.

375
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,470
So, there's something in between that we'll explore,

376
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,770
because, ultimately, it's all based on action.

377
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:05,350
So, I'm expecting doing this with you in a non-public way

378
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:09,970
is to actually impart more things that people can do,

379
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:13,070
should do, or may do, or find out about

380
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,690
that will improve, quote-unquote, their lives here.

381
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,490
Well, I always found it interesting when people said,

382
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,290
you know, look, you can go for instruction,

383
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:22,250
you can learn, and somebody can teach you

384
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,990
the how-to and so on, and quite often,

385
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:28,390
no matter what you attempted to educate somebody about,

386
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,110
whether it was very practical knowledge

387
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,970
or if it was something just purely academic,

388
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:35,430
it was irrelevant, it seemed to me as though

389
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:39,310
the people that, and I do despise this as a profession,

390
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,390
but there are people out there that are

391
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:44,710
what they call inspirational speakers, right?

392
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,710
But I think the term is sound.

393
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:52,510
I think the action is corrupt and absolutely ridiculous

394
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:55,410
since people just being fleeced, you know,

395
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:58,150
under the guise of, they make them feel good,

396
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,690
so they wind up turning over their money,

397
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,610
which is, you know, the profession of a lot of people,

398
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,690
whether it's a stripper or it's, you know, a musician,

399
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,330
right, you make people feel good, they end up with money.

400
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,750
Well, they just help the, well, the stripper

401
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,430
is stripping why?

402
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,270
To help themselves.

403
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:10,870
Well, of course.

404
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,570
The guys like Anthony Robbins, not to mention any names

405
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:16,670
or whatever, they're ultimately to help themselves

406
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,090
and most of their stuff doesn't work.

407
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,530
It makes you feel good at the moment.

408
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,510
Right, but the thing is the idea

409
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:24,190
of an inspirational speaker, though, is very sound

410
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:27,970
because if you inspire someone to take an action,

411
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,450
then you've actually accomplished something

412
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:32,990
because as you said, if you tell them what to do,

413
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,770
there's people that are more or less,

414
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,830
and I'm one of those people who's more resistant

415
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,150
when I'm being told what to do,

416
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:41,570
I automatically have a resistance.

417
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,110
Like even if something is popular,

418
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,790
I've always been like, you know what,

419
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,330
that's the thing I wanna be nowhere near.

420
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:49,170
You know, people tell me, you've gotta see this.

421
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,830
I go, yeah, I've gotta not see it.

422
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:51,970
You know what I mean?

423
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,570
Like, I automatically default to that.

424
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:57,170
And I think a lot of people have that tendency in them

425
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:59,810
to different degrees, but like you said,

426
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,290
if you give somebody a hint, they say,

427
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,950
well, that's a hint, that's not quite enough.

428
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:06,030
But if you sort of lay it out somewhere in between,

429
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,450
like you said, I think that becomes inspiration

430
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:13,530
or, you know, and this may sound esoteric to some people,

431
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:19,950
but the idea of the muse who inspires something, right?

432
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:24,410
And we talked about muses before even, you and I,

433
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:28,610
and that concept, but that is the thing

434
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:30,290
that actually creates what?

435
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:32,950
The art, the thing that somebody seizes upon

436
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,830
and does it their way with their talents,

437
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,990
with what they have available to them.

438
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:43,050
And really, the thing that gets things moving in a,

439
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,130
again, I hate to use these words,

440
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,390
but I don't have many others,

441
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:49,450
in a progressive direction, whether it's art

442
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:52,230
or it's construction or anything else,

443
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:56,790
is if you inspire someone who already wishes

444
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,730
to take action, right?

445
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:03,150
And also the why, why do we wanna inspire people?

446
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,190
Ah, okay, now we're back to that why.

447
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,990
I might wanna give that out because,

448
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,350
you know, charity begins at home.

449
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:11,070
You take care of, you know, like in the airplane,

450
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,190
if the oxygen mask dropped down,

451
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,710
you put your mask on first,

452
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:17,290
and then you help the people next to you.

453
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:22,210
But also, I believe that when this concept is understood,

454
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:25,290
like I say, if half the people of the world

455
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:26,550
help just one person,

456
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,570
well, then the whole world's taken care of, you see?

457
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,270
A third, each one would have to help two.

458
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:33,370
So, but here's the thing,

459
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,850
I'm doing it for actually selfish reasons,

460
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,310
and this is what I mean.

461
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:42,670
I can't, I have spent most of my life since nine years old,

462
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,550
knowing that I gotta put a protective layer around myself,

463
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:49,610
not an armor, because these people are nuts around me,

464
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:49,950
right?

465
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:53,230
But if I figure out something,

466
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,050
a better way of doing something,

467
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,730
and I show someone else and they do it,

468
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,090
well, then everybody around me is doing something better,

469
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:02,950
and that ends up being better for me

470
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:05,130
because, you see, right?

471
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:07,350
Because then everybody around me has improved.

472
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,530
Now, you know,

473
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,850
yeah, so like if you ride the public bus,

474
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:13,510
and you make sure.

475
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:14,710
Yeah, I was just gonna say,

476
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,030
I encourage it a different way,

477
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,230
and it's the same concept.

478
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:19,410
I talk about the random act of kindness,

479
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:24,230
whereas if you seek to improve things around you,

480
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:28,670
and you do consistently do that as an individual,

481
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:31,130
you improve the community,

482
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,270
you improve your neighborhood,

483
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,370
you improve the thing that is right around you

484
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:37,530
by improving things for others a bit,

485
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,570
and that automatically does what?

486
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:42,670
It returns to you because you've now,

487
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,810
look, if the people around you are less miserable,

488
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,970
if you've just relieved some of their misery

489
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:49,290
because you had the ability to do so,

490
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:52,830
I do this often by sharing food

491
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,350
when I have more than I need.

492
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:57,110
I'll often, you know, offer it to people

493
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:59,530
that I happen to know could use it.

494
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,350
Something very simple like that.

495
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,890
Now, that sounds like charity again, that word,

496
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:09,010
but it's about the improvement of the overall situation.

497
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,310
That is my motivator,

498
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,970
is that it improves everybody,

499
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,690
and by doing that, guess what?

500
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:17,550
My family's in a better place, right?

501
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:20,730
And myself, I am in a better place,

502
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:25,350
and things can be a lot easier on everyone if you do that.

503
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:26,550
So I like to say-

504
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,530
Sure, it's like moving,

505
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:28,870
it's like going to another neighborhood.

506
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:30,530
It's like changing where you live,

507
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:33,590
but the thing is to do it in a nondescript way.

508
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,410
So there you go.

509
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:35,950
I mean-

510
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,390
Anyway, I wanted to maybe,

511
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:39,530
because we're gonna eventually land on

512
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:41,530
why a lot of things are the way,

513
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:44,510
and it's still gonna be preferential,

514
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:47,690
like do you, you know, should you accept why?

515
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:51,210
You know, again, like Kennedy or 9-11 or many other things.

516
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,990
I can't really say why,

517
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:56,090
but we can narrow it down so well

518
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:57,970
that once you understand a little bit more

519
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:01,330
about what we even started the conversation with,

520
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:06,350
I haven't hammered on how juvenile, childlike the mind is

521
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:10,450
and of society, and I'm talking,

522
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,110
by the way, I think I mentioned

523
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,610
on the last time we spoke publicly,

524
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,770
when I use the term moron,

525
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:18,550
I'm not referring to the masses like most people do.

526
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,770
I'm referring to your professionals,

527
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:24,530
your leaders, you know, the upper echelon,

528
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,010
not the lower ones,

529
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:28,010
because the lower ones don't have,

530
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:30,310
they're like worker bees at this point, drones.

531
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:34,750
So again, when you look at the,

532
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:36,030
when I talk about juvenile,

533
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,370
it's, I'm talking about your judges, lawyers,

534
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:41,830
doctors, priests, CEOs of corporations, billionaires,

535
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:45,210
what people call Illuminati, elite, all that stuff.

536
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,310
They are very juvenile,

537
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:49,510
and you know how they have trickle-down economics.

538
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:51,330
If you cut the taxes of the rich,

539
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,550
they have more money to spend,

540
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:54,870
so that means they'll give it to their workers, right?

541
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:55,630
That idea.

542
00:26:56,350 --> 00:27:00,570
So you have this trickle-down juvenile tendency of thought,

543
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:03,130
and it's, of course, spiritual,

544
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,770
because spirit is the mind as well,

545
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:06,490
that has trickled down in society,

546
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:09,330
and I want to maybe give a couple examples if you,

547
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:10,950
what do you think?

548
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,690
Should we get into that a little bit?

549
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:13,150
Absolutely.

550
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:15,570
Because remember, we run out of time quick on these things.

551
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,710
Sure, no, absolutely.

552
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,410
This is necessary, I think,

553
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:21,330
because how are you going to understand

554
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:23,230
any of what is being presented

555
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,370
if we don't know the landscape,

556
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:26,070
and this is a big part of the landscape,

557
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:28,670
the interaction, and leadership.

558
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:30,330
These are key things.

559
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,470
Look, everything that is discussed,

560
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:35,230
even in, you mentioned alternative media hasn't done anything

561
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:37,030
because they're doing the same thing.

562
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:39,990
They're talking about, yeah, leadership.

563
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:43,010
Well, that was based on an email that I got

564
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:44,270
when we were rebooting this,

565
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:46,090
is why nothing's going to change anyway.

566
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:48,170
Well, you know, I beg to differ

567
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,310
because we have given,

568
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,410
well, I have, and I don't like to say,

569
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:52,730
I always like to do third-person,

570
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:54,130
many things out there,

571
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:56,730
which we can give a short and a long list of,

572
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,810
and I wanted to trickle over to the why,

573
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:02,190
but let's just, like you said, the leadership,

574
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,550
but it goes beyond the leadership

575
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,490
because the whole lot is this way,

576
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,110
and I'm going to give an example.

577
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:09,870
I'll start off with this one.

578
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:12,170
I think, without mentioning names,

579
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,430
there's someone that's popular

580
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:17,730
that does stuff with sound, okay?

581
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:19,590
You record someone's voice

582
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,470
and you could tell if they're lying or their health

583
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,310
and all this other stuff.

584
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:25,370
I've been working on audio for a long time,

585
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:28,530
and I have a system which is a counterspatial system.

586
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,770
In other words, it's like a wafer.

587
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:33,570
You put it inside of a loudspeaker box or enclosure

588
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:35,610
and you get coherent sound.

589
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:36,750
So instead of getting

590
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,850
that really crappy speaker sound that you hear,

591
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:39,630
you know, whatever,

592
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,570
it opens up and becomes clear,

593
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:43,350
and it uses the concept of counterspace,

594
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:45,730
which exists in electricity, with magnets, nature,

595
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,190
all of nature has that, right?

596
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:50,390
It would be, counterspace is the idea of having,

597
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:52,050
let's say, a drain in your bathtub, right?

598
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:54,410
You have a large area that's affected by something,

599
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,310
but it all goes down into one spot.

600
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,910
So I'm able to develop that technology,

601
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,410
and when I found out about this woman

602
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:01,250
who worked with sound,

603
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:06,050
I immediately contacted her organization on the phone,

604
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:07,430
and I wanted to offer it to her.

605
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:10,630
But when I contacted the organization,

606
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,650
or someone who answers the phone

607
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:13,790
who works with the organization,

608
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:15,170
I had some time,

609
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:17,130
and you know how I can get very chatty,

610
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:19,930
and I said, it's kind of technical.

611
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:21,970
I mean, I mentioned what it is,

612
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,270
and she says, it sounds technical.

613
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:24,970
I said, it's actually not that technical.

614
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:28,690
A person on the other line said to me,

615
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:31,050
well, I don't like things that are technical.

616
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,870
I'm not technical, right?

617
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:37,110
And immediately, because I already prefaced,

618
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,410
this is a very simple thing.

619
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,730
It only has three parts to it

620
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:41,510
that you could make in your kitchen, right?

621
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:45,150
You could make this by going through your recycling bin

622
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,490
in your garbage, it's so simple.

623
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:49,270
But because I mentioned it's something

624
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,310
that no one else has figured,

625
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,790
anyway, she said she's not a technical person.

626
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:54,910
So immediately, what I said,

627
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:57,630
I said, okay, I'm not gonna mess with her,

628
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:59,010
but I wanna guide her along.

629
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,330
Let's see if I could do a quick psychotherapy

630
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:03,310
with this receptionist in two minutes.

631
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:06,230
So I said to her, ah, so you're not technical.

632
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,030
And she goes, that's right, I'm not.

633
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:11,150
I said, I just wanna mention a few things

634
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:12,970
that might be personal to you, is that okay?

635
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:16,270
And she said, okay, most people usually say okay

636
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,430
when I bring that up, right?

637
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:20,630
And I said, okay, let me just say,

638
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:22,830
while you were growing,

639
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:24,270
the reason why you're saying that,

640
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:25,370
even though it's something simple,

641
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:26,850
you haven't heard about what it is.

642
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:29,510
It just came up that it might be technical

643
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:30,330
and you're not technical.

644
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:33,730
So you've branded yourself as a non-technical person.

645
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,570
Just someone says, I'm not good at math

646
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:37,390
or I'm not good at this or whatever, okay.

647
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:39,210
And you go along, I said,

648
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:41,090
how long have you been saying you're not technical?

649
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:42,990
And she did, she was quiet.

650
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,470
I said, pretty much all your life, right?

651
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:46,210
Adult life at least, she goes, yeah.

652
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:48,910
And I said, let me tell you how you got to that place.

653
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,290
And she says, okay.

654
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:55,170
I said, all right, somewhere around your youth,

655
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,710
let's say between when you were born

656
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,250
to about eight or nine years old,

657
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:02,150
whether at your home or a familiar place

658
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:03,270
that you were comfortable in,

659
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:06,790
something similar to this conversation came up.

660
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:09,690
And someone that was well-respected

661
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:11,350
by everyone else and yourself,

662
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:13,210
let's say an aunt, your mom or dad

663
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:14,590
or a friend of the family,

664
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:17,210
when the technical matter came up,

665
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:19,710
they broadcasted to everyone in the room,

666
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,630
including you, that they are not technical

667
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:24,030
or good at math or whatever.

668
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:25,930
And everyone in the room agreed

669
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:28,330
that that was okay to say that

670
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:29,650
and it was okay to be that way.

671
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:33,290
And you being a child saw that happen

672
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:36,810
and now you're emulating it for the rest of your life

673
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:38,430
because your aunt who was well-respected

674
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,610
said she's not technical and everybody said it's okay.

675
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:42,430
You said, I want to be like my aunt.

676
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:45,550
All I have to do now is say I'm not technical

677
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:47,170
or I'm not good at math or I'm not,

678
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,210
you hear this often.

679
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:50,490
And you've shut that part of your life,

680
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:51,250
even though it was,

681
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:54,330
even though something might seem technical,

682
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:57,110
it's so simple, you've depraved yourself

683
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:59,150
and shut yourself off, right?

684
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,790
So I said, what does it take to undo that?

685
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:05,870
And she was like, I'll have her call you.

686
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:06,490
I have your number.

687
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:07,570
I got to go, bye.

688
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:10,170
Right, you see my point?

689
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:14,390
So very often when people say, well, that's math.

690
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,270
I'm not good at math.

691
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:16,950
Some point in their life,

692
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:19,830
they saw someone else say that

693
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:22,010
that was still respected after saying that.

694
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,750
And they said, I'm just going to emulate that.

695
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:27,710
So it's a form of laziness, right?

696
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:30,030
It's a form of emotional and spiritual laziness.

697
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,530
Chuck, I'm sure you've heard a lot.

698
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:33,050
You know, you've come up with a conversation.

699
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,290
Let's add these things in the presence

700
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,210
of I'm not good at math, right?

701
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:37,770
But look, we're just adding up

702
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:39,390
like single digit numbers here.

703
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,590
What's going on, right?

704
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:42,670
Well, right.

705
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:43,810
So there's, yeah.

706
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,990
I actually have a question, if you don't mind,

707
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:48,530
really fast because I'm thinking about this,

708
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:50,670
you know, from my own experiences,

709
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:51,750
I'm trying to draw on it.

710
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,450
And I'm thinking to myself, this is exactly right.

711
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:57,070
And I'm thinking that the reason

712
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,790
that she probably did that

713
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,050
is because it removed pressure

714
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:04,930
because now she would be dismissed from that conversation.

715
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:07,250
She would not be asked to participate in it

716
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:09,950
if she did that because that's what she saw happen.

717
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:12,030
Yeah, that's fine means, okay,

718
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,550
now we're not going to ask you

719
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:16,410
to do anything that has to do with that subject.

720
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,550
Let's just say it was math.

721
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:19,690
And somebody says, well, I'm not good at math.

722
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,610
Then that means that that person

723
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:22,890
is not gonna be asked to participate

724
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:24,330
in something that is mathematical.

725
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,410
And they see that and they say,

726
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:29,730
well, that's my way of getting out of being asked

727
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:32,090
or invited into participation, right?

728
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:33,850
Well, it's laziness.

729
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:35,490
It's an emotional laziness.

730
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,870
It's a spiritual laziness,

731
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:42,090
but it happens when we're young and impressionable.

732
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:46,130
But it also, because this young juvenile state of mind

733
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,690
is kept through one's life,

734
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:49,610
let's say a new field develops.

735
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:52,330
I've seen this very often with computers.

736
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,430
And I ask someone, I send you an email

737
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:57,290
and the person will be in their 70s or 80s.

738
00:33:57,370 --> 00:34:00,730
So I'm too old to be into computers, right?

739
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:03,050
They'll say that just to get away from it.

740
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:03,850
Now I understand that.

741
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:05,430
Like when you asked me about something technical,

742
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:07,010
I said, I don't deal with the technical.

743
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:08,570
So that's because I decided not to.

744
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,449
And I could tell you why.

745
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,830
You don't want to spend hours and hours on this.

746
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:15,870
But the thing is, when let's say an older person says,

747
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:18,610
I'm too old to use computers or to have a computer,

748
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:20,290
I say, well, what about a telephone?

749
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:21,770
Can you use a telephone?

750
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:24,530
It's pushing digits and communicate, you see?

751
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,590
So it's this emotional laziness.

752
00:34:27,489 --> 00:34:32,170
What I mean about that also is that the child would not,

753
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:34,650
let's go back to this particular example that I gave.

754
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:38,290
When I told her that someone influenced you

755
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,730
that also said something similar

756
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,929
and you decided to carry it on the rest of your life,

757
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:45,650
the point of not being that way is now you're missing out.

758
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:47,710
You're missing out on your personal growth

759
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:51,770
and also something that acoustic counter space

760
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:52,530
that I'm talking about,

761
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:56,430
it's just three pieces of material linked up a certain way.

762
00:34:56,610 --> 00:35:00,310
It's so non-technical, actually, if I wanted to make these,

763
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:04,170
I could have third grader craft level skill

764
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:05,030
to make it, right?

765
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:06,970
You just need a scissor.

766
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:09,870
Basically, if you could cut cardboard, thin wood,

767
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:12,010
and use glue and felt, you can make it, right?

768
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:13,890
So it's not really that.

769
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:16,090
But she had decided,

770
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,790
I also asked her how old she was.

771
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:18,630
She was in her 30s.

772
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:22,830
So here's someone, we always encounter people,

773
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:25,210
but the most common, even more common than technical

774
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:26,430
is I'm not good at math.

775
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,250
You hear that often, right?

776
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:29,950
It doesn't matter what it is.

777
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:32,010
We're not talking about doing quadratic equations.

778
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,150
You hear I'm not good at math.

779
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:35,110
Even if you wanna say, look, there's two plus two

780
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,970
or plus four plus six plus seven,

781
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:39,710
right away, as soon as they hear it, they turn up

782
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:42,530
and they've decided to be emotionally lazy on that part.

783
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:44,610
And this is done by emulation.

784
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:46,750
And it's not only as a child.

785
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:50,890
So let's say when computers, PCs start to become popular

786
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:55,550
in the early 2000s and the person was 60 or 70 then, right?

787
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,650
They can say, well, do I wanna get into this or not?

788
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,110
Not really, because I'm intimidated.

789
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:03,030
I'll just say I'm too old for computers, right?

790
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:05,030
But they're missing out because it makes an excellent

791
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:07,370
a substitute for a telephone, right?

792
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:08,030
Right.

793
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:11,210
So there's this concept that goes on and on and on.

794
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:14,370
I've also heard when I brought up real history

795
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:17,970
to older people, like, well, I already was raised on this.

796
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:20,830
I don't wanna hear something different, okay?

797
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:24,990
Right, and so this is something that you can approach

798
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:26,610
someone who's later on in their life,

799
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:30,310
but they still have this very juvenile approach, okay?

800
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:33,870
So what is, for example, the storage capacity

801
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:34,890
of the human mind?

802
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:38,810
When you're exceeding, let's say you download 14 movies

803
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:40,290
on a new computer, it's gonna tell you

804
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:43,670
you're running out of hard disk space or memory, right?

805
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:47,070
What's the memory storage limit to human mind?

806
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:48,250
There is none.

807
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:49,070
I don't know that.

808
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:51,930
Yeah, as far as we know, there is none.

809
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:55,210
So you can, in other words, the way that we're set up

810
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:57,310
culturally, not possible.

811
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:00,110
But physically, the equipment that we have,

812
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:02,390
the mind, the brain, the body, the eyes and all that,

813
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:05,710
everyone can memorize every book that's ever been written.

814
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:08,090
There's no, if there's no limit,

815
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,850
if we haven't found the limit, right?

816
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:11,850
Because everything that's ever been written

817
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:13,750
or everything, let's say, in the Library of Congress

818
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:14,590
is limited, right?

819
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:15,350
It's confined.

820
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:18,530
So we can memorize everything, but we're taught not to.

821
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:21,430
Because imagine how open, what would happen?

822
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,630
How can you control people?

823
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,690
How could you put on the dribble that they put on,

824
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:26,790
quote unquote, the TV show they call the news?

825
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:30,410
If everyone that you're, if your audience has memorized

826
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:31,990
everything that's ever been written,

827
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:34,090
how can you put, you see what I mean?

828
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:36,150
They'll be able to access, cross-reference

829
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:38,010
every detail of the subject.

830
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:38,450
Right.

831
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:39,870
And say, you see?

832
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:44,970
So I took it to an extreme here that we're unlimited

833
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:46,230
because we really are.

834
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:48,770
But culturally, the culture that we're in,

835
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,770
the society that we're in, the way we were raised,

836
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:53,810
what I just said that we have unlimited memory

837
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:55,770
and we can memorize anything that's ever been written

838
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:58,110
through human history sounds ridiculous, doesn't it?

839
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:01,310
Well, no, it doesn't sound ridiculous to me

840
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:04,830
because simply the fact that I do not know

841
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:07,530
what the limitation is doesn't mean it doesn't exist either.

842
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,950
See, I have an open mind about this kind of thing

843
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:13,010
where there may indeed be a limit

844
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:15,250
to what the human mind can absorb,

845
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:17,590
but I do not know where that boundary is.

846
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:20,310
I don't know what that limit is.

847
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:23,090
It could be there, but I've just not explored it.

848
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:25,090
Look, I haven't explored outer space.

849
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:26,810
In the environment that we live in,

850
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:29,230
there is nothing that will limit us that way.

851
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:29,630
But go ahead.

852
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:30,770
Well, no, but that's the thing.

853
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,990
Like, I don't know what the limitation of outer space is.

854
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:35,630
Could there be one?

855
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:37,330
I believe there could be.

856
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:40,770
I'm certain that there could be.

857
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:43,710
I imagine that almost anything is finite

858
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:46,530
because I believe that almost everything

859
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:47,930
is finite in some way.

860
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:49,070
So...

861
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,710
Here's an interesting point.

862
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:51,150
You ready?

863
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:51,590
Okay.

864
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,490
And we brought this up.

865
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:54,710
This is kind of like a little bit of a salad,

866
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:59,850
a tossed salad thing, but I've studied a lot

867
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:02,090
on what they call outer space,

868
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:06,450
and I remember everything from what they told us

869
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:09,650
in the 70s and going to the library and reading about it

870
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:11,750
up until now with all the flat earth

871
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,570
and the dome and all this other stuff.

872
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:17,350
And I can recall stuff that I've read

873
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,730
in my third grade book.

874
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:20,330
Let's say, you know, primers, right?

875
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,250
I don't know, most people kind of shut it out,

876
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,530
but I could recall it pretty well.

877
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:26,110
Like, I have a scout handbook,

878
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:29,470
and I recall most of the stuff that's in there,

879
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:30,650
which is very helpful, by the way.

880
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:32,170
Very often when I'm out and about

881
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:34,530
and I tell people how to do a certain knot

882
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:37,430
or if you're gonna make a campfire,

883
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:39,190
put soap on the outside of the pot

884
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,230
before you put it in the fire

885
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:42,250
so that when it turns black and carbonized,

886
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:43,690
it's easy to rinse off, you know.

887
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:44,930
Where'd you get all that?

888
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,990
I said, I got it from the scout handbook.

889
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:48,330
You know, how old were you doing that?

890
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:49,150
I was 12 years old.

891
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:49,950
Do you still remember that?

892
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:52,090
Well, I don't know.

893
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:55,970
You wanna call it paying attention, you know, or whatever.

894
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:58,010
But everything that I've looked at

895
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:00,270
from what they call outer space

896
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:02,550
all the way through the Apollo stuff

897
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:05,090
and all the photographs and images

898
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:06,190
they show from telescopes,

899
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:09,450
I started saying more than 10 years ago

900
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:12,470
that everything you're hearing about that is untrue.

901
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:13,850
Not that it's fake,

902
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:17,510
but things that I tell you are far away are very close.

903
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:20,910
And things that are very close tend to be far away,

904
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,470
meaning out there, right?

905
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:24,250
And I'm not saying this.

906
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:25,890
And then the reason I said that

907
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,490
is because from all the information

908
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:29,110
that I remember seeing about it

909
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:32,090
and all the contradictions that they make, right?

910
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:35,410
And then when you couple that onto a lot of the commentary

911
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:40,350
that I have never seen a real image from outer space.

912
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:43,110
Do you trust it when they show you a picture?

913
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:45,650
I don't, because I can see right away

914
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,710
that it's artist's renditions, right?

915
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:50,410
When I went out and bought a telescope,

916
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:52,350
it's a big telescope.

917
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:53,670
And if I ever upload,

918
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:55,830
I think I have in the past uploaded photos

919
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:58,750
that I've taken of what they call the moon

920
00:40:58,750 --> 00:40:59,850
and the planets and all that.

921
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:01,710
It just looks like an astronomy book, right?

922
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:03,870
It's a pretty big one, very good glass.

923
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:07,570
I don't see things the way through the telescope

924
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:08,790
as they're being shown.

925
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:11,610
I could, very, very different.

926
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:14,550
So when you have that experience directly

927
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:16,530
with what you've studied about it,

928
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:20,230
I could formulate this in a very educated way

929
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,510
in a very reasonable way.

930
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:23,890
Now, this is just an example.

931
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:25,810
You brought up outer space and the limit.

932
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:27,930
And I think that humans are gonna be in

933
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:29,230
for a really big surprise

934
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:31,530
when they find out what's going up there.

935
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:34,050
Let's just call it up there more than out there, right?

936
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:37,590
It's nothing like we've been told, but similar to.

937
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:39,930
By the way, let me just throw something in.

938
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:44,230
From speaking to someone who had flown in an SR-71

939
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:46,650
that basically you get to the point

940
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:49,490
where you can't go any faster

941
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:50,890
because there's no air, right?

942
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:52,090
You're skipping on the atmosphere.

943
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:56,250
And he was on the dark side of the earth

944
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,430
and say dark side of the moon.

945
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:00,670
And space is not black.

946
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:04,030
It's dark, dark, dark, dark blue, right?

947
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:08,890
So very interesting when you get up there.

948
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:11,130
And when he said that, it gave me a chill

949
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:13,770
because I remember the paint on that

950
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:16,010
in military grade paints,

951
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:17,490
when they want to make them really black,

952
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:18,930
it's actually a form of blue.

953
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:22,170
The darkest blacks are actually blues

954
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:23,830
that are toned down to look like black.

955
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:24,970
They absorb the most light.

956
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:25,990
Very interesting.

957
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:27,770
So I just wanna throw out there

958
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:30,410
because the guy I referenced earlier, Archaics,

959
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:32,510
he talks a lot about it being a complete construct.

960
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:33,590
And I agree with that.

961
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:36,210
I believe in the simulation and all that,

962
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:37,870
but it's constructed in a way

963
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:40,850
that we still physically interact with it as such.

964
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:41,910
Right?

965
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:44,050
It's not just a movie screen up there,

966
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:45,630
like some people would suggest.

967
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:49,970
But yeah, the juvenile tendency again,

968
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:52,090
comes in through that.

969
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:54,890
Like for example, juvenile,

970
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:59,010
it is, let me just bring this up.

971
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:00,790
And I brought this up before Chuck.

972
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,990
You know that in the Western culture,

973
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:06,070
more than other cultures,

974
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:09,070
we've created a subculture known as the kid's culture.

975
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:10,790
You know, a kid is a baby goat.

976
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:11,210
Yeah, yeah.

977
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:12,270
Right?

978
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:14,810
You got the meals at the fast food stores.

979
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:15,590
You got the toys.

980
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:18,230
You got the TV and the movies made for quote unquote kids.

981
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:19,150
It's a subculture.

982
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:21,250
Kids meals, kids channels, kids, kids, kids.

983
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:21,530
Yeah.

984
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:22,670
Everything.

985
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:23,530
Toys are okay.

986
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:25,230
In older, other cultures,

987
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:28,110
the children were viewed as just small people

988
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:31,890
that were bound to become like the adults

989
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:32,730
when they get bigger.

990
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:33,330
Right?

991
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:35,170
But they were not sequestered

992
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:36,830
and they didn't have a subculture for them.

993
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:37,590
Like there is now.

994
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:38,550
It is a subculture.

995
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:44,650
Now, if this society at large had a mature mindset,

996
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:46,190
meaning there were culture and mature,

997
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:48,750
ethically, morally, scientifically, mathematically,

998
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:51,110
every aspect of their culture was matured,

999
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:56,210
they would not agree to having a separate kid's culture.

1000
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:57,130
Right?

1001
00:43:57,230 --> 00:43:57,750
Like that.

1002
00:43:57,850 --> 00:43:58,870
Why would you do that?

1003
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:01,070
Because at what point,

1004
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:04,170
there's no clear point when you're a quote unquote kid

1005
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:06,730
and you do the kid's stuff to where you're not.

1006
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:08,530
Where's the crosser?

1007
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:09,450
Eight, nine years old?

1008
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:10,530
Where you, right?

1009
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:13,090
The children are told about Santa Claus

1010
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:15,070
and when the child is about, I don't know,

1011
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:17,410
gets their first bicycle, eight or nine or 10,

1012
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:19,290
they ask about Santa Claus

1013
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:20,990
and the parents immediately tell them,

1014
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:22,130
what are you talking about?

1015
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:23,050
There's no such thing.

1016
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:23,510
Whoa.

1017
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:24,070
Whoa.

1018
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:25,770
It's like a slap in the face.

1019
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:26,070
Right?

1020
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:26,430
Right.

1021
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:27,250
Suddenly.

1022
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:29,030
So where does that end and where is it?

1023
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:30,410
By the way, I also heard from someone,

1024
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:32,550
you know, Santa Claus,

1025
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:33,650
is a Santa Claus a hoax?

1026
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:34,910
Well, come on.

1027
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:37,030
If Santa Claus was a hoax,

1028
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:38,970
do you know how many people would have to be in on it?

1029
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:40,830
Right?

1030
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:44,890
Well, you used to refer to it as pranks,

1031
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:45,250
but yeah.

1032
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:46,850
That's your conspiracy theory.

1033
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:47,410
I gotcha.

1034
00:44:47,570 --> 00:44:47,910
I gotcha.

1035
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:49,130
Yeah, okay.

1036
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:51,410
So this is the society.

1037
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:54,450
So just the very fact that I see

1038
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:57,210
that there is a subculture within the culture,

1039
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:58,290
I mean, what else would you call it?

1040
00:44:58,370 --> 00:44:58,850
The kid's thing.

1041
00:44:58,870 --> 00:44:59,510
It's a subculture.

1042
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:00,830
It's a culture within a culture.

1043
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:01,090
Right?

1044
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:02,770
Yeah, no, I have no argument there.

1045
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:03,590
It is subculture.

1046
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:06,070
It's a subculture by definition.

1047
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:09,550
That means, that is actually not

1048
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:11,530
because there is a separate subculture created.

1049
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:13,110
It's actually the juvenile nature

1050
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,370
of this society created that subculture

1051
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:18,730
to run not beneath it or before it,

1052
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:20,070
but side by side.

1053
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:20,710
Right.

1054
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:23,950
So only two things that are equal at parity

1055
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:25,230
run side by side.

1056
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:26,850
I see.

1057
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:27,770
Okay.

1058
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:30,230
So this is the juvenile.

1059
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:30,950
So in other words,

1060
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:32,350
if we did not have a juvenile,

1061
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:33,850
we meaning the collective we,

1062
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:37,290
did not have a juvenile mindset

1063
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:39,070
throughout their whole society,

1064
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:42,190
there's no way a subculture like that would exist.

1065
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:43,410
You see?

1066
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:46,250
Let's just bounce it.

1067
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:47,930
If you bounce it the other way,

1068
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:48,830
it's still juvenile.

1069
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:50,530
You had like with 9-11,

1070
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:52,150
the terrorism stuff, right?

1071
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:54,510
So they develop all these terrorism,

1072
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:55,930
anti-terrorism,

1073
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:58,770
which actually goes after their own population, right?

1074
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:01,990
What's interesting about that

1075
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:04,010
is that if the authorities,

1076
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:05,150
government administrators,

1077
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:06,550
kings, monarchies, whatever,

1078
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,830
were actually had the best interest

1079
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:11,230
of the people in mind,

1080
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:13,190
they wouldn't be threatening them

1081
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:16,770
with surveillance and basically intimidation.

1082
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:19,850
They would present a mature society

1083
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:21,890
would present say we have a terrorist threat.

1084
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:25,370
That means that we cannot lay back and be relaxed.

1085
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:27,630
All everyone that quote unquote a citizen

1086
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:29,730
has to be more vigilant.

1087
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:33,650
And we have to learn safety protocols, right?

1088
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:35,150
I'm not talking about just like snitching

1089
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:35,910
on your neighbor or whatever,

1090
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:37,030
but safety protocols.

1091
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:38,330
No, but that's part of it.

1092
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:39,190
That's part of it though.

1093
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:40,270
Yeah, we got it.

1094
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:41,870
Yeah, all of these preventive measures

1095
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:45,150
more highlighted than the threat part of it, right?

1096
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:45,650
Yeah, of course.

1097
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:47,690
Yeah, so again,

1098
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:49,810
it's like they're punishing children.

1099
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:51,110
If you don't do your homework,

1100
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:52,490
you're going to, right?

1101
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:53,890
Yeah, but you're gonna,

1102
00:46:54,170 --> 00:46:56,290
you see there's a follow through.

1103
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:58,110
All of the follow throughs,

1104
00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:01,010
the nature of the reactionary element

1105
00:47:01,010 --> 00:47:04,450
that you see with politicians and all this stuff,

1106
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:04,930
you know, they don't,

1107
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:07,590
no one speaks anymore like they used to.

1108
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:09,010
Politicians used to get up and say,

1109
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:11,130
oh, we're gonna look to the future generations.

1110
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,950
We're gonna develop more bridges and this and that.

1111
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:16,650
No one, the only time you hear anything political now

1112
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:17,810
is when an event happens

1113
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:20,050
or there's a complaint or something like that.

1114
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:21,110
Again, reactionary.

1115
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:23,590
It's reactionary as opposed to the,

1116
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:24,230
you know, the,

1117
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:29,310
like, okay, again, Kennedy's very easy to go back to

1118
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:30,750
because he gave many, many speeches

1119
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:33,190
in his short time in office as president.

1120
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,550
And almost all of them were about

1121
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:37,390
things that we were going to do,

1122
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:40,410
things that were needed to be accomplished.

1123
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:43,390
Some of the most dangerous speeches in my mind

1124
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:44,230
were about, you know,

1125
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:47,430
the possibility that we could literally abolish war,

1126
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:52,410
not just, you know, make peace and react to somebody else,

1127
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:54,310
but that we could go forward

1128
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:56,870
and eliminate the need for the weapons altogether.

1129
00:47:57,890 --> 00:47:59,870
And that, to me, was a much more mature

1130
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:03,470
way of conducting business.

1131
00:48:04,370 --> 00:48:06,450
You know, and that's the key complaint.

1132
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:08,490
Whenever anybody says to me, for instance,

1133
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:11,230
how would you improve planet Earth, basically, right?

1134
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:14,190
Almost always my response is,

1135
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:15,990
it's a little difficult to do

1136
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:20,910
given that we have a society that needs to mature,

1137
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:24,050
given that our species needs to mature.

1138
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:27,610
And everybody's always baffled by that,

1139
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:29,550
but I don't see how you can see it another way.

1140
00:48:30,330 --> 00:48:31,410
That is the only way.

1141
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:32,570
Yeah, it's a maturity issue.

1142
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:34,130
It's a maturity issue, right.

1143
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:36,830
Because if you were to take it,

1144
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:39,010
like you and I have talked about being all together

1145
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:40,770
on this one particular place,

1146
00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:45,010
the boat concept and all being on the same rock,

1147
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:46,210
I think we used to say, right?

1148
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:46,850
Or something like this.

1149
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:48,310
Or the cruise ship.

1150
00:48:48,610 --> 00:48:49,370
The cruise ship, there you go.

1151
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:51,530
Everybody's going from point A to point B,

1152
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:52,770
but while you're on the cruise ship,

1153
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:53,990
you can do what you want, right?

1154
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:54,810
That's free will.

1155
00:48:55,010 --> 00:48:55,530
Yeah, free will.

1156
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:57,850
But see, there's the interesting thing, right?

1157
00:48:57,930 --> 00:48:59,910
Is that, well, I brought it down to a boat,

1158
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:00,990
but the cruise ship, fine.

1159
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:03,270
It gives you more options, all right?

1160
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:07,370
But either way, the thing is, it's about maturity.

1161
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:10,610
It's, you know, like what is it that would change

1162
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:11,630
if that happened, right?

1163
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:13,290
Well, I say, well, the first thing is

1164
00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:16,130
that there would be no requirement for prisons or churches.

1165
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:17,030
They'd be gone.

1166
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:21,630
Yeah, the church, but the religion is one of the reasons

1167
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:23,450
we don't have visitors, you know?

1168
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:24,170
Oh, well, there you go.

1169
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:25,330
If we didn't have religion,

1170
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:28,270
we would have plenty of other visitors from other worlds

1171
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:29,190
saying, hey, you guys.

1172
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:32,310
But anyway, so that will be gotten rid of, but go ahead.

1173
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:33,830
Yeah, but that's the thing, though.

1174
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:35,930
But that is part of a maturation.

1175
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:38,470
If that happens, that would,

1176
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:41,270
and people, they just don't, they don't get that.

1177
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:42,410
You know, they don't want to hear that

1178
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:44,730
because it steps outside of, oh, wait a minute.

1179
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:46,130
It steps outside of exactly

1180
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:47,430
what you just talked about before,

1181
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:50,370
which is that someone who is respected

1182
00:49:51,370 --> 00:49:52,870
gave them a way to be lazy.

1183
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:53,550
Oh, wait a minute.

1184
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:54,630
Did I just come up with that?

1185
00:49:55,010 --> 00:49:55,710
I think so.

1186
00:49:56,450 --> 00:49:57,930
Yeah, that's a good way to say it, Chuck.

1187
00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:02,210
Someone that's respectable allows, you know,

1188
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:04,290
emulating them allows you to be lazy.

1189
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:04,910
Yeah, perfect.

1190
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:06,410
You said it well, though, on that.

1191
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:07,230
Oh, thank you.

1192
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:08,510
All right, well, look,

1193
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:09,990
I'm just putting these things together.

1194
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:12,510
I'm trying to observe and report.

1195
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:12,970
Yeah.

1196
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:16,230
Something I, there's some phrasing

1197
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:19,930
and a process that, frankly, I learned.

1198
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:20,930
Yeah, we'll look at the.

1199
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:21,750
Yeah, go ahead.

1200
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:22,910
Sorry to step on you there,

1201
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:24,930
but the pandemic thing that they did, right,

1202
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:26,690
where they were putting that picture of a virus.

1203
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:28,050
I mean, it looked like something out of,

1204
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:30,070
what's that purple thing on Sesame Street?

1205
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:34,630
They have, anyway, some dinosaur that's purple or whatever.

1206
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:36,370
It's on that ilk, you know, the children.

1207
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:38,510
The purple dinosaur was Barney.

1208
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:40,490
He wasn't on Sesame Street, but I get it.

1209
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:40,830
It's cool.

1210
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:42,050
Yeah, but anyway, yeah.

1211
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:43,290
It's all ridiculous, you know.

1212
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:48,150
They're on a Barney level thing, and yeah.

1213
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:52,410
So just to go back on the juvenile again,

1214
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:56,110
instead of trying to figure out what is juvenile,

1215
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:57,610
look at the other way.

1216
00:50:57,730 --> 00:50:58,530
Everything is juvenile.

1217
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:00,930
See what is not juvenile, right?

1218
00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:04,050
Take it as a presumption and an assertion

1219
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:06,050
that everything, like you said,

1220
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:07,610
it's not a mature society, right?

1221
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:09,410
If it's not mature, it's what?

1222
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:10,170
It's juvenile.

1223
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:12,810
Is there, adolescent would be in the middle, right?

1224
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:13,990
Well, right.

1225
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:18,390
I think if we made it to adolescence, it would be good.

1226
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:21,990
So I think I've talked enough about eschatology,

1227
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:23,410
which is how these things, you know,

1228
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:26,910
the end of the world, meaning not the world planet material,

1229
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:29,110
but the end of society, enough.

1230
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:32,930
And we're gonna go over a little bit more in future sonics

1231
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:34,390
with more precision.

1232
00:51:35,370 --> 00:51:38,710
But there is no, based on the,

1233
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:40,550
cause I'm a catastrophist, right?

1234
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:42,670
Not an evolutionist, you know, things get redone.

1235
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:46,610
There have been points of maturity.

1236
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:49,270
And what we're seeing now is the shades of it,

1237
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:50,550
but we're not going to get it

1238
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:52,650
because we're gonna be distracted by the revival

1239
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:54,710
of ancient customs and ancient religions

1240
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:56,230
and ancient ways of doing things

1241
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:57,510
that we're gonna attribute

1242
00:51:57,510 --> 00:51:59,350
to the way this society has developed.

1243
00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:04,410
And it's not, it's actually a revival, right?

1244
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:07,170
Of something that no one knows about.

1245
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:09,010
Very little, very few people know about it.

1246
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:11,230
And if you see it come on as new in the society,

1247
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:12,310
you're gonna say, this is new.

1248
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:13,450
And I'll say, no, it's not.

1249
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:16,070
It's just something that's revived from 4,000 years ago.

1250
00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:18,330
Seems new to you, right?

1251
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:20,570
Because you're not aware of this history.

1252
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:23,230
But even when that's revived,

1253
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:25,190
it's going to be done in a juvenile,

1254
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:28,010
for the juvenile palette, right?

1255
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:30,070
For the juvenile mindset.

1256
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:36,930
So I can't stress enough on people look at society

1257
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:38,230
like the email I got yesterday

1258
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:40,370
about like why bother doing more sonic events?

1259
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:42,610
It's not gonna change anything, right?

1260
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:45,170
Well, no, it's not gonna change anything at large

1261
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:47,730
because this society isn't gonna change for the better.

1262
00:52:47,850 --> 00:52:49,050
It has to be redone.

1263
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:52,730
But in the meantime, I think you have an advantage

1264
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:55,490
being more mature spiritually, cognitively,

1265
00:52:55,490 --> 00:52:58,050
and in many other ways, mature

1266
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:00,450
when you're amongst juveniles, right?

1267
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:01,450
You have an advantage.

1268
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:04,610
I mean, imagine Chuck, you went back to the third grade,

1269
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,110
but you looked like you did in the third grade,

1270
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:08,770
but you have the mind that you have now.

1271
00:53:08,890 --> 00:53:10,210
Are you in an advantage, right?

1272
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:10,970
Of course.

1273
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:11,350
Of course.

1274
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:13,530
You wanna date the teacher, right?

1275
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:14,590
Or something, let's say.

1276
00:53:14,970 --> 00:53:16,030
Okay, but.

1277
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:18,750
Yeah, but that aside, you know.

1278
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:21,810
No, it'll be difficult if you wanna date the teacher

1279
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:24,090
and you're whatever, eight years old and she's 30.

1280
00:53:26,690 --> 00:53:29,330
That won't cross over, but most everything else will.

1281
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:30,370
Right, right.

1282
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:32,370
No, and there you have it.

1283
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:38,850
I mean, again, so if you're able to mature a bit yourself,

1284
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:41,650
and get ahead of the curve, so to speak,

1285
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:47,250
this is a way of improving your own life.

1286
00:53:48,070 --> 00:53:50,930
But again, that concept that we also talked about

1287
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:53,590
where if you improve the things around you,

1288
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:55,730
the things that are within your reach,

1289
00:53:55,910 --> 00:53:58,750
the things that will have a direct effect on you,

1290
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:00,610
you get both, right?

1291
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:02,930
You get the ability to improve the thing around you.

1292
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:03,590
And like you said,

1293
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:05,270
if half the people in the world did this,

1294
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:07,270
I mean, there you go.

1295
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:09,830
Everyone would be taken care of.

1296
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:12,150
So.

1297
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:16,670
No, well, the thing is, you can't lean on it too much.

1298
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:20,750
In other words, if, okay, so you wanna share things

1299
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:22,670
that you know are objectively better,

1300
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:25,430
whether it's whatever the subject matter is.

1301
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:28,130
And the people around you might accept it,

1302
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:30,490
if everyone does, and maybe somebody will get it and say,

1303
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:32,450
hey, we can improve this, or maybe leave out this.

1304
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:34,530
But generally, you can start everyone around you,

1305
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:35,750
so it's going in that direction, great.

1306
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:38,230
But what if you're doing that and no one listens,

1307
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:39,570
and you're actually made fun of?

1308
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:44,270
So you can't base, in other words,

1309
00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:45,450
don't be attached to it.

1310
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:46,410
Because you know what?

1311
00:54:46,930 --> 00:54:49,690
Based on being on this planet now for six decades,

1312
00:54:50,650 --> 00:54:51,570
they're not gonna listen.

1313
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:55,230
Even people, let me just go even more heartfelt on this.

1314
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:57,250
If you're in a family unit,

1315
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:59,790
whether it's wife, husband, children, whatever, whatever,

1316
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:02,430
they're not gonna listen, you see.

1317
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:06,550
In most cases, in most cases from a spiritual point of view,

1318
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:08,350
you know, your real family is not the litter

1319
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:09,370
that you were born in.

1320
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:11,230
I say that litter meaning because it's purely physical.

1321
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:14,730
Your family is outside spiritually

1322
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:17,670
because you're spread out in a way that,

1323
00:55:17,810 --> 00:55:21,110
because if each family had done this,

1324
00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:23,550
then it would change, actually make some real changes.

1325
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:27,330
And what I just said, each family does a certain way

1326
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:29,890
based on the overarching culture that they're in,

1327
00:55:30,610 --> 00:55:31,370
you see, also.

1328
00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:35,870
So that's an inherent problem in that as well.

1329
00:55:36,010 --> 00:55:37,370
But I wouldn't be attached to it

1330
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:38,590
if it doesn't happen around you.

1331
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:40,550
Like you mentioned, let's make things better.

1332
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:42,650
No, no, don't be attached to it,

1333
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:43,890
but you have to do it anyway.

1334
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,820
Well, before we get further into that,

1335
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,800
I wonder if you wouldn't break that down a little more

1336
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:54,520
about the difference between physical relationship

1337
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,320
and spiritual relationship

1338
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:59,040
because there is a huge difference.

1339
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:07,000
I note that many of the people that I've interacted with

1340
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:12,400
who have listened to you, but also listen to my show,

1341
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:16,520
it's, they're a bit different from the people

1342
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:20,340
that I just run into randomly when I go out in public.

1343
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:23,880
All right, they have a slightly different thought process.

1344
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:27,620
They are a little more akin already,

1345
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:30,580
before they ever encounter what it is that I'm doing

1346
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:32,580
or what it is that you and I have done.

1347
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:34,900
They're already a little different

1348
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,240
when they encounter us, right?

1349
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:41,580
They're, how am I getting at this?

1350
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:44,340
Why don't we take a break for ourselves

1351
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:45,260
and for the listener?

1352
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:48,280
Just, we could just take a little breather

1353
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,820
and we'll come back and hash out

1354
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:51,340
the spirit versus the physical.

1355
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:53,320
I think that's an excellent idea.

1356
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,860
Let's do it.

1357
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:09,360
All right, let's talk about the status quo

1358
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,980
and the partnership with the Greek community

1359
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:11,100
on the ground level.

1360
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:19,920
story tells from 어쨌든 что этоigonал,

1361
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,420
it's going to go like this.

1362
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:28,560
Okay, fair enough. I guess well, we could say one and a half one and a half. Okay, one and a half

1363
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:31,020
Well, we're at the halfway point of one. So why not?

1364
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:35,020
Exactly if you're moving it along the number line, it makes sense

1365
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:41,160
Anyway back to making sense though. We were talking about the the the different relationships

1366
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:47,220
Okay, again, one of those words. I'm skeptical of because when something is in relation to something else

1367
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:52,560
Does it relate things like this people have sort of misused those terms a bit

1368
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:57,920
But look there is something to the idea that there is a physical relationship

1369
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:05,480
Because one thing is related to another as you said physically you might be from a certain litter again

1370
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,140
It's about the physicality

1371
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:12,680
Sure, you have your genetic connection, you know your family you look alike you came from

1372
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:17,300
Similar stock all that kind of stuff, but there's another heartache

1373
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:20,940
Physical the carnal the carnal the physical very good

1374
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,420
But then there's other

1375
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:31,100
Considerations here and I started to ask about you know, what about the spiritual relationship? What about those?

1376
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:38,240
You know again not not having to do with the litter of the physicality. So how do we separate that? How do we?

1377
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:42,380
Understand that these are well, I think related but also

1378
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:47,620
Yeah, don't go back to what you remember when you started you were talking about relationships, right?

1379
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:53,520
You said the word relationship. Let's define that think about it this way from a Greeks week. Let's well, okay

1380
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:56,840
Think about it this way. Yeah, I think about it this way from a Greek speak perspective

1381
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:03,460
You said relationship about four times earlier and I was thinking. Oh, wow. We got to bring this up. What is a relationship?

1382
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:10,320
What the way I would define it which is actually based on a functional sense because you could use that term

1383
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:15,080
Loosely when you're at work and someone says I'm having a relationship with so-and-so

1384
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:22,500
I mean that could mean a lot right right or whatever or relations or whatever. Okay from the Greek speak point of view. It's boundaries

1385
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:26,520
boundaries, okay, what kind of boundaries so let's say

1386
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,180
You have a relationship with

1387
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,040
someone next to you

1388
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:37,920
Wow, that is so broad and so open. Well, what happens is there's brown boundaries that are set there

1389
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:38,640
So for example

1390
00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:44,060
You can have a relationship with a co-worker and the way you relate to them is only at work on

1391
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:47,420
On a verbal basis you keep your distance. You might have lunch, right?

1392
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:50,540
so if you're gonna go ahead and grope them or

1393
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:55,480
Ask them something quote-unquote, whatever. It's the quote is too personal

1394
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,620
What do you see go up you think?

1395
00:59:57,620 --> 01:00:03,380
What they do is remind you of what the boundary you've overstepped or it's within the boundary, right?

1396
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:08,380
You're out of bounds like in sports, right? So you're playing this game

1397
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:14,820
It's a dynamic and remember it if no one's on the field and no one's nothing's moving. There's no there's no game

1398
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:19,400
So it's about motion. So let's say you're very intimate with someone

1399
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:26,060
You know, you know, I'm lascivious and could be carnal minded you can even let's say a wife a husband or something

1400
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:34,000
Boyfriend-girlfriend like people still use or whatever. They even then have boundaries. Let's say take it to the to the limit

1401
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:40,780
One person might like this sexual position or whatever. The other person says no, that's too much for me, right?

1402
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:46,180
So what does that define the relationship? No, what I'm saying is

1403
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:51,320
That the word relationship is an overarching way to say

1404
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:57,620
What kind of boundaries we have so when someone says relationship and you hear that it's very loose in general and

1405
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:04,800
When you start describing the relationship, you're not really describing the relationship, but you start with describing the boundaries that are set

1406
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:10,860
If that makes any sense, no, it does because it is about the boundaries

1407
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:13,060
I mean I could even say for instance

1408
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:20,940
I have a relationship with someone I just regularly see or regularly interact with not even at work forget that

1409
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:27,820
Because there's all kinds of terminology now attached to that which I think has gotten away from what you're talking about

1410
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:33,320
But if you go to you just you are regular at a store say Greek, right?

1411
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:41,160
You might have sort of a relationship with somebody there because they have a familiarity with you. They know your name

1412
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:46,940
They might know the product you buy like you and I might talk about going to buy a pack of cigarettes

1413
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:49,880
That guy knows something

1414
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:54,240
So they have no comes in he'll let him grab a free bag of chips

1415
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:57,040
But he may not let you because the boundaries are different, right?

1416
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:02,220
He knows to get my cigarettes, but he's not hooking me up because I'm not his brother, you know

1417
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:07,320
Where the brother comes in grabs a chips and a drink and waves and goes. Goodbye. That's cool

1418
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:13,820
But you try to do that. He's gonna make you aware of what the boundary you just crossed the line. They say right? Mm-hmm

1419
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:15,260
Exactly. Okay

1420
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:20,780
So the relationship that we use the term in this Western culture usually means

1421
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:25,720
More than friendly, you know, usually sexual intimate

1422
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:30,160
Or whatever, you know, like for example three roommates

1423
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:35,360
Sharing an apartment have a relationship. That's more of a loose boundary

1424
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:40,360
Right, then then some people that are dating. Let's say okay

1425
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:45,240
So right because you the chances of going on a date and the person shows up at the restaurant

1426
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:49,660
Just came out of the shower wearing a towel around their waist. It's probably not going to happen

1427
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:56,240
But if you're right, that's not acceptable, right? But if you have roommates all guys little girls, whatever, whatever

1428
01:02:56,980 --> 01:03:00,900
If you have a roommate gets out of the shower and they get out with a towel around them. That's it

1429
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:03,460
I mean, it's acceptable right your roommates, right?

1430
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:07,760
See so the setting and the pre agreed you could also have roommates say look

1431
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,620
I don't want to see you like that. Make sure you're fully dressed. What'd you just do?

1432
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:12,520
You just set a boundary

1433
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:17,820
right, so this thing about relationships is all these boundaries and and

1434
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:21,300
Let's go back to the familial. Like you said

1435
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:28,020
The litter right? I said that earlier as well when I say litter it's it's it's like the most

1436
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,680
Reductionist thing you could say, you know, it just means purely

1437
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,920
Animalistic, let's say in a way out of the similar to animals

1438
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:40,400
Basically, you come out of the the mother you're nurtured and then you're you're off to the wild, right?

1439
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,060
Essentially people do that as well

1440
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:49,460
So what boundaries now for example when you're in a family and you have an authoritative parent and

1441
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:54,340
You bring up something at the dinner table. They'll tell you don't mention that again in this house

1442
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:58,260
How many times have you heard that either in film or in real life, right? Oh, yeah

1443
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:01,920
Okay, what did they just do they set a boundary

1444
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:08,060
You can't talk about whatever at home, but you you can talk about that with your friends

1445
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:13,880
Let's say out, you know at the park or somewhere another setting. So the boundaries there are much more loose

1446
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:15,160
outside

1447
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:23,160
So you have a spiritual boundaries in the in the home family which in most cases through a convention not all but in most cases

1448
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:28,920
This is the religion that we practice here in this house, this is what we believe in in this house, right?

1449
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:35,420
So you're you find out like let's say your particular religion you you find out or it doesn't feel right

1450
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:37,000
Let's say intuitively is very important

1451
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:43,440
Most people that are in any religion intuitively, they know it's not the be-all end-all of spirituality in most cases

1452
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:50,480
Once they leave the boundaries of the home the mental boundaries of spiritual boundaries. They can discuss it outside of the home

1453
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:53,060
You've heard that too. Yeah, right those terms being used

1454
01:04:53,060 --> 01:05:00,340
so these relationships basically when you form a relationship with someone what whatever it might be like you and I have a

1455
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:02,340
Relationship doing these sonic events, right?

1456
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:06,020
All the way to the most intimate relationship what it is

1457
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:11,120
It's a series of boundaries that are either removed or set up to a certain point

1458
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:17,900
So once we start viewing these these boundaries, I mean you see this legally all the time, right?

1459
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:22,620
You can't like you can't go behind this line employees only right, right

1460
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:24,300
It's everywhere

1461
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:31,580
Boundaries are being set up constantly. Now. The thing is, you know, part of the legal thing is to get around these boundaries legally without

1462
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:34,540
Seeing it being seen as a violation

1463
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:39,180
Right in law. You don't have that because law is

1464
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:45,520
Something that you don't get around you you understand and you perform right? You don't violate right on your own

1465
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:47,680
And

1466
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:50,020
By the way, one day we'll get into it biblically

1467
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:56,240
There are a lot of it's very difficult to to put through a lot of the old hardcore laws that you find in the Bible

1468
01:05:56,240 --> 01:06:03,320
It's not as easy the certain conditions have to be met. It's not like people think right? So it is actually a very free system and

1469
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:08,340
The only way I can give an analogy for that is when they look for legal legal

1470
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:14,200
Loopholes the guy who has the better lawyer has more freedom, right? But actually in law, there's a lot of freedom

1471
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:21,480
But it's more upfront. It's not let's try it a way to go around it the same way that I just mentioned

1472
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:25,780
When you get into a relationship and boundaries are removed

1473
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:30,580
Then certain boundaries are set to be more restrictive. So let's say you have

1474
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:37,420
Intimate relationship with someone and you find out that they set this boundary here in a particular particular

1475
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:38,280
Sexual

1476
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:41,100
Position that you might want they don't

1477
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:46,100
Well, what will happen if depends on how you affect that boundary affects you might say?

1478
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,940
Oh, I used to like doing it this way now

1479
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:55,660
Maybe I need to go find someone else that doesn't have that boundary even though I'm not in a relationship just to do that

1480
01:06:55,660 --> 01:07:00,980
You see so there's an aspect to it. Also that we have to realize

1481
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:05,120
That when you hit a boundary like that that you find

1482
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:12,380
Limiting or whatever to make sure that it doesn't get to you emotionally that might lead you off to do things that you

1483
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:17,300
Normally, you know aren't right. Well, there you have it. I mean look an undesirable

1484
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:24,540
Boundary, I guess would be the best way to put it right because if you're in a let's go back to the other example

1485
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:30,160
Of you know in this house, you can only speak about this right when it comes to religion or whatever

1486
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:35,100
I mean in some places somebody could say, you know, look you got to be a Yankees fan in this house

1487
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:40,500
Or is something stupid? It doesn't matter. Sure. Sure. No, I've heard that. Yeah, you know, but but either way, okay

1488
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:45,780
What that often does though is if somebody feels as though that is unjust or they don't

1489
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:53,460
Intuitively agree with that they leave the home. They'll often seek to explore something other

1490
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:59,080
You know again, you can't you can't say I mean I've heard this many times

1491
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:04,900
I know this is a complex thing and could lead us in the wrong direction, but allow me to use it for an example

1492
01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:09,660
You know, the the only the only God we recognize in this house is it has to do with Jesus?

1493
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,540
Okay, I've heard that many a time, right?

1494
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:18,720
So you can't even discuss anything that isn't with that guy. That's it

1495
01:08:19,779 --> 01:08:21,700
now immediately when the

1496
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:27,240
The children the people not in authority in that house the people not really in charge of setting those boundaries

1497
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:34,279
Who are supposed to abide by them immediately when they leave the house? What is almost one of the first things they'll do

1498
01:08:34,979 --> 01:08:36,180
Seek to explore

1499
01:08:37,479 --> 01:08:43,380
Relationships without those boundaries one way or another or when then they'll find that there's still boundaries there

1500
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:48,600
But they're different and they're favorable or more favorable based on what their desire is

1501
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:52,000
That's why I say it's either a desirable or an undesirable boundary, right?

1502
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:59,240
And also what their knowledge base is and when their knowledge grows they may not like it or whatever. Yeah, right. It's all yeah

1503
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:00,700
It's sympathetic as well

1504
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:01,740
In other words

1505
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:07,660
What I'm trying to say is once you first thing that happens when you hit a boundary or a limitation is you have an emotional?

1506
01:09:08,380 --> 01:09:15,080
Response a reactive response unless even when you're approaching the boundary, you know, it's they're like, ah, we've reached the point now

1507
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:21,680
There's always going to be an emotional and a reactive response and want to tie that into the spirit and the mind

1508
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:22,399
Okay

1509
01:09:22,899 --> 01:09:25,779
But what did you I hope the people listening?

1510
01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:34,540
Relax into this because I might start using the boundary issue or the concept more than the relationship issue, right?

1511
01:09:34,939 --> 01:09:41,460
Because I think that I think that gives you more of the engineering of what we consider a relationship you the way an inch

1512
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:47,080
Let's just put it this way the way you engineer a relationship is by knowing what boundaries are there

1513
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:49,700
right, right, so

1514
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:57,320
We brought up the spirit earlier and the family and where your spiritual quote-unquote family now usually when you say family

1515
01:09:57,320 --> 01:09:58,960
It's a unit or a group, right?

1516
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:05,600
I'm I am against not against family, but the moment groups start to form

1517
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:10,360
Again, the boundary is defined. You're in our group or you're not in our group, right?

1518
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:18,020
So this is another form of boundary again sees the you know a member or not a member, right? So

1519
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:21,200
When you look at something let's go

1520
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:29,640
Delve into most people that have heard Ocelli in the Greek or Greek speak know that I'm a stickler about defining the spirit now

1521
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:34,940
The all the reference material that's been put out that we have access to in any language through time

1522
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:37,540
They wouldn't be deceiving us or trying to confuse us would they?

1523
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:45,440
In reference material, right? Of course not never right. Okay. All right. So let's just do this

1524
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:53,780
If you see something contrary to this I would consider it a typo based on logic reason and and good solid information

1525
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:56,780
When you look up the word spirit

1526
01:10:57,540 --> 01:11:04,340
Etymology dictionary or whatever it tells you it is also the soul the mind the breath

1527
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,820
When you look up the word soul

1528
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:11,540
The definition is it's also

1529
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:16,640
The spirit the mind and the breath whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a second

1530
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:18,520
You know

1531
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:24,060
That that's not much of a definition. Is it what's your first clue, right?

1532
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:29,920
What they're trying to tell you is that the soul and the spirit are the same within the deaf, right

1533
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:32,100
They just invert it whether you look up spirit or soul

1534
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:36,740
They give you the same definition pretty much one after the other and that's it. Yeah, right

1535
01:11:36,740 --> 01:11:37,940
So what are they hiding there?

1536
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:42,500
Well, the thing is is such a benign such a common like the word nice, right, right

1537
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:45,740
You know everything wants to be everything to be nice, but when you look it up

1538
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:51,020
It doesn't make any sense why we're using that word that way, but let's put that away. This is how everybody uses it, right?

1539
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,660
Okay. Well you get a lot further

1540
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:58,520
Because you understand what's called coding when the the elite or the people that run the planet

1541
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:02,600
they're not the easiest way to survey people is just like

1542
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:06,080
Social media if they want to find out about your personal life

1543
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:09,880
They have to have agents and all these things to look at what you're doing

1544
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:12,920
But if they put a social media you will volunteer to give it all away

1545
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:17,060
Right, the social media is is a secondary

1546
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,480
Part to the language coding

1547
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:25,620
So for example when they see everyone using the word nice when anyone can figure out what it really means

1548
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:30,320
They said well, these people are not looking they look at the society and say they're not looking at references

1549
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:36,500
They don't care what words mean if we get enough people to use it this way the rest will follow

1550
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:41,500
Right and the same goes with everything whether it's taking shoes off at the airport

1551
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:47,220
Paying taxes what they call paying taxes this the money system or if we get enough people to emphasize

1552
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:51,340
The rest will follow and that's pretty easy

1553
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:55,580
System to employ, you know or a methodology so you can control the population

1554
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:59,740
And the ones that want to show what it really is are the oddballs out and they're bad

1555
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:01,140
Well, I'll give you a for instance

1556
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:07,740
I actually have this question about that where I think it's just become acceptable and it seems to be a very benign

1557
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:14,620
Sort of thing, but the concept of tying a piece of cloth around your neck right the tie

1558
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:20,460
It seems to me to be functionally foolish to do so

1559
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:22,740
Especially with the way a lot of people make them

1560
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:27,020
I mean, they're basically putting a noose around their neck made out of cloth and yet

1561
01:13:27,020 --> 01:13:31,780
This is the kind of thing you do to what to dress up to look more proper

1562
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:34,860
What sure what is the point of that piece of cloth?

1563
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:39,620
I I wondered this this is one of those things I've carried with me since I was a child was a

1564
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:45,420
Where I was a mark, you know, and I said to myself, it's a marker. It makes no sense though in a functional

1565
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:49,220
Yeah, well, well, if you know anyone that worked for EMS or EMT

1566
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:54,920
So anybody ever get hung by a ties that happens all the time. He wasn't wearing that tie. He would have been alive

1567
01:13:55,500 --> 01:14:01,340
Oh, yeah, it gets caught in a machine. Yeah, it gets caught a door. Yeah elevator, whatever. Okay, what what it

1568
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:05,660
what it did in certain chivalry and

1569
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:08,860
Heraldry when you wore that band

1570
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:16,000
When you look at someone and the stripes are angled, you know striped tie and they're angled down towards the right

1571
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:22,700
That means you're a right-handed. So your sword you're advertising that your weapon is at your side on your right side

1572
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:28,960
if you were a lefty when you wore the band or the tie the stripes and the dip and the

1573
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:35,820
Markings would go down towards the left and that would let whoever was coming that you're left-handed and the sword would be revealed from your

1574
01:14:35,820 --> 01:14:39,100
Left side. This is from the old days of heraldry and stuff, right?

1575
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:45,940
Okay, and then it went on to people who wore markings to it being decorative to just being pure tradition

1576
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:50,620
But let's go back to the spirit and the soul. So we'll do a fast, you know

1577
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:52,660
I could speak really fast, but I won't well

1578
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:57,480
But the reason why I brought up the tie is not not because of what you just mentioned, which is correct

1579
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:03,020
I know that part of it now, but as a child I looked at it and I said that it serves no functional purpose

1580
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:06,740
it is now just something that is a matter of

1581
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:08,800
tradition and

1582
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:14,720
Compliance so it's just an acceptable thing when you see someone with a tie on

1583
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:18,860
They are elevating themselves in some way

1584
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:25,200
But it's but but it's fairly recent because let's go back to the Revolutionary War period in the US or before that

1585
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:31,200
You're not going to see people wearing ties. You don't see George Washington or whatever on the on the bills wearing ties, right?

1586
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:36,420
It's a ruffle. So that that's a whole other thing. I have I did about 40 years ago

1587
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:42,860
I did look into that and I don't read I do recall some of but I don't see or remember exactly how

1588
01:15:42,860 --> 01:15:45,380
It became fashionable like for example

1589
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:47,840
The reason why haberdasher

1590
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:50,980
This is just to go forward not get into fashion too much

1591
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:53,840
But people stopped wearing hats if you watch all black and white movies

1592
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:59,340
Everyone wore a hat when they went outside usually denoted what your profession was in your status in society

1593
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:04,940
But it really fell off in their early 60s because Kennedy was the first

1594
01:16:04,940 --> 01:16:08,080
President to not always be publicly wearing a hat as a matter of fact

1595
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:14,020
I've never seen a photo of Kennedy JFK wearing a hat in public and all the men want to be cool

1596
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:15,260
So they stopped wearing their hats

1597
01:16:15,260 --> 01:16:21,880
that's something I heard from a woman that was around during those days people stopped men stopped wearing hats when they saw Kennedy JFK not

1598
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:25,180
Wearing a hat right you see how this goes back to the coding

1599
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:28,440
yeah, if you get someone important to do something right and

1600
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:32,620
Okay, so the soul and the spirit and the body

1601
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:38,080
They need to be defined because well, you know, I used to get into the wall

1602
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:40,480
I used to say there's no need to define the body

1603
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:43,920
But it is critically attached to the soul because when the soul dies

1604
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:45,640
the body dies

1605
01:16:46,220 --> 01:16:52,820
Right the spirit could could leave the body and the body is still alive by the way if the soul so the soul is what?

1606
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:53,860
Keeps you animated

1607
01:16:54,660 --> 01:17:01,960
The body is the physical all the physical stuff. However, you want to break it down to minutiae the soul is

1608
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:08,340
Your metabolism it is the nervous system. It is the circulatory system your breathing

1609
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:11,680
All of the way, you know all the organs function

1610
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:16,980
When you speak on pulse in the Western world, they take your pulse

1611
01:17:16,980 --> 01:17:24,060
It's your heart, but in other cultures older medicines your liver has a pulse your kidneys have a pulse, right?

1612
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:32,320
Your lungs have a pulse every every major organ in the body has its own independent pulse. They're 12 pulses that they take

1613
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:37,460
Okay, and we've gotten into the medical we will again. We don't have a medical system. That's viable

1614
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:40,640
It's basically barred from the military battlefield medicine

1615
01:17:41,220 --> 01:17:41,820
so

1616
01:17:42,540 --> 01:17:47,000
that pulse of all the organs and your heart and your lung is

1617
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:52,210
being animated in the body by your soul by your metabolism, that's why a

1618
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:56,480
Soul when when someone is not breathing and you administer CPR

1619
01:17:56,480 --> 01:18:04,760
You're putting your soul into their body until they can then be dependent on their own soul. It's not only breathing

1620
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:12,560
It's also your metabolism because you know a healthy person can hold their breath for over two or three minutes, right one exercise

1621
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:19,260
When you study Tai Chi Tai Chi or Qigong is how long can you hold your breath also in yoga, right?

1622
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:23,260
And most people think it's ridiculous, but someone who's not fit can't do it very long, right?

1623
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:28,880
Advanced you so advanced judo classes as well, you know, yes the pedestrian

1624
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:33,500
Yeah, I just I know that by experience. Sorry. Okay. Good. So you confirm it?

1625
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:35,540
From your experience, so

1626
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:42,180
So this soul that everyone's being used. Yes. I know there's soul food. That's soulful and all that

1627
01:18:42,180 --> 01:18:49,900
It's been shoved over to the cart. Well, look if the soul is intrinsically connected to the body and vice versa

1628
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:54,280
You'd have to be a very carnal materially minded

1629
01:18:55,740 --> 01:18:56,220
Society

1630
01:18:56,940 --> 01:19:01,520
Haha to lump everything together like that to make the soul you see what I mean?

1631
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:08,680
So they take the spirit definition and tell you it's the soul because once you start going into the spiritual side

1632
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:16,420
What happens to the body the physical materialistic side not that it becomes less important because you need it to animate

1633
01:19:16,420 --> 01:19:17,360
right

1634
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:22,340
You know what I'm talking about Casper the ghost right floating around

1635
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:28,940
We're talking about a physical material animation that requires the living soul to make a living body

1636
01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:34,840
So the when the soul leaves the body there's no more metabolism meaning no breathing no nervous system

1637
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:39,160
No pulmonary system cardiac system stops. Then the body goes into

1638
01:19:39,940 --> 01:19:46,360
Decomposition you see spirit is something completely different from all of that and that is the mind

1639
01:19:47,060 --> 01:19:48,360
Now, let's go back

1640
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:51,500
To the basic definitions. We said earlier

1641
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:57,400
They wouldn't be deceiving us or giving us improper information in our reference materials

1642
01:19:57,400 --> 01:20:02,460
Would they when you just look up soul and it says spirit mind breath and you look up spirit

1643
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:07,580
It's a soul mind breath. Well, wait a second. Wait a second. Why are they there's something being hidden here?

1644
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:08,980
Just like the word nice

1645
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:16,200
Right, is it really hidden though? Does it take up a lot of what does it take to find out what the word nice means?

1646
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:17,700
etymologically not much

1647
01:20:18,220 --> 01:20:23,620
Okay, so the same thing goes here and when we get into the concept of the spirit I've given the analogy

1648
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,660
if you gave a

1649
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:30,360
CD or a movie or something to a material scientist

1650
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:34,240
He'll come back with a report and he won't see what's recorded on that medium

1651
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:39,720
Unless he has the proper thing device to play it and if it's a old magnetic tape

1652
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:43,740
He needs a tape player if it's a CD. He needs a CD player or a computer

1653
01:20:43,740 --> 01:20:46,600
But as a material scientist doing his job

1654
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:51,820
He's going to measure it weigh it tell you what materials are on there the grooves and what but he can't see it's the Beatles

1655
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:52,380
White album

1656
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:55,140
Until he puts it into a specific device

1657
01:20:55,140 --> 01:21:02,040
That's outside of his tools because the material scientist isn't going to give you a tour of his lab and say this is the CD player

1658
01:21:02,660 --> 01:21:03,800
Right very rarely

1659
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:09,360
That won't happen. So when you get the material science report you give him Beatles white album

1660
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:14,240
He can't see that and he went into and did an in-depth report on what's on that CD

1661
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:21,260
You pull out your little whatever Walkman or remember those days and or a CD player and you say look it has all this music

1662
01:21:21,260 --> 01:21:21,660
on it

1663
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:26,540
The physical body and the soul the physical body would be the CD player

1664
01:21:26,540 --> 01:21:32,480
The soul would be the electricity whether it's battery or plugged into the mains to power the CD player

1665
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:38,020
Right the CD player won't work if you unplug it or take the batteries out. That's your soul. Okay?

1666
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:44,420
So the spirit is what's recorded on the medium that cannot be seen unless it's played on a particular device

1667
01:21:44,420 --> 01:21:48,640
Your spirit your mind who you are which makes it's intangible

1668
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:54,800
Even though they say there's 21 grams or 28 grams that leaves the body when someone dies, that's the levity

1669
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:56,520
It's not the spirit

1670
01:21:56,520 --> 01:22:01,000
There's no material aspect to it. Just like there's no if I give you a

1671
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:06,900
CD of Beatles white album and you weigh that CD Chuck and I

1672
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:09,980
And you could play that CD and yes indeed

1673
01:22:09,980 --> 01:22:15,680
It does have the whole Beatles white album if you're able to wipe that CD and wait again, would it weigh any different?

1674
01:22:16,420 --> 01:22:16,760
No

1675
01:22:17,740 --> 01:22:23,220
Same with magnetic tape if you had an old cassette tape, you know, remember how sometimes you they had a little tab

1676
01:22:23,220 --> 01:22:26,600
So you don't accidentally record over it. You break the tab. It won't record

1677
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:33,300
Let's say I record some music leave the tabs on weigh the tape listen to the music and then wipe the music

1678
01:22:33,860 --> 01:22:36,940
Where the magnet does it change any weight? No, it doesn't

1679
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:43,260
Effectively, it's like saying well how much does my thought weigh right now?

1680
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:50,600
Exactly it's a completely immaterial right just like I mentioned on the last call just I think this is a very good analogy when you

1681
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:51,440
find someone

1682
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:57,820
That has an ailment or a disease or whatever then you find a plant in the wild that cures it or alleviates that

1683
01:22:58,580 --> 01:23:01,080
Right, if you give that to a quote-unquote

1684
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:04,740
Academically training whatever they're going to ignore everything about that situation

1685
01:23:04,740 --> 01:23:08,280
I want to find what chemicals material chemicals are in the plant, right?

1686
01:23:08,820 --> 01:23:13,240
To reproduce or patent or whatever right and that's not that's why the medicines don't work

1687
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:17,280
Only medicines that work are the ones that go directly after the nervous system

1688
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:19,000
you know like the

1689
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:26,240
The things that bring you down on the things uppers and downers basically and painkillers. The rest of it is a total mystery to them

1690
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:33,020
okay, so the spirit is the intangible part and it's the information and you are

1691
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,560
Not only the carrier of the spirit

1692
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:41,720
But you're also the device that plays the spirit an example of you being the carrier of the spirit is when you're asleep

1693
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:50,500
Right, okay. You're you're not doing anything. Well, let's say there's no dreaming your your your soul is at a very restful state

1694
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:55,460
when you get up in the morning, essentially you're hitting play and

1695
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:57,300
The music comes on

1696
01:23:57,300 --> 01:24:02,880
well, look, I hate to do this to you, but I actually want you to go back over this because

1697
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:10,040
Moving a little quickly. I just maybe it's just me and I hope nobody listening get upset because

1698
01:24:11,140 --> 01:24:13,860
It's a little odd to me that I am both

1699
01:24:13,860 --> 01:24:17,480
I mean, it almost seems like my body would have to be the CD player as

1700
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:19,020
opposed to

1701
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:25,340
Okay, so let me get this all straight and see if I understand or I I have followed what you were saying

1702
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:26,880
the

1703
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:29,800
The body is the CD player

1704
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:34,280
The mind and spirit are

1705
01:24:36,460 --> 01:24:39,520
are actually interchangeable aren't they because

1706
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:46,900
Yes, that's the same thing. Let's let's okay. The CD is inextricably connected to the CD player

1707
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:49,060
In other words, it's a part of the material

1708
01:24:49,060 --> 01:24:56,740
physically related object and therefore so a CD the information on the CD is not

1709
01:24:56,740 --> 01:25:01,980
Perceptible unless you put it together with the unit that's supposed to play it the same with the spirit

1710
01:25:02,980 --> 01:25:06,540
Let me just maybe this is the part and remember you left out the soul

1711
01:25:06,540 --> 01:25:08,260
The soul is the power what powers this?

1712
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,080
Solar battery. Yeah, I didn't get there yet

1713
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:16,000
It's very important the energy the energy that makes it run because here's the problem

1714
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:21,120
You could have all those parts and the information is there but if you don't have the energy it does nothing

1715
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:27,160
It just sits there. So that's the soul. That's your metabolism the breath the breath, right?

1716
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:31,080
So with and when you stop the breath the rest of the system goes down, doesn't it?

1717
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:34,640
it is suffocation you end up with a a hole a

1718
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:38,640
An empty shell and a well not really no

1719
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:43,480
No, when you stop the breath and you get suffocated or asphyxiated, it's you could provide from that

1720
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:46,500
You could revive you come back from that. Oh, yeah, usually no

1721
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:53,200
No, I think it's revived before chemical decomposition, right? But once it really fully stops working. That's the end of it

1722
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:58,780
It's just you know a thing there. There are ways to revive always but

1723
01:25:59,540 --> 01:26:00,400
But but anyway

1724
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:03,780
Let me just make sure I got this. So

1725
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:10,780
The difference between the spirit and the soul is that the spirit is the intangible?

1726
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:14,400
Right. It's the thing that's not perceptible

1727
01:26:14,980 --> 01:26:19,360
It's the information. Let's stick with the CD. It's the information on the CD, right?

1728
01:26:19,420 --> 01:26:22,940
Thank you can cannot see that's the information the energy

1729
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:25,460
though is

1730
01:26:25,460 --> 01:26:27,760
different because that's

1731
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:33,220
See, this is where I'm getting energy. The energy is completely connected to the physical

1732
01:26:33,220 --> 01:26:40,920
It is the energy itself. It could be a hand crank like let's go further back from a CD. Let's say you have those old

1733
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:49,440
Magnet, what are the gramophones the Edison you hand crank it and a physical needle is magnified through a horn

1734
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:50,960
There's no electricity there

1735
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:52,620
To play the record, right?

1736
01:26:53,360 --> 01:27:00,160
With those grinder boxes. Yeah, you can do a spring-loaded cameras even same thing. Yeah, you have to wind it up. Yeah, okay

1737
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:05,440
Yeah, let's do it. Let's go to a little more technical years ago. It's called a prime mover, right?

1738
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:07,260
So when you set up a generator

1739
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:08,860
to power a city

1740
01:27:08,860 --> 01:27:14,960
Your prime mover would be a steam engine or burning coal or oil or something or nuclear to get the thing turning, right?

1741
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:19,060
It's called a prime the soul in engineering terms is called the prime mover

1742
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:23,800
Because it animates the body and without the body the whole thing doesn't play

1743
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:29,960
Okay, so let's go back. Maybe this might be easier. Let's give a reference that is pretty solid

1744
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:34,280
You know the English language most languages borrow from other languages, right?

1745
01:27:36,060 --> 01:27:42,100
They by the way in a I'm going to use the Greek prefix PNU is where you get

1746
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:46,760
Pneumatic pneumonia that has to do with the movement of air

1747
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:51,220
The soul in Greek is a pneuma pneuma

1748
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:53,440
Pneuma

1749
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:57,620
Pneuma they pronounce pneuma. Okay

1750
01:27:58,420 --> 01:27:59,940
That is the soul

1751
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:07,120
So if we look at what the English is borrowing to communicate this the PSY prefix

1752
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:11,240
Psyche or psyche means the mind or the or the spirit

1753
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:13,900
We need that's where we use the prefix

1754
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:18,380
Psychologists psychotic right that has to do with the mind

1755
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:21,580
Which is the spirit so we do find?

1756
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:25,340
if we go back and look at the root and how this

1757
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:28,720
Concept of spirit and soul is

1758
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:35,040
Communicated using Greek prefixes and we look at the roots of the Greek prefixes, which are typically pretty

1759
01:28:35,940 --> 01:28:41,660
Technical right, you know, we use a lot of Greek prefixes like pro or ante or whatever

1760
01:28:41,660 --> 01:28:48,620
So you can take any word and put the PRO prefix and it'll change its meaning or if you take any word and put the

1761
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:51,860
Anti meaning the anti prefix it will change it

1762
01:28:51,860 --> 01:28:58,680
So the same goes true for spirit and soul when the PSY prefix shows up which means spirit

1763
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:01,360
It means it has something to do with the mind

1764
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:08,020
So if you run into someone that has a PSY in their job description psychologists psychiatrists, you know what?

1765
01:29:08,060 --> 01:29:11,520
They're if you really wanted to translate that word into more simple term

1766
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:15,600
They wouldn't be called a psychologist or a psychiatrist. It would be called a spiritualist

1767
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:22,060
Think about it, right? Okay. So when you say I have a pneumatic tire or pneumonia

1768
01:29:22,060 --> 01:29:25,040
Are you thinking about your big toe or your spit or your mind?

1769
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:32,100
No, you're thinking about your lungs. It's air. It's a movement of air and pneumonia of the lungs. So yeah, exactly, right?

1770
01:29:32,180 --> 01:29:38,300
Okay, so if I say I have a pneumatic problem, do they tell you you go to a psychiatrist? No, that's right

1771
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:43,220
Okay, so this is how in other words when I realized this decades ago. I was like wow

1772
01:29:43,220 --> 01:29:45,400
I just like split an iceberg

1773
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:53,140
Because these things were all lumped together and they're really as different as anything could be but are they related, you know

1774
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:59,640
It's like if you if you cut the cable off of the CD player the wire that plugs into the mains into the wall, right?

1775
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:01,980
That is just a piece of wire, right?

1776
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:07,540
But it's it's an it's very important that you that you attach it in order to play the thing, right?

1777
01:30:07,940 --> 01:30:10,200
So are there many aspects to this that are like that?

1778
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:17,060
That's why I like to stress the soul and the body work together if those two stop working like you could have the CD player

1779
01:30:17,060 --> 01:30:22,240
But if you unplug it, you ain't hearing nothing, right and you won't because you're not going to turn it by hand

1780
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:27,640
It's it requires a lot. The CD player is a better analogy than the gramophone that you turn by hand

1781
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:34,680
You know the old grinder thing, right? Okay, so because you could physically just by hand turn it

1782
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:36,880
Without even a CD player

1783
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:41,200
You're not going to power the laser and the timing chips and all ain't gonna happen just like your body

1784
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:47,500
You need the the cable. So you need the soul to keep the body going by the way when someone is on

1785
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:50,300
What do they call it when you're in the hospital if they unplug you you die?

1786
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:55,400
What do they call that? They got someone there's life support or yes life support

1787
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:59,680
So what life support is a synthetic soul?

1788
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:05,940
Mm-hmm. Think about if they if they unplug him he dies, right? So what so what's the difference?

1789
01:31:06,220 --> 01:31:13,200
Well one when you're plugged into life support, it's assisting the breathing with a ventilator, right? It's probably doing other things, right?

1790
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:17,340
All right. Okay, that's your soul. It's basically a so the soul has been duplicated

1791
01:31:17,340 --> 01:31:23,060
Technologically in most cases right and so as the spirit, but that gets us so teric the speed of you know

1792
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:28,560
That's the personality. You can have a portable spirit every time if you have a CD player or DVD collection

1793
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:34,580
each one of those discs has a different spirit but if like I said on the last time we spoke publicly if you scratched all

1794
01:31:34,580 --> 01:31:36,260
The titles off and put them in a big pile

1795
01:31:36,260 --> 01:31:41,220
The only way to find out what's on it is to play it right the only way in this realm

1796
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:47,300
There's no way you can detect it other than the in using the device that it was used to power

1797
01:31:47,300 --> 01:31:54,040
So the spirit opens up and it shows us that we are basically running an information protocol

1798
01:31:55,220 --> 01:31:58,400
Okay, I just took it forward and I

1799
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:05,160
Don't know how much more to simplify it because certain there is no like out of the okay

1800
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:06,300
I

1801
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:09,820
Think I broke it down and I have been breaking it down this way for a very long time

1802
01:32:09,820 --> 01:32:16,040
What I gave the information that you have the physical body that requires the soul which is the breath and the metabolism

1803
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:19,680
Once those two are working together and you're conscious awake

1804
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:21,660
the spirit then

1805
01:32:21,660 --> 01:32:29,660
Can be can perform through that or it seems to be animated through the body right unless there's telepathy

1806
01:32:30,580 --> 01:32:36,800
Right. Okay, because if unless you're animating with your voice drawing or your actions the old as they say

1807
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:42,780
I can't read your mind, right? You have to tell me right? Well, that's so you're gonna be vocal. Yeah, that's communication

1808
01:32:42,780 --> 01:32:48,580
Versus the internal. I mean you you can play the CD and if there's no speaker

1809
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:54,780
To express it. It's not being heard. It is playing the information is running

1810
01:32:55,700 --> 01:33:00,680
And it is happening, but it's not being communicated. It's not being heard because you also require the speaker

1811
01:33:01,540 --> 01:33:05,240
That that would be a monk living in solitude, right?

1812
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:09,140
You just he's still thinking he's still alive, but no one's getting anything out of his head

1813
01:33:09,140 --> 01:33:14,080
Yeah, nobody because he's not speaking to anybody. He's not can write so it's part of it. Yeah. Yeah the CD player

1814
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:15,380
Let's say it's a boombox

1815
01:33:15,380 --> 01:33:18,580
But it's part of a system just like we are part of a system and those other

1816
01:33:19,340 --> 01:33:23,380
Attachments come on spiritually then they manifest physically like for example

1817
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:29,900
You can get a mindful notion and then change your physical appearance. It's called fashion

1818
01:33:29,900 --> 01:33:33,660
Why do you why does this guy always wear black? Where did he get that?

1819
01:33:33,740 --> 01:33:39,380
Like every time he walked to the closet all the black clothing at the rack at the store jumped on him

1820
01:33:39,380 --> 01:33:43,820
No, he literally made a decision to do that tattoos what you eat

1821
01:33:43,820 --> 01:33:44,760
Where you

1822
01:33:45,820 --> 01:33:51,720
Everything communication is not just how you speak and write. It's actually you can communicate a lot. Well, it's not even such your appearance

1823
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:55,800
Yeah, well, that's the thing too is that it's not even necessarily about a direct decision, right?

1824
01:33:55,860 --> 01:34:02,140
because when somebody is feeling differently internally and they tell you this all the time every kind of

1825
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:06,560
life coach somebody who advises somebody professionally

1826
01:34:07,620 --> 01:34:09,480
Etc. What do they always tell you?

1827
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:16,120
Your attitude will change the way that you present yourself to people because what's going on internally gets

1828
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:21,540
Communicated why your posture changes you stand up straighter. Sure you present that's communication

1829
01:34:21,540 --> 01:34:25,680
So that's your committee, but your attitude is based on information in your mind

1830
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:33,360
All right, if you have a negative outlook that if you analyze how you got the negative outlook you would see a transcript of

1831
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:36,980
Information that lead led you that way and the opposite would be true

1832
01:34:36,980 --> 01:34:43,560
But the thing I wanted to bring up because it to bring it back to your spiritual family are the ones that you

1833
01:34:46,240 --> 01:34:49,380
Even though you're still communicating through the physical part

1834
01:34:49,380 --> 01:34:56,580
The mental part does not meet any of the spiritual part meaning the mental the information that you convey back and forth meets

1835
01:34:56,580 --> 01:35:01,360
No resistance until you hit a boundary and that defines what we call the relationship

1836
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:05,700
Right. So let me give you an example how this has been corrupted

1837
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:08,480
Okay, if you speak to a

1838
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:12,580
Christian they say it's a personal relationship with God they say right

1839
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:19,720
Okay, that is the same kind of juvenile cop-out as the person that says I ever I'm not good at math

1840
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:25,060
He starts saying what's 2 plus 2 plus 7? I'm not good at math. Wait a second a chicken can do that

1841
01:35:25,060 --> 01:35:26,920
You don't even have to be right

1842
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:31,800
I think birds count better than that can count that because again at some point in their life

1843
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:36,900
Decided so they could spend the rest of their life saying that to get out of working on that particular topic

1844
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:42,680
Right is emotional laziness the same thing when they say you have to have a personal relationship with God. Oh, wow

1845
01:35:42,680 --> 01:35:49,460
Personal means personal that means I cannot give you an opinion on that and you can't tell me what to do

1846
01:35:49,460 --> 01:35:50,760
I can't tell you what to do

1847
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:55,600
So someone who says I have to have a personal it's about having a personal relationship with God

1848
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:57,280
They just put themselves in a cage

1849
01:35:57,280 --> 01:36:03,340
Right because for anything from the outside to come in to either diminish that or improve it as nearly impossible

1850
01:36:03,340 --> 01:36:09,320
Well another way to kind of look at this is that and it took me a while to figure it out

1851
01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:12,160
You know, I admit it's slow learners sometimes

1852
01:36:13,220 --> 01:36:13,740
but

1853
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:21,360
In personal relationships, right? What has worked? Everybody always says well you get comfortable with somebody

1854
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:28,900
You don't get comfortable with somebody there is comfort in guess what there is a lack of resistance

1855
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:37,200
right to your way of being like I point out all the time that the the people that I've had the longest relationships with

1856
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:40,420
have been people where there isn't a

1857
01:36:40,420 --> 01:36:43,120
resistance you can just sit there and

1858
01:36:43,120 --> 01:36:50,820
Be around them and there isn't a need to perform. There isn't a pressure. There isn't a boundary there isn't

1859
01:36:50,820 --> 01:36:57,980
Constant rules because it's already boundaries are not rigid. They're not rigid because you're actually already

1860
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:01,320
Sort of oriented that way. It's it's already there

1861
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:04,440
You know, you don't have to build it and people say oh, no

1862
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:09,920
You have to build these things and you have to establish them and if you're doing all that work, then obviously

1863
01:37:10,640 --> 01:37:14,780
You didn't you know, you didn't have that relationship on that level

1864
01:37:16,420 --> 01:37:17,520
And I don't know if I'm

1865
01:37:18,420 --> 01:37:25,380
No, well, it's not really a level because when we say level it's vertical, you know, yeah up or down I would say this

1866
01:37:25,380 --> 01:37:28,560
very simply if you if you

1867
01:37:29,340 --> 01:37:30,800
react to something

1868
01:37:32,440 --> 01:37:38,460
Whether it's positive or negative that reaction has to have some kind of a stimulus that brought it on right

1869
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:46,480
Okay, so there if you have a very rigid boundary with someone and you hit that boundary and there's a reaction

1870
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:52,520
Also, if you have a very loose boundary or no boundary there's a reaction

1871
01:37:54,020 --> 01:37:56,480
like if you let's say have a co-worker and

1872
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:01,980
Let's say you're a guy and she's a gal and you find her very attractive and you're like

1873
01:38:01,980 --> 01:38:04,420
you don't know how to ask her out on a date and

1874
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:09,060
One day right before lunch she gets up and gives you a big hug and tongue kisses you

1875
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:16,740
Right, even though you wanted that a very passionate kiss or something like that you kind of freak out a little bit

1876
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:23,680
It's almost as much as if you didn't want it the reaction right because it's so out of the norm

1877
01:38:23,680 --> 01:38:26,760
So sometimes it's not the impedance

1878
01:38:27,300 --> 01:38:33,540
The resistance is not only sometimes what defines a relationship. It's also that there's no boundary can define

1879
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:41,220
If the spirit is the mind and knowledge when you have a situation where you have a quote-unquote a free flow of knowledge

1880
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:47,360
There's no boundaries there for knowledge right like censorship for example, right?

1881
01:38:48,260 --> 01:38:51,320
Is a type of relationship, right? How many people do you hear?

1882
01:38:52,420 --> 01:38:58,740
I can't put this on YouTube. All right. I can't say this on YouTube, right or whatever. Okay?

1883
01:38:59,420 --> 01:39:02,920
What what they're doing is funny. I've been watching this for a long time

1884
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:08,840
YouTube is controlling the relationship by putting up certain boundaries and penalties and

1885
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:13,740
violations and all that the same thing happens constantly but

1886
01:39:13,740 --> 01:39:21,180
When we go over to the again the family and the the spiritual family not being in your family is not always true

1887
01:39:21,180 --> 01:39:27,500
But in most cases it is because of the culture that the family was in and then it also depends on the person's maturity

1888
01:39:27,500 --> 01:39:28,780
So think of it this way

1889
01:39:28,780 --> 01:39:33,120
Let's say you're a young child and you already established that from a young

1890
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:35,980
Let's say the a formative years eight or nine years old

1891
01:39:35,980 --> 01:39:43,720
It is true. It is like a bit of wisdom that you have your your personal material family mom dad sister, whatever

1892
01:39:44,420 --> 01:39:45,380
dog and

1893
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:49,260
But your real they may or may not be your real spiritual family

1894
01:39:49,260 --> 01:39:52,960
Your real spiritual family is out there and you just have to meet them

1895
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:59,700
Think about what kind of an advantage you would have or also if you were very young and knew that and also

1896
01:39:59,700 --> 01:40:05,820
How that can be taken advantage of if it was part of your culture how you would be taken advantage of it, right?

1897
01:40:05,900 --> 01:40:08,260
So either way you can't be naive about this

1898
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:14,780
but the thing to bring it home was because this whole thing that sparked off this one and a half parts is

1899
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:19,760
the spiritual family and the physical family and the the concept of the

1900
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:25,880
The the mind which is the spirit the soul the metabolism and the body and

1901
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:32,930
Tying it all together. It will probably won't get done until we again mature and

1902
01:40:34,220 --> 01:40:36,540
What comes with that maturity is patience?

1903
01:40:37,420 --> 01:40:39,100
How many times have I been on?

1904
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:44,580
Sonic events and I said it's not time yet to talk about this for years. Oh, yes

1905
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:52,160
And then time goes by and then I do give more information and it's not because I'm hoarding or anything like that

1906
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:56,900
I just don't see any relevancy or any value in it at the moment. That's my personal decision

1907
01:40:58,140 --> 01:41:00,260
but the importance of the

1908
01:41:00,260 --> 01:41:05,120
Which we're going to get into time a little bit more like when we were on break. I said look if you

1909
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:06,540
cognitively

1910
01:41:07,060 --> 01:41:12,720
Train yourself first. You have to tell yourself and then becomes normal like when you first learn to tie your shoelaces

1911
01:41:13,160 --> 01:41:18,000
You might you really had to pay attention to what you were doing the first few times you did it, right, right

1912
01:41:18,460 --> 01:41:22,060
Okay, but then now you don't the same with many other things we take

1913
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:29,400
As being everyday occurrences, we don't have to think about once you start acknowledging and making a reminder to self

1914
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:34,700
However, you want to do it and I mean like in-your-face reminder that the day starts at solar noon wherever you are

1915
01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:42,060
You're going to have a reactive change in your body. That's you're going to feel suddenly like you just clicked in

1916
01:41:42,060 --> 01:41:43,320
It's kind of like

1917
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:50,120
You know when you're setting up your musician and you're setting up the PA system or the amplifiers and all that

1918
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:52,580
Even if you don't know what you're doing

1919
01:41:53,020 --> 01:41:56,160
You're going to get to a point where you say this is how it sounds the best, right?

1920
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:59,980
If I do it this way I get feedback this way. It's not loud enough, right?

1921
01:42:01,260 --> 01:42:04,720
That's part of the timekeeping and isn't information flow

1922
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:11,380
Also a matter of time, you know how many megabytes per second right, right

1923
01:42:12,060 --> 01:42:16,980
How many words can you type per minute or how many words? Can you read per minute?

1924
01:42:18,240 --> 01:42:18,480
right

1925
01:42:19,020 --> 01:42:20,260
And all this other stuff

1926
01:42:20,260 --> 01:42:27,660
So how about it when we start getting into a society that is has ratings constantly rated how many words per minute or?

1927
01:42:28,200 --> 01:42:28,960
Whatever, whatever

1928
01:42:29,660 --> 01:42:32,720
Once you understand that you could do it all at the same time

1929
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:39,400
But you have to do it in a way based on a time function that it that it can be communicated and make sense

1930
01:42:40,180 --> 01:42:44,120
Right, like how many times have you heard someone I have I have so many things

1931
01:42:44,120 --> 01:42:48,000
I want to say and I can't say it all at once. I have to go down the line, right?

1932
01:42:48,460 --> 01:42:49,940
You have this serial kind of thing

1933
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:54,100
You have to say one thing and then the next thing you can't be speaking it to

1934
01:42:54,100 --> 01:42:59,640
There are singers by the way that could sing multiple chords and tones very very difficult

1935
01:43:00,500 --> 01:43:04,160
Well, so or there is a natural thing sometimes built in

1936
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:09,280
I mean, there's a semi or additional tone that is due to a physical structure

1937
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:15,880
But it's it's rarefied to intentionally do that is is something that is difficult. But then again

1938
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:17,840
if we look at

1939
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:26,140
Communication as it's evolved. I know you know technology is a difficult subject, but here's the thing

1940
01:43:27,160 --> 01:43:33,700
The idea that I could transfer fully the information in a movie

1941
01:43:34,160 --> 01:43:41,100
To someone that would have required a whole lot of physicality not too long ago and a bunch more time

1942
01:43:41,860 --> 01:43:45,680
Nowadays you download it you have it you can watch it

1943
01:43:45,680 --> 01:43:51,220
You know quickening of the spirit kind of thing where you can get a tremendous amount

1944
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:59,080
Basically communication or information being sent over and less time. Yes, right. So why is it that people I?

1945
01:43:59,580 --> 01:44:04,080
Have said throughout history was certain literary works when you read it, it's very dense

1946
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:08,040
You have to read it more than once. Mm-hmm to understand it, right?

1947
01:44:08,260 --> 01:44:13,160
That's because it's very dense. There's a lot of information jammed into one right little package

1948
01:44:14,660 --> 01:44:20,820
So one way to get ahead of all of this stuff the cultural stuff. Who's your spiritual family?

1949
01:44:21,860 --> 01:44:27,720
The communication and all that is to get a lock on how you can interact with all this

1950
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:30,960
Information because the spirit is all about information

1951
01:44:31,620 --> 01:44:32,780
It's it's not

1952
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:39,340
How would you say it to get away from the religiosity that's been put on us

1953
01:44:39,340 --> 01:44:46,760
What's interesting the biggest sabotage on people that are quote-unquote in the convention talk about the collective now that?

1954
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:53,040
They get this feeling of being spiritual or one with the source or God or whatever religion they're in

1955
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:59,060
What happens to their information base it goes to zero they get really dumb clear your head don't think of it

1956
01:44:59,060 --> 01:45:01,900
Just feel it right and that is the complete opposite

1957
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:06,740
with any higher cause dealing with let's say a divine being or

1958
01:45:07,180 --> 01:45:13,360
even dealing with someone that is in your spiritual family very rarely would it just be about feeling and

1959
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:19,520
Even if you're looking at guys that get together for Sunday football with drinking beer or whatever

1960
01:45:20,440 --> 01:45:25,760
They're still interacting in the information how what's the score? How long does this player been there?

1961
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:30,280
How much is he making what team was he before you see there's never this dumb lull

1962
01:45:30,280 --> 01:45:31,340
nothingness

1963
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:38,640
It's always about managing high streams high levels of information within the context and within the subject so

1964
01:45:39,320 --> 01:45:41,820
There I could see why throughout the ages

1965
01:45:41,820 --> 01:45:45,500
The spirit in other words spiritual work quote-unquote

1966
01:45:45,500 --> 01:45:51,120
I know it sounds funny to say that but doing spiritual work has got nothing to do with what's been put out there

1967
01:45:51,120 --> 01:45:55,720
Whether it's in the alternative or in the convention it is all about information

1968
01:45:55,720 --> 01:46:03,400
And how you process it within your mind your spirit, and how mature are you and what could you handle right?

1969
01:46:05,140 --> 01:46:08,700
No right I know it's it's kind of like all these thoughts thrown together

1970
01:46:08,700 --> 01:46:12,480
I think we should organize it in the next few minutes here. Yeah, no I

1971
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:17,880
That's what I was thinking here is that you know what if I if I imagine it this way

1972
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:25,120
The speed at which you can turn your head allows you to see things at different angles, right?

1973
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:30,940
There are things going on behind you that you're not looking at just if you're only using your eyes

1974
01:46:31,980 --> 01:46:33,000
Etc so

1975
01:46:34,060 --> 01:46:34,620
if

1976
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:38,320
at the point where you're observing if

1977
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:44,540
If you're able to take in more and process more and communicate more at a higher rate of speed

1978
01:46:46,100 --> 01:46:50,400
Indeed it creates a more dense experience it creates a more

1979
01:46:51,320 --> 01:46:55,300
Textured experience right it doesn't have to be though high-speed

1980
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:00,920
But that but the if you're trained to do that if you can get yourself to take in more

1981
01:47:00,920 --> 01:47:05,020
Information and process and communicate more information more densely it would be better

1982
01:47:05,020 --> 01:47:10,440
Yes, that's how you get to a more mature point, but you have to adjust it of course right if you're going to do

1983
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:14,900
Public speaking you're not going to you're not going to speak at 120 words per minute

1984
01:47:14,900 --> 01:47:21,420
You might get it down to 75 which is more listenable right well, but again. It's about the communication of it

1985
01:47:21,420 --> 01:47:24,580
But what I was trying to get at is that it's about the density of the subject

1986
01:47:24,580 --> 01:47:29,540
It's about the the the nuance and all the things that are contained within

1987
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:36,200
Speed is is relevant though because you know at a very slow rate if you have very little to relate to

1988
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:38,100
Or you have very little to communicate

1989
01:47:38,680 --> 01:47:41,500
Then it's not such a big deal that you take it very slowly

1990
01:47:42,500 --> 01:47:47,660
Sure, but but the thing to bring to bring it home Chuck is the spirit is where all this comes from

1991
01:47:48,660 --> 01:47:54,820
Right if you look at the ancient text you get knowledge from us at the spirit right from the divine you get a download even

1992
01:47:54,820 --> 01:47:58,940
With a computer it comes from an intangible sense there are no electrons right little

1993
01:47:59,540 --> 01:48:04,240
There's no mass moving along the wires or the Wi-Fi right you see so once

1994
01:48:05,460 --> 01:48:10,480
Okay, once we understand that we being conscious and the spirit the mind

1995
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:18,940
Information that animates us is completely different from the way. We use the term soul and all this other stuff and we distinguish it

1996
01:48:20,020 --> 01:48:23,900
You've just gone to the next level. You've just been able to to segregate

1997
01:48:23,900 --> 01:48:29,000
I mean, it's it's the same thing like when the when an automobile is not working right the

1998
01:48:29,540 --> 01:48:31,380
Person opens the hood and they see all this stuff

1999
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:36,400
They call a mechanic because they don't mechanic if the engine is running as he's approaching the cars not to look at

2000
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:39,820
Oh, that's the that's the power steering pump. I can hear it right

2001
01:48:39,820 --> 01:48:46,300
They they have the information and they can communicate and they fix it right where the average person say oh the cars not running, right?

2002
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:52,940
I don't know well the mechanic on a spiritual level is much higher much more mature and developed when it comes to cars, right?

2003
01:48:53,820 --> 01:48:55,040
Then your average person

2004
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:57,440
right so

2005
01:48:57,440 --> 01:49:01,480
I was having a conversation recently with someone said you know in other worlds

2006
01:49:02,440 --> 01:49:07,440
Children, let's say they have a similar lifespan actually there are a few hundred years on other worlds

2007
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:09,540
They by the time they're eight years old

2008
01:49:09,540 --> 01:49:15,920
They have already have what the equivalent of three or four master's degrees you would get here on earth at that age

2009
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:17,880
that's the level of their education system and

2010
01:49:18,700 --> 01:49:23,500
You'd say oh, they're they're much more evolved than us. No. They're not there exactly. They're just us living in a different world

2011
01:49:24,540 --> 01:49:28,000
In other words were completely interchangeable in other words if you were raised there

2012
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:34,600
You would also have the equivalent of four graduate degrees at eight years old, and if they were raised here

2013
01:49:35,060 --> 01:49:38,280
You would have a graduate degree and still be on a third grade level

2014
01:49:39,660 --> 01:49:40,400
You see

2015
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:46,580
Completely interchangeable, so you know how we were saying earlier. It doesn't matter if it's fact or if it's fiction cosmically

2016
01:49:46,580 --> 01:49:48,860
Did you get did you get that information?

2017
01:49:50,240 --> 01:49:52,620
Right right in the cosmic sense

2018
01:49:53,260 --> 01:49:55,680
The information being fact or fiction is

2019
01:49:56,780 --> 01:49:59,700
Is not important is did you have do you have that concept?

2020
01:50:00,660 --> 01:50:06,960
Right you know how we have the sci-fi concept since the 1950s of flying saucers with aliens who become popular

2021
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:12,260
There are far more people on the world right now than had that concept. Let's say 200 years ago

2022
01:50:12,920 --> 01:50:13,440
now

2023
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:18,000
It doesn't matter if it's fiction. You know the concept

2024
01:50:19,140 --> 01:50:20,460
You see right

2025
01:50:20,460 --> 01:50:28,380
Well and and I look at art like that because a painting of something doesn't have to be exactly accurate to communicate the idea

2026
01:50:28,380 --> 01:50:29,540
it was

2027
01:50:30,140 --> 01:50:31,960
communicated and

2028
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:40,000
Before the action takes place there is that inspiration or that desire to communicate said thing in the painting

2029
01:50:40,900 --> 01:50:44,340
Right so sure unless you're looking at the modern

2030
01:50:44,340 --> 01:50:50,240
Art world, then it's that's a difference to want to get conspiratorial you can on that, but you know

2031
01:50:50,240 --> 01:50:56,320
Yeah, yeah, but you know I'm not I'm not trying to go for the modern. You know oddities. I'm saying that in

2032
01:50:56,840 --> 01:51:00,220
Historically what has always been pretty much?

2033
01:51:01,200 --> 01:51:08,020
You know is is that you communicate an idea an image imagery a bunch of things not?

2034
01:51:08,240 --> 01:51:13,000
Just the you know when when when you paint a woman. It's not just about the woman

2035
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:19,900
It's about where she's positioned what's around or everything else. It's meant to communicate a much more complex idea

2036
01:51:20,700 --> 01:51:28,280
But yeah, is it dark is it light is it religious is it punk is it what yeah, right exactly is there styles in this?

2037
01:51:28,720 --> 01:51:33,200
Thank you brought up the idea of style style the same thing goes with style

2038
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:38,700
When you meet someone their personality is what you're dealing with is just their spirit

2039
01:51:39,480 --> 01:51:43,560
The the personality that's the other thing I didn't I didn't bring it up

2040
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:47,900
But you're who you are personal personality is your spirit

2041
01:51:47,900 --> 01:51:52,760
Just like there's a Star Trek where they land on a planet and they're millions of years old

2042
01:51:52,760 --> 01:51:57,320
They don't need bodies anymore. It's just these globes and the globes talk right right and they want to get bodies

2043
01:51:57,320 --> 01:52:02,580
So they go into bodies just to feel what it was like again. That's the same spirit. That was in the body

2044
01:52:02,580 --> 01:52:04,960
It just needs to be animated somehow

2045
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:08,820
So this the idea of spirit hit

2046
01:52:08,820 --> 01:52:15,980
This is a very good way to filter what's going on around and if you around you in in the world you are and when?

2047
01:52:15,980 --> 01:52:22,880
You hear people use the word spiritual or this is spiritual whatever examine it and see what it is in 99% of the time

2048
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:25,980
it's going to be if not all the time fluff and stupidity and

2049
01:52:26,600 --> 01:52:29,500
vacuous and void of anything usable and

2050
01:52:30,380 --> 01:52:34,840
Mature and all that right so well back to the motivational speaker

2051
01:52:34,840 --> 01:52:42,180
You know where again they they are presenting something for you to feel something, but it's really about their benefit not yours

2052
01:52:42,900 --> 01:52:48,700
We'll get into that the emo what if you ask anyone, why do we have emotions? They don't know I?

2053
01:52:49,540 --> 01:52:53,940
I'm not saying that I know but I can tell you how we can use it and how like for example

2054
01:52:53,940 --> 01:53:00,320
Why do you have a pinky finger we write or any appendage in your body the emotional is a platform

2055
01:53:00,320 --> 01:53:02,260
I mean how many times have you heard?

2056
01:53:02,500 --> 01:53:08,860
He's a pretty cool calm collected guy, but he got emotional and you just blew every you got a gun and shot everyone

2057
01:53:09,380 --> 01:53:12,520
Right whoa wait a second you said he was common collective

2058
01:53:12,520 --> 01:53:17,840
So you think that his emotions drove him to do that wow those emotions are very powerful. How come we're not

2059
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:23,580
Focusing on that well they used to say you lost they used to say you lost your mind if you did that right

2060
01:53:24,460 --> 01:53:30,440
Lost your spirit. Yes, because your particular mind or your spirit had a certain track or a certain type

2061
01:53:30,440 --> 01:53:36,080
And you lost it and another one or influence so influenced that it's no longer the same thing

2062
01:53:37,220 --> 01:53:43,580
So this I can't let me just say on the end the mind the way that I think and evaluate things is

2063
01:53:43,580 --> 01:53:46,120
First on a spiritual level what mind?

2064
01:53:46,940 --> 01:53:54,380
You know is is being communicated and what is being imparted like what mine is imparting like if you turn on the television show they call

2065
01:53:54,380 --> 01:53:54,820
the news

2066
01:53:55,400 --> 01:54:00,680
The you will see that they're imparting up before they even start speaking you see there's a certain

2067
01:54:00,680 --> 01:54:03,320
Thing that's set up, and when they start speaking

2068
01:54:03,820 --> 01:54:05,620
It's not how they look anymore

2069
01:54:05,620 --> 01:54:12,220
It's what they're saying right and you could see all the attachments well a sensitive person will notice something is not right here

2070
01:54:12,220 --> 01:54:19,020
But every other the way it's set up every other part of me says it is but something is not right you see

2071
01:54:19,560 --> 01:54:24,520
So and this is that's why the news and the media get over on people because they've been separated

2072
01:54:24,520 --> 01:54:26,820
They don't they have no control and no

2073
01:54:26,820 --> 01:54:32,720
Tangibility or definition to what is the spirit and the mind what is communication? What is thought knowledge?

2074
01:54:33,700 --> 01:54:35,300
it all based on the spirit and

2075
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:42,580
That'll start to make sense if you start looking into ancient writs, and they're quote-unquote spiritual documents

2076
01:54:43,560 --> 01:54:48,920
A modern person looking at them is going to think it's woo. I should be feeling good. No. No has nothing to do with that

2077
01:54:48,920 --> 01:54:52,660
It's really knowledge. You know in ancient times

2078
01:54:52,660 --> 01:54:55,380
Written material was so rare I

2079
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:02,940
Have mentioned this libraries and things like that that it was very expensive to interact with written material from the past

2080
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:04,000
so

2081
01:55:04,700 --> 01:55:08,700
Okay, I think we're we don't want to maybe run down too much time

2082
01:55:08,700 --> 01:55:13,980
But what do you think we've we hit near an hour or so yeah well on this part

2083
01:55:13,980 --> 01:55:20,380
I I'm I am just simply following an internal clock on my part here, but let's take a little go

2084
01:55:20,940 --> 01:55:27,500
And yeah, I was feeling as though. It's about time to wrap this one up with with just one last little thing

2085
01:55:27,500 --> 01:55:30,020
I think we're going to have to get into time

2086
01:55:31,540 --> 01:55:32,500
again and

2087
01:55:32,500 --> 01:55:36,220
Go a little further with it. I mean you mentioned it here about starting your day

2088
01:55:36,760 --> 01:55:39,060
You know at at what they call noon

2089
01:55:40,040 --> 01:55:41,740
solar noon solar noon

2090
01:55:41,740 --> 01:55:47,220
But that is the reason I said solar noon is get away from the wind-up toy right

2091
01:55:47,780 --> 01:55:55,060
Because it's right okay, but that that is that is the appropriate time to start the day and and look there are reasons

2092
01:55:55,060 --> 01:55:59,800
why the day was said to start at different times and for different reasons and

2093
01:56:00,500 --> 01:56:05,480
we did discuss that in the past, but I think we could take it a bit further and

2094
01:56:06,520 --> 01:56:09,680
It will be interesting to to go over it

2095
01:56:09,680 --> 01:56:14,900
But really quickly before you go though you brought up something here toward the end which

2096
01:56:14,900 --> 01:56:21,920
Which I always find interesting almost always there's something at the end of these discussions that you and I have it seems to be a pattern

2097
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:22,660
with us

2098
01:56:23,180 --> 01:56:27,680
Yes, that could sort of lead into another direction right away

2099
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:30,120
and

2100
01:56:30,120 --> 01:56:33,660
In this case I would say

2101
01:56:35,100 --> 01:56:37,760
that the breakdown of the

2102
01:56:38,380 --> 01:56:39,520
of the

2103
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:47,540
Spiritual relationship the parameters that were set you know when you're talking about the news that again is something that became part of

2104
01:56:47,540 --> 01:56:51,640
Convention right that this was an authority to present

2105
01:56:52,300 --> 01:56:55,140
Information this is how you became informed

2106
01:56:56,180 --> 01:56:57,520
You're right, but

2107
01:56:57,520 --> 01:57:02,940
Here we go. We know that there's some artificial about the communication. We know that there's something

2108
01:57:03,620 --> 01:57:05,040
Dishonest about it

2109
01:57:05,040 --> 01:57:10,720
Well the news Chuck is just like the lady that says I'm not technical or the guy that says I'm not

2110
01:57:10,720 --> 01:57:14,920
Mathematical at one point they got something important that was usable

2111
01:57:14,920 --> 01:57:19,880
Mm-hmm, and they said since I did get a piece of information that was usable here

2112
01:57:20,500 --> 01:57:26,700
Thus it must be all the time and even though I know intuitively it's not I still have to follow through on that, right?

2113
01:57:28,420 --> 01:57:32,060
Well, it's what I mean, yeah, no, it's much like the library

2114
01:57:32,780 --> 01:57:37,380
Or the libraries that used to exist in certain places if you were to go to one now

2115
01:57:37,380 --> 01:57:42,660
Which I don't know if anybody does anymore waste of time 20 years ago was a waste of time, but yeah

2116
01:57:42,660 --> 01:57:45,560
Well, it's become much more of a waste of time

2117
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:49,960
Because of what do they have in there now a lot of computer stations?

2118
01:57:51,520 --> 01:57:55,380
So, you know, that's that look if it's if

2119
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:57,580
Do you remember on the old sonic events?

2120
01:57:57,580 --> 01:58:04,420
Everything that could have been known was known by the 1890s and then everything went downhill from there and they showed it to you

2121
01:58:04,420 --> 01:58:05,300
after

2122
01:58:05,300 --> 01:58:08,440
1913 and by the 1920s in the 1940s

2123
01:58:08,440 --> 01:58:12,100
They proved it to you that all the knowledge was taken away all critical knowledge

2124
01:58:12,100 --> 01:58:13,960
continuation of

2125
01:58:13,960 --> 01:58:18,340
Sciences continuation of history, you know, all of that was taken away

2126
01:58:18,340 --> 01:58:23,700
So, I don't know unless you're what if you were born you'd be 83 if you were born in 40

2127
01:58:23,700 --> 01:58:28,780
So you'd have to be a hundred and forty hundred and fifty years old to have caught it on and you know

2128
01:58:28,780 --> 01:58:32,060
It to actually be out in the public venue and get something worthwhile

2129
01:58:32,060 --> 01:58:38,340
So if you're younger than a hundred and fifty, you've probably never been exposed to worthwhile information on the fly

2130
01:58:39,720 --> 01:58:46,160
Well, but that's it is that these things have changed over time and why that's happened

2131
01:58:46,160 --> 01:58:48,860
I think that that'll take us through a little bit

2132
01:58:49,380 --> 01:58:52,340
Yeah, and it just to give a quick thing the same thing. I've been talking

2133
01:58:52,340 --> 01:58:56,680
They know they don't have a lot of time left. The big one's coming, right, right and

2134
01:58:57,380 --> 01:59:00,360
They want to set it up. So when they reemerge they think

2135
01:59:00,360 --> 01:59:06,660
They'll have control. So that's basically it and look if I figured out

2136
01:59:07,220 --> 01:59:11,700
You know when this quote-unquote society will end and I'm just some Greek guy

2137
01:59:11,700 --> 01:59:14,460
Whatever Greek American running around here, right?

2138
01:59:14,540 --> 01:59:20,020
We want you on whatever trying to see what the hell is going on these guys who have the quote-unquote elite

2139
01:59:21,300 --> 01:59:22,080
They know

2140
01:59:23,300 --> 01:59:24,480
You know what's coming?

2141
01:59:25,620 --> 01:59:26,740
So it's all about control

2142
01:59:27,400 --> 01:59:32,400
So again, I think we had a we're kind of verbose on the on the soul and the spirit

2143
01:59:32,400 --> 01:59:37,980
But well, this is going to be revisited and I've always wanted to bring up that relationships are basically

2144
01:59:38,760 --> 01:59:46,240
Another word, you know are set by boundaries and the word really actually the concept of relationship is what boundaries are there and understanding that

2145
01:59:50,020 --> 01:59:50,540
You
