1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:12,560
The Sonic 10th Event here on Oteli and the Greek Rated Y and welcome to you no matter

2
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,320
who you are, where you are, of course you are someone who did subscribe to this and

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,880
I always like to tell people that I appreciate them doing that.

4
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:26,700
So thanks for being along with us on this very interesting ride and the latest incarnation

5
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,200
of something that we had done before.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,420
So, Greig, how are you doing tonight?

7
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:31,420
I am.

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:31,980
I'm doing.

9
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:40,100
I just wanted to mention the episode nine, or Sonic Nine, gave a lot of anecdotes there.

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:49,700
I can't get this out of my mind, is what large women, women with large feet are cruel, size

11
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,460
nine or bigger.

12
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,980
I didn't want anyone to really see that that way.

13
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,240
It was an anecdote, right?

14
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:00,140
Is that the thing that got a lot of feedback for you this time?

15
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,940
Because I find that interesting, considering all that was covered in nine.

16
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,480
No, no feedback other than I said it was in the mind, you know?

17
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,500
Oh, okay.

18
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,420
So this is the part-

19
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,420
Something around in the mind of the Greek.

20
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,080
I see.

21
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,100
Not in terms of the minds of whoever's listening.

22
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:22,220
Well, I was a little surprised by it because I always thought that and never heard anybody

23
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:22,880
else say it.

24
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,200
So-

25
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,060
Yeah, I'll tell you something that harkens back.

26
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:31,900
There was a mom back in the 70s on the same street that we lived in.

27
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,700
They were Hungarian and she looked like a witch.

28
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,520
Basically the long nose and the high cheekbones and-

29
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,140
Dark hair also?

30
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,740
Kind of dark, long, straight hair?

31
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,580
Well, actually blonde, blondish hair, but she put on a hat.

32
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:52,300
She had the profile of the classic witch and on Halloween, she would dress up like a witch

33
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,140
to make fun of her own visage, visage, right?

34
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,960
And she looked just like the witch from The Wizard of Oz, you know, the Wicked Witch of

35
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,340
the West.

36
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,060
Oh, no kidding.

37
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,020
Yeah.

38
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,320
And with no makeup.

39
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,199
So what do you say about that?

40
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,520
I mean, she was a wonderful woman.

41
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,320
Well, she wasn't green though, right?

42
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,040
She wasn't green in appearance because I know in the colorized version, they made her green.

43
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,900
Okay, so-

44
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,020
In other words, yeah, she wasn't green, no.

45
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,520
So yeah, we got into- I didn't really feel like we laid down enough where people could

46
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,020
listen to that and say, this is how a relationship should be.

47
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:36,120
But basically, without going over the subject, we put down some stuff that you're not going

48
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,020
to hear anywhere else, number one.

49
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,780
Number two, just like with anything, imagine that you already have it and you're already

50
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,880
in it, act accordingly.

51
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,400
Think about that for a minute.

52
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,120
Well, it goes with anything.

53
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,300
Like someone I knew who wanted a motorcycle and couldn't afford it, couldn't find one

54
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,760
that was what he could afford or whatever, I said, act like you already have one.

55
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,940
Because if you just got one today, you're going to go out and get wax, you're going

56
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,880
to go out and get chain oil or lube, you're going to go out and get this and that, you're

57
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,260
going to go out and get a helmet, you're going to get gloves, hopefully some leathers, right?

58
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,280
So if you fall, you know?

59
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,180
I said, go get all those things first, because you're going to get the bike and you're going

60
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,440
to find your deficient, you know, the motorcycle, of all these other things, get all the things

61
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,780
that you would need or want to have if you did have the motorcycle, right?

62
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,440
And guess what?

63
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:35,060
Within like a week of doing that, he found the bike of his dreams, right?

64
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,340
And it helps when I'm the one that gave him the motorcycle, though, right?

65
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,440
I should have left that part out, right?

66
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,880
I don't think that changes the story much.

67
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,480
Well, no, but did you have that in mind when you told him to go get the stuff and be ready

68
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:49,920
for it?

69
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,300
Or did you not?

70
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,740
Because your intention is part of the question, too.

71
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:01,000
No, I noticed that I was getting, I was in 40, late 40s, I was like, the eyesight's not

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,420
razor sharp, and I need razor sharp vision on this thing, you know?

73
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,360
No, I was thinking of just keeping it as a possession.

74
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,200
Okay.

75
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,180
You know?

76
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:18,420
I was riding less and less, and yeah, I kind of mentored this person and whatever, and

77
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:22,340
they were looking, and they couldn't find anything, and yeah, it was a classic motorcycle,

78
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,620
a very old classic one.

79
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:32,040
Yeah, yeah, it just turned out that way, but when, all right, let's just say it this way

80
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,040
in truthfulness.

81
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:39,820
When the person had accomplished all the things that are required or needed or want when you

82
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:44,280
do have a motorcycle, when I knew that they had that, I got this overwhelming feeling

83
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,380
to sell it to them, you know?

84
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,080
Let's just say.

85
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,560
And if you asked me a month before, I said, no, I'm going to keep this bike as part of

86
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,880
a, it's an antique, it's in perfect condition, you know?

87
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:55,560
Okay.

88
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:01,120
So anyway, one of those stories, and the same thing with relationships, people want to eat

89
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,660
Well, I'm just trying to do a, the reason why I'm asking questions, I'm trying to do

90
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,080
a chicken or egg thing here, right?

91
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,020
What came first?

92
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:12,620
Did your intention to give it to them or to sell it to them or whatever, did that become,

93
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,540
you know, was that the thing you had in mind?

94
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,100
Because I think that would change things a bit, wouldn't it?

95
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,500
Well, in this universe, the chicken comes first, by the way, right?

96
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,300
Fair enough.

97
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,180
I mean, you have to have a chicken capable of laying an egg to lay an egg.

98
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,700
Because here, the chicken and the egg, I go over this so many times, and it's interesting

99
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,360
to hear it.

100
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,540
Okay, this is one of the fundamentals of Greek-speak, right?

101
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:44,000
When you hear about something, it's best to go over things that you're used to.

102
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:49,820
But as if you're hearing it for the first time, you look at your source, and if your

103
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:54,380
source doesn't provide you with the history of that thing or a definition of that thing

104
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,180
or the function of that thing, you're on your own, you've got to do it yourself, right?

105
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,680
So, just like if someone uses a word you've never heard, you typically ask them what

106
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,220
that means.

107
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,940
Now, isn't it weird when they don't know, but they're using it, right?

108
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,200
Think about it.

109
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:09,720
Yeah, it is.

110
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,020
Someone uses a word, they don't know what it means, right?

111
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:16,260
And they can't provide a definition, I mean, that's, wow.

112
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,120
Well, this is the world you live in.

113
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,340
Well, let's just go back to chicken and egg.

114
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:26,400
Fundamentally, the chicken is the being, and the egg is simply its ability, it's the mechanism

115
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,620
and the function of it reproducing itself.

116
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,200
So it's still about the chicken.

117
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,520
So you can look at it two ways.

118
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,420
You can look at it as the chicken being the variable, and then 2x, you know, multiply the

119
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:45,460
variable into another thing, and I say variable because almost all things multiply.

120
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:52,180
So the chicken and the egg thing, if you break it down using Greek-speak logic and reason,

121
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,180
is the chicken is far more important than the egg, but without the egg, there's no more

122
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,980
chickens after the chicken reaches its, right, duration.

123
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,260
So the egg part is just the reproduction part.

124
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,520
It's not the creation part, how it came into being.

125
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,860
That's something different.

126
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,040
Fair enough.

127
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:17,500
I mean, and I had a couple of things in mind I was going to ask you about regarding the

128
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:25,020
container and what the container represents, because a lot of people will now go to the

129
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:30,280
idea that the container is ostensibly meaningless, and I object to that when I hear it, because

130
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:35,000
I don't believe it is meaningless at all.

131
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,420
And, you know, there are things that are retained in a container.

132
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:45,320
If you just think about a container that you commonly store food in, well, you know, you

133
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,040
keep food in it.

134
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:52,020
It retains certain aspects of the food sometimes, right, until it has been thoroughly cleaned

135
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,040
and repurposed.

136
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:58,440
So, you know, I wanted to talk about that maybe with the body a bit, but I think we

137
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,300
should finish with the relationship aspect.

138
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:07,320
I'm done with the relationship talk, or speaking on, but the container, okay, here, I'm going

139
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:12,140
to throw this in for a future thing, an NPC, you know, these husks of humans, they're like,

140
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:15,760
they call them soulless, but if they're alive, you know, the spiritless, low-level spirits.

141
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:16,560
Low-level spirits.

142
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,300
Yeah, that's when the being takes the shape of the container.

143
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:29,620
When the mind takes the shape of the container, right, that's one way to look at an NPC.

144
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,720
You know, when you pour, like liquids take the shape of their containers, right?

145
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:33,460
Right.

146
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,940
So when you pour this low-level spirit out into a body, it takes the shape of its container,

147
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,500
or some attributes of the shape.

148
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,260
That's why when you, when people don't like someone, what do they call them?

149
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,180
Hey, that guy's a what?

150
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,880
He's a dick.

151
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:47,580
Yeah.

152
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,500
Or that guy's an asshole.

153
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:50,800
Right?

154
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:51,500
Or whatever.

155
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,180
You ever notice that?

156
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,460
It's just for, how can you be a dick and how can you be an asshole?

157
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:59,260
You're, it's, you see, because they're taking that, you see what I mean?

158
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,200
Just one attribute.

159
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,200
So yeah, it's very interesting.

160
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,520
The container in this case is the five, we're the five-pointed, the star configuration, right?

161
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:15,240
Which is the most common, believe it or not, for this type of setup, this type of mind.

162
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,160
Well, it's five points, but six compartments, as we've discussed a long time ago.

163
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,580
The six compartments are pretty easy to recognize.

164
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,600
If you take a look at the general, typical physical form, right?

165
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,820
You have the head, you have the torso, you have the arms, two of them, and two legs.

166
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:40,060
There's your five points and your six containers, or your six compartments, I should say again,

167
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,380
in the one container.

168
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,040
So that's the representation, right?

169
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:44,960
Yeah.

170
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:45,300
Yeah.

171
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,820
And the container needs input, physical input, air, food, and water, and we're going to be

172
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:57,860
speaking on food, or I keep threatening to do these solos, which I get myself to sit

173
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,600
down long enough.

174
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:06,000
We might end up doing one like this, and then I might fill it in, because it gets really

175
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,140
intense.

176
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,200
But I wanted to just throw something in about the container.

177
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,540
And I've been doing some practicing and, let's say, experimentation.

178
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,060
You hear about people with health, quote-unquote, health problems, right?

179
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:22,860
All the time.

180
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,040
All kinds.

181
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,840
And we're talking about real ones, like real manifestations.

182
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:34,760
Not someone says, I went to the doctor and he says I got diabetes or I got high blood

183
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:34,940
pressure.

184
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,060
That's absurd, you know?

185
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,920
Yes, Ivan, I'm recording with Uncle Chuck right now.

186
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:47,390
The feline pipes up for a moment, but that's all right.

187
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:53,590
We might hear from one of my canines if it so happens to strike them to speak up, too.

188
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,910
Yeah, okay.

189
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,870
He's a baby panther, actually.

190
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,370
If he gets big enough, I'm going to have to find a zoo for him.

191
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:05,650
So what I wanted to suggest is real situations.

192
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:11,150
I kind of touched on the last time briefly what cancer is.

193
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:16,850
That's when food wants to revert back to its natural state as whatever it was in the body.

194
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,490
It's not what people are...

195
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:21,590
We kind of talked about it.

196
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,270
And then these odd manifestations take place.

197
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:29,110
But what I wanted to say about food is, and with illness, is that if you change the diet

198
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:35,750
and turn into, let's say, a whole food diet, in other words, when you buy rice, you buy

199
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,290
it in bulk.

200
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:41,290
Don't buy it in a plastic bag or a box, and I think I've discussed why in the past.

201
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,190
We'll get into it again.

202
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,230
And organic stuff, let's say.

203
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,070
By the way, you've heard me say I'm against organic.

204
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:51,910
It's existence of classification.

205
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:59,230
The reason why is what kind of society would allow organic food, which means no toxin added,

206
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:03,890
and then right next to it, another market or in the same market, food that is loaded

207
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:04,470
with toxins.

208
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,030
What kind of people would allow that?

209
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,990
In other words, there should be no qualification.

210
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:14,790
The non-organic food should have never been allowed, and it's allowed.

211
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,790
This goes into your politics.

212
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,730
This goes into everything else.

213
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,910
Well, that's not the case everywhere, you know.

214
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:28,730
You know, there are places where, ostensibly or allegedly, they don't allow the GMOed food,

215
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:29,070
right?

216
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,090
Supposedly.

217
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,190
I'm not saying that it's GMOed.

218
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,170
Well, it's beyond GMO.

219
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:40,330
When you add synthetic nitrogen-based fertilizers to food, it's like giving someone a dose of

220
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,830
heroin or cocaine either way.

221
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:45,290
You're drugging the plants.

222
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,830
It's not fertilizer.

223
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:48,690
You see what I mean?

224
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,790
There's a difference to it, right?

225
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:54,690
Well, drugs and poison are an interesting thing anyway.

226
00:12:54,890 --> 00:13:01,710
I mean, one of the most common, maybe not so popular nowadays or trendy nowadays, but you

227
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:06,050
and I both, well, you do smoke sometimes still.

228
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:10,470
I smoke also, and they often say, well, you're addicted to the nicotine.

229
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,830
Nicotine's actually a fairly effective pesticide.

230
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:19,970
Well, when it's separated, when you separate something enough, the more it wants to go

231
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,630
back into its natural state.

232
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:26,830
But let me just, on the point that I brought up today about food and all this stuff and

233
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:32,310
real illness, let's say, people who aren't feeling well, you know, organ depletion, whatever,

234
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:38,150
whatever, skin problems, headaches, gout, all these things that have been around.

235
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:42,410
If you want to know what real diseases and real illnesses are, go before 1890s.

236
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:47,170
1890, 1930, they invented all these other things, right?

237
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:53,650
So what I'm trying to say here is when you go to, let's say, here's a simple way to classify

238
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:58,190
it, and every year there's less and less on the internet about it, but macrobiotic diet,

239
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:04,190
which is whole food and eating seasonally, it's kind of a turnoff to a lot of people

240
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:08,450
because it was promoted by Japanese and there's a lot of Japanese style in there, and some

241
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:12,270
people don't like that, but they also, if you study the history of it, just eat the

242
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:16,690
way people that, you know, don't get sick eat, basically, which is local.

243
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:20,810
So what I'm trying to say here, let's say you went to a macrobiotic diet or a whole

244
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:24,450
food diet, understanding the energies of the food, right?

245
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,850
What's uplifting, what's down, what feeds each organ.

246
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:33,990
If you are ill, you will notice a very speedy recovery if it's something that your body

247
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:38,290
can recover from, bounce back quickly, depending on your rate of recovery.

248
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:42,990
You know, you ever notice how athletes kind of retire after 40 or after 30?

249
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,810
They actually have more experience, which makes them a better athlete, but physically

250
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:53,890
they don't recover as fast, and they can't compete with the younger guys who recover

251
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:54,410
faster.

252
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,850
You see, the younger guys have less experience and less technique.

253
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:02,650
The older guys have more experience and more technique and are actually better at the sport

254
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:06,010
as any sport goes, but they just can't recover.

255
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,530
See, that's what I mean by recovery.

256
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,050
Right.

257
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:14,890
I mean, tracking boxing, actually, we saw a phenomenon about 20, 30 years ago where

258
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:19,250
a lot of older guys got back into the game, and you could see exactly what you're talking

259
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,690
about if you followed it very closely.

260
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:26,270
Larry Holmes, George Foreman in the heavyweight divisions especially, but Sugar Ray Leonard.

261
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:29,250
I don't know how much into boxing you are, but I appreciate boxing.

262
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:35,830
Yeah, they take a hit and they swerve for like five seconds instead of one second, you

263
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:36,290
know?

264
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:36,710
Right.

265
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,270
Which is an hour in boxing time.

266
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:44,230
Five seconds is like an hour by the watch when you're not boxing.

267
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:47,890
But overall, you saw these guys fighting much more intelligently.

268
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:53,210
You saw them doing better things in their training than they had done at a younger age

269
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:53,950
and all of that.

270
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:58,090
But the problem for them becomes how quick can they recover?

271
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,910
Because after a boxing match, you know, you do a lot of training in order to go in there

272
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:02,350
for that.

273
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:08,590
Say, you know, you got three minutes divided by 12, so you're talking 36 minutes realistically

274
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:11,230
of action with a minute in between each round.

275
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,870
That doesn't sound like much, but that is a hell of a lot of training you have to do

276
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:15,770
to prepare for that.

277
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:21,050
And they much more intelligently do it and they're much better prepared as older athletes.

278
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:26,530
However, recovery time after the fight, because obviously you're going to take some damage

279
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:31,130
getting punched in the face a hundred times, you know, not just the face, it's other parts

280
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:31,830
of the body too.

281
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:37,030
But that recovery time is the thing that would finally sideline them because they would

282
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:42,690
be like, look, it takes me too long to come back around and continue to fight, unlike

283
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:43,810
when I was much younger.

284
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:50,390
And also when they exert themselves the cardiovascular, you know, they can't recover from that, not

285
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,650
only taking the hit and running around.

286
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:59,290
But my point here is if you go to a whole food type diet, natural food, no pesticides,

287
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:04,690
no packaging, the reason why you don't want food in packaging is because you look at the

288
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:09,970
ingredients list, yeah, that's the ingredients that is placed in the package after the package

289
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:10,510
is prepared.

290
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:15,310
And what they do to prepare the packages, which is not in the ingredient list because

291
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:21,730
it's not in the food, is there the packaging is sprayed with fungicide and bactericide.

292
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:26,890
And because it's not added to the food directly, it doesn't have to be FDA approved, yada,

293
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,570
yada, yada. Right.

294
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,690
But it's the food is sitting in it for how long?

295
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:33,710
Most packaged food could be at least a month, two months, three months.

296
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,810
Right. Some of them say, you know, good for a year.

297
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:38,650
Yeah. Depending on it might be sitting in there for a whole year.

298
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:45,070
And, of course, we've read stories about how they spray meat with viruses in order to

299
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:45,990
kill other things.

300
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:46,870
They say ammonia.

301
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,730
But it's not. Yeah, there's no.

302
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,610
Yeah. That's like saying Al-Qaeda or.

303
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:56,250
Yeah, well, you know, in the common terms, I'm just talking about what happens is they

304
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,610
spray the package and the product, but it's not part of the ingredients list.

305
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,630
It is in the container, though.

306
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:07,510
Sure. There isn't anything that's dead and waste they can call a virus.

307
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:11,410
But, you know, originally the virus was the guy who came up with it was this degenerate.

308
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,070
He didn't know what to write his thesis on.

309
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:19,410
So he went into the hospital dumpster, started pulling old bandages out and looking at

310
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,310
them under a microscope.

311
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:23,190
This is about 80, 90 years ago.

312
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:31,310
Anyway, so my point is, if you can go into a natural diet, so to speak, but it has to

313
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:37,610
be balanced according to your where you live in the season, you can recover from most

314
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:44,530
ailments within a week or be at the point where, let's say you tried regular medical

315
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:48,190
procedures and pills and all the therapies and all these things, and it went on for

316
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:51,330
months and months and months or even a year or two or three.

317
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:56,470
You switch over to a really good diet and in one week you have more improvement than

318
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,330
you had, let's say, with all the other treatments.

319
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:01,650
Right. And within a month, it's almost full recovery.

320
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:07,070
And as your own personal recovery, meaning with age and other things, constitution, I

321
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:11,050
mean, there are many young people now that have old people diseases.

322
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,670
Right. You've heard of that.

323
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:21,330
So if you take like an average white Midwestern American, their body, their heart at

324
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:27,890
18 or 19 years old would be what a 40 or 50 year old would be living in a much better

325
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:31,210
let's say environment where they have access to better food, you see.

326
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:38,550
So what I'm trying to say is I'm a proponent for good food, healthful food.

327
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:41,170
Food is not healthy. You're healthy if you eat healthful food.

328
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:47,330
And the recovery rate, I'm just astonished at how fast one can recover.

329
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:49,630
And it takes planning and it takes knowledge.

330
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:55,190
And usually, unfortunately, you're going to need someone who has experience with how to

331
00:19:55,190 --> 00:20:00,970
put together, quote unquote, a diet for your condition unless you learn it and learn how

332
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,730
to do it yourself if you're a quick learner.

333
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:08,370
But the reason I brought this up is because of recent experiments and observations, how

334
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:13,690
rapid how rapid the body changes, again, based on how old you are and your condition.

335
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:21,370
So, in other words, a typical American in their 20s will have the typical recovery rate

336
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:24,510
of a 40 or 50 year old living in another part of the world.

337
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:29,930
You see, so and I keep stressing American because we have the worst food on the planet,

338
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,110
bar none here, you know.

339
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:38,250
So in terms of quality, I always find that remarkable, by the way, because quite often you

340
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,750
hear from people, look, we have the cleanest food, the cleanest water, this and that.

341
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:46,390
And I find it laughable because it's not it's poisoned.

342
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,470
Yeah, it's precisely the opposite of that.

343
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:55,050
We're also the most medicated people on the planet in the American, you know,

344
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,170
geographical region.

345
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,590
Thankfully, I'm not part of that.

346
00:20:58,770 --> 00:20:59,530
We don't know.

347
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,130
But listen, neither am I.

348
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:02,350
But I'm just saying that.

349
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,410
Yeah, it's it's it's not.

350
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:10,950
Yes, it's the Americans are going through one of the worst cursed earth periods, you know,

351
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,030
from the 1700s.

352
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:16,030
But that's another discussion when we get into the gods, which might be today.

353
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:23,670
But I just wanted to throw that in there, because when we do something on food, a sonic

354
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:26,050
on food, I want people to keep in the back of their mind.

355
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:30,110
It's not just preference or it's it's actually very, very important.

356
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:33,750
What's interesting is when you do an experiment with someone who has, let's say, an

357
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:40,530
ailment for two or three years and within a week or 10 days, it's 90 percent recovery.

358
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:45,790
Right. What does that tell just by doing the food in the water thing?

359
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:52,850
Right. Well, what does that tell you in bright neon that the reason why they were sick is

360
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:57,350
because of whether what they were eating in the first place is not amazing.

361
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:04,430
Yeah. So it doesn't we're talking about looking at a rate of about 50 to 75 percent of

362
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:09,930
the people just having a changing their diet to a really high quality food for two weeks

363
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:13,310
to a month. Let's say we'll recover 50 to 75 percent of the people.

364
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,590
I mean, think that I've ever done this with.

365
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:20,790
So it's quite amazing and it's kind of a shocker and it makes you want to sit down and

366
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:23,390
cry, you know, and how sad the food situation is.

367
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:26,550
But I just want to throw that in there before we got into whatever we're going to get

368
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:30,330
into tonight. Right. Well, even worse than that, and I wonder if you would agree with me,

369
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:36,410
is that quite often when I find somebody who asks me what they could do to improve their

370
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:43,770
situation, often one of the first and most primary concerns is actually their water

371
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:51,030
intake. And so even before they start to eat, even before food, water is a big problem.

372
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:55,670
They're not you know, they're not consuming enough or they're not taking in enough, I

373
00:22:55,670 --> 00:23:00,570
should say. Well, I would have to I'd have to say that you should only drink when you're

374
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:03,890
thirsty or feeling like you should you need water to drink.

375
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:10,810
You don't have to necessarily be the feeling of of being said in Latin or Spanish.

376
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:16,150
Tengo sed, I'm thirsty or, you know, I'm thirsty when I like some water.

377
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,710
You shouldn't have to get to that point.

378
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,270
But that's a good point to drink water.

379
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:22,250
And you four ounces of water is enough.

380
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:25,090
Remember, the water stimulates the liver.

381
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,590
Remember those blood sugar test strips?

382
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:31,030
All they do is test your hydration level, not your blood sugar.

383
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,190
You could look this up, by the way.

384
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:38,310
There'll be no website that'll tell you sugar diabetes testing is a scam.

385
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:39,490
It really tests hydration.

386
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:44,250
But if you look at all the problems with testing strips, every website, everything I did

387
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,850
this recently, I was surprised to see it's still true from the 80s.

388
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:50,330
It says that you can't do it if you're thirsty and you can't do it if you just drank

389
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,890
water because it won't work.

390
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:56,550
Well, guess what? It has nothing to do with blood sugar anyway, because there is no such

391
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:57,690
thing as blood sugar, by the way.

392
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:02,590
It's blood quality. But what I want to say with water, it's we're going to get into water

393
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:08,630
again. Also, you don't you don't need much and you don't need to have it often because

394
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:13,010
the best water is the water that's inside the cell of the food that you eat.

395
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:19,470
And I would rather people drink less overall water, but more of the higher quality

396
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:22,410
water. And you'll do better that way, if that makes any sense.

397
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:23,630
Oh, it makes plenty of sense.

398
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:28,530
But the counter and I don't mean to disagree with you exactly, but the problem that I

399
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:33,990
find often with somebody who's not feeling well is that they're consuming food, which is

400
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,810
not giving them hydration.

401
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:37,530
So, yeah, Dr.

402
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:40,570
Dr. Batman, they call it for short.

403
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:43,770
Batman, not as in B.A.T., but B.A.D., Batman.

404
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:47,450
Dr. Batmangala, You're Not Sick, You're Thirsty.

405
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:50,590
Have you heard of that book? Or anyway, someone.

406
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:56,090
Yeah. He was a prisoner in Iran and he was healing people or helping people cure their

407
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:57,870
illnesses by just having them drink water.

408
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:02,670
And he helped so many people that when his prison sentence was over, he decided to stay

409
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:06,690
another year. I didn't hear I heard that story.

410
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:08,850
I don't I never read that book.

411
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:15,110
But a while back, yeah, he I was turned on him by Trevor James Constable, who we were

412
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:19,470
going to meet. And he died, I guess he was getting too popular, meaning Batmangala was.

413
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,750
Yeah, there's many issues on it.

414
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:27,830
But remember, years ago in the 60s and 70s, I would go to the hose and drink water before

415
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:30,030
it was fluoridated and brominated and chlorinated.

416
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:33,150
And it was good. Like New York City tap water was great.

417
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:34,690
Yeah, it was. Yeah.

418
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:39,170
Yeah. Based on, you know, all the rumors and myths about how good the pizza is and the

419
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,250
bagels. Right. Because of the water.

420
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:44,310
So, yeah, it's very tricky.

421
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:50,110
And by the way, even here at home, I'm constantly being reminded, like when we see

422
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:53,950
things happening with food or, quote unquote, the news or this or that, I'm always

423
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:56,170
reminded that, you know, you talked about this a few years ago.

424
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:59,170
Exactly. This, you know, and so, you know.

425
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:04,970
Nothing to be surprised about, but the water quality is even on the natural side is

426
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:05,950
getting worse and worse.

427
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:11,430
Everything is just telling humans that you've had so many chances to you screwed up.

428
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:13,490
It's OK. Make it better.

429
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:14,710
Do do what you do.

430
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,790
Don't do don't keep doing what you're doing.

431
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:19,550
Right. But they keep doing what they're doing.

432
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:23,370
So. So then eventually your natural environment is going to fight against you.

433
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,970
But I just want to throw that in there because it's been something resonating in my

434
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:32,450
head for a while. Well, it's like, how can how can it be so simple that a week's to a

435
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:37,150
month worth of eating right or eating well can reverse so many things?

436
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:40,450
It's it's just goes back to the same thing.

437
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:43,350
It sounds cliche that the food is making you sick, let's say, you know.

438
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:48,210
Absolutely. Well, there is an interesting thing there.

439
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:51,910
Did you happen to pick up anything from the chat this week that you wanted to address?

440
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,530
Yes, some things, general stuff.

441
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:58,590
There's someone through a whole bunch of questions in there that I think we've we can

442
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:03,290
address, not necessarily now, but there's more going on in there.

443
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:09,090
The people that are in the chat are generally, you know, when I see who's in there,

444
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:11,710
they generally ask the similar questions.

445
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:16,670
So it would be, you know, if anyone go to the O.N.G.

446
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:24,930
chat, the Unculting of Humanity, Chitango, it's usually about weather, well, time

447
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:30,250
keeping the gods and growing things, which is important, which we are in a season, by

448
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:35,770
the way, here on the this part of the world where the growing season has started and

449
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:40,170
and the other part of the world that's upside down, they're going into the winter.

450
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,950
And just because winter is coming, it doesn't mean you can't grow anything.

451
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:45,370
There's something called winter rye.

452
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:48,850
I'm not saying you should grow winter rye, but there are crops that are winter crops.

453
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:49,810
They're just very slow.

454
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:53,950
And there are plants that are, what do they call it, frost hardy.

455
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:58,050
Right. When you have a freeze, they don't they don't die back like Swiss chard and

456
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:01,650
things like that. So it's an all year round affair.

457
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:06,710
But one thing that I did mention in the chat, there was someone that was asking a whole

458
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:12,970
slew of questions regarding forms of almanacs, timekeeping for planting, astronomical,

459
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,290
local astrological stuff.

460
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:22,030
And that's an example of showing all the various varieties of systems out there.

461
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:25,570
Right. I don't know if you looked in the chat, but there was about two or three

462
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:28,530
different calendrical systems for planting brought up.

463
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:33,910
And they were, I think, more they were more like someone's website, I think.

464
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:38,370
And some of them were recent people that developed things in the 20s and 19th century

465
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,530
or the 20s and 30s.

466
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:45,850
And if you study this, you'll see with the age of media, let's say printing got cheap

467
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:51,510
in the 1800s and 1900s and YouTube and all this, you'll see every year there's more and

468
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:54,670
more systems coming up.

469
00:28:55,250 --> 00:29:00,030
What I suggested in there, instead of looking at this calendrical system or that, what I

470
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:05,610
suggest is I looked at you have seven years of yin and seven years of yang, seven years

471
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:09,430
of expansive and seven years of contractive.

472
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:16,150
Right. So you'll have seven years where the summers seem milder, but longer and the

473
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:19,770
winters are milder and shorter than the contractive cycle.

474
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:25,810
You'll have the summer seems short and hot and the winter seems longer and colder.

475
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:32,410
Right. And a seven year expansive cycle, seeds will germinate very readily.

476
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:36,950
You know, you'll plant something and you'll have a plant that seems like you'll turn

477
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:39,670
around, walk back inside, come out and the plant's a foot tall already.

478
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:40,710
It's like, what the hell is that?

479
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:44,850
Right. And they'll bear a lot of fruit and the fruit will ripen quickly.

480
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:46,930
And sometimes you'll get two crops.

481
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,250
That's an expansive year.

482
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,150
We're in a contractive year.

483
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:53,410
Germination is really slow or low, lower germination.

484
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:57,510
You plant something you're used to, you know, coming above ground in a week or so.

485
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:59,390
It's been like three weeks and it's barely up.

486
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,870
Right. Right. And the fruit you'll have.

487
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:06,510
Let's say when the plant does grow like a tomato, cucumber or whatever, it's a beautiful

488
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,310
plant. But there's no tomatoes.

489
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:10,010
It's like, where are the tomatoes?

490
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,290
Like huge plants, like a tree tomato.

491
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:14,430
And it's got one tomato where.

492
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,590
So that's the contractive year.

493
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:24,750
So I've been observing this and using 1998 as reference and going forward from there.

494
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:29,710
So around 2018, 2019 went into a different cycle.

495
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:33,930
Right. And you be the judge of its expanse over contractive based on what I said.

496
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:37,390
And there was someone that did agree with this observation.

497
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:43,990
So we'll see how this year works out being in an expansive cycle.

498
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:49,030
So. Well, it's interesting because, of course, you have to pay very close attention to

499
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:54,290
where you are as you I mean, you give a very general sort of like, OK, so there's

500
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:58,590
Northern Hemisphere and sort of Southern Hemisphere ideas and cycles.

501
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:04,910
But there's a bit of a difference, say, where I am geographically than a couple of

502
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:08,850
states further north than me, even though it's considered kind of a similar region.

503
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:11,810
I'm in a slightly different temperate region.

504
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,290
So cross cross latitude.

505
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,410
We're about the same, though.

506
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:21,910
I'm 32 latitude and you're probably 33 or you might be on the same latitude as me.

507
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:25,430
It's just that it's different because of where the ether comes in.

508
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:31,590
The southwest is a desert because it was probably underwater about 4000 years ago.

509
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:38,510
And that desert energy is still there, you know, that nothing grows energy and the

510
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,550
East Coast would be would have been much higher.

511
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:46,890
That's why when you look at Google Earth, for example, the coast of Florida or the

512
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:50,920
East Coast of the US, if you look at the shaded areas and how deep the water is, it

513
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:56,540
seems the plateau goes beyond the coast about 30 to 100 miles and then it drops, you

514
00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:02,860
see. So, yeah, I'd say that it's cross latitude.

515
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,160
But again, it has to be done within your region.

516
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,640
You can have drastic differences cross latitude.

517
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,680
Look at when you say Sahara Desert, let's say.

518
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:18,380
Right. Look at the center of the Sahara Desert and the general latitude and go across

519
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,740
the planet. It's not the same.

520
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,020
It gets tropical in some other places.

521
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:27,380
Right. All right. Like like where I am is considered like a subtropical as opposed to a

522
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,620
tropical because just above me is that tropical.

523
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,360
It doesn't work in exactly.

524
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:36,480
It doesn't work exactly along the straight lines of latitude is all I'm trying to say.

525
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,440
So you've got to be observant about that.

526
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:42,100
50 mile radius is a good guess, is a good.

527
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:46,400
So let's say you're trekking across the earth and you want to settle somewhere.

528
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,220
Wherever, whatever direction you came from, just recall the last 50 miles, what it was

529
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:56,980
like and where you land is probably going to be like that.

530
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:02,000
So the last 50 miles you trekked was an introduction to what it's going to be like.

531
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,720
You know, you say 50 mile radius is usually usually fair.

532
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:11,240
I'd say less than that if the elevation changes drastically.

533
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,500
So that's a general way to look at it.

534
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:18,520
So I would say that anything you look at is a guideline.

535
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:24,220
You're going to have to everything needs except for certain math.

536
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:28,860
You know, if I say two plus two, you know, and you say two plus two, regardless of where

537
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:31,860
you are, it's going to it's going to we should end up with the same result.

538
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,520
Right. So but that's math.

539
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,660
That's that's an abstract.

540
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:41,480
So anything that you get is going to need some fine tuning, even if you get into biblical

541
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,980
stuff. Right. You know, a lot of people like, yeah, I'm going to do this.

542
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:48,560
But if you study like biblical law, very little applies to you because most of the

543
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:54,280
laws in there and things are regarding things that you're not and things that don't

544
00:33:54,280 --> 00:34:00,260
exist. See, so you have to learn how to narrow things down and see what applies best.

545
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,820
Yep. So, you know, so.

546
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,980
All right. So we've addressed the chat.

547
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,380
We've addressed the last sonic a bit.

548
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:13,080
Yeah. You know, you were ruminating on that.

549
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:17,219
A bunch, I guess, you know, we didn't get a lot of feedback about relationships.

550
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:22,440
I kind of expected more to come my way about it, but we didn't see a lot, I guess.

551
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,900
Well, that's like a relationship.

552
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,600
Don't expect more anyway.

553
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:31,580
Here we go. But, you know, but see, I'm still stuck on the container.

554
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:34,420
And I'll tell you why, unless you have some other things you want to get.

555
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,659
No, no, please. Please go ahead.

556
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:40,760
Yep. Because I was thinking about this, you know, the different organs and how they're

557
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,060
misunderstood. Right.

558
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:48,840
And, you know, the idea about the liver in the kidneys, they're not separate things.

559
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,679
They're part of the same system and all that.

560
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:55,120
Well, there was an interesting thing that just kind of came across like accidentally to me

561
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:59,080
when I was just letting a video thing run for a minute.

562
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:04,920
Right. And I was looking at organ transplants and stuff like that.

563
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,440
And there were people claiming that they had changed after they had an organ transplant.

564
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:15,240
And that it seemed as though the organ might have had a memory of its own.

565
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:19,480
And that might sound like a crazy idea to some people.

566
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:28,520
But to my mind, the physical container, again, does retain some aspects of what's put

567
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:32,960
into it. Now, like I said, breaking it down to the container, you might put food in.

568
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,020
Right. Which we did address for a moment.

569
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:42,000
But there is a way that some of those things that are put inside of the container leave

570
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,420
behind traces of themselves just in general.

571
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,340
Right. Yeah. Again, it is a very simple.

572
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,960
By the way, there's a very simple answer to why.

573
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:54,040
Yeah. Like someone gets a heart transplant who loves mustard.

574
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:58,640
And if they survive the heart transplant and recover, now they hate mustard.

575
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:04,120
Yeah. Then they find the family member who they got the deceased, let's say.

576
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:08,260
Got their dead, you know, their dead, dead dad's heart.

577
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,120
Right. Yeah. Dad hated mustard.

578
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,160
Right. You see. So now this person hates.

579
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,800
Very simple. Very, very simple.

580
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,740
Let me ask you a general question.

581
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,060
Sure. You said organ transplant.

582
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,560
Okay. What have you? You can take your pick.

583
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:26,360
You've got eyes, heart, liver, kidneys, on and on and on.

584
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:31,740
All right. Are those organs either on ice usually, right, to a degree?

585
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,100
They're not frozen, but they're cold.

586
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,440
Thirty nine. You shouldn't go below thirty nine.

587
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,360
And they don't usually.

588
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:39,040
Let me ask you, are those organs dehydrated?

589
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,300
You had water or are they hydrated?

590
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,000
Are they wet?

591
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,600
Well, I believe they stay wet at all times.

592
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,700
Yeah, exactly. Right.

593
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,380
Okay. So that water is from the previous body and that water's memory.

594
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,240
It's the memory of the water.

595
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:55,600
Right. So believe it or not, there was a

596
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:01,000
organization back in the early 2000s that wanted to use water instead of a hard

597
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,900
drive. And there was a bunch of stuff that made it to the Internet.

598
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:04,980
Then it was all removed.

599
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:11,180
And one of the articles was stating that actually they got inspired that water

600
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:15,100
could be used to, in other words, tap direct memory just because of organ

601
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:19,700
transplants. The in other words, the receiver of the new organ

602
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:24,440
felt that had the tendencies of the previous owner.

603
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:29,920
Yeah. Well, that's what was being discussed in this, you know, very basic sort

604
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,940
of video. I just want to give you a quick anecdote about it and maybe it'll give

605
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:38,080
you more things to expand on, because it wasn't just the things that you might say,

606
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,000
okay, there might be a chemical aspect to this where like you brought up the

607
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,420
mustard. All right. But some of the examples they were bringing up were things

608
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:51,760
like all of a sudden somebody had an affinity for classical music that they

609
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,740
never had before.

610
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:59,100
And they had received I forget what the organ was, but a variety of organs were

611
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:04,200
discussed here. Right. There was a heart. There was there was a liver trance, you

612
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,600
know, transfer.

613
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:10,600
There was I think there was some other there were a few organs.

614
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:15,720
Let's just say there were a few different organs that were transplanted and they

615
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:21,280
had issues where they suddenly had mental affinities for things.

616
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,720
They had physical desires for things, but they certainly had new interests.

617
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:31,500
There was a young girl who ended up with like, I think it was the heart might have

618
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:35,640
been the heart. Let's just go with heart heart of a 40 year old guy who was sort of

619
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:40,620
a handyman. And all of a sudden when she recovered and she felt much better, she

620
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:44,780
started wanting to work with her hands and found herself doing some of the same

621
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:49,020
activities. And then she did what you said, which was track down, you know, the

622
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:54,140
donor and learned about them a bit and found that they were somebody was involved

623
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,260
in that activity often.

624
00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:01,720
And this all comes down to just the the memory in the liquid, you think, here or.

625
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,440
Yeah. And also the predominant.

626
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:08,720
In other words, the the person's ethereal, let's say, the spiritual state of the

627
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,960
individual, what level?

628
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:13,480
Let's say if you were to classify something from one to ten, right, ten being the

629
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,120
highest, one being the lowest.

630
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:23,160
If you were to classify the intensity of the spirit and its ability to imprint in

631
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:27,900
the water and the cells and in the organ, the characteristics of that individual

632
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:34,240
one, if you were to, let's say, let's take the the the girl that got the or the

633
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,600
young lady that got the heart from the four year old.

634
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:44,480
OK, if if she's if she finds the that one organ, even though the heart is has brain

635
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,440
tissue in it, by the way, to dominate her whole character, that means that the

636
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,500
person that she got that from had a higher order spirit.

637
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:57,540
In other words, more dominating, you see, what I mean that I mean that, take it

638
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:01,280
simply. You know, there are people that are dominant individuals.

639
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,260
Right. Like what do they call me?

640
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,280
Alpha, alpha males, alpha, whatever.

641
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,720
Right. Well, a lot of times and some people might think of it as influential.

642
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:15,560
Right. When somebody comes into a room and the entire attitude of the room changes

643
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:21,100
because they instantly sort of impart their presence in that room.

644
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,020
And therefore, you know, like the old life of the party thing, right?

645
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:28,340
Oh, this guy shows up and all of a sudden the party's fun because this person.

646
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,180
Yeah. Or they're more forceful.

647
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:33,820
Maybe somebody shows up and all of a sudden everybody becomes much more organized.

648
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:38,820
They're much more regimented, you know, when doing a group activity, whatever this

649
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:41,320
guy. The one that would be like eight, nine, ten.

650
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:46,140
And then the one, two, three low level ones would be that you're sitting in a room and

651
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,180
no one even knows you're there.

652
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,460
OK. Right.

653
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,580
Right. Not you.

654
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,680
But, you know, I mean, typically I've seen that happen.

655
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:56,380
Actually, once we were taking a headcount for a pizza and there were five of us there,

656
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,980
but we did only a four headcount, even though the other person was sitting right there.

657
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:05,680
Is that amazing? I mean, that's a very low, let's say, functioning, not not in

658
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:11,880
non-intelligent or NPC, per se, but most likely NPC would be down there also.

659
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,680
Very passive individual.

660
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:16,900
So this let's just say it this way.

661
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:22,140
From a scientific perspective, if you were to see the certain dominant traits from the

662
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:26,300
donor to the donee is not in every case.

663
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,900
It's in many cases.

664
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:31,420
And we don't know if it's 50-50 or 10 percent or what.

665
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:38,340
But I would suggest that the dominant persona or personality, it carries through.

666
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:43,640
So one organ, in other words, transplanted from a dominant individual to a more

667
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:47,700
passive one is enough to, let's say, what do you call it?

668
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,340
Override some of the person's, let's say, previous desires.

669
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,980
You see, it's very simple.

670
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:59,500
It's the same thing with like, let's say, in a computer you have corruptible memory

671
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:03,580
that could be erased and an uncorruptible memory that's in a chip, let's say, you

672
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:07,920
know. Yeah, it's just dominance and there's many variations to it.

673
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:13,780
But I would say that the mind is the overall tool.

674
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:19,280
And I just want to interject since you're, let's say, I don't want to say it this way,

675
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:21,080
but anything else on the organs?

676
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:27,920
The point that you wanted to bring up, are you are you OK with that or will you segue?

677
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:33,700
Yeah, it's OK. I just I had one other thought about it, which was that, you know, in

678
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:39,140
general, I think about there is what is imprinted based on the actions, the activity

679
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:45,080
and all of that. But also, I think we begin with a set of things quite often and some

680
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,480
people refer to it as genetic memory or whatever.

681
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:50,060
Things are passed along.

682
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:55,160
And there has been recent scientific studies about epigenetic reactions and how

683
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:01,440
something can be passed from generation to generation, right, based on things that are

684
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,140
imprinted in. And obviously, the genetic result is something that you would see.

685
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,560
You'd have to ask the same question.

686
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:10,780
Is the sperm and the ovum wet?

687
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,940
Right, right, of course.

688
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,820
OK, so it's a little bit of water.

689
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,160
OK, is enough.

690
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,180
No, fair enough, but I mean, I think it's an interesting thought.

691
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,800
It's not DNA or chromosomes like they tell you.

692
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:30,580
OK, well, but that was the thing I was trying to define.

693
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:36,780
So it's really just about this this passing on and literal sharing of the fluid which

694
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:41,920
retains characteristics and stuff like that, which I always find it an interesting point

695
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:46,080
that if you think about it very carefully, you know, a part of you was in your

696
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,220
grandmother's body. Right.

697
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:55,600
Because at some point the the ovum, right, which was a woman is born with all of them

698
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,180
scientifically, supposedly.

699
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:00,100
Right. They're born with all they're going to have throughout their life.

700
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:02,460
That's already in their body.

701
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,320
So it's that's why that's why if you cut open the goose, you get all the eggs.

702
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,560
Right. Anyway, bad joke.

703
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:13,540
Well, but the thing is that if you think about it, your mother in your grandmother's

704
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:16,920
body, she ends up developing all of her eggs before she's born.

705
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:19,620
And that egg at some point becomes you.

706
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:23,220
Right. Because it's half of the equation when it comes together.

707
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:29,320
So in a in a very serious way, you're connected to your grandmother at one point, a

708
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:32,620
part of you physically was inside of your grandmother's body.

709
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,780
The same water, the same water, which is still blood.

710
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:41,640
But it's it's not just because there are oils in there, lipids and things like that.

711
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:46,840
But it's all water in terms of it's not just oversimplifying it.

712
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,020
It's water. It's not DNA.

713
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,660
See, DNA and these other things are just you didn't bring that up.

714
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:52,420
But this is what goes to people's minds.

715
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,140
Right. They're just antennas.

716
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:58,480
Just like if you take the antenna off of the radio, do you expect to see a little jazz

717
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,460
band in the antenna? No, nothing.

718
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:01,980
You won't even see it inside.

719
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:07,580
It's in the water. So what happens when the when the organ, the or the egg or the

720
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:12,780
sperm, it has a certain shape because that's how it interacts with the ether.

721
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:18,180
And based on that shape and its interaction with the ether, it picks up the quote

722
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:19,360
unquote frequency.

723
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,280
It's more of a vibration than a frequency.

724
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:24,300
And there's a big difference between vibration and frequency.

725
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:28,680
And one is anyway, that's another discussion.

726
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:33,380
But what I'm trying to say is that when the water is in the organ, like you mentioned,

727
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:39,380
the heart or the kidney or the or in the egg or the ovum, right, that specific shape

728
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:44,820
and the amount and what the water is being exposed to being in that container, in

729
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:49,200
other words, secondary container is very, very powerful.

730
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,680
So let's take it from another point of view.

731
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,380
There's some myths or mythology.

732
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,300
I don't want to Harkin says a church where they have holy water in a little bottle.

733
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:02,740
Right. But depending on what intent is in there, they actually put curses in it, believe

734
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:09,140
it or not. But anyway, whatever a tiny amount of water you can, quote unquote, make

735
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:15,340
sacred or very special with some intense preparation, you can take that little vial or

736
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:19,480
what have you that fits in your pocket and go to a large body of water and just put a

737
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:25,480
few drops and that will dominate and take and the large body now will take on the

738
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:30,700
characteristics of the few drops that you put in there.

739
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:34,120
But the water has to be prepared to do that.

740
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:38,820
And believe it or not, when you have the that's why I keep asking, was there water?

741
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,380
Are they wet? Right, right, right.

742
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:45,500
When you have the water in the cells and when all the cells come together to form that

743
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:51,760
shape of whatever part of the body it is that is constantly being worked on from an

744
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:57,360
ether point of view and from the you know, how the system works to make the water in

745
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:03,420
there really do what you think the egg or the heart or the liver or whatever is doing.

746
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:11,960
OK, it's a it's a new way to think about it, you know, for me, so I'm finding this

747
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,340
interesting and processing it.

748
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:16,860
So, well, here's an interesting way to do, you know, one thing I've been putting in the

749
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:17,720
chat, it's induction.

750
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:22,940
We've got to really get this project off the ground, not we.

751
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,760
And that's just a small voice.

752
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:28,600
I'm realistic about it, meaning I'm not hopeful.

753
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:36,260
But once the concept of induction, right, no material transfer, but you have material on

754
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:41,460
one side, a barrier and then material crossing through that, not going through that

755
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:44,840
barrier, but appearing on the other side of that barrier, like Star Trek.

756
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:45,760
Right. Beam me up.

757
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:48,140
Right. This is how all living things are working.

758
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,580
Plants, animals, even the weather works that way.

759
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,840
Right. There's no there's no water in the rain cloud.

760
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,240
If there was, it would just fall to the ground like fog.

761
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:59,680
Right. See, the water is produced in situ by induction, biological.

762
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:07,080
Right. So once this is understood and a series of experiments are shown to positively

763
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:13,480
affect, because believe it or not, it's very easy to negatively affect biology using this

764
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:18,920
concept. Well, the all the hoop to all the stuff being talked about online about how

765
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,720
5G is damaging, for example.

766
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:24,700
Right. But no one's talking about what frequencies are helpful.

767
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:28,120
You see, but it's not frequency, it's vibration.

768
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:34,040
And just a real quick insert, a frequency is defined by a cycle per unit of time.

769
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:38,880
Right. And that cycle per unit of time is a vibration for a unit of time.

770
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:43,980
I'm suggesting get away from time and just focus on the vibration.

771
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:49,760
It doesn't matter how what the frequency in time is, because it's everything that happens

772
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,640
is instant in this case or within an instant.

773
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:59,660
And if you do have what was mentioned in the chat as hysteresis, which is action reaction,

774
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:02,780
but hysteresis is action, reaction, action.

775
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:08,220
And it keeps it's kind of like something you ever notice.

776
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:12,000
Put a magnet on a screwdriver, you pull the magnet away.

777
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:15,240
Now the screwdriver for about a minute or so can pick up nails and screws.

778
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,200
Right. Right. Yeah.

779
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:24,400
That's hysteresis. So what I know and from experiments is when you do have hysteresis

780
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,720
through biological induction, it produces poison.

781
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:35,340
Now, I think there's plenty of organizations like, for example, Ibrahim Karim, who does biogeometry.

782
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:41,700
He does these symbols that improve the environment just by putting a symbol in the room.

783
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:49,540
He says for every lab or group that researches how to use these things for positive,

784
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:56,680
there's 150 to 300 groups that are trying to develop the same technology for negative.

785
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:58,780
Right. Think about that.

786
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,060
So, yeah.

787
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,880
So, OK. Yeah. About the organs.

788
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:06,960
Yeah. Actually, what I wanted to segue into is what the next thing you brought up.

789
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,500
So we're OK.

790
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,060
Yeah. It's really about water.

791
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:16,460
And the easiest way to think about the organ or the liver or the ovum, like you were mentioning,

792
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:22,360
how those characteristics carry on is the concept of that holy water where they have a small vial.

793
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:24,260
That's all you need. Right.

794
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:25,800
But I hate giving that example.

795
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:32,220
There's got to be a better one because the next the only other mythical stuff I could think about is the fountain of youth.

796
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,660
But that's a fountain. Right.

797
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:41,040
Right. It's not really a small vial of or small given volume that can affect a large given volume.

798
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:47,540
You see. Well, you know, it makes me think oddly of the, you know, some of the scam artists that are out there, too.

799
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:51,060
Like the one of the most popular ones involving water.

800
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:54,000
I'm sure you've heard of it. Is this what is his name?

801
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,360
Peter Popov. Right.

802
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:59,120
You ever heard of that guy? The name sounds I've heard of the name.

803
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,600
I'm not familiar with their stuff, though.

804
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,400
He does this thing where, you know, look, we'll pray with you.

805
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,700
And, you know, he's all on the J.E.S.

806
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,620
U.S. kind of, you know, trip and all that.

807
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:11,560
But he sends you a bag of water.

808
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:17,320
Right. Oh, well, he cursed, which he says is, you know, filled with this great intent.

809
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:21,660
And it'll do it'll do for you if you take this water, you drink it.

810
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,000
It does great things, et cetera, et cetera.

811
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:29,300
And he sells that as kind of a, you know, like we'll send it to you for free and all that.

812
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:34,540
But it's kind of interesting to take a look at it one of these days because I'm not sure what he's doing.

813
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:37,500
But the premise is correct.

814
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:40,560
The execution is probably way off.

815
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,160
Right. But here's the thing.

816
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:44,860
If you believe that it's on, it'll work for you.

817
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:54,600
You know, years ago, they when they started bringing radiation therapy for cancer treatment in the 50s, they started inviting people in for it.

818
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:58,660
And it's basically a hopped up, hopped up X-ray machine.

819
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:01,180
Right. For radiation therapy.

820
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:03,260
Well, this man comes in.

821
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:11,520
He's like a bus driver or something, goes to a doctor and the doctor puts a thermometer in his mouth and walks out of the room, comes back in.

822
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:15,140
And the doctor noticed the man is acting like he's actually getting the treatment.

823
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,460
Right. So the doctor said, this is going to be interesting.

824
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:21,240
So he left the thermometer in the man's mouth for another week or so.

825
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:29,380
The man supposedly had throat cancer and he came in for this radiation therapy right through this weird X-ray machine, a broken X-ray machine basically is what they use.

826
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:32,700
Yeah. So he told him to come in next week.

827
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:36,220
He didn't give him any of the radiation therapy, just left the thermometer in his mouth.

828
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:39,200
It was one of these industrial type with a cord on it.

829
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:44,160
And he noticed that the man thought that was the therapy.

830
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,940
So he told him to come in another week, did the same thing.

831
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,840
He just had him lay back in the chair, puts the thermometer in his mouth 15 minutes, then tells him to go home.

832
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:52,440
He did this for about a month.

833
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:55,140
Then about a month later, the man's cancer was was healed.

834
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:58,100
OK. He never got ready.

835
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,640
The doctor kind of did this thought intention experiment with him.

836
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:07,000
He only had was the thermal because the man thought that was the therapy.

837
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:08,220
He didn't tell him it wasn't.

838
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:10,840
He just wanted to see if just having the thermometer in his mouth.

839
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,600
Right. The placebo effect. Right.

840
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:15,560
Right. Think about the placebo effect.

841
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:21,680
So it's again, going back to the induction and how the biology really works.

842
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:27,280
I think I gave an example of someone said, is blood alcohol real or is there another prank?

843
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:30,100
No, it's real. But the alcohol doesn't go through anything.

844
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:31,660
It's reproduced by the body.

845
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:35,980
That's why people who are known to hold their liquor are slow to reproduce alcohol.

846
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:42,080
Someone who takes one beer or one shot of whiskey and is drunk, they reproduce the alcohol very quickly.

847
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:43,500
You see, it's not that they.

848
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,480
Right. And this is a common thing.

849
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:54,800
I think anyone from a child remembers someone in a familial gathering or public gathering that just drank a little and got drunk or the other people didn't.

850
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:59,680
Right. We've noticed this all our lives and there's no explanation for it.

851
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:07,680
But here you go. Once you understand one person's body impedes production and the other person's body encourages it.

852
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:10,700
So this is the same with all kinds of things.

853
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:27,180
Like, for example, if your body is very quick to reproduce the food that is in the intestine into the bloodstream and doesn't do it completely well, that person is more susceptible to getting, quote unquote, what they call cancer.

854
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:34,820
Or someone who's a little bit slower to reproduce that, meaning slower with but less, no, no hysteresis at the same time, no memory.

855
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:45,640
So in other words, the person is more susceptible of getting cancer when they digest the food in the lumen of the intestine or the stomach or the duodenum and passes through the body.

856
00:54:46,440 --> 00:55:02,800
If if the if the nutrition that goes into the blood from the intestine through and by induction has the memory of the original food and enough of the memory by hysteresis, by dwelling there, chances are that person will be more susceptible to cancer because the food will go back.

857
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:07,360
The nutrition that's in the body will want to revert back to how it was before they ate it.

858
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,820
And that's what forms tumors and toxins and things like that.

859
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:27,820
So that, again, the the ultimate story, we're kind of bouncing around here with induction is, you know, the thing is, you know, we look at devices like the Reif machine and all these other things that were developed in the 20s and 30s was a lot of these alternative medicine devices.

860
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:32,900
Even the Hieronymus radionics with the copper plates and the dials and all that.

861
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:42,440
Right. What I'm suggesting is the ultimate way to do this is strictly through the emo and the mind, believe it or not, not sort of in line with what they do.

862
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:46,380
But hand, you know, it's not airy fairy, though it has to be.

863
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:47,860
You know, there's Reiki.

864
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:48,980
There's all this other stuff.

865
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:50,720
Right. These organizations.

866
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:55,340
And, you know, I've spoken to people that do Reiki and I bring up the concept of induction.

867
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:57,080
They don't get it. I'm like, what are you doing?

868
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,040
What are you doing?

869
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:04,580
How could you possibly support the idea of Reiki and not understand the concept of induction?

870
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:05,900
I mean, yeah, they don't.

871
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:20,720
That's well, that's silly to me, because it's like, look, are you not basically saying that you are able to transmit from an intention, OK, to another place and manifest it elsewhere?

872
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:27,540
I mean, literally, that's almost exactly the same as the Star Trek example, right, where you're taking the thing, you're sending it elsewhere.

873
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:31,860
And well, it's not harp on the harp on the Reiki guys.

874
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,760
I mean, they're trying to harp.

875
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:36,220
I'm just saying, I think that's especially silly.

876
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:39,120
It is. Well, look at the medical doctors.

877
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:43,360
They don't know that there's no blood, you know, every doctor I've ever spoken to.

878
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:49,600
And I've shown him that there's no blood pressure, what it really what they're taking and how nothing passes through.

879
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,900
All of them say the same thing.

880
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:53,720
Really? Really, Greek?

881
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:56,040
Oh, wow.

882
00:56:56,820 --> 00:57:00,200
You know, and I'm talking about people that have been in the medical field all their lives.

883
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:01,540
Right. I'm like, oh, my gosh.

884
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:04,040
Oh, my gosh. We are in big trouble.

885
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:08,060
You know, it's like how long you've been a car mechanic for 40 years.

886
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,040
And by the way, what is the steering wheel again?

887
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,580
Yeah, it's like, whoa.

888
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:20,680
So that's why, you know, that's why I keep saying all fields of study, all professions are wide open.

889
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:28,100
When you go to any professional field or body of knowledge, the reality of that body of knowledge is in storage.

890
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:34,160
It's archived. The people practicing that profession know nothing about that field.

891
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,180
Let me just give it to you this way.

892
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:40,420
Everything is being run like an illicit operation.

893
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:41,900
Everything's being monetized.

894
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:46,840
Whether you register to vote, go to the hospital, go to church, everything is being monetized.

895
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,320
Right. Okay.

896
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:49,580
Your signature. Okay.

897
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:52,720
So basically, very few people know about this and it's unlawful.

898
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:58,700
So it classifies as a RICO, racketeering, corrupt organization or an illicit organization.

899
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:01,120
Right. Everything that's going on.

900
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:03,900
So let me put it this way.

901
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:11,820
If you were going to set up an illicit organization on a large scale, the people that you have that are part of your organization that deal with

902
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:18,060
the public at large, the less they know about what really is going on, the better it is for you.

903
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:19,500
Isn't it? Yeah.

904
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:23,600
It's best that they just know about what they have to do as a job.

905
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:24,420
And that's it. Yep.

906
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,000
Need to know. That's it.

907
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,920
That's why you have all the specialization.

908
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:31,380
And I'm telling you, all fields are open, wide open.

909
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:41,120
That's why when I hear about Black Ops Project, Skunk Works, I laugh because it's not really Black Ops Project.

910
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:43,320
It's just more they're working on real stuff.

911
00:58:44,780 --> 00:59:10,140
So in other words, unless they've gotten some ancient technology or reverse engineered or gotten, quote unquote, gifted by another society that doesn't have this protocol of subversion and illicit organizations, I'm telling anyone that once you do, I shouldn't say just a fair amount of Greek speak, but just open your mind and perceive and ask the right questions.

912
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:34,240
You can start your own Black Ops Project in advanced science and material and energy systems and all this other stuff on your own and catch up to them very quickly, because 90 percent, if not better, of these guys working in these secret Black Ops that have advanced technology, they came out of the bullshit school system, university system, and they believed it all their lives and probably still do.

913
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:43,180
So if you have an open mind and perception and ability to ask the right questions, you could catch up to any one of those, you see.

914
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:48,180
So this is how kind of bizarre the world is.

915
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:29,080
Continuing Rated-Y Sonic Event 10, as we had taken a break and the Greek was saying that all the fields are wide open, does that have anything to do with the orientation, the situation, the communication, if you will, with the gods, Greek?

916
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:31,180
Of course.

917
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:40,780
You know, I've always said to people, you know, when you have a discussion, the easiest way to do it is first you preface, then you inform, and then you discuss.

918
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:42,500
Right?

919
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:58,760
So a simple example of that is your cell phone battery is low and you're calling someone to give them important information, instead of saying, hey, this is this and I'm so and so, give the important information first, blah, blah, blah, and it may not make sense, and then start backing it up until it makes sense.

920
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:00,460
So when the battery dies, they got it.

921
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:01,160
You see what I mean?

922
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:04,880
Well, they got the most important part out of the way, so they have the key.

923
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:06,100
They have it.

924
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:06,400
Right.

925
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:06,940
Okay.

926
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:18,740
So the key here, the preface, inform, discuss is kind of like out the window when it comes to the gods, because first of all, let's give the important part, like I said earlier.

927
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:26,520
So right now, this is the relevancy, if you want to take it from the relevancy, meaning how important it is.

928
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:37,220
All the stuff that you see going on worldwide since the pandemic has been notched up a few gears, let's say, right, with like whatever opinion people have on it.

929
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:37,520
Right?

930
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:52,700
One of the big distractions is the socialist liberal banking, whatever agenda, but it's a much bigger agenda than that because it's been in place very firmly since the 1950s after what they call World War II.

931
01:01:53,380 --> 01:02:05,060
What that is is you'll notice that after World War II, all of these fertility, let's say, medical practices started being introduced into society, right?

932
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:16,760
Incubators became popular, and then in vitro fertilization, so infertile, so-and-so, or a couple can't have a baby, they want a baby.

933
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,520
We're not talking about adopting here, right?

934
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:19,860
We're talking about impregnation.

935
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:20,440
Right.

936
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:32,340
All these technologies were now being made available to the public openly, right, creating children in ways that were not in recent times known, okay?

937
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,700
They were shown as medical advances.

938
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:43,460
Then you have the legal system coming up with this bullshit thing that everybody's got rights, right?

939
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:44,680
It's important, right?

940
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:48,160
No talk about law because you know there's no rights in law.

941
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:49,720
We've spoken about this, right?

942
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:50,900
Right?

943
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:51,460
Get it, right?

944
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:56,540
Right is something that you have when you transgress the law.

945
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:58,280
You shouldn't be treated like a dog.

946
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:03,100
You have a right to three meals, three hots and a cot or something in jail, right?

947
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:04,260
Yeah, that's one of those things, yeah.

948
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:05,540
Yeah, that's a right.

949
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:08,980
So if you're asking for rights, it's like what did you do wrong that you're asking for rights?

950
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:15,340
But anyway, they brought this stuff in with civil rights and then they started talking about women's rights, right?

951
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:17,860
Burn your bra all the way to now.

952
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:23,260
A minor is 18 years and younger.

953
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:28,140
By the way, I don't like hearing when people are of color and they say I'm a minority.

954
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:37,240
In law, a minority, unless it's specified by age, a minority means you're incompetent.

955
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:39,020
Because the majority, right?

956
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:41,380
Remember it's called the majority vote?

957
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:46,880
Majority means you're competent and you can make a decision that will influence the group.

958
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:51,260
A minority means you're not competent and you should not influence the group.

959
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:55,800
So when I hear people of color saying they're a minority, I say in age or in competence?

960
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:57,760
You have to specify.

961
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:02,920
And they don't know because they're deemed incompetent because it's quote-unquote a –

962
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:07,900
There's many places, writings in the Constitution, all that, that it's the white male, right?

963
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:09,780
Landowner, white male, right?

964
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:11,300
That is the majority.

965
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:15,100
If you're not male or white, you're part of the minority.

966
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:19,380
Temporarily, they did used to say that you reached the age of majority,

967
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:26,060
which I always found interesting because it made sense considering that you were a minor before that.

968
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:27,920
Sure, but it's specific, right?

969
01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:30,720
Because you're deemed incompetent, you need a guardian, let's say, right?

970
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:32,040
Where the age varies.

971
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:34,860
It's 20 in law, by the way.

972
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,660
When you hit your 19th birthday, it's not –

973
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:37,820
Okay.

974
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:39,600
Anyway.

975
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:42,240
So you have that.

976
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:47,500
The legal system budding in now and they bud into the point where same-sex marriage, right?

977
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:50,240
And the minority now –

978
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:54,780
So even now, 18 or 21, depending, is you're not a minority.

979
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:59,020
You can go and function in society, right?

980
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:06,620
But they're telling children at 7 or 8 years old to cut their penis off or cut their breasts off

981
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:08,560
and take sex change drugs, right?

982
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,980
It's pretty critical outside of the –

983
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:15,620
So all these things and then you have the gender-bending chemicals.

984
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:17,280
They dump phthalates.

985
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:18,620
I like that word, phthalates.

986
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:21,900
It's spelled P-T-H-A-L-A-T-E-S.

987
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:27,020
It's a plasticizer, usually in chlorinated plastics, and it's a gender-bender chemical.

988
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:30,580
You pour it in the river, all the male fish become female,

989
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:35,940
and the female fish usually lay so many eggs that they're not viable or whatever.

990
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:41,820
That's what we were referring to a few years ago as estrogen mimickers that were being brought in,

991
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:47,560
and some of this stuff was literally leaching from the plastic bottles and the BPA and all that, right?

992
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:48,740
Yeah, those –

993
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:53,320
Well, the polyethylene bottles, most of those don't leach.

994
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,820
They're pharmaceutical-grade, polyethylene, polypropylene.

995
01:05:55,820 --> 01:06:01,280
It's the polycarbonate that has the BPA, the bipethyl sulfonyl, whatever.

996
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:04,860
Okay, so you have all the gender-bending stuff, right?

997
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:10,000
And then you have the attitude, right, the rainbow flag, all this other stuff.

998
01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:17,080
Okay, so it started in the 50s with in vitro fertilization, all this stuff, women's rights,

999
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:23,520
all the way to what you see going on right now with children being told that they could pick whatever gender

1000
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:24,820
or sex they want to be, right?

1001
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:28,900
Okay, so what does this have to do with the gods?

1002
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:34,480
Well, one of the earliest Sumerian – actually two Akkadian –

1003
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:43,920
it actually would be classified as an Akkadian – tablets has their chief goddess to be Inanna,

1004
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:46,380
however you want to spell that.

1005
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:52,680
It's a double N, I think, I-N-A, double N-A, however, Inanna, Al-Inanna.

1006
01:06:54,080 --> 01:07:00,640
Later on became Ashtarte, Queen Mary, you know, these goddess personifications, Maat in Egypt.

1007
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:09,400
But the earliest goddess personification, veneration that has been known in a clay tablet, the poem to Inanna.

1008
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:12,300
In that poem, there are several hymns.

1009
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,120
I don't have the references in front of me.

1010
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:18,120
The internet, I looked this up a couple of months ago and I couldn't find it.

1011
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:22,780
But I remember if you go to an old library here, fortunately, near Tucson,

1012
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:25,360
the Carnegie had endowed one of his private libraries here.

1013
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:33,360
So you go and you look around and these little hardbound books that were designed to be put in a vest pocket.

1014
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:38,240
They're about the size of a postcard and they're real small and they're jam-packed with information.

1015
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:45,240
So when you look at some of the hymns, if you can find it, let me know on the chat or email.

1016
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:52,940
The hymn to Inanna talks about her as being the creatrix, right, of all things.

1017
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:56,060
Well, one of the stanzas in the verse is in the hymn,

1018
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:00,780
Oh, Inanna, who turns men into women and turns women into men.

1019
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:03,080
Think about that.

1020
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:08,100
That's like really stark contrast to what you see in the biblical text, right?

1021
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:15,220
So this is way before the quote-unquote penning or writing of what's called Genesis or anything like that.

1022
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:23,220
So one of the earliest venerations of the goddess, she was touted as being able to, in a justified way,

1023
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:28,200
her justification to turn, let me repeat that, men into women and women into men.

1024
01:08:29,479 --> 01:08:30,600
Wow, right?

1025
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:35,120
Okay, so the veterans of Greek speak will go back and say,

1026
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:39,460
Hey, Greek, you always talked about the revived goddess religion.

1027
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:42,560
Anybody who's heard me speak since the early 2000s,

1028
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,720
it's like what you're witnessing for not now,

1029
01:08:44,899 --> 01:08:49,620
but everyone wants to think the world's going to end on September 22nd every year, right, or something?

1030
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:50,359
Something like that.

1031
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:51,220
It doesn't work that way.

1032
01:08:51,399 --> 01:08:58,080
What you've been witnessing for almost three quarters of a century is the revival of the ancient goddess religions.

1033
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:00,120
Well, we talked about evidence.

1034
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:09,399
Yeah, we talked about evidence of that on early Ocelli in the Greeks regarding the concept of the justice goddess.

1035
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:17,340
And the other representations of, and you would generally just say that's just a representation of the ancient goddess religion.

1036
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:18,960
This is exactly what you're talking about here.

1037
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:21,580
Yeah, and it's far-reaching.

1038
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:28,800
It's far-reaching, and the reason I brought up what I did regarding the creatrix,

1039
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:35,660
one of her attributes was not only creating everything, you know, mankind and animals and all this,

1040
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:40,300
but she also turned men into women and women into men, right?

1041
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:41,340
Think about that for a moment.

1042
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:47,920
This was acceptable and justifiable, so as it is today.

1043
01:09:48,779 --> 01:09:57,200
You ever notice how, quote-unquote, political parties are saying it's justifiable for people to be, quote-unquote, transgender and do sex changes?

1044
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:58,400
More than ever, right?

1045
01:09:59,180 --> 01:10:07,960
So this started in the 1950s by simply offering as a benefit those that could not, let's say, have paternal functions,

1046
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:13,000
to having paternal functions with the aid of science, scientific methods,

1047
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:20,280
and all the way to the legal system butting in to same-sex marriage, to the legal system butting in to rights for people who,

1048
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:23,640
another thing now is which bathroom do they use, right?

1049
01:10:24,580 --> 01:10:25,780
Right, on and on and on.

1050
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:33,100
This has nothing to do with some democratic, socialist, whatever, U.N. agenda at all.

1051
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:36,040
They are simply administrating it, you see?

1052
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:36,580
Okay.

1053
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:39,920
Now, how many people are in that group?

1054
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:46,840
Let's say the people that you see on the newspapers and the names that you see and hear of, whoever they are,

1055
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:48,860
they're just puppets.

1056
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:50,040
They're told what to do.

1057
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:55,640
I doubt if any of them know that it's the revived goddess religion because, again,

1058
01:10:55,900 --> 01:11:04,020
these people that you hear about, the Musks and all the leaders and Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, all of you can go down the list.

1059
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:06,840
It doesn't matter.

1060
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:12,620
The thing is that they're just like you were talking about with, you know, if you're going to run something OC-wise,

1061
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:14,500
what do you do?

1062
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:15,680
You give people jobs.

1063
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:18,340
They don't need to know anything other than the job they're doing.

1064
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:19,280
Exactly.

1065
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:20,200
Their leaders do.

1066
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:22,680
The people running them do know this, right?

1067
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:28,400
So what's interesting is part of the Greek-speak thing is to bypass all that stuff, you know,

1068
01:11:28,460 --> 01:11:31,560
what's being put out and go right to the core of it.

1069
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:34,340
And I just wanted to bring up that hymn of Inanna.

1070
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:35,360
That was very important.

1071
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:41,740
You could take that as a closing statement or you could take it as an opening statement to a discussion of the gods.

1072
01:11:41,740 --> 01:11:50,980
But once in your mind you consider what we just said, compare that to all the frustration the quote-unquote conservative types,

1073
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:56,020
religious types are having with the current situation with what's going on with the gender bending and the children

1074
01:11:56,020 --> 01:12:00,500
and which bathroom to use and the same-sex marriage and all this other unlawful stuff, right?

1075
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:01,060
Right.

1076
01:12:01,780 --> 01:12:05,880
How many of them are saying, oh, this is just the revived goddess religion?

1077
01:12:06,020 --> 01:12:10,460
And by the way, the more you fight the agenda that they're putting on the people,

1078
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:12,300
the stronger the agenda seems to get.

1079
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:13,040
You ever notice that?

1080
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:13,920
Oh, yeah.

1081
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:19,880
I was just going to ask you something here, which is speculation on your part, clearly.

1082
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:22,160
But I'm curious.

1083
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:26,580
What do you think would happen if somebody came out instead of saying, look, you know,

1084
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:34,060
based on the laws of the Bible, this is usually their backing for why they're resistant to that agenda, right?

1085
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:38,280
It's because of their King James book, et cetera.

1086
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:38,580
Okay.

1087
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:45,380
Look, if somebody came out and said, you know what, you guys are instituting an ancient goddess religion.

1088
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:49,360
You guys are actually enacting this agenda.

1089
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:52,280
And this is actually what's at the core of it.

1090
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:56,720
If somebody came out and said that, which I am highly doubtful anybody would,

1091
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:01,800
whether they were educated on it or not, I mean, if you went to one of the political leaders today

1092
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:05,640
and you got, you know, 30 minutes to explain this to them, and you did,

1093
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:08,440
and you said, look, this is where it comes from.

1094
01:13:08,540 --> 01:13:09,620
This is what it's based on.

1095
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:14,140
What do you think would happen if one of these guys came out and said that publicly,

1096
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:17,560
like really in a position of supposed authority?

1097
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:19,380
I don't think it's possible.

1098
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:21,780
I don't think it's possible for many levels.

1099
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:24,640
I think we talked about the security apparatus.

1100
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:26,440
Put it this way.

1101
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:31,060
If you saw one of these guys, the influential people with a minimal security apparatus around them,

1102
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:32,380
they're a clone.

1103
01:13:32,820 --> 01:13:34,360
You could kidnap them all day.

1104
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:36,160
And another one will show up.

1105
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:38,960
And it's already, this is already out on the dark web.

1106
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:41,040
Don't bother with kidnapping operations.

1107
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:41,780
They're clones.

1108
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:47,440
The minute you got them in the room to make the phone call that we want,

1109
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:52,600
we got Jeff Bozos or Gates or whatever, they're going to push a button and his head blows up.

1110
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:55,440
And you see he's just useless.

1111
01:13:56,160 --> 01:14:01,580
I know this sounds kind of crazy, but I'm telling you it's something to think about regardless.

1112
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:05,200
The way to do it, it's interesting.

1113
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:07,400
That was the next point that I was going to bring up.

1114
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:12,540
The way you deal with it, once you get the information in hand, but you have to know the information.

1115
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:17,020
You can't just repeat what I just said because if you have enough people just repeating,

1116
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:18,820
it will sound like a script.

1117
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:22,120
You have to know it, right, backwards and forwards.

1118
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:25,120
And you could be quizzed on it, let's say, right, to a certain degree.

1119
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:27,720
Because who's going to quiz you on it anyway, right?

1120
01:14:27,740 --> 01:14:28,980
They don't know anything about it.

1121
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:33,400
So let's say you're well-versed enough on the goddess religion.

1122
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:41,640
The way you approach the establishment is not by, hey, what you're doing is this, ha, ha, ha, whatever.

1123
01:14:42,180 --> 01:14:46,920
You approach them in a shameful way, almost as if you're laughing at them for that,

1124
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:50,620
like as if they've got poo on their face already.

1125
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,220
In other words, you laugh at them like they got hit with the pie.

1126
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:57,360
Don't talk to them like they're serious.

1127
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:07,080
You would have to be all in jest because remember, I've mentioned the more that quote-unquote conservatives

1128
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:12,280
or whatever, let's say, let's not even call them conservative, but people that are against whatever agenda,

1129
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:13,160
what happens to the agenda?

1130
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:14,400
It gets stronger and stronger.

1131
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:21,060
But if you go after them with laughter and need to say with love, meaning you're doing the right thing, right?

1132
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:23,580
Remember, love should be like light.

1133
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:25,000
Love should not be like fire.

1134
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:32,420
So if you're basically doing it as if you just threw a pie at their face for everyone else's entertainment, right,

1135
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:36,720
not to prop yourself up and say, look, people, I just discovered this.

1136
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:38,420
Oh, so serious, right?

1137
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:39,940
You'll be marked as a terrorist.

1138
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:45,320
But if it's done in the funnies, I guess they still have political cartoons, don't they?

1139
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:46,040
Yes, they do.

1140
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:50,320
They're not as good as they were 50 years ago or 30 years ago, let's say.

1141
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:50,980
No, they're not.

1142
01:15:51,660 --> 01:15:52,760
Yeah, they're not as good.

1143
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:53,120
Right.

1144
01:15:53,260 --> 01:16:00,720
They're not as hard-hitting, let's say, well, soft-hitting, let's say, or overall as they were years ago.

1145
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:06,420
Well, they used to contain a lot of things that, you know, there was a lot of interesting things within the art

1146
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:12,440
that transmitted many messages that, you know, now it's much more simplified.

1147
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:16,500
It's, you know, one particular point is made maybe, if you're lucky.

1148
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:17,860
It had more depth.

1149
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:18,800
It had more depth.

1150
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:20,060
That's a good way to look at it.

1151
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:27,100
It really brought the character that they were making fun of through more than just one, like, single-issue type stuff.

1152
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:28,600
I mean, like they drew a cat.

1153
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:31,540
They would put, you know, dollar signs in its eyes.

1154
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:36,160
They would make sure that the cat was definitely, clearly a Zopdigger fat, right?

1155
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:37,920
They would put a top hat on it.

1156
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:44,000
You know, like, in other words, there were many different levels by which you were meant to recognize that this was, you know,

1157
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:47,180
a fat cat who was interested in money, et cetera, et cetera.

1158
01:16:47,180 --> 01:16:54,140
And they put things, you know, even like, say, dripping from its teeth in the cartoon way to show that there were many points

1159
01:16:54,140 --> 01:16:58,060
to what it is they were pointing a mocking finger at, you know.

1160
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:01,220
Well, let's give it to the AI art boom.

1161
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:04,560
They should give it to the AI art now and see what the AI does with it,

1162
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:08,840
even though, you know, it's just a computer program with multiple computers.

1163
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:12,340
It's not really AI, but it would be interesting to see.

1164
01:17:13,220 --> 01:17:16,600
But in essence, it would have to be done to shame them.

1165
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:23,600
And it doesn't matter what they do because no one sane would believe it, you see, is one way.

1166
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:28,700
Because one of the things that I've noticed with these, quote, unquote, protester types, they're too serious.

1167
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:30,460
They're too serious.

1168
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:39,660
And there's two things going on because this always brings up the, you know, the ham-fisted approach, you know,

1169
01:17:39,660 --> 01:17:47,260
or the, you know, someone repeating something against, you know, that they've heard this counter, you know,

1170
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:48,860
the conservative media or whatever.

1171
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,700
They just repeat what they saw on Fox News or Alex Jones or whatever.

1172
01:17:52,780 --> 01:17:59,840
So there's an in-between point where if you're going to protest this or present a counter to it,

1173
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:04,080
it should be in a very comical fashion, very lighthearted fashion,

1174
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:10,280
or it has to be done numerically and geometrically the way they do it.

1175
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:12,520
Okay, what do I mean by that?

1176
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:21,700
When Biden announced the pandemic, whatever, it was at 3-11 or 3-22, I'm sorry, on the clock,

1177
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:27,220
when he came on C-SPAN or CNN to do the three years ago, the lockdown.

1178
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:31,480
They waited for him for it to be 3-22 on the clock.

1179
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:34,280
And they show you the clock, 3-22, before he started his speech.

1180
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:36,880
3-22 is a heavy masonic number.

1181
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:40,440
Another coincidental number is the 11-11.

1182
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:46,140
Another thing is the black and white, you know, the black and white checkered floor, right?

1183
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:53,320
Another thing are certain days, you know, from Hitler's birthday to the equinoxes like March 21st and the other one, right?

1184
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:56,980
Another one is they have their occult holidays.

1185
01:18:56,980 --> 01:19:02,500
So if you're going to do a protest, you figure out their calendar and use it.

1186
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:08,580
Because the moment, okay, the last big protests that happened that I recall were the ones with the bankers,

1187
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:12,000
the 99 percenters, what was that called back in 2011 or something?

1188
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:13,720
Occupy Wall Street, that kind of thing.

1189
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:14,360
There you go.

1190
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:19,020
Whole masses of people showing up, okay, doing all these protests.

1191
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:20,540
But here's the thing.

1192
01:19:21,620 --> 01:19:25,380
If they all came out at 9-11 a.m., like there was no one around,

1193
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:30,700
it said we're going to assemble at exactly 9-11 or assemble so at 9-11 we're all in formation.

1194
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:42,660
And we have 33 people wearing white and behind them 33 people wearing black, right, the masonic 33, right?

1195
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:48,500
And then we go to 11-11 and then we bring in another group, right?

1196
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:53,020
And then at 3-22 we do another thing, right?

1197
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:55,280
This is all being watched.

1198
01:19:55,440 --> 01:20:00,400
They're going to say, holy shit, they're using the same magic we are.

1199
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:03,420
What do you think the protests?

1200
01:20:03,780 --> 01:20:13,240
So if they did that, I discussed this back with Vinnie Eastwood when the Occupy Wall Street was coming.

1201
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:18,100
I said they need to follow, you need to come out at 9-11, 33 this, 33 that, 3-22.

1202
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:21,220
It just went over his head like it does for most people.

1203
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:22,280
What does it matter?

1204
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:23,740
We need to just get out there and protest.

1205
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:25,020
You see the lack of order?

1206
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,760
I'm not saying you should follow Freemasonic, but here's the thing, Chuck.

1207
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:37,040
If the people do want to protest and they use the same numerology and the same visualization and symbology that they do,

1208
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:42,400
the Illuminati or the Freemasonic Authority, they will see that as a serious counteroffensive.

1209
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:46,260
But you could have millions of people.

1210
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:48,500
What happens when millions of people show up?

1211
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:51,300
Well, now it doesn't even make it to mainstream news at all.

1212
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:59,500
An example right now is there's actually a very vaguely mentioned, there's a serious unrest in France as we speak.

1213
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:00,580
Oh, Israel.

1214
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:02,240
And Israel as well, yeah.

1215
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:09,380
I'm just saying there are people showing up in significant numbers, but our media is kind of like, well, this is sort of happening.

1216
01:21:09,540 --> 01:21:14,400
Anyway, on to what we're going to be talking about in 2024 with the presidential selection.

1217
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:16,700
They move right along.

1218
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:19,480
They don't dwell on it at all.

1219
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:28,520
And it gets, well, the symbology, I'm not saying that if you follow the symbology, what they do to a T, it's going to work initially.

1220
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:36,660
But once you, it'll take notice, and the second time they're going to say, okay, this is too serious because you're actually affecting this reality.

1221
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:38,380
This reality is an egregore.

1222
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,280
This is the NPC also.

1223
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:43,980
If you have parents.

1224
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:45,800
I'm not aware of what the word egregore means.

1225
01:21:46,620 --> 01:21:53,120
Well, it's if enough people believe in something, it manifests.

1226
01:21:53,700 --> 01:22:02,920
An example of an egregore would be in the movie Ghostbusters, the first one, when this goddess, again, goes to manifest something.

1227
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:04,700
And they're like, clear your mind, clear your mind.

1228
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:10,000
And he says, oh, what were you thinking of when she went to manifest this magic?

1229
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:15,280
One of the guys was thinking of a harmless thing like the Stay Puft marshmallow man, right?

1230
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:16,120
Right, right.

1231
01:22:16,340 --> 01:22:23,160
So this 100-foot tall marshmallow man starts walking through the street in New York destroying everything.

1232
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:23,580
Right.

1233
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:25,280
Because he thought of it.

1234
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:29,960
It's basically a thought form that's manifest, but it's a thought form that's manifest through the collective.

1235
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:32,680
That's what the NPCs are also.

1236
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:39,360
What I mean by that is you have enough parents believing what they were told in school, what they're told in church, and what they watch on TV.

1237
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:40,420
You want to have a baby.

1238
01:22:41,300 --> 01:22:46,420
That energy in the water is being affected by all those collective beliefs they have.

1239
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:50,740
That baby is going to be torqued and twisted into an NPC based on those beliefs, you see?

1240
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:51,480
Okay.

1241
01:22:52,060 --> 01:22:55,320
But not always, because sometimes you have the black sheep.

1242
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:56,040
Right.

1243
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:59,860
Anyway, to go back to the protests and the gods.

1244
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:10,960
What's interesting is what I just said is pretty obvious because there's a dozen conspiracy-type websites that always talk about these things.

1245
01:23:11,060 --> 01:23:16,040
Look how Biden came on and did the speech at 3.22 to announce the lockdowns, right?

1246
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:18,280
Look at how they did this at 9.11.

1247
01:23:18,380 --> 01:23:19,700
Look, 33, right?

1248
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:21,700
All the Hollywood logos.

1249
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:24,900
He's doing the symbol with the eye, right?

1250
01:23:25,060 --> 01:23:27,420
And many people will show you different things that are in the background.

1251
01:23:27,620 --> 01:23:28,440
Look at these angles.

1252
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:31,200
Look at the fact that there's the two pillars.

1253
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:35,160
Look at the numbers that are directly over his head.

1254
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:36,900
It seems like it's just part of the background.

1255
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:37,920
But, yeah, all of that.

1256
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:38,420
Right, right, right.

1257
01:23:38,420 --> 01:23:45,080
So what this tells me, when you look at all the protests going on, and it seems like a segue, but it's not, from the god.

1258
01:23:45,140 --> 01:23:45,740
We're going to go back.

1259
01:23:45,860 --> 01:23:51,380
But if you examine, let's say you just came to this planet, and you're trying to assess what's going on with these protests,

1260
01:23:51,380 --> 01:24:03,460
you know that all of the manifestations from the authorities are using these Freemasonic guidelines or outline or template with the 33s, 11s, the 9s, and all this other stuff, right?

1261
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:04,580
They're using the 19.

1262
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:07,160
Anyway, there's a whole handbook on this.

1263
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:08,120
I'm sure you could find.

1264
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:08,880
I don't know where.

1265
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:15,920
But so if you're visiting this planet and you see the protesters are not using any of this, right,

1266
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:24,220
you either say this is a planet completely full of morons, or these protests are actually not really, they're organized as counter, as a fake opposition.

1267
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:29,080
There's a few people that got these protests together that work for the same people that they're protesting against.

1268
01:24:30,420 --> 01:24:33,220
Which I mean is very often exactly the case.

1269
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:34,460
The latter is true.

1270
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:44,820
Like, again, with the protests against the Occupy Wall Street, how many people were talking about 12 U.S.C. 411, where we're not supposed to be using the money?

1271
01:24:44,820 --> 01:24:45,500
We have no money.

1272
01:24:45,620 --> 01:24:48,880
It's a state of emergency, giving us worthless notes.

1273
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:51,220
If it's a bank note, you should get money for it, you know?

1274
01:24:51,860 --> 01:24:54,060
So, all right, so how many people brought that up?

1275
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:54,260
None.

1276
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:57,580
So right away that told me it was a fake, it was a co-opted, right?

1277
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:01,200
Okay, what's interesting is you're not seeing mass protests.

1278
01:25:01,860 --> 01:25:14,180
It's going to be, it's not going to happen that way because when the system flips and becomes ultra-conservative, still retaining the goddess religion but another form, which I have never, I don't know if I've ever gotten into it, but we will.

1279
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:20,780
You will have the rise of the conservative, the biblical types coming to the surface.

1280
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,020
You know, religious Christian type, not biblical.

1281
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:28,760
There are no, there's only a handful of people that know what's in the Bible because there's a billion copies of it, right?

1282
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:31,780
Very few people have the comprehension.

1283
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:33,480
It's not because you have to be intelligent.

1284
01:25:33,620 --> 01:25:34,640
You just have to have comprehension.

1285
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:41,920
So what I'm trying to say is it's all going to flip, but you're not seeing protests other than a few mom and pops on street corners about this.

1286
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:47,240
And they don't even know it's the goddess religion, but what's going on with which bathroom to use and gender bending and all that, right?

1287
01:25:48,040 --> 01:26:04,280
Okay, so there's, I gave some of the reasons because as we go along, the discussion of the gods, the first thing that you can discuss, go back to the gods, about the gods is how evident is it?

1288
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:05,560
Do you know how I just showed it?

1289
01:26:05,780 --> 01:26:20,600
It is evident that 99.9% of all the protests that you see are a co-opted, actually created or set up by the same people that supposedly being protested against for the very lack of having this Masonic template in place.

1290
01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:26,220
Because you don't have to be that intelligent to put a Masonic template to scare them back, right?

1291
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:29,260
And so it's, don't waste your time.

1292
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:39,700
In other words, if you saw a protest going on and it did have the Masonic template, it might be worth getting into, hate to say, even though I'm not that type, it doesn't matter.

1293
01:26:39,900 --> 01:26:42,600
But then it's probably the real deal, but it's not going to happen.

1294
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:51,520
So what you observe, for example, what you see on a slightly deeper level reveals a lot.

1295
01:26:52,100 --> 01:27:03,860
So when you go back and speak about the gods, how many of us have actually walked into one overtly that had the t-shirt, I'm a god, let's say, recently that we know of?

1296
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:05,000
No one.

1297
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:06,520
I haven't seen that lately, no.

1298
01:27:06,620 --> 01:27:15,760
Yeah, so as you start looking around and going into this, from a material or immaterial point of view, you're going to notice that they're not around.

1299
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:20,380
First thing you notice, can't help it, right?

1300
01:27:20,380 --> 01:27:24,160
Silence is something that everybody hears once in a while, right?

1301
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:24,740
Right.

1302
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:28,820
But what everyone will see is there's no gods around.

1303
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:32,620
That's pretty easy, pretty obvious, pretty much.

1304
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:36,520
Almost reminds me of that scene in Devil's Advocate, right?

1305
01:27:36,940 --> 01:27:42,080
The Pacino scene where he says, you know, where's your god? He's an absentee landlord.

1306
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:46,940
Well, yeah, here's the interesting part of that.

1307
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:50,360
Then they start breaking it down into subdivisions, right?

1308
01:27:50,540 --> 01:27:54,680
Because let's say if you read about the god of the Bible, he uses agency.

1309
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:58,800
He does it all by agency, right?

1310
01:27:59,380 --> 01:28:07,620
Other gods are just so overcoming and overbearing and distant, and we just spoke about the goddess, for example.

1311
01:28:08,060 --> 01:28:08,260
Right.

1312
01:28:08,580 --> 01:28:10,780
Okay, so we don't see them around.

1313
01:28:10,780 --> 01:28:13,120
So what do they really represent?

1314
01:28:14,340 --> 01:28:17,560
This is back into fundamental Greek-speak, which is basic.

1315
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:19,040
It's where you get your law from.

1316
01:28:19,100 --> 01:28:21,440
They're a superior being, so why reinvent things?

1317
01:28:21,780 --> 01:28:22,660
It's already been done.

1318
01:28:23,060 --> 01:28:26,220
They have things that are provable that work well.

1319
01:28:26,460 --> 01:28:34,440
Like, for example, the reason I do the Old Testament, let's say, template is because it works and it's true.

1320
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:43,860
Even something like circumcision, which should be done on the eighth day, well, it's very well-known, established scientifically and medically,

1321
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:50,120
that a male baby at eight days old has the highest coagulative properties in their body.

1322
01:28:50,640 --> 01:28:53,320
Not the seventh day, not the ninth day, but the eighth day.

1323
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:57,240
So how did they know that back then?

1324
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:05,360
So all of these different things, and they still hold true today because it holds true enough for the individual.

1325
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:10,500
There's plenty of people that I've met that say, no, I don't do any of those laws because I do whatever I want.

1326
01:29:11,180 --> 01:29:12,460
But there's a certain limit.

1327
01:29:12,620 --> 01:29:19,020
We're not born with any downloads, so we're going to have to learn what we're – in other words, most people really don't know what they want.

1328
01:29:19,100 --> 01:29:20,640
They have to be told what they want.

1329
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:21,360
You know that, right?

1330
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:24,600
Well, they learn it one way or another through experiences.

1331
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:24,700
They learn it, exactly.

1332
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:27,020
You have to be shown or taught.

1333
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,360
Like you said, they learn it.

1334
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:31,580
Okay, so what is there to learn?

1335
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:39,780
So the first priority one should have is if you're going to venerate something or someone as a god, how does that improve your life?

1336
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:48,580
So right there you've weeded out 99% of all the religiosity and all these other things that you see.

1337
01:29:48,780 --> 01:29:53,460
We're not talking about how you feel about something, like the J-E-S-U-S stuff.

1338
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:55,380
It's all about feeling and belief.

1339
01:29:56,480 --> 01:30:03,920
If there's nothing there that you can use that's tangibly going to help you or organize you into a higher quality of life

1340
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:11,280
or anything on how to do something, like if you don't know how to tie your shoelaces, is there a god for that that shows us how?

1341
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:12,440
And he doesn't have to be here.

1342
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:16,240
It would be very inefficient if he could just have it written down, right?

1343
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:17,680
Stuff like that.

1344
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:22,140
So that's essentially, believe it or not, that's all I have to say about the gods.

1345
01:30:22,140 --> 01:30:24,080
What are you getting from that?

1346
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:35,740
And I'm talking about if a god is all-encompassing, okay, well, that has nothing to do with the physical reality, right?

1347
01:30:36,460 --> 01:30:37,140
Or whatever.

1348
01:30:38,380 --> 01:30:41,180
There's a dualistic and someone put, what about monism?

1349
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:42,620
Is that just another one of the things?

1350
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:44,620
It is, but there is no monism or dualism.

1351
01:30:44,620 --> 01:30:50,360
So if it's a god, most people have justified that there is no physical benefit.

1352
01:30:50,580 --> 01:30:52,240
It's all spiritual and what you believe.

1353
01:30:53,760 --> 01:31:00,480
So then you just act like a poor sad psych here and you don't know how to function here.

1354
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:01,580
It doesn't help you at all.

1355
01:31:01,660 --> 01:31:03,380
Well, what good is it, right?

1356
01:31:03,460 --> 01:31:04,660
Then go where they are then.

1357
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:05,340
You can't.

1358
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:06,020
So you're stuck here.

1359
01:31:06,020 --> 01:31:14,860
Then there's the other ones, like the science god, for example, tells you, or the legal god, how to do everything here.

1360
01:31:15,660 --> 01:31:16,900
There's no spirituality.

1361
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:18,880
You know, when you're dead, you're done kind of thing, right?

1362
01:31:19,700 --> 01:31:20,920
The ultimate duality.

1363
01:31:21,180 --> 01:31:24,220
When you're dead, the laws don't apply to you because that's that.

1364
01:31:24,740 --> 01:31:24,980
Right.

1365
01:31:25,460 --> 01:31:26,380
But they're playing.

1366
01:31:26,820 --> 01:31:27,420
So either one.

1367
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:28,680
It actually should be both.

1368
01:31:28,780 --> 01:31:31,980
It should be for the mind, the spirit, the non-physical and the physical.

1369
01:31:31,980 --> 01:31:46,040
So one thing to watch out for is when you're looking at the gods, what information are these gods transmitting and has been memorialized that could help with your daily life or weekly or yearly or whatever.

1370
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:53,180
Again, when you consider this, you've weeded out 99% of what's out there, right?

1371
01:31:53,420 --> 01:31:53,620
Right.

1372
01:31:54,100 --> 01:31:56,020
So that's a very, very simple way.

1373
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:58,160
It's like, why would you want to listen to Greek speak?

1374
01:31:58,480 --> 01:31:59,740
He doesn't have a great voice.

1375
01:31:59,740 --> 01:32:02,720
He doesn't have an agenda or something.

1376
01:32:02,980 --> 01:32:04,180
He's not whatever.

1377
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:05,580
Why do people like to listen to it?

1378
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:12,640
Because it brings forward things that are very simple that really anyone can think about and ponder.

1379
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:14,700
And it's helpful.

1380
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:17,680
If it wasn't helpful, I don't think people would be listening.

1381
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:26,680
Well, there are tangible improvements that can be gleaned from various discussions, whether it's about reorganizing the way that you think about something

1382
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:35,660
or it's literally changing the way you handle something like water or changing what we're going to get into food soon.

1383
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:38,660
Or 30 other different things.

1384
01:32:38,860 --> 01:32:42,100
It shows you how to put conditions and put things.

1385
01:32:42,740 --> 01:32:46,260
It's a form of mental organization and manifestation.

1386
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:56,280
So in essence, one of the things that inspired me to do this kind of speak is the way I got into the scripture.

1387
01:32:57,260 --> 01:33:02,480
When I heard someone discuss that all law comes from God and this and that, I said, there is no God.

1388
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:02,780
What do you mean?

1389
01:33:02,820 --> 01:33:04,140
The Bible that was written by Shakespeare.

1390
01:33:04,300 --> 01:33:04,920
I've said this before.

1391
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:05,620
People have heard it.

1392
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:07,480
I said, you know, I'm knocking the Bible.

1393
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:08,340
I've never read it.

1394
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:12,240
It's like knocking a movie that you haven't seen or even seen a review of, right?

1395
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:15,440
Or maybe if you saw a short review, you can agree with the reviewer.

1396
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:18,260
But how can you agree with the reviewer without seeing the movie?

1397
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:20,540
It's an uninformed agreement you're making.

1398
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:21,080
Totally.

1399
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,340
So it was extremely uninformed.

1400
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:24,000
And this man brought up law.

1401
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:25,740
So I just went and studied law in the Bible.

1402
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:27,400
I said, no one ever told me this.

1403
01:33:28,280 --> 01:33:28,380
Right.

1404
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:32,180
And I saw many things that were in there were actually already implemented.

1405
01:33:32,980 --> 01:33:33,260
Right.

1406
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:36,820
So I started looking at other law forms.

1407
01:33:36,820 --> 01:33:45,140
And I started seeing that this was a superior law form because it was very hands off, but very stark, not limiting, but limited in many ways.

1408
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:53,420
But if you adhere to what limited things there were, it had such a large effect on everything else.

1409
01:33:53,460 --> 01:33:55,320
You didn't need much more, you see.

1410
01:33:55,980 --> 01:33:57,980
So I played around with that a little bit.

1411
01:33:58,040 --> 01:33:59,520
I started using it as a benchmark.

1412
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:11,320
And I'm sorry to say it's very difficult to find anything else that comes close in terms of mental, physical, spiritual organization in terms of how to organize oneself.

1413
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:20,080
Now, there's many things in there like lawful timekeeping and things like that that are not mentioned directly because they're supposed to be taken for granted.

1414
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:26,620
One thing that's lacking in the scripture is not directly, but it does tell you the times will be falling apart.

1415
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:31,540
You won't be able to reckon time anymore to a certain degree until everything changes.

1416
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:36,160
Because, you know, I think I've mentioned we're going to lose one-third of our time, right?

1417
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:41,180
It'll be a 16-hour day and nine months out of the year.

1418
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:43,060
You know, everything's going to be shortened by a third.

1419
01:34:47,220 --> 01:34:54,440
But how to measure the effect of a god is what, first of all, what you can access from that god.

1420
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:59,580
Because, like we said earlier, how many have you run into lately or known anyone who's run into any of them lately?

1421
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:02,720
So the only thing that we have is what's written about them.

1422
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:04,680
Now, at this point, it doesn't matter.

1423
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:08,160
Let's just say it this way.

1424
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:17,420
If it's inspired or was a work of fiction or real or not or edited or whatever, are you familiar with it just like the film?

1425
01:35:17,420 --> 01:35:25,020
You know, there have been many things that have been put out there through the years that have been shown to be a fraud or a fallacy or whatever, right?

1426
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:33,300
But whatever was called a fraud or a fallacy had to be examined first before it was called, right?

1427
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:35,580
Otherwise, it's unfair, you see?

1428
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:36,420
Well, right.

1429
01:35:36,460 --> 01:35:38,440
So you have to know what you're... yeah, of course.

1430
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:38,980
Yeah, exactly.

1431
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:40,600
It has to be examined closely.

1432
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:47,900
So what I'm saying here is any god, any information that's put out there about the quote-unquote divine needs to be examined.

1433
01:35:48,620 --> 01:35:57,420
Now, when you start, let's say, taking the opinion of others without examining it yourself, then you're... you know, we just said what that's like.

1434
01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:01,520
How can you agree with a reviewer if you haven't seen the movie yourself?

1435
01:36:01,660 --> 01:36:03,840
Or maybe you do it out of convenience, which is fine.

1436
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:12,280
It's also the most commonplace piece of trouble I see for people's lives all the time is they've taken somebody's word for something and they're parroting it,

1437
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:15,940
and they're completely uneducated about what it is they're parroting.

1438
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:18,700
They don't realize the attention they've released.

1439
01:36:18,820 --> 01:36:21,220
They don't realize the thing they're supporting.

1440
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:29,520
I find it most interesting that people who, on the one hand, say, I have these certain principles, then they tell me what they're supporting,

1441
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:36,440
and I'm often confused because I say, well, you're literally in support of the thing that is working against you.

1442
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:37,820
Do you understand that?

1443
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:40,960
Or you can say, obviously, you don't know much about it.

1444
01:36:41,420 --> 01:36:42,920
Well, I would say that.

1445
01:36:43,020 --> 01:36:48,400
I try to be a little kinder about it, and I just sort of say, do you realize that this is kind of working against you?

1446
01:36:48,580 --> 01:36:51,840
And usually a blank stare is what I get.

1447
01:36:52,220 --> 01:36:56,460
I think the time for kindness is over when it comes to a lot of these informational things.

1448
01:36:56,460 --> 01:36:57,920
But here's the thing.

1449
01:36:58,040 --> 01:37:08,980
With a movie reviewer, if I saw a movie reviewer and he gave you stark reasons and objective reasons that are sort of universal on why the movie was bad,

1450
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:12,740
I may not want to watch the movie, and he just saved me a whole bunch of time.

1451
01:37:13,860 --> 01:37:16,140
See, that's the other side of it, right?

1452
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:33,420
But if the reviewer is practicing heresy, heresy means your own preference, then I'd have to know the movie reviewer really well to see that in many other aspects of his life,

1453
01:37:33,860 --> 01:37:37,980
and then say, well, if he says the movie is not good, that's good enough for me.

1454
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:39,080
You've heard that before, right?

1455
01:37:39,080 --> 01:37:41,280
If someone says it's an endorsement, let's say, right?

1456
01:37:41,900 --> 01:37:43,260
Endorses or doesn't endorse.

1457
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:52,380
So one of the things that I like to do with people is when we discuss the gods or whatever writ, because, again, I haven't run into any of them physically.

1458
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:58,440
Because with UFOs, they have close encounters, first kind, second kind, third kind, fourth kind, right?

1459
01:37:58,640 --> 01:38:01,680
I think third kind and better is when you have physical...

1460
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:03,800
Some contact, some level of direct contact.

1461
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:04,180
Right.

1462
01:38:04,700 --> 01:38:06,280
That seems to be gone.

1463
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:12,080
So let's say you have a close encounter of the first, not even first kind with the gods, really, or second kind maybe.

1464
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:14,880
So let's go all the way back.

1465
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:24,140
Very little tangible, directly tangible in terms of what we consider to be meaningful in our lives, very little of that.

1466
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:29,080
So then how do you judge what is being put out by them?

1467
01:38:29,220 --> 01:38:31,500
Well, you have to see, again, how does it affect your life?

1468
01:38:31,580 --> 01:38:32,740
Does it improve your life?

1469
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:39,720
And that would be the shortest godspeak talk I've ever done for Greek speak on the gods.

1470
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:43,480
In other words, so it doesn't matter, how does it make my life better?

1471
01:38:43,660 --> 01:38:47,500
And I'm not talking from a greedy point of view, just me, but everyone.

1472
01:38:48,260 --> 01:39:01,860
For example, if you had a whole toolbox of various things, information or techniques or whatever, to make everyone around you better or improve their lives,

1473
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:06,020
and didn't use it on yourself, but everyone you've ever met did,

1474
01:39:06,820 --> 01:39:14,040
even if you never applied them to yourself, your life would still get better by contact with everyone else whose lives did.

1475
01:39:15,180 --> 01:39:16,040
Do you see what I mean?

1476
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:16,960
Right.

1477
01:39:18,260 --> 01:39:26,740
So what you start seeing then is how is knowledge of the gods or what they're saying helping anyone at this point?

1478
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:28,380
Not at all.

1479
01:39:28,420 --> 01:39:28,980
Not at all.

1480
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:31,980
Because they either don't know it or are not applying it or whatever.

1481
01:39:31,980 --> 01:39:39,800
And again, if you narrow it down, I think you and I once had a talk with a woman who converted to Buddhism or whatever,

1482
01:39:39,940 --> 01:39:44,340
and her whole shtick was about why does God have to have a dick?

1483
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:45,980
Why does he have to be male?

1484
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:48,440
And I was like, wow, that's what you're getting?

1485
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:49,860
This is your spiritual apex?

1486
01:39:50,660 --> 01:39:54,160
This is the whole, it's like, I kept saying, well, how does it make your life better?

1487
01:39:54,700 --> 01:39:57,280
What have you done that, no answer at all, right?

1488
01:39:57,280 --> 01:40:02,000
I'm not going to put a finger or point at anyone, but this is so common, right,

1489
01:40:02,060 --> 01:40:07,160
that people that go on these spiritual adventures, I call them, thinking that they'll improve.

1490
01:40:07,260 --> 01:40:08,760
And I ask them, well, how are you better?

1491
01:40:09,140 --> 01:40:10,560
Well, they can't answer that.

1492
01:40:11,540 --> 01:40:15,500
Well, the only answer I've ever gotten from somebody is that it makes them happier, right?

1493
01:40:15,940 --> 01:40:16,340
Sure.

1494
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:22,000
And that's the only thing where I go, okay, well, tangibly I could say if you're made happier by these actions,

1495
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:25,240
oh, you could mark that as an improvement, couldn't you?

1496
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:27,640
Because you weren't happy before without it, right?

1497
01:40:28,340 --> 01:40:30,180
Are you happier when you're sleeping, though?

1498
01:40:30,980 --> 01:40:35,140
I mean, yeah, it's very, well, still, happiness is a big deal.

1499
01:40:36,060 --> 01:40:41,220
So essentially, yeah, essentially I wanted to start off with the current conditions,

1500
01:40:41,380 --> 01:40:45,260
let's say socioeconomic political conditions is the revived goddess religion,

1501
01:40:45,260 --> 01:40:52,920
and I wanted to give that hymn to Inanna about how she turns women into men and men into women

1502
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:56,140
and how that applies since the 50s until now.

1503
01:40:56,820 --> 01:41:02,640
I wanted to give that first because if you want to talk about the gods, let's get to the most pertinent thing.

1504
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:05,980
What is the sociopolitical environment that affects everyone?

1505
01:41:06,240 --> 01:41:12,000
Yes, believe it or not, the money system and inflation is still part of the goddess system, right?

1506
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:19,680
So I just wanted to give that part first, and I think we'll maybe do a wrap on this one and continue at some other time.
