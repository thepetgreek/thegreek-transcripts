1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:13,960
Sonic Event 100. Didn't know that was coming. I'll tell you, sometimes I don't know a lot

2
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,200
of things are coming, but that's just me.

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:23,140
Oh, I did. I did. It's a progression, and if you don't stop it, it keeps going. It progresses

4
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,800
just like anything. That's why we're going to talk about the container tonight.

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,360
And yet all things are finite, though, Greek, are they not?

6
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:39,840
Yeah, even in an open system, it's finite. We'll get into that because we're not in a closed

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:49,300
system. But what you can extract from the open system is highly, highly variable. And yeah, just

8
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:55,040
like you have valving, you know, and lanes for directing traffic, you know, think of it that way.

9
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,040
In valving, you know, you have a valve on a water hose, right? How much water you let through?

10
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:04,740
Yeah. All right. So, yeah, let's just get right to it. One of the early things, by the way, I'm

11
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:10,420
still the only person on the Internet, as far as I can tell from others, that is discussing these

12
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:17,820
things all as one in one get go. What, you know, in terms of the body and it works and it seems to

13
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:26,140
be with many methodologies, whether you specialize on the part or the whole to work, you know, with

14
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:33,380
modern medicine, well, overall, okay, you everything that you engage in, in public is

15
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:39,680
political. None of it is lawful. Okay, what does that mean? You have political medicine, political

16
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:46,680
religion, political schooling, political science, political media, political means it's some form

17
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:54,540
of control, anything goes to sort of direct the mind and the behavior of the populace a certain

18
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:01,140
way. It's not at all objective at all. And this is how you get directions from legalistic things, but

19
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:07,360
not lawful things. Well, I remember 15, 20 years ago, working with someone against some attorneys,

20
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:13,120
we were working against them and beating their pants off. They basically threw their hands up. It

21
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,660
says, Well, you have radical political views, we weren't bringing anything, what people would talk

22
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:23,960
up as being political, we were just using the law, you know, the code as codified, and the position of

23
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:30,260
the Bar Association, which is called the company in the US code, by the way, and it's a communist

24
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,600
organ, it's registered as a communist organization.

25
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,620
England, it's a temple bar association or something like that. Yeah.

26
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:47,660
Oh, yeah, the crown. It's called the crown. Canada also. And yeah, but that's, look, one thing that I

27
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:55,220
shy away from is when people start putting the finger blaming certain groups. Unless those groups

28
00:02:55,220 --> 00:03:01,320
are coming, going to everyone's house every day with weapons at everyone's head. Well, more than

29
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:07,020
just threats and intimidation. Let's say, it's the people that go for it, right? It's the fish in the

30
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,900
hook. What do you call the bait? They're just baiting the public. You know, they're like, there's the

31
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:16,680
there's the blame the Jews, right? They blame the communists. They blame the liberals. Yeah, but who

32
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:22,520
they have no power. That's just a it's advertising. The word advertising means to shift direction or

33
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,320
get someone's attention, right?

34
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:30,820
Are you saying at the core of the real rot and on everything is actually compliance. It's not all

35
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,980
about the dictations that are

36
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:40,820
compliant, but it's what people find to be a preference, irrationally. So yeah, let's anyway, so

37
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:45,080
it's all political, the medical system, what it does, it gives okay, medical system, let's do the

38
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:52,940
important part first. Sure. War is a campaign. It's a theater. It's a game. It's a rite of passage.

39
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:59,880
It's what people do. If you are anti war, and you like watching sports, you're a hypocrite. It's the

40
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:04,240
same thing. It's the same thing. Just you know, the competitive sense, the winner, the loser, right?

41
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:13,940
The same language. Okay. It was deemed prior to the 20th century. But they really shot their load in

42
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:21,079
the 20th century, that conventional warfare is not the way to go to ruin a population or control a

43
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:27,160
population, even though they did World War One and World War Two, and all that other stuff, all these

44
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:34,280
wars that you have still today, the best way to wage war, a continuous war is through psychological

45
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:40,920
means by controlling the education system, medicine, religion, and money, really the money

46
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:49,200
system. The current medical system across the entire world is a militarized system against the

47
00:04:49,200 --> 00:05:00,360
population, not for the population. Now, why anyone would go for it in whole is insane. So most people

48
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,520
are insane. We've talked about this before.

49
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,880
Well, following the logic you use, though, here's the problem. By their culture, they're taught

50
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:17,000
what's acceptable and what's not acceptable. And therefore this becomes how they're conditioned. And

51
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,980
obviously, a short term trauma, like a sudden violent event is effective, but only in the short

52
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:26,440
term. So it's better to have a long campaign of attrition.

53
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:34,180
Well, depends on the age, the not the age, meaning years that the the period that you're living in. So

54
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:40,000
there's, you know, I've talked about the eschatology running up into the, you know, six past the sixth

55
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,820
millennium and all that. And the dwindling down of the population, all that, yeah, that's still holds

56
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:50,980
an effect that started a long time ago, but it's in full force now. And don't, by the way, the world's

57
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:56,900
population is about a third what they say it is. So when I bring up people crunching numbers on how they're

58
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:01,660
going to kill 8 billion people, there ain't no 8 billion people on the planet. Sorry. It's barely in the

59
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:10,820
billions, barely. So all of the hard math, you know, like, if you give a statistic, like 80% of the people

60
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:15,660
who have cell phones in a particular country is supposed to have one and a half billion people. And

61
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:22,400
there's only 500 million cell phone accounts. Well, that means that the entire population would not be

62
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,400
more than 700 million or so, right?

63
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,640
Well, by extrapolation, also, people say that only one third of the world apparently is on the

64
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:36,680
Internet. And what you're saying is maybe similar metrics. It's the metric works in reverse this way,

65
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,320
though, where they would say, Look, if there's too big of a number of people, if they've got a ghost number

66
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:46,980
of people, then probably the thing that it's for the bank, or the bankers keep the bankers have two sets of

67
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:51,460
books, and they never tell the truth. Of course, they give facts. So alright, so let's get back to the

68
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:58,100
container, right back to the medical system, what they're doing is highly specialized on the parts and not

69
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:06,200
the whole. So the parts would be the parts of the body and the whole of the body is ignored. Even when you go

70
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:14,400
for what's called a diagnosis, it's ignored, they basically go for a scope, they get a fictional, I

71
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,840
could do a recap, but I don't think a full recap necessary. There is no blood pressure in the body.

72
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,700
That's a fiction. There is no blood sugar in your blood, by the way. An analog is used to measure that,

73
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:34,120
right? There are pretty much a handful of popular diseases thrust on the American public that don't

74
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,940
exist that people are actually taking medication for, which are leading to how many times you ever

75
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:44,520
heard of they died with complications of diabetes. Okay, the word complications means that the medical

76
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:51,740
treatment they got actually caused liver failure. Okay, and kidney. Okay, bounce around a little bit.

77
00:07:51,860 --> 00:08:02,160
If you lived in old world, China, they had a girdle type thing. It looked like half of an apron, you know, an

78
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:08,580
you tied it around your kidneys on a windy day to protect your kidneys didn't matter has nothing to do with how

79
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:15,700
many layers you're wearing, or you're wearing a windbreaker. A windy day would be accountable for blowing the

80
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:22,300
fire out of your kidneys. This isn't traditional Chinese medicine. So they had this wrap that you wrapped

81
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:29,480
around your kidneys or on the backside, right and tied it off on the front when it was windy outside. Right? So

82
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:36,900
the kidneys are fire connected to the liver function. pancreas are not considered a separate organ, right?

83
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:45,960
They're part of the liver function. Kidneys are connected to the liver function on and on adrenal, right? All

84
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:53,860
that stuff stress, right? Okay, so I need to throw in some it's amazing how little tradition if you look up

85
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:58,460
traditional Chinese medicine practices online, I did something about a week ago and we said we might be doing

86
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:04,120
the thing on the container again. Yes, there's nothing it's all been scrubbed. It's not like back in the early

87
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:10,000
it's 20 years ago when you'd look that up and there'd be some HTML basic website and it would be someone that

88
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,880
does what we call like a blog listing all these things, right? There's nothing like that anymore, right?

89
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:22,820
1990 site that somebody forgot to delete. Yeah. Yeah, right. It's just this stuff is Yeah, so it's amazing. I

90
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:27,920
have to go from memory. 99% of the stuff I talked about on the Sonics is from memory and whatever you know, I

91
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:37,960
have been black ink on white paper. So but anyway, the specialization and the fictionalization is part of the

92
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:47,960
tactic and the strategy. Also, it's part of the legal system. So when I say legal system, it has nothing to do with

93
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:55,200
law. It relates to law because in law, you have a provision that you can go into contract, right? So that's what

94
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:01,060
legal has to do with now. I'm not against legal, you absolutely need it in certain cases, but that not as a whole,

95
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:08,540
right? To say that you have a legal system, that's all you have is like watching idiocracy where they put Brando and

96
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:14,840
everything. Right? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Well, what do you know? Why do you take Brando? Because it has electrolytes?

97
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:20,540
What's electrolytes? It's in Brando, right? So Brando, it's in everything helps everything. Yeah, that's what pretty

98
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:24,460
much you're living in right now. All right. So anyway, we I don't feel like we've gotten started, but let's get

99
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:30,660
started. Okay, sounds good. Your your body, we're calling it the container. So saying the body strictly we're

100
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:38,580
talking strictly the meat, the carne the material part this time, right? Is is part of the earth. It's just as part of

101
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:46,840
the earth as anything else that's extracted from the earth in simple form. If you look at all the raw materials that

102
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:54,260
you'd make things with, it's just as it's just as direct as that it's, you know, when you have an iron gate, that iron

103
00:10:54,260 --> 00:11:01,660
was garnered from mining, you know, black sand or hunks of iron melted down, right? natural materials, aluminum,

104
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:07,740
whatever metals, non metals, minerals, or salt, you know, guess he saw you take it, okay, your body is just like that.

105
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:14,420
Very not very different. So when you have an iron gate, and that if you watch where it came from, someone back at the

106
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:20,820
beginning was gathering fragments of iron, you know, surface iron to melt down, your body is very much the same way

107
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:31,200
based on raw material from the earth. So if your conception point, time of conception in the mother's womb, if she

108
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:37,680
didn't intake earth elements, earth materials, you wouldn't be here, she would, she and the bay and the embryo and the

109
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:44,020
development of you in the womb would never take place, you would starve to death, right? And once you're born, if you

110
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:52,440
don't take in water, food, air, minerals, and all the food, you would also die. Now, what makes it full circle, we don't have to

111
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:59,780
get into, it's always mentioned, when you die, you also go back to right, the earth will willingly accept you, just like the

112
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:05,700
earth will willingly give up nutrition and food stuff for you. In other words, even if you don't know anything about

113
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:13,740
agriculture, let's say you're, even if you're vegetarian, you'll survive in any natural setting, you'll find stuff to eat,

114
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:20,020
right? In some traditions, they even state when burying a body, right? You came from the earth, now we return you to it. That's

115
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:27,160
right. So this is this is the main point, if you know, it's the body, not any specific aspect of the body, not the eye, not the

116
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:35,280
ear, not the leg, not the internal organs, but about as a whole. So when you look at what to eat, this is going to be very heavy on

117
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:42,740
what we eat. So you're going to say something? Yeah, I wanted to ask you something about the use of the word container, because I

118
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:50,040
was thinking about this, a Star Trek episode that came up, and they said, there was a computer describing people as ugly bags of

119
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:57,480
mostly water. And I found that interesting. But it got me to thinking that, you know, when we think about a container, a container

120
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:04,600
usually has a different type of material that is able to contain other materials. Sometimes there's similar materials, but the

121
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,760
nature of the material must be different. Otherwise, the container doesn't function, right?

122
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:18,580
So it could you could have, you could have a rock container with sand in it, which are both the same, but okay. So you know, one of the

123
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:27,600
jokes that I make is that the medical community basically is saying that humans or animals or mammals, or anything living is a

124
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:36,320
pressurized filter bag. All right, that's what you're basically being called. But what I want to just lean more heavily on, on this one

125
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:43,720
about the container is, is how we are attached to the earth. And you really can't separate. You know, that's why the you know, whether

126
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:50,720
you believe it or not, space travel will never be popular. In other words, you know, the Star Trek stuff, you know, you're living on

127
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:57,440
spaceships for generations and generations, right? That if you're born on Earth, you'll have severe problems.

128
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:04,740
Well, because if you were able to farm fruit and things, say on another planet, it would not naturally work in your system.

129
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:12,840
Because even in space, or whatever, it will not work. Or Yeah, the energy. And you learn this from when you do gardening, by the way,

130
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:21,660
certain crops, like we grow certain leafy green vegetables year after year. And when they were in a certain period, the lettuce is very

131
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:29,160
tough. And other periods, you know, a few years later, it's very soft, again, tender. That's because of the activities of the earth and the

132
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:38,460
cosmos, you know, the planets and the sun. But anyway, back to the, the body and the container and the earth. There's so much to be said

133
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:48,840
about it. But it's so individualistic, whenever you put something into the body, especially from a medical perspective, where they like to

134
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:57,880
inject people, or the more you get so far away from entering, putting things into the body normally from breathing or eating, right, or

135
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:05,320
putting under your, you know, under your armpit or something is another way to hear like the tobacco, the patch, right, there's no nothing

136
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:15,600
that right, okay, so you could apply things to the body and all that. Anything that the medical community is telling you even anything that

137
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:26,040
goes under the skin, subdermal, hypodermal, and all that stuff. Other than saline solution, and certain opioid opioids, blood type must be

138
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:34,760
taken into consideration. Race must be taken into consideration. Body weight must be taken into consideration. The same with animals. By the

139
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:41,840
way, I'm just bouncing around. Anybody ever go to a vet? It doesn't matter what animal what vet they ever take blood pressure of the animal? No.

140
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:49,560
Yeah, because it's a non existent thing. So I just got to throw these little digs in there. If you're going to leave from this conversation, kind of

141
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:56,100
like all over the place, but there is no blood pressure. And there is no blood sugar. And there is no right all these things that you don't absorb

142
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:02,400
anything, right? Well, kind of everything's by induction. Yeah. And a fascinating observation there is where you're telling me that yes, indeed, a lot of

143
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:10,280
people try to say that we're nothing more than mammals. Well, it's funny, because veterinary people that treat mammals constantly, you know, your dog, your

144
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:16,820
cat, that's a mammal, to the best of my knowledge, they don't need blood pressure. Now they are starting to do. Oh, yeah, the blood pressure thing. That's

145
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:26,460
total fiction. But as so as the diabetes, by the way, it's a total fiction, and AIDS and many other diseases. But you people that get diagnosed with

146
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:34,520
these things and follow treatment get sick and die. Many people that are diagnosed with these things and refuse treatment live a healthy, normal life

147
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:42,840
generally. So that's how this is the way it's kind of like, you know, my brother died, how did he die? Oh, he's on the battlefield. Oh, that makes total

148
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:50,440
sense. When you hear someone getting treatment for blood pressure, diabetes, whatever, they're going to die, or cancer, they're going to die. There's,

149
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:59,680
there's actually, there's a study done, it's kind of buried. I remember about this is back in Oh, for that, if you have cancer and get treatment, your

150
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:08,960
chances of dying are higher than if you don't treat it at all. And we're talking about oncological stuff, too, with tumors, right? So yeah, so this is,

151
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:20,140
again, very, very bad situation that people are in, but it's voluntary. In certain cases, it's not when you become a ward, you know, with someone under 18

152
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:29,440
award, you know, incompetent judges, judges order medical treatment, by the way, to certain people, you know, or the right. Also, the hospitals are run that

153
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:40,400
way, too. There is always like 100, almost 100% of a chance as soon as the custody of a child is handed over to the state. It's almost a certainty absolute that

154
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,140
there will be medical treatment involved there. They'll start to medicate them or do it's a guarantee.

155
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:55,700
Yeah, yeah. The same if you leave the hospital without checking out, they call the police to hunt you down. I've seen that. Anyway, police driving up and down

156
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:01,420
like, Hey, you guys need any help? Because I always ask them if they want any help. Yeah, we had someone check out of the hospital such and so person, you'd almost

157
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:12,300
know. Okay, so where did the legal authority but good. Sorry. No, they do because it's it's part of the military system. The surgeon general who's the head of

158
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:27,640
is always in uniform. Okay. Where were we? Okay, the the aspect of the human body that is totally negated, almost by most is what should we eat? Right? But it's not

159
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:35,740
negated. You know, it's being negated when there's a fashionable diet every year, right? Or every several years, right? I don't even have to get into what those

160
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:41,940
fashionable diets are. And most of it started in the 50s and 60s. I'd say really in the late 70s.

161
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:47,280
Yeah, 70s and 80s. And all that we went to Atkins and then the different what? Oh, yeah.

162
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:55,300
Every morning, go down the list. And when one is popular, like right now, something that is popular keto or paleo, there's like two or three other ones and lurking in the

163
00:18:55,300 --> 00:19:08,180
background. Right? Yes, of course. So so all this. So basically, what I've discovered through all these years is primarily a veggie vegetable diet in season. That's why I feel so bad about

164
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:19,200
vegetarian vegan people, they have no idea of energy. And one way to do that is the fashionable shakes. They they're chemically clinically chemically correct. You know, they mix

165
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:31,700
like kale, avocado, banana, orange and mango. Right? Really, really bad food combining. They have no understanding. 99% of the people that do practice vegetarian and vegan have no

166
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:46,120
understanding of seasonality, no understanding of the energies, which vegetable does what for the body how they could be used to have the body react differently. No, no clue at all. Not even a clue. They just

167
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:57,540
think, well, we're really like this, because we the animal cruelty, and we don't want to eat something that has eyes, you know, that I remember, when I first read into the non

168
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:06,160
Krishna's, you know, that we're about being vegan. If it has eyes, you know, you shouldn't eat it, right? So that means fish, birds, right?

169
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,140
As a mother, sometimes they say such a mother or whatever.

170
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:23,420
Yeah, but they have nothing about that. So if you want to end the recording now, and since I've prefaced, this is really about food and giving jabs and jigs to the medical community, which is horrible, by the way, there's no

171
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:37,540
redeeming, even the only thing that they there, they should be there for is for trauma, like when someone's bleeding out, and their guts go to the emergency room in ICU, intensive care, they usually treat you very quickly, not always,

172
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:51,500
they medical again, community does not understand that you have anywhere from a few minutes to a few minutes to patch someone up, right? They don't understand that, you know, to have extremely rapid healing. So again, they're not really

173
00:20:51,500 --> 00:21:19,460
good for much. But they do exist, just like lawyer, attorneys are not good for much bankers are not good for much. I mean, all these things, you know, this is the society living. But all of these years now that I've been looking at it, I since the early 80s, what I've come to surmise that a human but what would keep the human body in the best balance is the cabbage plant, and the thistle plant. These two

174
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:49,300
plants, one, the cabbage plant, believe it or not, just like you have green cabbage, red cabbage, broccoli, by the way, kale, all of those are cabbages. For example, if you let a cabbage plant go into bloom, where it bolts, and it's ready to give out a seed stock, it looks just like kale or collard, right? Okay, so when you plant kale or collards, or Swiss chard, it's just like the early the later stages of cabbage, right? Okay, it's

175
00:21:49,300 --> 00:22:19,020
like, imagine, you know, you ever see little babies, old man disease, imagine like a three year old baby looks like a 70 year old man, right? That's basically what kale is, and collards and all these other things and lettuces. The other thing is the thistle plant, which you can go into the other aspect of the root of the thistle plant. By the way, people that are into supplements, one of the best things and most widely recommended things for liver dysfunction is milk thistle. Right? So what I mean by the thistle plant root is the bird

176
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:48,440
off route. So this might sound very narrow for for typically, I'm not into being narrow about anything. But what I've discovered also, this is on looking back, that if you can incorporate the cabbage plant, which is what I just mentioned, that whole variety of cabbage plants, and the thistle, which is burdock, also burdock would include the carrot, which is a very soft form. It's if

177
00:22:48,440 --> 00:23:18,260
burdock were ice cream, a carrot would be whipped cream. Okay, right, very light. parsnip, right root vegetables, not bulbous root vegetables like peanuts, and potatoes and yams and things like that. Those would be further down the line further away to be eaten as well. The next level would be your gourds, pumpkins and squashes. There's so many varieties, right? Okay,

178
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:47,640
between those three things as being a staple, you will excel in health, and you will excel in recovery, and general vitality. The other aspect is whole grains, and whole grains and whole cereals now whole, not processed, right? You take your pick. You know, for example, what I mean by this, you know, usually when you bring up this is only since the

179
00:23:47,640 --> 00:24:17,360
1950s, or maybe 60s, even much later. Asian cultures, you always think of white rice or rice, right? Always rice. But yeah, but before World War Two, rice was not a mainstay. If you served someone rice in Asia, you were wealthy. It's like doing filet mignon in the Western world, right? It was very exclusive. They predominantly ate barley and millet. That was predominantly their grains, believe it or not. There's a movie that actually

180
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:44,540
shows us in Kurosawa, Seven Samurai, they're walking through some of the villages, and someone offers him rice. He's like, wow, you have rice, you know, like no one, you know, if you don't know the history, like I just mentioned, you wouldn't see how important that was in that part of the film, right? The samurai was impressed because he had someone was offering him rice, right? And if you're a modern Westerner watching it, you're like, what do you mean? He's so excited about getting rice. What are you talking about? You know, it's so common, right?

181
00:24:44,540 --> 00:25:14,520
Yeah, it makes sense.

182
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:40,680
And there's something called valve timing, which is based on how fast the fuel ignites. If the fuel ignites very quickly, it's usually a lower power fuel, and it requires a certain timing. In other words, when the fuel is introduced into the cylinder, and when the spark goes off to ignite it. When the fuel is a slower burning fuel, a higher octane, requires a different timing, when the fuel is introduced and the spark is introduced, right?

183
00:25:41,720 --> 00:26:10,320
So this in simple terms is put into what's called the recommended octane rating. So if you buy, let's say a typical American car, they'll say use only 87 octane. Oh, but I want the premium. Well, it's a slower burning fuel, you'll be wasting your money, it might do have some cleaning properties, because it lingers around. So you don't have to fuel lingers around, it'll be wetter in there, it might clean off some carbon. Right? Now, if you buy something like an Audi, or BMW, it says use only

184
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:38,780
91 octane, because the timing and the valve timing and all right, is adjusted for the slower burning fuel, the higher octane, 93, or whatever. Yeah, that's even the higher remember, Sunoco is only one off for 92, or 93. Then there's racing gas 107. Right? Which is an even slower. Yeah, because those engines run hotter. So burning fuel cools the engine. Yeah, we can talk about car design. You know, but

185
00:26:38,780 --> 00:27:08,680
reciprocating engine is not my favorite, even though I can talk about it and engineer it to be better, which I do, by the way, spark plugs and throttle bodies. Okay. So essentially, but again, with the automobiles, they'll tell you what octane you use, what fuel to use, you can go radically different gasoline or diesel, right? Then there's the the the ethanol and all that other stuff. Right? It's almost like the manufacturer recommends this

186
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:38,560
stuff. You know, I don't see a direct manufacturer recommendation. But in the Bible, it indirectly, indirectly promotes a vegetarian diet, because it says if you touch any animal carcass or flesh, you're unclean until you wash the next day. So most people think it would be roadkill or a dead cow or something. No, if you chicken sandwiches are made of chicken flesh, which is dead chicken, if you eat a chicken sandwich, which is permissible, right? Are

187
00:27:38,560 --> 00:28:08,100
you touching animal flesh? Yes or no? You are? Yeah, you're. So it's indirectly, it doesn't tell you be vegetarian, don't eat animal, but it indirectly tells you if you happen to touch animal flesh, you're unclean. Well, if someone says, Well, I'm a kosher, I biblical, I pride, I only eat clean meats or whatever. Doesn't matter. It's still animal flesh, right? Right. So it doesn't tell you be avoided. It just says if you do, right, it's covered, it covers it very indirectly.

188
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:37,980
So again, it might be a proponent for veganism or vegetarian. No, not at all. I do enjoy eggs and milk and oval lactic and fish and things like that. And meats and all that. But I'm not I enjoy them only if they're good quality. I don't when I'm hungry. I don't think Oh, I want I want chicken, right? I want fish, right? No, I want a delicious meal. And if there happens to be high quality meat that can be prepared well or animal, I'll get it.

189
00:28:38,580 --> 00:29:08,280
Right? Like, if I'm traveling, I remember when I was traveling more a decade ago, and who I was staying with, I'd cook dinner, you know, they want to cook dinner. So let me cook dinner for you. We go to a quote unquote, supermarket that I'm not familiar with, and they want to eat the chicken. So we go to the chicken department. And I'm looking at the chickens are our friends. And these chickens don't cut it. Just because it says chicken on it doesn't mean you should eat it, right? I mean, look at the quality of this, you know, you know, what's what's like, some farms was one of these

190
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:24,700
chicken companies, not like Purdue, or whatever farms hills or whatever. Yeah, like, Oh, man, these guys, this is not it's in a bag with liquid. And it's a doesn't, you know, it probably was eating chickens. And this is not going to taste good. So let's do something else. You see,

191
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:38,740
plus, sometimes I see those things are unnaturally large, you know, like, clearly that this thing had to have been fixed. Oh, yeah. Well, anyone knows that people that come from, especially Asia, they don't, they laugh at the chickens, the chicken,

192
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:46,040
free range chickens are so skinny. They're so skinny, they're bred, you know, especially roosters. I'm always

193
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:50,460
giving a rooster once. I was like, there was no chicken breast, you know, it was like, hardly

194
00:29:50,460 --> 00:30:01,020
anything, right? And the legs were super sticks. Yeah, there's not enough meat. You know, what came first, the chicken or the egg, I used to joke, right, it's the chicken farmer that came first, because what you call a chicken now did not exist

195
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:05,520
before they were cross bred into what you consider to be a chicken now.

196
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:13,400
Very much like wild game bird, if you've gone hunting, game bird, it's nothing like the bird

197
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:36,560
that you poultry that you buy in the store, it's very, very thin, very little meat, right. So the same with most animals. But what I'm trying to say is the I've also said this publicly years ago, and as in the coming years, it's going to be harder and harder to eat meat. I think I said this around 2019. In a few years, probably won't be eating meat, I still make some good choices. But predominantly,

198
00:30:38,040 --> 00:31:02,240
based on vegetable, but you must understand the balance on how to do it. And the balance is very simple. Vegetable and grain should be the majority, you can go down the middle. And then you have legumes, beans, and they should represent a quarter or a third of the volume of the vegetable and grain.

199
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:18,780
Yeah, I was gonna ask about that. Because I know that you didn't bring up really a lot of beans. And you know, most of not necessary, believe it or not, beans are overrated. Well, yeah, but most of these vegetarian people that I speak to right there, they're always hawking the beans, like, Oh, you got to have beans in there. Beans, beans, beans, because that's how you get your proteins.

200
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:47,760
Well, no, well, there is no look at protein, the science, by the way, if you look at a protein molecule and a carbohydrate molecule, molecule, what's the difference? The chemical molecule? Nothing. It's just one, one nitrogen atom. Yeah. So it's, it's a hoax protein is a hoax to direct you into buy it's a marketing hoax. There's okay, it's also available protein. Give you an example. If you have something that has 10 grams of protein,

201
00:31:48,780 --> 00:32:17,720
and you can only only about a third or 20% quarter of that 10 grams, two and a half grams is biocompatible. And you have something that is half the protein, five grams of protein, that 70% of that is biocompatible or 80%. You're going to be getting four grams instead of two grams, right? So you'll get more protein out of beans than meat, you'll get more protein out of certain plants, especially thistle, then you will even out of beans.

202
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:39,640
Even though it initially has less protein, it's what's biocompatible. Now, beans are more of a concentrated food, a higher energy food, people that eat a lot of beans have retard the digestive process. That's why if you don't cook beans properly, he was even in film, they're sitting around the cowboys around the campfire farting. What was that film?

203
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,220
Blazing Saddles.

204
00:32:41,440 --> 00:33:08,040
Yeah, yeah. That's the common if you eat beans, you're gonna fart, especially in Western culture, because they don't understand how to cook them properly. That's the other thing. When you start preparing food for yourself, learn how to cook it properly. There was a Jiro Uno, a Netflix documentary about one of the best sushi places in Japan. And it was in Japanese with subtitles. And one of the rice merchants came into the restaurant and was laughing

205
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:38,020
with the owners of this restaurant that the documentary was about saying, Yeah, you know, the Hyatt Hotel wanted to buy the rice that you buy, but I wouldn't sell it to them. And because why would I sell them rice that they can't cook? Because, you know, no one was there was skilled enough to cook. And the logic behind that is, if you have a certain quality product that has to be cooked well to get that quality result. When you give it to someone who doesn't know how to cook it properly, they're going to get a low quality result. And that's going to go back on the

206
00:33:38,020 --> 00:34:06,160
reputation of the product, right? You see, right, right. So you're selling this premium rice. And if you give it to people who can't cooking, it's no good. Well, he has one person to say that somebody else ruins it. And then it's like, what kind of rice is this? It's ruined. It's terrible. Well, it's this. Yeah. Or it's not that good. And you just need one person, you know, one person to give that out. And I'll say, Wait a second, he's charged. That's a premium. And it's not any good. You see. So you want to protect these things, right?

207
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:35,800
By reputation, you wind up shooting yourself in the foot if you do that, right? So you don't sell it to people. So for me, when I start discussing food, it's in the back of my mind. I'm like, Oh, how many people listening to me actually know how to prepare food properly? Very few, you know, very, very few. So that is another thing that we should probably get into. I was taught we the solo sonics never really took off because of the scalerator and the water research and other things. But learning how to cook,

208
00:34:36,500 --> 00:35:05,780
is so important. And ever since I saw the chef popular, the popularity of chefs in the 90s on television, I pointed out and I said, Not one person's gonna learn how to cook by watching these cooking shows, because it has nothing to do with their strength. It's all showmanship. Right? Yeah. And I think we've been over this before. So again, if we're going to talk about the human body, you're basically made of the earth, you need the earth materials, and I just pretty much laid out the fundamentals of it. And it doesn't have to be boring.

209
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:35,140
Because I've always have time to talk about condiments and what makes eating cabbage, thistle, basically, you know, root vegetables, and whole grains, super interesting is the condiments, the sauces and the things that you use to flavor it. Right? So, and maybe we should do something about that. And I was really going to get into more about the human body and how it works and all that. But if you can forget about how something works,

210
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:44,080
and ritualize good intake, right, like having a physical health manifestation, whether it's skin,

211
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:51,680
organ, you know, what people call illness and all that. If you eat a correct diet, just like I mentioned,

212
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:56,620
you will not have that. It doesn't mean you're immune to not having it. By the way, there's no

213
00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:01,400
immune system either. Right? Well, you know, it's interesting. You brought up cars before,

214
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,580
because think about it. You know, what do you find when you're buying a used car that's been

215
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:10,980
around a little while? What is one of the best values to it? It means that somebody took care of

216
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:16,620
it. They put the maintenance into it. And when you put the maintenance into it, it survives better.

217
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:22,580
It's in better shape, even as it gets older. Sure. Even like the Dodge Caravans have a terrible

218
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:28,520
reputation for breaking down. Not if you may change the oil frequently and you have a bad

219
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:33,080
reputation for transmission failing. Not if you change the transmission fluid once in a while.

220
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:38,440
You really must do a full transmission fluid change, just partial change, and they just run

221
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:43,880
pretty much forever, as long as you use it as you should. Well, a well taken care of, you know,

222
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:48,920
Dodge Caravan, as you said, is much better than, you know, a crappy taken care of Escalade

223
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:54,220
any day of the week. And fundamentally, when the lights are off in the garage, they all

224
00:36:54,220 --> 00:37:02,160
kind of look the same, right? Anyway, so yeah, I would suggest, again, without getting into

225
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:09,700
major and how the body works and all that, I found that meditating on how would you explain

226
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:14,840
the human body, you know, walking, walking around with your head filled and how the human body

227
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:19,220
really works. So we talked about there's no absorption. Also, you could look at the skin,

228
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:24,200
cross section of a skin. Anatomical drawings are fairly accurate of the intestines. There's

229
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:28,120
no way anything passed physically passes through like you're saying you're absorbing it. It's by

230
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:33,620
induction. By the way, if you look at all of the reference, you're not going to find it online

231
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:39,820
anymore. I'll tell you that very difficult. What they call disease and contagions are induced into

232
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:45,860
the body, by the way, right? There's no physical transfer. It's recreated in the body. So the

233
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:52,340
miracle and the incredible magic, you can call it magic. Like walking, if you if you would you say

234
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:57,240
that somebody walking through a wall actually coming out the other side magic, you know, you

235
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:03,000
could it's in that category. That's how the body pretty much works. But what I what I would just

236
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:10,900
want to I cannot overemphasize that. If you stick to what I said tonight, as your general principle,

237
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:15,860
go to it doesn't have to be boring. This is the other thing I because I've tried to render this

238
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:22,860
myself. I've been doing a revived doing burdock and cabbage and all that cabbage more recently,

239
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:28,380
as a regular staple, like I said, two people here live here and we go through two heads of

240
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:33,320
cabbage a week and doesn't feel like we're eating a lot of cabbage, right? And this is just to because

241
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:37,480
I was using this to remedy some things that I'm trying to recover from and the recovery was really,

242
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:46,540
really fast. Eating eating Well, also, only if you're going to have to learn how to do it. And I

243
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:52,200
think we did a talk about that before and also burdock. Yeah, you did you did the What did you

244
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:56,180
call it? The cabbage pot roast cabbage pot roast. That's what I was trying to think of. Right. Yeah.

245
00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:00,640
And then there's the broccoli steak and broccoli and cabbage are pretty much the same thing,

246
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:06,080
by the way. So is kale collard and Swiss chard is just if you look at the growth patterns. Yeah.

247
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:12,080
So yeah. And I know two heads of cabbage for two people. That seems like very little in a week.

248
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:15,820
Yeah, that seems like that's not all we have. We have lots of other things, too.

249
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:20,200
We have a big variety. No, no, I'm not talking about a Spartan diet on that.

250
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:24,740
No, but it's the basis. You know, it's kind of like the basis. You know how people say it's

251
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:30,960
meat and potatoes. Right. Right. So you're going to always you know, it wasn't uncommon,

252
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,200
basically, in a meat and potatoes type household to go and buy a 50 pound bag of potatoes for

253
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:44,520
family every other week or so. Right. Right. And what I would say is a cabbage based diet with

254
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:50,800
grains, fish and other things as well. Like I have a pizza oven. I made pizza last night,

255
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,960
you know, Napolitan style, you know, with a mother culture and the fermented dough and,

256
00:39:56,620 --> 00:40:01,460
you know, 90 seconds, maybe maybe 90 seconds in the oven, you know, a beautiful leoparding

257
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:05,780
on the bottom and oh, yeah, you know, Jewish, you know, Napolitan style, not New York style,

258
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:09,360
Napolitan. It's a small, very, you know, the personal look like personal pizzas.

259
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,120
Absolutely delicious. You're going to make personal pizza or just pizzas if you have a

260
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:21,400
pizza oven, wood fired oven with a stone. Don't add anything to it. Don't put anything in the

261
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,860
sauce. Use a plain tomato, crushed tomato. Don't add it. Just, you know, make the dough how

262
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:32,140
you want to ferment it with olive oil, a little honey and salt. Don't add it. Nothing fancy with

263
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:36,440
the cheese. And you'll notice the fewer seasonings you put, the more delicious it is if you do it

264
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:42,700
right. So I have an extreme variety. The night before that, I had a yellowtail sashimi. There's

265
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:48,680
a place where I could go and get what's called sushi quality fish and a big slab of yellowtail

266
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:54,600
and, you know, raw is soaked in salt water. Chidashi Chidashi is where you put raw fish

267
00:40:54,600 --> 00:41:01,920
slices on top of a bowl of rice. And I had that with a side of Chidashi, which is like

268
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:07,560
steamed spinach. It's steamed in a fish stock, right? It's it's it's poached in a fish stock.

269
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:15,600
Yeah. With various condiments. So I do have variety, but the main staple, the main go to

270
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:20,400
are these vegetables, especially now that I was trying to heal certain certain things in the body

271
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,040
coming to be 60 pretty soon. And, you know, what you did in your 30s catches up with you,

272
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:33,720
even though I tend to be health conscious. But one thing that I can stress on all of this is

273
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:42,040
if you resolve yourself, not necessarily to be vegetarian or vegan, but to just consider those

274
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:46,340
the whole grain, the cabbage based vegetables and the root vegetables,

275
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:51,020
potatoes and peanuts and yams are not really they're more you can have those,

276
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:56,880
but more off to the side root vegetables, parsnip, burdock, carrot and resolve yourself.

277
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:01,460
And then, of course, beans. If you could resolve yourself to a diet like that,

278
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:06,820
when most people do it, they don't like it. They don't feel good because they don't.

279
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,260
It's the flavoring that also signals the body that it's getting nutrition.

280
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:16,860
So you must get into condiments. You must have flavorful condiments at this point.

281
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:23,280
What I would suggest is if you're going to switch and do even a whole grain, more whole grains

282
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:28,080
and cabbage based vegetables and root based vegetables with some beans,

283
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:33,780
if you don't find it to be flavorful enough as a meat and potatoes dish and one of your favorite,

284
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:39,240
let's say salad dressings is blue cheese dressing from going by the blue cheese,

285
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:43,060
put the blue cheese dressing on the brown rice and this cabbage or whatever you're having.

286
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:49,060
Right. As just to give you the flavor you're looking for. And one thing I haven't stressed

287
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:55,700
enough is how much the role of condiments, because they're digestive aids. And also,

288
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:00,740
if you're eating something that's bland, no matter how nutrition packed it is, like in sci-fi, right?

289
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:05,320
They're aboard some situation and it's like, where's the food? Well, you just put this tube

290
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:09,120
and you just eat that. That's your food. It has no flavor, but it has all the nutrition

291
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:13,400
your body needs. How many times you heard that in sci-fi means, right? All the time,

292
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,480
right. Your body will not sense that it's getting nutrition. You must have something flavorful.

293
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:25,780
So one thing that I want to stress is when you change that. OK, for example, in the military,

294
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:29,500
the little Tabasco in the MREs, they give you a little Tabasco sauce bottles,

295
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:33,920
little miniature bottles like serving size one. But that's used as money in the military.

296
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:41,360
In other words, infantry, when you if you don't actually you see, you know, cigarettes,

297
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:47,980
not so much anymore. But Tabasco sauce is like money because, you know, the MREs taste so bad,

298
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,200
you need more than they give you for Tabasco sauce to bring the flavor up. Right. Anyone that's been

299
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,660
in the military with infantry would know what I'm saying. Probably laugh. Yeah. Tabasco sauce

300
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:01,260
could be used as money. You know, it's a it's a value, very valuable commodity. What is it?

301
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:07,160
It's a condiment. Right. So if if you were to hear this kind of like all over the place,

302
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:10,460
it was supposed to talk about the container. We're really talking about what you should put in it.

303
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:18,120
Start what I would say after listening to this sonic and start researching and recapitulate

304
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:23,660
research condiments and recapitulate what is your favorite flavor and taste in food,

305
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:29,020
and you will find it's the condiments. So it's all about the condiments. And at this point,

306
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:33,660
but so we get to, quote, unquote, healthier condiments, anything that you find to be

307
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:38,460
exceptionally delicious for me, one of the most exceptionally delicious things, like flavor thing

308
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:43,700
is blue cheese dressing. Right. In a Western event, it's ranch. Right. How many times people

309
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:47,100
go to fast food? I want to start a ranch no matter what they're getting. Right. You're

310
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:52,320
even for pizza. I've noticed. Yeah, that really weird. Somebody told me about that a few months

311
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,880
ago. I'm like, oh, my God. Really? They put ranch on everything. Well, that's the taste.

312
00:44:55,880 --> 00:45:00,460
It's cultural and all that. You know, in Asia, it's soy sauce. When I would cook for Asian people,

313
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:05,320
they use more soy sauce. I'm like, oh, I thought I drowned it in soy sauce. So it's cultural. But

314
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:13,540
one way to to really bring up what your your game is in food is to decide what

315
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:17,800
condiments really blow your hair back. And that's where you're really going to.
