1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,180
Sonic Event 101, Rated Y.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,840
And here we are.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:15,520
Now, last time we did discuss the container briefly, but more about the care and maintenance

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,180
of the container last time, Greg.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,940
Yeah, I needed to just put the most important stuff out, so what do you do once you find

6
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:22,900
out how something works?

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,440
It's kind of like, you have a car and you got an oil leak because you didn't use the

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:33,020
right oil, and you got to fix the oil leak on the gaskets, a several hour job or whatever,

9
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,080
but you never discuss what the right oil is.

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,060
So just say, here's an oil leak, this is the right oil, use that.

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,280
And now we get into fixing the gasket or whatever that broke, right?

12
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:50,500
So now we'll get more into the technical stuff, which is pretty much a recap on, I think,

13
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:55,260
back in the original ONG, the second episode called The Container.

14
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,480
I'm going to revisit that just mentally, I have no notes, I have never heard it.

15
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:04,660
I just recall that was part of my standard shtick when I told, you know, whenever I had

16
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:09,360
the spotlight on explaining what the human body is, including the doctors, by the way.

17
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:17,300
By the way, the medical people, it's programming, it's brainwashing, it's, they have a state

18
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,460
certified education.

19
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,420
If it's state certified, it's crap, right?

20
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,480
I hope you guys know that.

21
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:27,220
Well, why would they certify something that's good for you as if they're on your side, right?

22
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,100
It's always yours.

23
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,840
Well, you did, they did before the central banks came in.

24
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:37,160
They're just, okay, doctors, attorneys, priests, accountants are central bank clerks.

25
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,800
That's who they really work for.

26
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,580
They may not know it, right?

27
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,540
They may not know it.

28
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:48,560
It's kind of like any other operation that's, what do you call it?

29
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,940
Like when the mob owns a, he's got control of a trucking company and the trucking company

30
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:59,420
tells the driver to go make a delivery, he doesn't know that it's being ordered by the

31
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,980
mob that controls his boss because he's getting it from his boss, right?

32
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:03,620
Oh, of course.

33
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,180
That's why you leave the bosses in place and you buy the bosses.

34
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:13,640
So the AMA, all these medical, they're basically part of the central bank conglomerate.

35
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,140
Every time you hear alphabet agency, that's part of the central banks except for the FBI,

36
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,820
which was created by the Jewish mafia, which is another story we can get into.

37
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,940
It was called, it was Pinkerton before that, super corrupt.

38
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,160
So they said if it's, if we, an organization like that will always be corrupt.

39
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,560
So let's dress it up the way we want it.

40
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,860
I mean, how many mob, Jewish mob bosses have been busted versus Italian mob bosses?

41
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,600
Think about it.

42
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,060
Way less.

43
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:42,720
By the FBI.

44
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,340
Way less.

45
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,180
I mean, yeah.

46
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:44,560
Oh yeah.

47
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,240
Like maybe two versus a 50 or a hundred.

48
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:47,640
Yeah.

49
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,560
I mean, they busted Lansky, but I mean, they, they didn't bust a hundred other guys.

50
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:52,260
I mean.

51
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:52,620
No.

52
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:52,920
Yeah.

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,900
And just like the DEA is, has the full might and military of the U.S. Army, right?

54
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,820
And what they do is they mitigate the cartels.

55
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:09,780
It's kind of like the DEA does what OPEC does for the oil producing nations.

56
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:15,600
The DEA organizes all, everyone who is the cartels versus regional geography, that they

57
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,740
behave a certain way.

58
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,620
And when the cartels, let's say, you know, like the mob boss, they have a meeting and

59
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:26,580
they say, well, this cartel isn't really playing with us well, guess who goes and takes them

60
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:26,780
down?

61
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,420
The DEA.

62
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,960
Well, I pared it down this way when somebody asked me about the drug war and they said,

63
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,760
well, what is the purpose of the DEA and your concept of what the way the drug war is actually

64
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,100
fought?

65
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,600
You know, cause he was mocking me about how I said the biggest drug dealer is our government.

66
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,160
Well, it's not, it's not, again, DEA is, is from the Nixon administration around there

67
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,720
put forward, right?

68
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,000
FDA, DEA.

69
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,260
Yeah.

70
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:48,500
Okay.

71
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,860
That's again, it's a central bank operation.

72
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,640
He's also responsible for the Environmental Protection Agency too.

73
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,020
Yeah.

74
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:56,880
I know.

75
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,220
Okay.

76
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,500
I'm not going to use names, but the, one of the best snipers, if this guy, if you look

77
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:07,660
at Pablo Escobar, there's a picture when he shot on the roof, it's kind of like Photoshop.

78
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,300
He's dead.

79
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,180
And there's a guy that's holding dead Pablo Escobar from the shirt and he's smiling.

80
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:13,920
That's the guy.

81
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,960
He's a sharpshooter.

82
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:19,760
Uh, he used to work for the state department and he's part really high up in the DEA.

83
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,480
And he says the biggest drug dealer in the world is the DEA.

84
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:22,860
Yeah.

85
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:32,420
And DEA is also used to, to clean up and FBI, um, sick situations for, for, uh, public relations.

86
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,260
Well, this guy asked me and I told him that the DEA is really there just to control the

87
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:36,620
price.

88
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,120
Yeah.

89
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,360
That's really what it is.

90
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:43,300
But when it gets really dirty, really, really dirty business, like, you know, when they

91
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:48,000
nuke the terror, you know, the terrorist bombings that are actually really nukes, they don't

92
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,880
even use the, any, any triple letter agency.

93
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,400
They use, um, Wackenhut.

94
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:57,520
That's whenever you see a Wackenhut security show up, it's usually a Fed contracts that

95
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,340
something really dirty is going on, like super dirty.

96
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,060
So this whole thing, this is very well known.

97
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,260
This is like, uh.

98
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,540
Well, Kraft too, right?

99
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,120
You live in a bad neighborhood.

100
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,980
This is a bad neighborhood, meaning the world.

101
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,080
And one of the benefits of living in a bad neighborhood is you're not surprised when

102
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,040
bad shit happens.

103
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,240
These people that live in these, you know, uh, ticky tacky McMansions or whatever, they

104
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,040
get really surprised when bad shit happens, right?

105
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,120
It's the same thing.

106
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,300
So don't, you know, don't be surprised.

107
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,160
But anyway, the container, one of the things that we got into on the early ones is that

108
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,520
the body is a sealed and closed system.

109
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:40,500
It really is mostly, um, nothing ever goes through the body directly.

110
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:47,700
Just like, for example, when you are at a picnic or at the beach years ago and you

111
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,380
had a radio with speakers, because I always hear radio, people always think headphones

112
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:56,420
if you're not 30 or 40 years old and you hear jazz music playing, do you think if you open

113
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:00,880
that radio, there's a little jazz band inside playing it out, it sounds like a ridiculous

114
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,380
analogy.

115
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,540
No one's that stupid, right?

116
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:06,960
Well, then how do you, why do you believe when they tell you things go through the intestine

117
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,280
and absorb that, you know, through the skin, you know, through the intestines, through

118
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,760
tissues in the body, they're completely sealed.

119
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,140
So how does the music play through the radio?

120
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:24,420
By quartz crystal induction, there's a perturbations in the ether, well perturbations merely like

121
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:31,260
a waveform crystal is tuned into that, picks it up and it goes through a series of amplifications.

122
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:35,000
It's exactly how the body works, but it works on a material sense.

123
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,040
Now the reason why it's never discussed how induction works is because if this is taught

124
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:46,160
at a young age, you will literally, I have to say this slowly because people don't really

125
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,600
get it.

126
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,060
And I never had, the reason I'd say slowly is because all the years I've been talking

127
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:54,660
about this and using this principle, no one's really said, Hey, we need to develop it and

128
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,060
talk more about it.

129
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,940
It's amazing to me.

130
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,500
This is the amazing thing.

131
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,500
I'm going to say it very slowly.

132
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,800
If you were taught at a young age, how induction and how the body really creates things and

133
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,740
eliminates things and builds up self and however, whatever function you might consider, if you

134
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:15,740
were taught how that it really works, you will be spending the rest of your life, never

135
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:23,380
feeling there's anything you can't do because it literally compares to magic or superpowers.

136
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,840
If it comes down to it, right?

137
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,980
It's just about putting the right stuff into the right part of the induction system to

138
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,280
create the right reaction.

139
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,960
And that's all there is to it.

140
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:38,140
I mean, look, here, here's the thing that I think really confuses people because we were

141
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,220
taught about digestion and you've been through that and you talked about the intestines,

142
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:45,440
but I think the thing that confuses people is what you take in air though, don't you?

143
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:51,260
So you take in air, you must use the air and it's the same function, but that's the

144
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,040
same by induction.

145
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:52,820
Whether, okay.

146
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,680
Think of the air as being the jazz station, right?

147
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,720
The food is the rock and roll station.

148
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:03,800
The classical music is the light, you know, it's all different tunings, different frequencies

149
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,440
by a material and materials all have different frequencies.

150
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:11,600
There's a Jack Fresco comment that he says, instead of naming the elements, whatever,

151
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,960
why don't we, each element has a specific frequency.

152
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,920
Why don't we just use that number instead of the name of the element?

153
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,900
It's far more specific and it tells you more, gives you information about the element.

154
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,040
Well, you know, beyond just what it should be designated as.

155
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,640
So this is the primer.

156
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:32,299
This is where I always start out, get on the computer or whatever, even you can do this

157
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:41,919
long hand in print, but type in cross section of intestines anatomy and you will see anatomic

158
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,480
drawings.

159
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,700
I've verified them.

160
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,220
I have microscopes and all that.

161
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,720
The cross section looks very accurate, right?

162
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,140
And you will see at least two or three hydrophobic layers.

163
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,900
Hydrophobic layers means that they reject water.

164
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:03,140
Hydrophobic means that, for example, a freshly polished car hood with water on it, well,

165
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,360
the water will bead, which is hydrophobic, means it repels water.

166
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,740
Just like roots of a plant.

167
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,180
Hydrophilic is when it absorbs water, something like a sponge.

168
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:16,240
But here's the interesting thing without going on a tangent.

169
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:22,620
A sponge, usually a natural sponge, a living sponge, as a sea, I was going to say sea vegetable,

170
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:27,720
it's a sea animal, looks like it's hydrophilic, like it absorbs water.

171
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:34,120
But if you look at the structure of the cells of the sponge itself, it's actually hydrophobic.

172
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:40,880
So in other words, if you magnified a very small, tiny piece of sponge inside the cellular,

173
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,620
not the molecular cells, just a very tiny, too small to see by the human eye, but you

174
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,240
can see it under a microscope, put it near a drop of water, it will reject the water.

175
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:49,460
Why?

176
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,240
Because all living things do that.

177
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,940
So let me just go back to the analogy.

178
00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:00,380
Put in the intestines, it doesn't have to be human intestines, but you can, cross section

179
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:00,860
anatomy.

180
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,920
Do a split screen and then do a cross section of a steel belted radial tire or a car tire.

181
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,040
And they look the same.

182
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,540
Why?

183
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,160
Because what is the purpose of a car tire?

184
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:21,420
It's to have a certain pressure, so it performs its function and it separates that pressure

185
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,180
from the environment, doesn't it?

186
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:28,340
And right, so what I mean is the tire is inflated and it's supposed to keep that pressurized

187
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,060
air in order for the tire to perform its function.

188
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,100
When it no longer can perform its function, it equalizes the pressures and right, okay.

189
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,860
So it's flat.

190
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:46,520
So look, do the same thing, cross section of skin, epidermis, and you will see pores

191
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,100
and hair follicles, yada, yada, yada.

192
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:52,100
And start researching the cells and then they actually designate different cells and they're

193
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:52,900
all hydrophobic.

194
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,600
A healthy person, when they come out of the shower, by the way, it's not too hairy.

195
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,680
If they just stand there, they start drip drying, you know, the water starts beating

196
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,020
on the surface of your skin, doesn't it?

197
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:03,480
Yes.

198
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:04,320
Yeah.

199
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,420
Because it's hydrophobic, repels water.

200
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,040
Right.

201
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:11,240
So, so here's the other thing, and I'm not going to make this about being hydrophobic

202
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:16,000
or hydrophilic, but it is a quality that shows the direction of things.

203
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:22,620
You will also see that the skin, interstitial spaces in the cells that they show, interstitial

204
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:29,360
spaces means that they're packed together, just as if you go to the store and buy a loaf

205
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,520
of sliced bread, you notice how it almost doesn't lift a really, you know, fresh loaf or it's

206
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:34,900
packaged.

207
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,180
Well, you can't even see the slices sometimes, right?

208
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,340
Until you start moving it, right?

209
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:38,760
Right.

210
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,360
Because they're packed really tight.

211
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:40,640
Okay.

212
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:45,260
That's exactly how your cells are, but imagine irregular shapes or basically oblong shapes.

213
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,900
That's how swelling happens, by the way, when those spaces disturbed lymphatic fluid flows

214
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,460
into those spaces and you get swelling.

215
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,880
That's why we've gone into the remedies of that, uh, wrapping things tight to prevent

216
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,840
that fluid from going in there and the body doesn't get the signal that you have an injury.

217
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:07,520
So by the way, five times a second, the, the, uh, every cell in the body or group of cells

218
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,680
sends a message to the brain, we're okay.

219
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:16,160
And five times a second, the brain sends a signal to all the cells in the body saying,

220
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:16,920
are you okay?

221
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,340
Right.

222
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:23,220
This is happening at that rate, generally at that rate, five times a second, there's

223
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,200
a correct, a test back and forth check 300 times a minute.

224
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,460
This is going up 300 times a minute.

225
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:29,720
Yeah.

226
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:36,760
Some people, healthy people, uh, more physical, faster, and obviously, you know, less and older,

227
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,420
less healthy, less, but older people slower.

228
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,580
Um, this is not discussed by the way.

229
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:48,100
Also, by the way, blood cells literally have serial numbers on them, not like numeric numbers.

230
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:54,520
But when these idiots, medical idiots are looking at blood slides, they don't know what they're

231
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,400
looking at, by the way.

232
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,520
You know, by the way, blood testing is, is all algorithms now.

233
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,240
It's put in a machine.

234
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:06,620
It kind of reminds me of, um, you go to these, uh, Home Depot, whatever stores now, and you

235
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,960
know, when you wanted a key made, you had a clerk make a key, tested it and everything.

236
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,860
Now you just stick a key in a machine.

237
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,500
It's automatic.

238
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,420
It makes a key automatic.

239
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,200
It doesn't always work also.

240
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:15,540
Right?

241
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,060
No, they kind of automatic key.

242
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,520
The automatic key machines suck.

243
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,140
Yeah.

244
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,980
The blood, the blood testing is similar like that.

245
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,400
You never go, this is protocol to charge you a bunch of money.

246
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,380
Oh, we got to do blood work.

247
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,480
And they do that for animals.

248
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,960
Vets doesn't want to talk to you unless you do blood work and they hear it.

249
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,000
It's all useless.

250
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,440
They don't even know what they're looking at.

251
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:34,480
Okay.

252
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:40,160
So what I want to say is when they look at red blood cells, the morons don't know that

253
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,480
the each blood cell has a designation point.

254
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,780
What do I mean by that?

255
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,880
This red blood cell is for the eye.

256
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,280
This red blood cells for your big toe, right?

257
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,320
This blood cells for the ovary.

258
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,920
This blood's red blood.

259
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:54,560
So all red blood.

260
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,420
They don't see that.

261
00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:01,180
And by the way, if you work in the medical community and you start using this kind of

262
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,960
language, you're going to get fired.

263
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:07,300
Just like, for example, when I used to go, when I learned about the system more than

264
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,940
24 years ago now, I used to go into the bank and mess around and say, these people are

265
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,720
really dumb, aren't they?

266
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,300
Let's prove it.

267
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,240
I had someone with me.

268
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,280
I'd give them a check.

269
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,200
So I'd like to convert this to federal reserve notes.

270
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,260
And the clerk, the bank teller looks at me, uh, just a second.

271
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,040
And she started talking to the manager on the side.

272
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:28,400
And the manager's like, oh my gosh, touches, you know, does the chin scratching thing and

273
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:35,020
tells the bank teller to go on break because the, the, the bank teller doesn't know what

274
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,120
a federal reserve note is, right?

275
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,640
A bank note doesn't know.

276
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:43,020
And then the manager would just come and sit down looking straight forward.

277
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,020
How would you like it?

278
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,420
You know, in twenties, fifties, a hundred, whatever.

279
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,680
And I'd be like, oh my gosh, you know, I'm looking at her and we're both looking at each

280
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,200
other and we're like, yeah, these people are really dumb.

281
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:58,220
So imagine someone who is working with federal reserve notes all day and they don't even

282
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,000
know what they are.

283
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:02,360
If someone asks for one, this is the medical community.

284
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,740
Well, this wasn't always the case though, because when you look at older medical texts

285
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,240
and I've been through a lot of textbooks, you know, that they were supposed to teach

286
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,340
doctors and nurses and different practitioners at different times, right?

287
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,760
Um, they used words like induction in a lot of older medical books.

288
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,300
But not on the internet, you're not going to find it.

289
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:28,320
I've been looking, actually this past, I didn't spend as much as I should have or could have.

290
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:34,120
A few hours is plenty, but look, the status of Google right now and other search engines

291
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,820
that are similar.

292
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:40,140
If you can't figure out that they're hiding stuff or not showing you stuff or it's watered

293
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:44,580
down in like 20 minutes or an hours of research, you're, you're not that bright.

294
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,560
And I was looking around, looking around, nothing.

295
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:54,020
It's funny when you put in a search and it tells you 8 million results, right?

296
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,440
And then you go, okay, you got 30 or 40 results on a page.

297
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,500
You go to page two and you got another 30, 40 results.

298
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,000
You go to page three, page four, page five.

299
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,040
So you're like 200 results.

300
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,620
And then you look up and it says only 500 results left.

301
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,060
Wait a second.

302
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,300
I've only gone through a hundred sites.

303
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,520
How did you go from 8 million to 500 now?

304
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,940
I've only been through like a hundred or 200.

305
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,680
How do we do that?

306
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,480
You ever noticed that?

307
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,080
Have you ever done that?

308
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:20,740
Yeah, absolutely.

309
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,520
I've done that.

310
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,720
Uh, and, and it's, yeah, you keep progressing.

311
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,400
It's 8 million research results.

312
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,300
And someone will give you some excuse.

313
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,000
Oh, the search results mean on words that are in within the document, but not 8 million.

314
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,760
What the hell are they trying to do?

315
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,500
So anyway, you can't find stuff.

316
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,000
The NIH, um, NIH document.

317
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:39,320
Okay.

318
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:45,020
There was a document that I downloaded a long time ago, 900 pages on virology, vaccination,

319
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:45,880
immunology.

320
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:53,900
And the whole thing was about finding the effectiveness all over the world that compiled

321
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,800
all these researches that some were done with a five year, some were done over 20 year periods

322
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,440
on all that's all that subject matter.

323
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,260
And I had some graphics and all that stuff also.

324
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:07,960
So by the time you got to the reading this entire thing, I said, wait a second, let's

325
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,640
go see what the conclusion is.

326
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:14,980
The conclusion clearly stated that this is all inconclusive and we still don't know what

327
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:20,460
the, if there's any primary mechanism, what the, uh, you know, how it's induced or whatever.

328
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,300
All right.

329
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:27,160
So why would you spend, you know, I don't know, a week, two weeks reading this 980 page

330
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,020
document if it's inconclusive in the end, just go right to the conclusion.

331
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:31,780
It's inconclusive.

332
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,340
So, but basically you see what they went through and they went through every possible process

333
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:44,080
that that is known to them to look for causes of disease, immunology, virology, blah, blah,

334
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,960
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

335
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,240
And then you have no conclusion on what causes it.

336
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,920
So you can walk away.

337
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,880
There's no reason to really get into the details.

338
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,320
You can, it's important to have it as a reference manual.

339
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:58,900
So if you're going to quote unquote debate or argue the point, you could bring up the

340
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,700
more critical example set in the text.

341
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,020
Right.

342
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,360
But ultimately the conclusion is thus.

343
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:10,240
That's why it's very often you'll hear me say like, okay, the three letter alphabet

344
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,580
agencies in any country, they're all central bank clerks.

345
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,140
Oh my gosh.

346
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:13,840
How'd you get that?

347
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,300
I don't see it.

348
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,860
You start researching how the central banks have infiltrated and taken over.

349
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,140
You'll see.

350
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:18,920
Yep, exactly.

351
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,880
After about a year's worth of research.

352
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,160
Right.

353
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,640
There's also people that work in there.

354
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:29,240
It's like JP Morgan said, there's two reasons why people in organizations do things.

355
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,160
First is the reasonable, logical, good reason that you tell everyone.

356
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,660
And then the second is the real reason.

357
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,060
Right?

358
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:45,300
So the reason why the first logical reason with the three letter agencies is that we

359
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,020
need controls.

360
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,960
We need regulation to protect the population.

361
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,360
That sounds good.

362
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:49,720
Right.

363
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,500
But the real reason is so the central banks have controls of all those things.

364
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:53,780
Right.

365
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,700
And that's basically what you end up with.

366
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:59,140
We're here to protect you from the irresponsible actors out there.

367
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,340
Which happen to be them.

368
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,540
Which happen to be them.

369
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,020
To be them.

370
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,340
Right.

371
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:02,860
Exactly.

372
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,880
This is a repeat over and over.

373
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,140
So let's go back to what we were discussing.

374
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,100
The community, meaning not only the people that, okay, you have people that have their

375
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,480
quote unquote jobs or yobs, either one.

376
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,080
I think we've discussed the difference between a job and a yob.

377
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:25,220
And they have their interests.

378
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,040
They have their families to take care of.

379
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,980
And let's say, you know, it takes up most of your day.

380
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:34,740
And you're not the type that comes home and watches four hours of TV, but you're interested

381
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:39,900
in astrophysics or you're interested in the biology or medicine or miniature trains or

382
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,220
whatever.

383
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:40,820
Right.

384
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,820
You're going to look at people that do that as you're going to say, well, I'm interested

385
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:50,060
in astronomy, so I'm going to go read what the astrophysicists write about.

386
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:50,420
Right.

387
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,640
So because I have to trust them.

388
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,820
You know, I don't have the time to do what they write.

389
00:19:54,420 --> 00:20:00,380
So what happens is you end up repeating the junk that they have learned and they're not

390
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,880
smart enough to realize they're being fooled.

391
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,020
Actually, a lot of them are and they leave.

392
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,100
And now this is how you keep, what do you call it?

393
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,300
Dog chasing its tail.

394
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,320
What do you call a situation you can't get out of?

395
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,000
Catch 22, whatever.

396
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:13,420
Right.

397
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,060
Right.

398
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,940
So, again, this is how the medical system is.

399
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,360
And they've brought it up to a level where you can't question it just like priesthood

400
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,380
of some sort.

401
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,440
I say, why bother question it?

402
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,780
Because here's the thing, right?

403
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,380
What it sounds like you're saying to me-

404
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,480
Just reject it unless you're dying.

405
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,460
Even then.

406
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,180
Let it go.

407
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,460
And now let's get back to the real thing here, which is, again, you're saying it's a closed

408
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:35,920
system.

409
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:36,420
The body.

410
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,500
Let's go back to the without the changes, because this is very, this is very, very important

411
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:46,520
because it's more important to discuss other things along with the container, how it works,

412
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:51,520
like the things we are, because it's such a drastic deviation from what the programming,

413
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,320
the culture, recent culture, you know, 150 years.

414
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,780
Well, the culture has been all kinds of teaching.

415
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,920
All kinds of constructs.

416
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,140
It's all BS.

417
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,660
It's all central banking stuff.

418
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,200
Around it.

419
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,200
But the central banks are not the base, you know, there's stuff beyond that too.

420
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,740
But it's a spiritual decline, you know, the way I want to call it, right?

421
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:10,820
It's cosmic.

422
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,780
It's a cosmic thing, it's a spiritual thing, and it's an attack, and it's a constant hindrance,

423
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,900
and all of that.

424
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,260
But back to the container itself.

425
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:24,380
It sounds to me like there are a bunch of subsystems here, which are contained in the

426
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:24,520
singular system.

427
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,080
Just like in a radio.

428
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,320
And yeah, just like you said.

429
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:33,480
Or anything that hasn't, all of the devices that you have today work by this same principle.

430
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,060
There you go.

431
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:37,940
The speakers in the wiring in a radio, they have a purpose, and their purpose is not to

432
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,640
receive stuff.

433
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,540
Their purpose is to then put it back out for you to hear it, right?

434
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,180
Okay.

435
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,960
Yeah, let's just get into something that I haven't gotten to before.

436
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,380
One of the main purposes of the different systems is scale.

437
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,640
Scale meaning size.

438
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:59,140
So if you were to be much larger physically, 20, 30 feet tall instead of the average height

439
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:04,460
of a human, or you were to be one inch tall or two inches tall, certain systems would

440
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,240
be very different.

441
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:12,260
The scale adapts to the energies based on the mass principle, the physical size and

442
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:18,640
things on this planet, on this earth, however you want to view the earth, this domain, this

443
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,620
realm that we live in.

444
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:25,820
And one of the ways you can start looking at this is the differences between men and

445
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,960
women physiologically.

446
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,840
And we're not talking just the reproductive organs.

447
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:38,160
For example, when you have a man and a woman in a room, the women tend to prefer the room

448
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,240
to be a little warmer than the man, usually.

449
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:41,540
Why?

450
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,320
Well, proportionately, let's say the man and the woman are the same weight and the same

451
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:46,680
height.

452
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,000
Until they get to a certain age, yeah, they generally prefer.

453
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,120
The man's liver is larger.

454
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:57,200
So one hundred and fifty pound, five foot eight man compared to one hundred and fifty

455
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,700
pound, five foot eight woman.

456
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:05,800
The liver in the male would be larger than the liver in the woman, right?

457
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:14,560
So you have certain organs that take precedent in size and scale within the body based on

458
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,500
what we're supposed to be doing, right?

459
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:23,000
Think about, you know, there's a certain amount of some some medical side.

460
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,160
This is not really discussed.

461
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,120
Have you heard this before?

462
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,320
No, I haven't.

463
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,160
Equal proportion.

464
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,660
The proportion of the liver is larger in a man, right?

465
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,680
No, I've never heard that before.

466
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,080
Yeah.

467
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:38,580
You will start going and seeing things similar to this with various organs that are not discussed

468
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,460
because it has to do with doing whatever job you're doing.

469
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,940
Typically, the male would be more active.

470
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:48,400
A lot of what some stuff that was written about this is that, well, the liver is larger

471
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,300
because of because of testosterone, right?

472
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,900
And that there's no proof of that.

473
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:54,740
Right.

474
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,160
There was no relation to that.

475
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,620
I once saw a study that said that women would be better astronauts because they more efficiently

476
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,740
utilize water than men do.

477
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,040
And there were a bunch of reasons for that.

478
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,120
Is that does that have something to do with this as well?

479
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:12,600
What makes a good astronaut is that people believe that there is such a thing.

480
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:17,540
No, but what I'm saying is to be away from the earth for a long time to conserve water

481
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:21,860
and like a woman would use less water to survive is what the idea was in this study that they

482
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,080
did.

483
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,860
You could go.

484
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,500
Here's the other thing we'll get into.

485
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:30,620
I haven't been there to maybe I have, but I don't recall the further you get away from

486
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:34,640
the earth and what you call if you look up and you don't see a blue sky meaning during

487
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:40,480
the day, the less you can control your sanity, you will get to the point where you will start

488
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,160
to see things that you will not function.

489
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,940
I mean, not like DMT, but it's just you will not be able to function.

490
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,240
In other words, it's all mental.

491
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,480
It's all mental.

492
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:55,240
So, OK, well, if you don't believe that, look into when they when they put people in isolation

493
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,520
in incarceration.

494
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:03,280
I mean, when when you're in, you know, when you're I'm the wrong person to talk about that

495
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:08,220
because there's people that have spent months and months and even years in caves alone and

496
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,180
they're in total bliss.

497
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,860
Yeah, but I are.

498
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,280
So I might be one of those.

499
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:16,480
I'm you know, I'm if I don't see another human ever again, I'm I'm fine.

500
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,180
Well, a lot of people when they're forced into isolation.

501
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:19,840
OK.

502
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:20,300
Right.

503
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,280
But that's because.

504
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:21,940
Yeah.

505
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:22,440
Yeah.

506
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,920
That's because of programming.

507
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,680
And that's because the individual just like the liver is larger.

508
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:26,940
Right.

509
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,820
So there's a there's a there's a I don't want to be like Jimmy the Greek.

510
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,400
He said something that got him in trouble.

511
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:34,820
Remember?

512
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:35,560
Yeah.

513
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,260
Well, yeah.

514
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:36,680
OK.

515
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,380
So, yeah.

516
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,040
So I don't think it's across that line, but I think it's more individual.

517
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,940
There's some people that must be around like you don't have to be antisocial.

518
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:45,200
This.

519
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:45,520
OK.

520
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,980
The real gurus, the real people that you hear about that go into isolation.

521
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:50,560
Yeah.

522
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,160
You never hear about them.

523
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:52,640
You know why?

524
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,540
Because they're in isolation.

525
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,060
Right.

526
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:58,620
The ones that you hear about are the ones that are going batshit crazy.

527
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,820
You know why?

528
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,960
Because they're batshit crazy.

529
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,380
Not rip from go.

530
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,140
You see what I mean?

531
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:04,740
Oh, yeah.

532
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:04,940
Yeah.

533
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:10,220
People that people that are quiet and conduct and conduct themselves in an impeccable manner

534
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,760
where it never get any attention.

535
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:15,900
Well, most times it seems to me like people just amplify what they already had.

536
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:16,220
Yeah.

537
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,640
So like this.

538
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:18,000
Right.

539
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,800
So anyway.

540
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,900
OK, let's get back to the body.

541
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:21,260
Sure.

542
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,500
There's the scale concept.

543
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:22,780
OK.

544
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,940
The other thing is go back to the induction.

545
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,600
How does it work?

546
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,080
This is just imagine a process.

547
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:30,400
OK.

548
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,300
You have a lot of this law of attraction, all these gurus.

549
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:37,520
You just imagine something and it comes, which is true, like Nisha and Daikon in Buddhism,

550
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,800
where you chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.

551
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:46,660
And it's basically if you want something physical, there's like a swan or one of those other

552
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,620
birds that are not swans.

553
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,580
They have long legs and they fly cranes.

554
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:51,960
Crane.

555
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,040
Yeah.

556
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,540
And Tina Turner.

557
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:58,240
Most people Westerners find out about it because she's like, I want a red Corvette.

558
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,020
I want a red Corvette.

559
00:26:59,100 --> 00:26:59,900
I want a red Corvette.

560
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,840
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.

561
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,520
And you end up getting a red Corvette.

562
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:02,780
Right.

563
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,000
This is for a lot of people.

564
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,560
It kind of works.

565
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,340
OK.

566
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:13,060
Regarding to the body, the chant for the body or the mind idea is that everything is energy

567
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:13,520
and energy.

568
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,340
You can just use the simple academic term of what energy is.

569
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,520
Then it's then it starts to become a plasma for a very, very short period of time.

570
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,980
And then it appears to be a gas.

571
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:30,700
And I mean a gas just like a gas that could be odorless, colorless or may have an odor.

572
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,620
And then it becomes a liquid.

573
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,720
You could pick your choice of liquid because there are liquids in the body that are dark

574
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,040
purple.

575
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:37,960
Right.

576
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,380
And red and clear.

577
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:44,700
And then it becomes a gelatinous soft tissue and then it goes to a solid like teeth or

578
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,320
hair, chitin, bone.

579
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,020
This is the frequency change.

580
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:55,460
Not necessarily frequency as in radio waves, but in other words, the frequency of how it

581
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,120
goes from one thing to the next to the next.

582
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:02,880
So and I've discussed this with a neurosurgeon and he said he didn't know about something

583
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,480
as simple as this.

584
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,780
He started observing it and came back.

585
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:10,860
So, yes, exactly what's happening when you have a wound, let's say a cut, you know, a

586
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:14,940
quarter inch deep in your skin, something that you have to mind, not like a paper cut

587
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:18,380
or a scratch when you're working construction and you're like, oh, I'll just I don't have

588
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,080
to worry about that.

589
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:19,240
Right.

590
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,880
But something that you really have to mind for a little bit.

591
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:26,820
OK, so it doesn't get infected or if you don't tighten it, it bleeds a lot.

592
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,740
Kind of thing like that.

593
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:33,080
If you watch a wound like that, first thing you're going to see once the bleeding stops

594
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:39,800
and you close the wound, there's going to be a light colored fluid coming through.

595
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:45,560
But prior to that, you're going to feel a tingling sensation depends if it's sore or

596
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,360
inflamed.

597
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:47,740
Right.

598
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:52,300
So that tingling sensation is the gaseous atmosphere forming around the wound.

599
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:58,740
And then that becomes a liquid of that's what scabs are made of, blood and other things,

600
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,540
you know, it's dry on there and yeah, yeah.

601
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,940
And then that becomes a soft gelatinous material, almost like a pure white.

602
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,100
You could see through it.

603
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,080
And then it starts to become skin.

604
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:10,760
Right.

605
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,580
And that is the process.

606
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:19,780
And it always goes from an energetic to a plasma, which is an energy sort of they call it another

607
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,600
state of matter.

608
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:28,900
Let's just say, oh, boy, in manufacturing, when you're making anything like a food product,

609
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,960
you know, you get the raw materials distributed and they start getting mixed up and then they

610
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,720
form doughnuts.

611
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:34,700
Right.

612
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:39,780
And then they fry the doughnuts and they get packaged system very similar like that.

613
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:42,280
The raw material for the human body is energetic.

614
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:43,980
Right.

615
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:49,780
And the energetic gets organized, just like you have a power, let's say, cable coming

616
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,060
in and it energizes a fan, a light or whatever.

617
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,640
That would be the plasma.

618
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,700
And when it energizes a fan or a light or whatever the purpose of that is, would be

619
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,260
the gas.

620
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,740
You see, there's an analogous.

621
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,220
So what you why is this important when you're dealing with the human body?

622
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,520
Because you know, you know, the stages that it goes through, just like if you want to

623
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:12,140
open a doughnut factory, you got to have the flour delivered, you got to have the oil delivered.

624
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:12,440
Right.

625
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:17,380
How are you going to handle those deliveries and process them into final to doughnuts?

626
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:23,620
So when you have a wound or don't have a wound and the body is growing or recovering, do you

627
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,440
understand that it's energetic first?

628
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,720
That's why the quality of the food is very important.

629
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:34,140
The energetic part of the food, the component, which I saw in the chat, let me just digress

630
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,080
a little bit.

631
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:42,320
The fine energies, for example, there's something called homeopathy, placebo aside, the purpose

632
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:47,340
of homeopathy is to put the energy of something into a substrate like sugar.

633
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:52,700
And when you take that substrate, it has the absence of the material that's supposed to

634
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,520
have the remedy, just the energy of it.

635
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,700
But it's called a preparation.

636
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:56,760
Right.

637
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,580
So there's actually nothing that's a lot of Westerners like, well, it doesn't work because

638
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,220
there's nothing in it.

639
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,500
It says it has this particular herbal extract, but it has doesn't have any of it in it.

640
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,240
Well, it goes in angstroms.

641
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:08,440
Right.

642
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,820
They keep reducing it.

643
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,060
Right.

644
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:10,960
So it's like you put a drop.

645
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,980
Let's say you're going to do an herbal texture of THC homeopathically.

646
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:18,900
So you get a drop of THC and you put it in a fifty five gallon barrel of water, just one

647
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,080
drop of THC in a fifty five gallon barrel of water.

648
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:21,360
Right.

649
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,580
Then you prepare that fifty gallon bottle of water.

650
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,640
They usually put rubber pads on it and hammer on it.

651
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:26,800
Right.

652
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:27,460
So vibrate it.

653
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:28,480
OK.

654
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:28,780
OK.

655
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:34,600
And they certain processes few days and then they take one drop out of that fifty five

656
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,820
gallon barrel of water.

657
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,560
So they only have one drop of THC in it.

658
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:38,840
Right.

659
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:46,580
I put it in four or five other fifty five gallon barrel of drugs and they prepare those and

660
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:49,240
then they take one drop out of each one and put it in even larger.

661
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:52,300
So it's like, oh, my gosh, the reduction is like millions of times, right?

662
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:52,700
Less.

663
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,680
But it has the effect of THC.

664
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,040
You see.

665
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,100
OK.

666
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:03,280
So if it's something that is so subtle and it works, homeopathic stuff works.

667
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:09,920
One of the most effective anti-toxin, anti-venom preparations you can take are homeopathics,

668
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:10,960
by the way.

669
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,640
It's and it works better than chelation for some.

670
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:18,160
That's another discussion because we can go into specific things and have a hundred episodes

671
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,780
just on biology and how to treat things.

672
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:21,280
Right.

673
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,180
Right.

674
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,900
So it's not necessary because you should be doing this on your own once you have the basics.

675
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:26,280
Right.

676
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,400
This is the fundamental stuff.

677
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,660
So give me an example.

678
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:33,580
When you have wonderful organic vegetables that are very healthful and they go into a

679
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:40,480
diesel truck with a refrigeration system that uses compressed freon, let's say, right, or

680
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,860
refrigerant, which is a very volatile.

681
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,260
Sometimes it's not system.

682
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,760
Do you think the diesel tank?

683
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,640
How far away is the diesel tank in the exhaust pipe and the engine from the cabbage that's

684
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,440
being transported by 10, 20 feet, 50 feet?

685
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,220
If you've got cabbage on the end door and the exhaust, the engines on the other side

686
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:05,180
of the trailer, maybe 50 feet away, I think 5, 10, 5, 10, 15 is your maximum probably

687
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:05,620
any given.

688
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:05,960
Yeah.

689
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,220
Right.

690
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:06,520
Okay.

691
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,940
And it's sitting there for how long?

692
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,740
And it's vibrating going down just like they make homeopathic remedies, right?

693
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,580
That's to be vibrated.

694
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,500
Not just sitting there.

695
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:14,800
Right.

696
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,980
But if you're ahead of cabbage in a truck, diesel truck going down the road, you feel

697
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:19,580
any vibration?

698
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,100
Hell yeah.

699
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:26,680
So all this vegetables that are transported by diesel trucks or locomotives or however,

700
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:28,180
Right.

701
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,120
It's they're preparing this for me.

702
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:30,900
It's got.

703
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:31,200
Right.

704
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,060
So anyway, very interesting.

705
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:37,360
That's why even people that eat really healthy food, here's something.

706
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,540
Oh, I don't know.

707
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,660
There were health foods since the 1970s and they got a certain cancer and you'll notice

708
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:45,060
that's the same cancer that people that work with petroleum get.

709
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,260
How could that be possible?

710
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:52,300
Because they basically got eight, mostly veggies that were transported.

711
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:58,280
They didn't have their own garden, for example, or if you have a local garden, it's probably

712
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,720
never going to be in a diesel truck.

713
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,280
Is it?

714
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:00,620
Right.

715
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:01,560
Yeah.

716
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,360
Local meaning.

717
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,060
I don't know.

718
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,460
20 minute walk.

719
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,220
Half hour walk.

720
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,080
Right.

721
00:34:07,139 --> 00:34:07,380
Okay.

722
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:08,679
So if you're in, you're right.

723
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:09,760
You know, half hour walk.

724
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:09,980
Yeah.

725
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,780
Half hour walk.

726
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,199
You cover about a mile and a half comfortably.

727
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,500
I was going to say mile, you know, mile, two mile and a half.

728
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:15,880
Yeah, sure.

729
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:16,199
Yeah.

730
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:16,840
Comfortably.

731
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:17,719
All right.

732
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,960
So what's, you see how it works?

733
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,659
Very, very simple.

734
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:21,659
This is so simple.

735
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,699
You know, like people that were ill, what do I do?

736
00:34:24,739 --> 00:34:26,699
I said, well, okay, let's just get to the end of it.

737
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,040
If you want to get better, you're going to have to live in a straw hut with a mud floor.

738
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:31,219
How's that?

739
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:37,699
And then anything that's not that or deviating from that is how harder it is going to be

740
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:38,239
to heal.

741
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:39,760
Right.

742
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:40,260
Okay.

743
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:46,639
So if we go back to the body and the sections where it's energetic, we got into the yin

744
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:51,440
and yang and previous episodes, how certain energetics and food, the left side of the

745
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,860
body, the energies exit the body.

746
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,860
They want to go down.

747
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,640
And on the right side of the body, the energies go up.

748
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,080
I know someone, John Butts recently passed away by the way of natural action technologies.

749
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,000
I was working with him.

750
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,100
He died at 49 when he was in his 50th year.

751
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:11,760
Anyway, he worked as a nuclear technician on a naval submarine.

752
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:15,420
He was like the number one or number two guy, depending on how drunk the number one guy

753
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:15,720
was.

754
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:16,460
Okay.

755
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:21,200
And it was kind of those weird, one of those weird ships where the captain of the ship

756
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,540
shot his wife and then shot himself kind of like you, who the hell knows what's going

757
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,240
on in these things.

758
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:26,500
Right.

759
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:26,940
Yeah.

760
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,960
So he was around the reactor and he did all this kind of stuff with water, of course.

761
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,280
And I've known him, we speak and speaking for over a year.

762
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:43,160
And because of the radiation toxification that his body was still dealing with, kind

763
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:46,740
of a hard head, though, he wouldn't do any of the remedies I suggested, but it was interesting

764
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,280
to see that if you would.

765
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,200
But he didn't.

766
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,900
He would say, you know, he went into the car and he felt something on his ear and he squeezed

767
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,980
it and it just all this liquid came out.

768
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:55,820
It sounds kind of gross.

769
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,660
I said, oh, yeah, it was your right side, right?

770
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,240
It was your right ear.

771
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:58,540
Right.

772
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,580
And he's like, yeah.

773
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,540
I'm like, yeah.

774
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,080
How do you know?

775
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,160
Well, the right side is radiation.

776
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:04,760
Yes.

777
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,540
It goes up.

778
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:06,540
Right.

779
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:07,300
Right.

780
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,700
If it was a toxification like a salt or from animal protein, it would be the left side

781
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,180
and down.

782
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:16,500
So every time he mentioned he had an ailment or something, I said, oh, yeah, it felt like

783
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,900
this and it was on this side of the body.

784
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,420
He's like, yeah, exactly.

785
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:20,840
What the hell?

786
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,460
You know, I'm like, this is simple stuff.

787
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:23,960
This is simple.

788
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:27,780
I mean, once you start applying this, right, but you have to have more information.

789
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:34,600
If he just said, well, I squeezed my ear and all this liquid came out my earlobe, I would

790
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,600
and I didn't know he worked with radiation.

791
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,260
I wouldn't be able to determine which side it would be, you see?

792
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:40,620
Okay.

793
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:48,180
So, but let's say he ran Jojo's barbecue pit in South Carolina, right?

794
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,400
And he said he squeezed his earlobe and all this liquid came out.

795
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,340
So that was your left ear, dude.

796
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:51,560
Right?

797
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,840
He's like, yeah, that's my left ear.

798
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:54,780
How do you know?

799
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,580
Anyway, these are these things.

800
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,060
That's why I keep saying these things with the yin and yang over and over.

801
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:05,020
But the problem with yin and yang discussing it with the body is it's constantly flipping.

802
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:09,480
When one thing is yin, it has a yang manifestation towards it to make balance.

803
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:13,700
And then that yang manifestation then wants to go back to being yin, right?

804
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,220
So it's kind of one of these things that's very difficult to grasp and there's very little

805
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:21,500
into good tutorial online, but we'll get into it again.

806
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:25,700
So the left side of the body, when you have manifestations on the left side of your body,

807
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:28,060
it's the body doing one of two things.

808
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:34,360
You have too much energy going down or the body's creating a block to prevent too much

809
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,660
energy from going down because it'll create other harm.

810
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,200
Well, is it unfair to say that anything that is hard is trying to get soft and anything

811
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,880
that's soft is trying to get hard?

812
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,460
I mean, that's pretty much seeking.

813
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,880
It's seeking that, but it may not achieve it.

814
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,300
Right.

815
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,240
It's hinting you all the time.

816
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:49,500
OK.

817
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:50,380
Yeah.

818
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,800
So the body has its.

819
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:55,120
Oh, by the way, another thing, there's a therapist that I know we had a discussion with someone

820
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:55,540
else.

821
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,020
Yeah.

822
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:59,800
And I said, the body has a mind of its own and he's like, you're the only other person

823
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:03,160
I've heard say that this person is doing physical therapy for 40 years.

824
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,620
I said, well, yeah, give me an example.

825
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:13,680
The body has an innate mind of its own where, well, OK, when I say mind, it's not the brain

826
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,340
either for you or the body.

827
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:15,720
Right.

828
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,840
It's a culmination.

829
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:21,420
The whole effect of the whole thing to a medicine is the medical community, scientific community

830
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:21,760
is doing.

831
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,620
It's hard to efficiently explain what each thing does, but efficient explanations of each

832
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:29,500
part of the body does not mean an efficient explanation of the whole.

833
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:30,620
Right.

834
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,260
Right.

835
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:40,000
So basically, the mind's body, an example of it would be someone who wants to commit

836
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,660
suicide because their mind is so much at the end of the line.

837
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:50,980
They want to go drown themselves and they type concrete blocks or lead or whatever while

838
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:51,560
they're drowning.

839
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,060
The body is saying, I don't want to drown.

840
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,660
I don't care if you're depressed or not.

841
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,720
I don't want to drown.

842
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:58,940
Right.

843
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,180
And there's this fight.

844
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:00,660
Right.

845
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,140
Internally.

846
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:02,860
Right.

847
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,960
Let's say that's why, you know, blowing, you know, using a shotgun or something is usually,

848
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:10,020
you know, a gun is usually one of the better things.

849
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,660
People that hang themselves while they're hanging their bodies, I don't want to die.

850
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,460
I don't want to die.

851
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:14,920
Right.

852
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:20,040
I mean, there's people that do want to kill themselves so bad, they actually take a hammer

853
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:26,000
and a knife and hammer the knife into their chest and halfway before it breaches the sternum,

854
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:30,960
they call 911 ambulance for help because the body overcame is the way you do it.

855
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:31,540
This is stupid.

856
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,140
I don't care if you're depressed or not.

857
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,360
I don't care if you want to kill yourself.

858
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,400
I don't want to die.

859
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,560
Well, the inverse can work as well, even though you want to live, you want to live like a

860
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,260
lot of people do toward the end of the line.

861
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,460
Thank you for bringing that up.

862
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:42,620
Yeah.

863
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:45,220
If the body's mind decides it's time to go, it's time to go.

864
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:45,940
Yeah.

865
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:49,220
You just, you know, it's one of those things where it's like, I don't know, they seem great,

866
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,520
but something just the body just said no.

867
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,200
And that was it.

868
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,520
Well, it depends on how they seem.

869
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:53,760
Great.

870
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,260
We've gotten to that before, because the last thing to leave is the same great feeling.

871
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:57,880
Right.

872
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:58,520
Right.

873
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,660
So the young.

874
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:00,300
So.

875
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,920
So there's aspects to that also.

876
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,040
So is it simply here?

877
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,220
Would you do a sonic like this?

878
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:13,940
The easiest thing to do because of the audience's propensity to be in a certain culture and

879
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:19,720
the programming that we all have and had, let's say, plural past tense is that it's

880
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,740
all material, something you can draw on a piece of paper and something you can explain

881
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:24,740
as a basic function.

882
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:28,140
No, it's not like that, but it is generally.

883
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:33,940
But if you think that's all there is, you're going to negate the overall function of the

884
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,480
thing, which is a completely different thing.

885
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:39,800
So in other words, if we're let's say we're going to have an episode and discuss a specific

886
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,160
organ of the body, the eye.

887
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:41,900
Right.

888
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:42,740
And you have to pick.

889
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,700
Do you want to talk about the left eye or the right eye?

890
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,560
Very specific.

891
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:51,540
In ancient Egypt, there's evidence that when there was two ophthalmologists, one for the

892
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,820
left eye, one for the right eye.

893
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,760
Oh, of course, because they had a surplus of eye doctors.

894
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,020
Right.

895
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,980
No, because the left eye is connected to a certain group of organs and the right eye

896
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,800
is connected to a different group of organs.

897
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,820
You see the same with the ear.

898
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,420
Same with the mouth.

899
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,380
Upper teeth.

900
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,040
Copper quadrant.

901
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,060
Lower quadrant.

902
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:09,420
Right.

903
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,640
Because left or right.

904
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,760
Because most people's eyes act in concert with each other and they do triangulate things.

905
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:18,720
There's a calculation there where you determine depth and distance.

906
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,200
That is the way most people's eyes work.

907
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,500
If both of their eyes are indeed functional.

908
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,240
Except for if you're a bird.

909
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:36,020
In most birds, prey birds, the right eye is for flight, navigation, and the left eye is

910
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:39,460
for foraging, pecking, food, the young.

911
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,540
It's a split screen.

912
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:46,480
Yeah, well perhaps I was a bird in another life because I got to tell you, my left and

913
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,480
right eye don't match.

914
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:48,980
They do not match.

915
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,380
I can only use one at a time, in fact.

916
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:52,720
Oh, okay, yeah.

917
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,940
Maybe you got the bird in this lifetime.

918
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,940
I have an odd configuration there as part of my situation.

919
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:04,220
But no one has ever been able to solve that.

920
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,300
Why it is that they act independently.

921
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,700
Well, it may not be neat solving.

922
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:13,540
Very often problems end up being a plus, right?

923
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:15,940
In many.

924
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,280
I don't have to give any examples.

925
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:21,520
Most of the most creative and advanced things we have in this world, including creative

926
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:27,840
people and whatever, are people that had challenges that initially would be considered non-conformist

927
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,780
and need to be solved.

928
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,220
But they ended up, right, being.

929
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:36,700
The common stories of many of the so-called recognized geniuses being dyslexic and things

930
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:37,160
like this.

931
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,320
Yeah, obviously.

932
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:38,760
Right.

933
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:43,200
The thing that appears to be a hindrance can actually be turned into something that is

934
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,600
an inspiration or a motivation to examine things from a different point of view.

935
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,040
Like for instance.

936
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:52,680
Well, you have to realize that genius is a limitation, like what's the difference between

937
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,820
genius and stupidity?

938
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,680
Genius has limits.

939
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:56,840
There you go.

940
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:57,820
Right.

941
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:58,120
Okay.

942
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:58,860
So, but anyway.

943
00:42:59,040 --> 00:42:59,200
Yep.

944
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,220
Like odd thing, right?

945
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,480
I got this terrible eyesight.

946
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:01,820
Sure.

947
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:02,560
But you know what?

948
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,560
Whenever you need to find something in the house that's lost or whatever, guess who finds

949
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:06,700
it?

950
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:06,920
Me.

951
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,100
Well, yeah.

952
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:14,700
You're not filtering out the rest of the things that you used to find people or other people

953
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:19,020
are relying on their eyes, which actually acts as an omission for all their other faculties.

954
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:19,400
Right.

955
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,260
Exactly.

956
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,920
So there you go.

957
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:27,320
Because I have to utilize other things, I have a different way of accounting for things.

958
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:27,880
Yeah.

959
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,040
Now imagine, yeah.

960
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:33,100
Because when you're taught as a child that your ears are for listening, right?

961
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,500
Not the bottoms of your feet, right?

962
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,200
Or your hands or whatever.

963
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,580
You will always rely on your ears.

964
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:45,340
Where someone who is sensitive enough and didn't get that instruction, if he's in a

965
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:49,640
room with people, in order to listen carefully, something in the distance, they'll put the

966
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:54,600
both palms of their hands on the wall or the floor to pick up also, right?

967
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,200
Besides their ears.

968
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,360
I'll give you a very practical application for that.

969
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:59,240
Crossing the street.

970
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:02,880
Again, I have terrible eyesight, can't see the car from a distance, this and that.

971
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:07,780
Tell you what I can do though, is feel with my feet if a car is close or not.

972
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:08,100
Sure.

973
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:08,800
Exactly.

974
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:10,140
Yeah.

975
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,000
Yeah.

976
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:16,780
So basically we've been trained, the more training you have, just like what is the definition

977
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:17,520
of a professional?

978
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,080
It's someone who is learning more and more about less and less.

979
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:26,160
Like I've worked with people in the engineering field and physicists, physicists, I usually

980
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:30,320
spell them F-I-Z-Z-Y-S-T-S-S-C-Y-S-T.

981
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:37,040
Not one of them, with the scalerator and the water for the past year, these are people

982
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,100
active in the field as physicists and engineers.

983
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:45,000
Not one of them, even frequent discussions, frequent discussions, hours long, frequently

984
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:50,040
came up with one suggestion or one recommendation of what was going on.

985
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:53,780
With all of their background, they couldn't, and all they did, kept doing was asking me

986
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:56,720
the same questions over and over and over, real dumb questions too.

987
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,700
Stuff that we had gone over, it's almost as if there's not even, they're not even real.

988
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,820
They're like some kind of manifestation.

989
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:10,440
Anyway, let's just stop on this one here and we'll do one more if there's any comments on

990
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:14,680
this one because I said we would maybe be more adherent to what we did on the container

991
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:20,740
on O and G, but I just wanted to stress again, just like the last time we spoke on the

992
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:25,160
container, I just talked about cabbage and burdock or basically thistle and the cabbage greens.

993
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:32,100
The reason I did that is very simple, is that in order to be able to diagnose and think clearly,

994
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:35,920
you must be in a good state of mind and good state of health to do so.

995
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,920
Remember, there's no such thing as health, it's only fitness.

996
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,920
When someone says, are you healthy for what?

997
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:46,080
Climbing Mount Everest, doing deep sea diving or sitting at an office?

998
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,280
It depends on what you're going to do.

999
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:48,220
There is no health.

1000
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:53,640
General health may be idea that you're not suffering or in pain or don't look, right?

1001
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,520
You fit within a certain parameter of look, right?

1002
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,740
But there is no health specifically when you're operating on a higher level.

1003
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:01,620
It's fitness.

1004
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,520
What kind of fitness do you want to do what?

1005
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,040
Well, it's preparation for what it is you're going to do.

1006
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:07,420
I mean-

1007
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:08,280
It's just fitness, yeah.

1008
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,440
Are you fit for climbing Mount Everest or doing deep sea diving?

1009
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,300
Or are you fit for sitting in an office chair?

1010
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:14,140
And that's fine.

1011
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:18,380
Well, are you fit to be able to just get through your day without falling asleep?

1012
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:19,820
Or are you fit to be-

1013
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:21,860
Yeah, there's a level of fitness, not health.

1014
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:27,120
For example, if someone ever says, well, sitting in an office chair eight hours a day for 20 years,

1015
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:27,960
you're going to get sick.

1016
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,780
No, it's not true.

1017
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,920
There are ways to balance that, right?

1018
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,680
You have to eat food that's well cooked and blah, blah, blah.

1019
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:39,940
Yeah, just like, for example, if your UPS driver is basically like jogging all day,

1020
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:40,300
right?

1021
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:42,120
Lifting heavy weights, you're going to be healthy.

1022
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:42,780
Not true.

1023
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:47,600
If you're not eating the foods to balance that, you have to eat more raw food if you're more active.

1024
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:52,080
And we've gone over this in the older container stuff, right?

1025
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,220
We've gone over many, many direct points.

1026
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:57,080
So I just want to say where we are now.

1027
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:57,780
It's been almost, what?

1028
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:01,440
More than 10, about, I want to say 10, about nine years since that.

1029
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:08,220
I think you could find it on the site, ONG on the Patreon site, access to the second,

1030
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:11,280
the container, ONG, the original ONG.

1031
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:15,760
Listen to that and supplement it with this one and the last one that we did recently.

1032
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:20,420
Because you cannot, so that, back to what I wanted to say, the reason I talked about

1033
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:25,980
cabbage and burdock, but basically thistle roots, is because in order to diagnose and

1034
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:29,820
think clearly, you must be in fit to do so, right?

1035
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:35,820
Just like, for example, it was very common back in the 70s that in a business meeting,

1036
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:41,920
when this, how food relates to mind, certain, like an advertising agency would take a client

1037
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,820
out and they wanted to have an upper hand, you know, for lunch or dinner.

1038
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:49,620
Everyone in the advertising agency would order a vegetable dish and they made sure that

1039
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:51,960
the client only ordered heavy meat dishes.

1040
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:57,260
Like the clients, the opposition, let's say, or the ones they wanted to take advantage of

1041
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:58,640
was eating dead animal flesh.

1042
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:03,720
And those that wanted to stay on top were eating vibrant vegetables.

1043
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:05,040
Think, right?

1044
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:06,760
And this worked very often.

1045
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,060
Yeah, the steak versus the salad.

1046
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,440
The steak versus the salad.

1047
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,640
The person who ate the salad would be a lot more awake, limber.

1048
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:19,780
Alert and more prone to seem taken upper hand of the situation.

1049
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,400
The, no matter what it was, whether it was emotional,

1050
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:28,520
you know, calculative, financial, rational, whatever, creative.

1051
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:37,200
So if you partake in thinking about the things about the body, let's say to help yourself

1052
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:42,900
or help others, you must start getting on a clean food, veg based.

1053
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:49,460
Now I've gone over in the past, if you eat McDonald's every day or fast food every day

1054
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:52,940
and you get criticism that you need to eat healthy, most people think they have to go

1055
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:53,520
cold turkey.

1056
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:57,960
No, you just keep doing what you're doing and just start introducing the healthier food

1057
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,320
and phase out the unhealthy food over a gradual period of time.

1058
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:03,480
Usually a month is fine.

1059
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:06,960
You start, you'll notice it'll be a month by the moon.

1060
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:11,860
So if you start in the middle of the month where the dark moon, it'll probably, you'll

1061
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:15,540
probably pass that full moon in two weeks and go to the next full moon.

1062
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:16,980
So it might be more than a month.

1063
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,860
It might be six weeks, depending on when you start.

1064
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:25,240
Again, people have been listening to this Greek speak stuff over the years will understand

1065
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:25,740
what I'm saying.

1066
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,600
Maybe not, but that's why I'm bringing it up again.

1067
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:33,620
The moon cycle is very, very critical to, by the way, there's a lunar, we're probably

1068
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:36,260
doing another episode before the lunar eclipse that's coming.

1069
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:42,400
Archaics has done some pretty good videos on that, especially the last one, which basically

1070
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,160
reverse psyop using reverse psychology.

1071
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:50,220
Also, it's going to line up a day or two or three after the Passover.

1072
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:56,200
Remember the, these, they, they use the biblical days, like nine 11 happened on the day of

1073
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,880
atonement on the 10th day of the seventh month.

1074
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:05,020
The Corona virus was declared to be a national state of emergency type thing by the federal

1075
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:05,660
reserve.

1076
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:11,480
Do you remember it was Google and the federal reserve was a short speech about doing the

1077
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,760
lockdowns by the bankers, right?

1078
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:18,220
Who own you on the Passover in 2020 or whatever it was.

1079
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:24,980
So these, these days are interesting because of the biblical alignments, by the way, you

1080
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,420
know, not Jewish, by the way.

1081
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,320
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1082
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:31,380
You know, just a quick note too.

1083
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,260
I saw in the chat that, uh, what was it?

1084
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:37,640
A Freeman recently had a brochures on good, you know, so, uh, good.

1085
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:42,860
He's got, I really, I'm thankful and grateful about the, the, uh, the, uh, chronography

1086
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:43,960
chronology that he's done.

1087
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:44,780
Right, right.

1088
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:47,600
Because I've always, I've always been known as someone who looked at old books, but not

1089
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:50,940
like that, you know, and, and putting piecing it together.

1090
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:58,840
My whole thing is to do a broad, a broad sweep over this existence and dig down a little deep,

1091
00:50:58,860 --> 00:50:59,800
which isn't that much.

1092
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:03,420
You don't have to dig deep to be advanced on any subject.

1093
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:08,360
And, uh, he went really deep on the chronography and that's pretty much, and that's what he

1094
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:08,560
is.
