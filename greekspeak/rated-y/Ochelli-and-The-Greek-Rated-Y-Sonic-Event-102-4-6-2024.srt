1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:16,180
A sonic event 102, rated Y, Ocelli and the Greek. So, let's just get it started where

2
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:21,080
it needs to start. I would ask Greek how he's doing. Not gonna ask, I'll find out in a moment.

3
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,160
I'm gonna ask him this instead. How's that celebrity chef thing doing? You know, apparently

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,720
as people got bombed, you like to bring up celebrity chefs, Greek. No, actually, I don't.

5
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:37,060
I bring up a lot of cooking and what I do say about celebrities and, well, chefs as well,

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,360
is that no one, in remark to the popularity of cooking shows, is no one will ever learn

7
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,800
how to cook properly or good food by watching all that, right? Oh, right, but you bring

8
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,060
that up every time. Like, lately, we've done a bunch of things where you've given people

9
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:54,440
instructions. Yeah, I keep saying, because people gravitate. Just like you're not gonna

10
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,920
be a good filmmaker from watching good film, right? No, no, and even if you watch the documentaries,

11
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,560
The Making Of, some people like to do that, right? You're not gonna, yeah, exactly, so.

12
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:07,820
But that's the level, I think before we started recording, you brought it up, I said, did

13
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:12,260
I spell that chef's name right? Yeah. Right, because it's bad news, right? So, you see,

14
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,600
it's all BS. And what did I say? Do you know in the past four hours, over a thousand people

15
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,960
were killed by doctors knowing that they were gonna, you know, their patients were gonna

16
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:27,580
die. And maybe 3,000 or 5,000 in the U.S. alone since this morning. How many people

17
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:32,780
are listing that in the television program called The News? None. So, you know what I

18
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:37,260
say about those celebrity people? Fuck them, and their help. And here's the ultimate, here's

19
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:41,120
the ultimate statement, right? Which, you know, here we go. I'm gonna challenge the Greek

20
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,360
and tell them to tell me that I'm not telling the truth entirely when I say this. I love

21
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,220
doing this. No, it's not a matter about the truth, it's a matter of what you're, if what

22
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:53,400
you're conveying has any value. But go ahead. Okay, well, let's see if this has any value.

23
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:59,060
How about this? I have stated before, and will continue to state, that the medical industrial

24
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:04,640
complex has literally killed more people in the time that we're looking at, you know,

25
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:09,139
modern times, and all the combined wars. You combine all those casualties all together.

26
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:13,720
I do mean World War II, World War I, all of the stuff since the United States existed.

27
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,000
In that time period, the medical industrial complex has absolutely killed way more people

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,440
than all the wars combined. Right or wrong? Right, and you don't even have to factor in

29
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,240
aborted babies. You don't even have to factor in, you know, other stuff, too. So, car accidents

30
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,200
or anything, I mean, it's just the medical, yeah. Yeah, I agree. Okay, well, here's the

31
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,060
thing. I'm not anti-medical, I'm just anti-stupid. But here's the other thing. I recently, um...

32
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:45,500
There's a t-shirt. Yeah, I had a conversation with a doctor recently. They're actually gonna

33
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:52,840
be installing some water devices, for plural. And I've known them for a while, a decade

34
00:02:52,840 --> 00:03:00,880
and a half or so. And by the way, you know, when you hear me speaking... Curiosity, doctor's

35
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,580
home or office for the water devices? Home, yeah. Okay, just checking, go ahead. Yeah,

36
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,860
the offices, they're an academic doctor, so... Oh, so they don't care what happens in the

37
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,780
office. Go ahead, yeah. There is not much of, yeah, the office is just a landing. But anyway,

38
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:19,580
when I speak about the attorneys and the doctors and the priests, it's not because I have some

39
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:24,560
opinion from reading an article or just see... It's because I know these bastards, right?

40
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,960
By observation is what you're doing. Yeah, and you know, it's funny, through the years,

41
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,220
among the older sonics here and there about various sundry places where I did sonics,

42
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:40,180
I would challenge people, if you know any one family member who's an attorney, you ask them

43
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:45,060
this and this is their answer. And if you know a doctor and you ask them this, this is how they're

44
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:50,400
going to answer. And, you know, I gave a specific answer in a specific question and people would

45
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,860
message me back and say, you know, my dad's an attorney and I asked him this and he answered

46
00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:00,480
exactly what you said. How is that possible? How are we not noticing what kind of a... Yeah,

47
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,240
they're not... So anyway, regarding this medical person, they know what's going on, by the way.

48
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:10,780
They know, but they fully agree... Actually, let me just say this. Let's just be biased. I've

49
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,980
known them for a decade and a half, so I gave them the entire full Greek speak over the time

50
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:21,940
that we spent together regarding AIDS, virology, disease and all that. Okay, maybe I'll be a little

51
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,960
self-aggrandizing and say that they learned it from me. Most of it, yeah, in order to put it,

52
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,220
you know, what calories don't matter, there's no blood pressure. They know all this and they're

53
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:36,680
still continuing in the field because it's a matter of, you know, how else are they going

54
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:42,980
to make a living? Now, I do know, this is from seeing, when attorneys do quit, they become

55
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:50,180
car salesmen, not used car salesmen necessarily, but they always end up... Okay, when I say always,

56
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:57,380
most of the time when an attorney decides, okay, enough with the bar, the bar is a

57
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:03,340
Isn't that funny? Now, doctors, when they quit, they end up getting into some kind of retail

58
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:13,680
business, either a shop or whatever, or sports, you know, kind of thing. You're right. Retired

59
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,080
doctors, I used to work in the convenience store business, right? So I saw a lot of different angles

60
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,200
on this. And quite honestly, a lot of these like older guys who are coming in, not somebody who

61
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,580
worked their way up and decided to buy a store, but like an older guy who shows up with a check,

62
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:34,400
basically, and buys a business that's already existing, usually, and takes it over, and,

63
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,940
you know, sets it up so that like his kids can work there, this kind of thing, right?

64
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,840
That's usually a doctor. They end up working, I'm saying even from any perspective, but those

65
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,840
are the industries. But here's the thing, it's so, so predictable. But I want to be neutral,

66
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,320
like the Swiss on this, right? Which if you go even deeper, I'm not, because the Swiss are a

67
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,640
pretty evil bunch, meaning the, you know, the collective, the collective organization. But on

68
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:04,480
the other hand, you do have to give them some, the Swiss regarding, they were the last sovereign,

69
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,640
not sovereign, the last free nation, they were not, up until 2002, they were not part of the UN,

70
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:15,840
right, which is a club for all the corporations. And they couldn't join the UN because each man

71
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,700
and woman was considered to have their own rights and their own standing in politics.

72
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,400
So they couldn't send anyone to represent them, but they became a corporation,

73
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,740
they sent out some paperwork, had people sign them, they announced to them what they were doing.

74
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:34,400
And they joined the UN on, I think, September 12, 2002, because after 9-11, they gave them

75
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,920
an ultimatum, I don't know what it was. But I know that, like, for example, in World War I,

76
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:44,300
Turkey was given, the remnants of the Ottoman Empire was given an ultimatum that all their men

77
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,080
take on family names and surnames, and they switch their language from, you know, into

78
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:56,120
Roman characters, and also adopt the Pope's work schedule, right? So these things are done,

79
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,760
and they're quite major changes, and no one talks about them just like major changes.

80
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,740
Like, this is kind of a source, but I know someone that I was kind of fond of for a while,

81
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,980
regarding the medical, and, you know, about a month ago, someone told me that, oh, yeah,

82
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,780
they're not answering your calls, they're okay, they're just getting this medical treatment,

83
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,500
they have to be there every day. I said, oh, they're going to kill them. Two weeks later,

84
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:24,160
such and such died. I said, told you, pretty obvious, and he looked just fine. Anyway,

85
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:30,480
so I call that, by the way, medical Darwinism. You know, the whole evolution of species and all

86
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:35,140
that is not, because even Darwin himself, you know, said these were all theories that he borrowed

87
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:40,960
from his grandfather, by the way, who was more popular at the time. Darwin did not become popular

88
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:47,140
until the late 20th century. Well, and much like the Bible and everything else, the people that

89
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:51,040
pound on it and quote it and source it and everything else usually haven't read it. They

90
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,340
don't even know what they're talking about. No, but this is different. Darwin himself stated that

91
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:59,920
the majority of the, his evolution is a theory, but what he does know is that major changes come

92
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:06,640
from calamities and catastrophes, right? So it's really a catastrophist, which is basically the

93
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:11,560
creationist or catastrophist, too. Archaics is really good, has put forward a real good

94
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:20,900
synopsis and presentations on that. So what I'm saying here is medical Darwinism in the sense

95
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:27,120
that if you are stupid enough to proceed with what is going on in the medical community,

96
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,960
you pretty much deserve not to have your gene pool, or genetics main, you know, hang around,

97
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:38,159
right? You know, that's the Darwinism idea after that done. I like the donald bird got wiped out

98
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,620
because it was dumb, right? Well, whatever. Right. So let's just say, right. Okay. So yeah,

99
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:47,680
you're actually a dodo. Actually, we start coining that people that believe what the medical

100
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,220
establishment you call it, what is the medical complex? What did you call it? Yeah. Yeah,

101
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,500
the medical industrial complex. Yeah, there you go. Yeah, you're a dodo. They don't have patients,

102
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:05,860
they have dodos. So yeah, so it's really harsh. You know, it's kind of harsh. It's kind of like

103
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:12,460
I was listening to someone. I knew quite a bunch of people, especially when I lived in New York,

104
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:19,940
in the 80s that were in Europe during World War Two. And they knew a bombing raid was coming

105
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:27,900
because of espionage. And their city was quiet. This is in Hungary, and near Budapest. And

106
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:34,780
they they said, let's leave the apartment. Let's leave the apartment, just grab whatever you can.

107
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:39,540
And we'll come back in a few days and get the rest of the stuff. Well, they left, but they came

108
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:45,500
back in a few days. And guess what? It wasn't there, but it was hit, right? So and another

109
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:51,880
story was that they had, this was in Berlin, someone that I knew, an older person, they

110
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:58,060
early on in the war when the major actually towards the middle end, you know, 42, 43, 44,

111
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:04,160
bombing of Berlin. They had bombing shelters, and they would be in the bombing shelters. And

112
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,020
it was kind of like, you know, you knew something was going on on the surface.

113
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,820
And they would, and after the bombing stopped, they still kept the people underground for quite

114
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:16,460
a few hours, and he'd come up, it would be daylight morning. And you'd see elephants,

115
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:23,460
and lions and giraffes in the streets, right? Because the right the zoo got hit, right? And

116
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:28,480
the animals got out. Stories like that, right stuff that you don't see on the history channel,

117
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:32,400
right? You'll see. So what you see on the history channel, all this other stuff,

118
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:37,140
is the same stuff that the medical industry is doing, right? It's just the same stuff over and

119
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:42,820
over and people go for it. Now, what's going on that makes it so bizarre is the same thing that

120
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:47,700
if you start researching ancient cultures, and we do some research, I used to have like a pretty

121
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:53,060
like these encyclopedias of weird stuff. Do you remember those? Not not Ripley's, believe it or

122
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,700
not, but there was others like that. Yeah, no, there was a couple of different books. And they

123
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,660
were usually in the bookstore right next to the Guinness Book of World Records. Yeah,

124
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:07,460
novelty kind of stuff, you know, old information that's brought out newly. So look up if you can,

125
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:13,940
even on the stupid rectangle of bizarre traditions of ancient cultures, right? That no longer

126
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:18,320
practice. That's what you're living in right now, right? You know, that calories have something to

127
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,940
do with food. You have all these. All right. Okay. Anyway, going back to being neutral.

128
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:30,940
I want to thank people, by the way, who are trying out the suggestions and recommendations

129
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:36,080
that I'm making regarding the things to prepare food food wise. And I think they do find it to

130
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:40,800
be even though it might sound if you listen to the cabbage pot roast and broccoli steak,

131
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,940
right? Sounds kind of like this guy's insane. You know, who wants to eat that? Well, whoever tried

132
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,680
it. I've gotten some feedback from a couple of people. And there's one in the chat was like,

133
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,340
dude, this is pretty amazing. I mean, I know, I know. It's pretty amazing. All right. You know,

134
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:57,560
I got to try the cabbage thing, because I'll tell you, truthfully, generally, the way cabbage has

135
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:03,140
been presented to me in the past, and I usually don't work with it. But I've eaten, you know,

136
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:07,660
coleslaw, and I've eaten, you know, the cabbage that's inside of the egg rolls or whatever else

137
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:13,300
from a Chinese hold on, you're missing the point. You missed the whole point. I'm not saying eating

138
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:18,320
cabbage at all. You can eat cabbage 500 different ways. If you have to make it, it's very specific.

139
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,860
Oh, go back and listen to that sonic. I understand. That's what I'm getting to is that,

140
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,300
you know, I've eaten it before, though, and don't think of it as something that could be turned

141
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:31,160
into something that is substantial. Cabbage pot. Yeah. And it's wonderful on its own.

142
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:36,540
Yeah. It's a very substantial and it's very healthful. By the way, there's no such thing

143
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,820
as health. This is a repeat. This is very important. And I don't know how to drive it

144
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,940
home enough because you have to think about this every day to make use of it.

145
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,600
It's almost as crazy as people go, you know, the lettuce diet. And it's like,

146
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:52,200
OK, well, let me just say something. It's almost like I almost feel like every time I do a sonic

147
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,810
simply by just speaking to people in my own personal life. And now it seems like

148
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,840
every it's like there's no what is it? The goldfish has memory. 15 seconds or five. You know,

149
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,400
that's an analogy. Right. Just like I hope they spelled their name right. Yeah. OK.

150
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:13,380
There is no such thing as health. Right. Good health means that you have the fitness to do

151
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:19,400
what you require of yourself to do. So if you require of yourself to go climb a mountain tomorrow

152
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:25,880
and you have not achieved or don't contain or have the ability to do so because of your

153
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:31,620
fitness level, you are in poor health. Right. So you see what I mean? There is no such thing

154
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:37,820
as good health. So that's another medical fraud. They have this baseline of what blood pressure,

155
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:41,480
blood sugar. By the way, there's no blood measurable blood, blood sugar or sugar in

156
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,100
the blood that's done by analog. It's another fraud. Well, I've been meaning to ask you about

157
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,700
this, actually, about this good health thing, because isn't there a minimal baseline that you

158
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:54,560
could say is good health? For instance, you know, people that have trouble staying awake.

159
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,980
But people have trouble staying awake right now. Right. No, no. So stop. Stop there,

160
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:04,080
because it's so unusual. And I've given this analogy. I just I've been studying the medical

161
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:09,300
stuff since the 1980s in the big public library on 42nd Street, Fifth Avenue, the ones with lions

162
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:13,060
outside. Right. Yeah. No, I don't know. Nineteen or two. I've been to that. One of them was in

163
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,300
a movie a couple of years ago. It was like really cool. And I'm like, I don't think that place is

164
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:22,020
even there anymore. But good. Would people would go. I've maxed my time there. So I knew the hours

165
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:25,760
and I knew. So whenever I had free time, I would go there and because it was just beautiful

166
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:31,980
architecturally and all that. And just, you know, it was there was a film where it was a film. Maybe

167
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:35,780
it's imagining it. There was a film where some children are like they pull a book off the shelf

168
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:39,920
and they open the book and they go to the setting in the book. Right. That's how it is for me.

169
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:48,740
And I watched between like nineteen eighty three and nineteen ninety five, the salvage or removal

170
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:55,960
of areas of the library I put to the from public view. So I knew what what we have now was coming

171
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:00,460
just by when they remove these sections in these books, what are we what are they going to give us?

172
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:08,320
You know what? Well, anyway. So while I'm looking at all everything in the from the 1980s, let's say,

173
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,460
I realized that how easy information was to get and no one was looking at it at all.

174
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,680
But there was another point actually escaped my mind before you said that about health.

175
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:26,780
OK, I wanted to continue with which is your fitness level and the baselines that are created do not

176
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:30,660
exist. Like give an example. OK, this is the example I wanted to get. Recently, I spoke with

177
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:36,860
someone who works with a stationary bike company. I'm not going to mention the company. You probably

178
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:41,640
know they're the largest in the world and every it's all the rage. You know, it's got all the

179
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:46,820
tech and all that. And this person I brought up, the most famous cyclist, and they didn't know who

180
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:52,800
it was. It's like almost someone speaking with. And this is a point. This is not a smirch or

181
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:58,200
stain on them at all, because they're just a part of the culture. Right. It's it's is it

182
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,300
is it bad? No. But is it good? No, it's definitely not good. But here's the thing.

183
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,300
It's like someone who a young person, let's say someone in 30s is just getting into rock and roll

184
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:12,220
and doesn't know who Elvis is. Right. They want to do pop music, though. Right. Not. Right. OK.

185
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,980
So and they don't. Right. So that's right there. There's a problem. Right. Or you don't know who

186
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,420
the Beatles never heard of Elvis or the Beatles. I was going to say, yeah, that would be like,

187
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,920
oh, wow. OK, so are they bad for not knowing that? No, no. But is it good? No, it's not a good thing

188
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:31,940
either. Right. So you try to be neutral. Remember, so you said earlier. OK, so what I mentioned to

189
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:38,620
them in short is this stationary bike movement in terms of let's use the sex analogy is like

190
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:44,660
creating a whole culture that's based on masturbation, where the other the original

191
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:48,120
culture of the bike movement, where you go out and cycle would be like having sex

192
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:54,220
with a partner. Big difference now from an anatomical point of view. And this is a very

193
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:59,680
good analogy, because from an anatomical point of view, while, you know, you're stationary bike,

194
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,900
you're still turning the cranks with your feet, you're still getting cardio, whatever.

195
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,040
But you know what? No matter what you those people that focus on that stationary bike will

196
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:15,339
don't understand that 90 percent of the finesse of riding a bike and energy goes into balancing the

197
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:21,859
bike. Right. Taking your line steering right now, maneuvering and navigating the terrain.

198
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:28,200
These people on stationary bikes don't have that. Just like, for example, navigating the terrain

199
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:34,000
and all that and steering is in sex. Right. With a partner versus masturbation. Right. Right. So

200
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,240
and so and they're focusing it all on physical condition, which there is no such baseline.

201
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,180
And they also brought up their baselines. Those baselines don't work.

202
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,580
What I did learn from going back to the library, this is the point I want to bring up.

203
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,200
There was a study because back in the day, medical institutions that did research would

204
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,560
actually publish their findings in books. Right. It would be like the latest, you know,

205
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:00,440
usually five years after the study is done, you get just like now when you look at economic figures,

206
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:07,080
they're from twenty nineteen usually. Right. Yeah. You know. OK. So this was a study done

207
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:12,120
where they went to various medical institutions, went to study centurions, which are people that

208
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:18,620
live over a hundred places like the Hunza region, places like near Crete, Okinawa, so on and so

209
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:23,180
forth. And when they arrived, they asked where these people were and they were like, well,

210
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:26,720
they're not here. Well, you're sure they are. Where are they? Oh, you mean? Oh, yeah. Where

211
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,080
they are. Oh, yeah. They're out in the field working. So these people are one hundred,

212
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,400
one hundred and five, one hundred and ten. And they're working just like everyone else,

213
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,900
normal behavior. And they took their blood pressure and their blood pressure would be

214
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,900
like two eighty over two twenty. Right. Which means they need a quadruple bypass.

215
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,360
Their blood sugar would be four eighty or five hundred count, which means that you're going to

216
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:54,140
die. Right. Right. Normals, whatever. A third of that or a quarter of that. And so these people

217
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:59,920
would be on insulin and kidney dialysis and have quadruple bypasses. If you use the baseline,

218
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:04,980
right, that's being used in the society here right now. And it's not that they're that different.

219
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:09,900
Right. Like I sometimes joke around medical people with them. I said, what do you do with

220
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,980
someone that has two hearts? And they're like, oh, no, it is. Oh, yeah. They show up and the

221
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,820
hearts are underneath their armpits. It's not in the middle of the chest. And I start giving all the

222
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:22,760
anatomy of how if someone had if you had two hearts, where they would be and how they would

223
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:28,840
work and the doctors, they start. I use medical terms, of course. Right. And because you have to

224
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:35,040
know the language. Right. And they start freaking out. You know, I saw I did this once with someone

225
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:40,700
a few years ago and they ran out. They ran away from it. You know, of course. Right. So

226
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,820
it's not that strange. It's not that off. I mean, that's the two hearts. That's a fictional account.

227
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,800
But what they're doing is is almost as if they're applying that to you because there is no baseline.

228
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:57,040
And I can go on and on and on and on with when these baselines are very, very dangerous because

229
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:02,780
it's narrowing the field. It's not like when you're playing darts or shooting arrows,

230
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:08,640
there's a baseline there, because if you're playing darts or shooting arrows, well, not

231
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:16,380
shooting arrows, archery more than playing darts. You don't have to wonder what they're aiming for.

232
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:21,120
What does everybody know? What's the baseline? The bullseye. Right. Generally, generally. Yeah.

233
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:25,120
That's what everybody. OK, so, you know, it's not like that. It's not like there's a bullseye

234
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:31,480
on everyone. There's definitely a target on everyone. Well, you can be targeted.

235
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,220
Right. Then then it gets really rough for you. It doesn't mean that they'll succeed,

236
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:39,280
but it just gets really rough for you. But they see these baselines. It's just

237
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:45,920
like painting a target on someone and they have to. Right. So. But they do it in a way where

238
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:53,440
they shoot you in the kneecaps first. Right. Then they do the center mass. Right. So anyway,

239
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,720
that's the situation with that. Now, the thing about the I want to maybe continue a little bit

240
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,720
with the container is people that have been listening for a while know that I always talked

241
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:09,080
about wrapping it tight because of the biological vacuum in the body. Now, one situation came up

242
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:14,540
and I've done this naturally. Most people do. When you have a natural expulsion in the body

243
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:20,100
where something needs to be discharged through the skin, like let's say you have an itchy, OK,

244
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:27,420
on a limb, most likely it'll be on the left side, by the way. If it's a slow expulsion,

245
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,420
if and if it's a fast something that's going to last a very short time, it's going to be on the

246
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:38,020
right side. OK, what will happen? Let's say on your leg or your arm, you'll have an itchy spot.

247
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:43,900
And as it keeps getting issue, then it gets sore and then it breaks out and the skin breaks away

248
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:49,200
and you have a manifestation assist or pass or something, something might grow or whatever.

249
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:57,180
OK, that means that the body needs to let it out. So you want to encourage that by by massaging,

250
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:03,220
you know, and not wrapping it tight. Wrapping it tight at that point would be like putting a

251
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:08,060
potato in the exhaust pipe. I know some actually saying, you know, people may not know what that

252
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:12,340
means in the 70s. If you didn't like someone, you put it but you stuffed a potato in their gas pipe

253
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:18,360
in their car. Right. Right. Right. It wouldn't start. OK, so they need to encourage the flow.

254
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:24,840
But the flow just now just leaving it alone, let's say, or massaging doesn't mean you have to

255
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:30,480
consider why it manifested what's there. By the way, I've gotten several messages from people.

256
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:36,020
They'd go to the doctor. Right. And they said, well, there's some kind of streptococci or

257
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:42,100
these bacteria growing on it. It could be dangerous. Well, your body creates that,

258
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,400
by the way. That's part of like the garbage eaters. Right. And they do go out of control.

259
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,560
If you're out of balance, they can go out of balance very easily just because

260
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:53,580
there's back to the test. So the slideshow is

261
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:02,020
foggy. These these type of bacteria that eat flesh. Right. Let's say it doesn't mean it's a

262
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:07,120
bad thing. It's just that you're already in balance. If these things go in and out of balance

263
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,500
again, that will be hard to get rid of. And that kind of makes them go more for those other

264
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:16,380
treatments. So the entire thing here is when something like this happens to you and you have

265
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:20,860
something that wants to come out from the inside of the body to the outside and it's readily doing

266
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:27,580
so. Right now, I think I've mentioned someone that's among us here in this one of the subs.

267
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:33,180
Right. I had a breast tumor and I kept saying, try this, try that. And it got to the point where,

268
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,460
you know how the Catholics say, God bless her heart.

269
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,720
Lived by California, went into the cold beach in the winter, in the morning,

270
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:46,940
got numb completely, went home, put a mirror on the floor, drank a half a bottle of something,

271
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:51,900
put a mirror on the floor and cut the breast open. So the tumor come out. I mean, not you know,

272
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,720
I mean, so a lot of people who could do that. That's like Rambo type stuff. Right. There's a

273
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:00,240
little lady did this. Right. Little, little. Yeah, it takes a little lady to this. It's not

274
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,200
old. But you know what I mean? You know, it's up there at age, but not like, you know, like,

275
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:08,600
I'm at our age. Right. But that's that's something else. Right. That's that came and went. I mean,

276
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:15,000
that's like, well, that's Rambo type shit. Right. Yeah. So that's rare. OK, so this is not what I'm

277
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,360
talking about where there's stuff is under the skin, where it's at the skin. The best thing to

278
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:25,460
do at that point is what that cause that manifestation, whether you know exactly or

279
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:30,460
not, is what you've been doing. It could be let's just take it from an outside route. It could be

280
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:35,980
the route that you take to work every day. It could be where your bed is, the location of your

281
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:42,300
bed in the house or the apartment where you sleep and that location on the earth. It could be your

282
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:47,740
diet. Could be your thinking. Could be some circumstances that have come up. Usually it

283
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:53,460
takes four seasons a year for something like that build up for something like that happens

284
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:57,660
because every time there's a seasonal change, your body tries to mitigate. And if it carries

285
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:01,480
over from one season to the next, to the next, that means it's going on for more than a year.

286
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:09,660
Right. And so changing the route you take from work to work every day instead of taking the same

287
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:15,160
route, which you shouldn't do, by the way, anyway, changing where you sleep, the location of the bed

288
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:19,180
or because the bed is the location of the bed in the house. Your apartment also has to be a specific

289
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:26,020
location on the earth. There's something going on there and your diet. And once you've accomplished

290
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:31,420
making enough changes, that manifestation will change as well. Now, the easiest way to do that

291
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:38,160
in terms of diet is make a list of all the things you like to eat and all of the and how many and

292
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:45,020
then check next to those things. Which one do you do frequently? A secondary list within that list

293
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:52,520
and then make another list of all the things that you don't like to eat and then make a check next

294
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:56,220
to each one of those which you think would be beneficial if you started eating them because

295
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:02,580
of the known properties and vitality. And then you switch those two lists. Eat the things that you

296
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:07,460
normally don't eat right and don't eat the things you normally eat. So changing all this. So what I'm

297
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:13,300
trying to say is people's financial situation, mental situation, health situation. I'm using

298
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:20,100
the word health in quotes. It is because of your behavior and what you've been doing. If you want

299
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:26,120
to change any of those things, you have to change what you do and give it a try. It doesn't mean

300
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:32,000
that it will necessarily change immediately or the way you like it, but it will not continue the way

301
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,660
it has been for sure. For sure. You see? So that is the main thing. So when health comes up,

302
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:44,100
it's not. By the way, the antithesis with the medical industrial complex, right? They say,

303
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:51,320
okay, it's true, because what they're doing is always the same thing. Anything comes up,

304
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:55,580
what do they say? Go to the doctor. I made it right. Go to the doctor. Same thing. Same thing.

305
00:26:55,620 --> 00:27:01,260
And you're going to have the same results. Now, for some people who are infrequent by going to

306
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:08,280
quote unquote, the doctor, the doctor, right? Or my doctor, where do I get one of those, right?

307
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:15,840
Um, uh, is a break in, in a pattern or a break in what they normally do.

308
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:23,060
And it's that break or change that leads to the change. In particular, you cannot logically,

309
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:27,820
rationally, emotionally, or psychologically. It's all psychological placebo, by the way,

310
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:33,400
if it does work, if whatever they're ordering you to take by prescription, pharmaceutical,

311
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:38,020
all of it is toxic, all of it. There's no way that's going to help anyone.

312
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,860
Right there. And their procedures are very evasive, which can help sometimes, right?

313
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:46,880
If you're at a terminal end, like, for example, when a house is on fire,

314
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:52,260
and the fire crew comes with an ax to break down the door to put out the fire, that's pretty

315
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:57,680
fucking evasive breaking away, breaking the door. Yeah, but the Yeah, if you don't break down the

316
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:01,260
door, right, you see, it might be right, right? Yeah. So yeah, now you have a burned house

317
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:07,260
with a broken door where the house would be more burned without a broken door, which one you say,

318
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:11,520
yeah, you're better off breaking the door. Yeah, yeah. So they're better, you're better in some

319
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,620
way. But that is the something that you're gonna have to decide. But there is no health. So whenever

320
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:21,720
you hear of health care for what, you know, the thing called health care, health care for

321
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:28,180
mountain climbers, health care for deep sea muff divers, I mean, scuba divers. Yeah.

322
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:31,720
Uh, right, because we're talking about the bike analogy. Yes, yes.

323
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:36,860
Health care for construction workers, health care for office workers for who?

324
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:41,380
Don't give me that baseline bullshit. Right? Because I gave this centurion

325
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:47,700
analogy, by the way, if anyone could find that study, most of them are under NIH, which

326
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:53,680
or an England, nobody NHS, they're the ones and then there's the Red Cross, but they don't do

327
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:59,240
that stuff anymore because they're, by the way, the Red Cross do not donate there. That's just a

328
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:04,480
money laundering thing now. Worse, whenever they show up, children go missing. Okay. You know,

329
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:09,080
I think you've heard there's some stories on the outliers, you know, out fringe on the internet.

330
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,800
Well, yeah, I've never, I've never been able to verify any of that stuff. But yeah, I've heard.

331
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,440
Yeah, yeah. But that's obvious, you know, and also drug running.

332
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,000
Well, that yes, that that drug running human trafficking arms,

333
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:27,500
the triggers trigger devices for nukes, right? Sure. Don't I've noticed I've been looking at

334
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:33,260
the landscape and they've really calmed down. So since 2020, they really calmed down on the use of

335
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:37,200
nukes on the population, by the way. In other words, these car bombs, by the way, that leave

336
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:43,400
30 foot craters in the ground. They're not carbon. I mean, they're car bombs. All right. Anyway,

337
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:48,060
so I think there'll be a big resurgent resurgence in that again, you know,

338
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:52,920
like a little Nissan Sentra walks in and it completely demolishes a 20 story building.

339
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:59,100
And you know, you do the math on it. And you needed 35 tons of TNT to do that.

340
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,800
Do you think we're going to go back to those days where the Yeah, I think so. I think it's coming.

341
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:08,640
So yeah, a little Nissan Sentra, the explosion goes off as a bright flash. And yeah,

342
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:14,540
totally pulverizes, you know, a 40 foot diameter hole and everything around it turns to dust. Yeah.

343
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:19,180
Reason why the Pinto was so cheap, you know, just yeah. You know, by the way,

344
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:23,260
when you say I got a one ton pickup truck, that's a pretty big truck, right?

345
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:29,580
So I don't think you could put like 25 or 30 tons in a Nissan Sentra. Yeah. Anyway,

346
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:34,860
generally, no, I would say yeah, the ignorance of the public is astounding. Yeah, it's it's the

347
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:39,660
ignorance is so astounding. That's one thing when Newtonian physics doesn't, you know, it works out

348
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:44,880
well, you know, it does it fits and you can't discount it. So when you see the amount of force

349
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,300
that it takes to do these things that say we're done by a car, really? No way. There's no way.

350
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,780
Yeah, but the people are ignorant about this stuff. And the people in the mills, I don't know

351
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:57,200
how they've, well, they have been through the years. Well, JFK, how do they have all these

352
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:03,820
people in Department of Energy and in the military stay quiet? Right? Are they that ignorant? Also,

353
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:09,000
I don't know. I mean, there's got to be something. I think it's, it's got to be character

354
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:15,340
too. Because I know you if you you end up you end up dead if you do speak like recently, the Boeing

355
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:19,360
engineer who spoke out that Boeing's been negligent on their maintenance and stuff

356
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,420
suicided and they paraded it around quite well. And no one does anything. No one cares. You know,

357
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:31,260
by the way, when you have a someone like who a whistleblower who's a benevolent, you know,

358
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:34,900
benefactor really that says, Hey, this company everyone trusts is doing this and that,

359
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:40,620
and they end up dead. No one cares. There's who should be like, protests and marches in the

360
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:45,240
street, right? Something ought to happen. Yeah, they don't care. So that's what I'm saying. Just

361
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:50,860
why bother just leave it alone. This is Darwin. This is Darwinism, social Darwinism,

362
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:56,400
or medical Darwinism, social Darwinism, whatever. Yeah. And I've been saying for a long time,

363
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:05,280
this society does not deserve to continue. So yeah, doesn't want it anyway. Right? Yeah.
