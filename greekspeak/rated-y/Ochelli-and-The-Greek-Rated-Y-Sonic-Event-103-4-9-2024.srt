00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,120
Rated Y, Sonic Event, 1-0-3, Ocelli in the Greek.

2
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,000
Anyway, how are you doing, Greek?

3
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,300
I'm doing good.

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:20,260
Listen, I'm excited about cooking because, you know, you do something and other people

5
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,200
get excited, it bounces back, right?

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:27,680
What I made tonight is, by the way, some pretty good responses I've got.

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,160
Not that many, but, you know, the ones that came in were pretty good about the cabbage

8
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,120
pot roast, right?

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,580
I think two or three Sonics ago, I gave the directions on how to do it.

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,080
It's not cabbage, it's how you cook it, right?

11
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,980
So that makes it different.

12
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:46,240
And what's wonderful is you do that and cut a wedge off of that and make yourself a very

13
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:53,960
simple spaghetti, make your pasta, and on the side, you make a compound butter, which

14
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,720
is basically compound butter is when you chop things up, various things, very fine,

15
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,780
and mix it with butter.

16
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,340
And the butter is not even pre-melted.

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,040
You basically cut the butter up as you're cutting the other, after you cut up the other pieces.

18
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,860
And in the compound butter is black pepper, parsley, and onion, white onion.

19
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,200
I'm surprised you don't make your own pasta, Greek.

20
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,680
I've never heard you mention that you make your own.

21
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,600
Yeah, I do all the time.

22
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:15,040
You do?

23
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:15,740
People come over.

24
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,260
Yeah, especially when I make an Asian brothy noodle thing, and the people are always debating.

25
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:29,360
I once served some people like a ramen, a vegetable ramen broth, and I was listening

26
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,600
to them talk.

27
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,820
I said, I wonder where you got these noodles.

28
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,580
Did you get it over at that Asian market on Pima Street?

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,020
And where I'm laughing, I'm like, I just made them.

30
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:42,700
But anyway, what you do is you chop up the white onion very fine and the parsley, and

31
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:47,180
then you use a couple of pads of butter chopped in there with some black pepper and salt.

32
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,320
And in the same pot, when your spaghetti comes out into the colander, turn it up high, and

33
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,740
you have that compound butter mixture, and just get it hot as possible.

34
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,120
It doesn't even have to brown.

35
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:04,420
Add some olive oil, mix your spaghetti in there, and then a little bit of tomato paste

36
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,760
that's slightly watered down.

37
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,600
And you have a very simple pasta.

38
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,840
It's not saucy at all.

39
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,500
You put some really good fresh grated cheese on it, and you serve that with a side wedge

40
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,640
of that cabbage pot roast.

41
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,240
Oh, my gosh.

42
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,160
The food combining there is amazing.

43
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,720
And you're talking about using enough tomato paste and watered down to just make it pink,

44
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,260
basically.

45
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,800
Just make the pasta pinkish, right?

46
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:28,960
Yeah.

47
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,540
Just to pink it off a little.

48
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,060
Yeah, yeah.

49
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,420
So add a little bit of fat.

50
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:39,180
Whenever you're cooking pasta, don't use the water that they do in restaurants, huge quantities.

51
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,640
Just have a hot pot of water, so as the pasta begins to cook, you add it.

52
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,920
You just want to cover it, but you have to keep adding, because it absorbs quite a bit.

53
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,420
And as you see, the pasta doubles or triples in size, depending on the cut.

54
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,560
So you add some fat to the water.

55
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,600
You want to add raw sesame oil.

56
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,800
Don't add toasted or olive oil or some butter to the water with the salt.

57
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,300
Nothing wrong with a little olive oil.

58
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,440
That'll go into the pasta.

59
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,100
Yeah, nothing wrong with a little olive oil and butter, both, right?

60
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,600
No, that's a great flavor.

61
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,720
And the other thing is, yeah, I notice a lot of people, when I watch them cook pasta, I

62
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,100
mean, they totally drown it.

63
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,380
You got to look at the pot, and you're wondering what's at the bottom of it, because it's got

64
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,240
so much water in it.

65
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,880
But no, you're right about that.

66
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,780
You only just want to cover it.

67
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,540
Just get it over the pasta.

68
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,300
Also when you start it, you need enough water to hold its temperature, because if there's

69
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,380
not enough water when you start the pasta, the temperature will drop too rapidly, take

70
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,400
too long to boil, and you won't get a good al dente day.

71
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,720
It'll be soggy on the outside.

72
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,260
You know, the yin condition.

73
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:48,000
So yeah, I just wanted to bring that up, because it's just that combination of just a pink

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,380
spaghetti with some onion and butter and parsley chopped up.

75
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,720
Here's the thing.

76
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,560
If you chop up the onion really fine, talking like a mince, and the parsley fine, and you

77
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,720
don't combine it with the butter on the cutting board, it's not going to taste the same.

78
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,360
If you just put the butter in the pan like many people do, let's say they're making pancakes

79
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,120
or eggs or something, and then you add your ingredients, it won't work.

80
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,180
It has to be mixed in cold.

81
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,280
And you can do an experiment.

82
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:19,079
I've spoken frequently about the cut changes the flavor, right?

83
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,760
Well, an extreme would be puree.

84
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:28,340
You know, most people have bitten into a carrot, and if you slice the carrot really thin on

85
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,540
a bias, it tastes different.

86
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,000
If you make it matchsticks, it tastes different.

87
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,940
If you grate the carrot, it tastes different.

88
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:34,960
And guess what?

89
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:40,660
If you made the carrot into juice or puree, it would taste different again, the same carrot.

90
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,040
So the cut does make a difference.

91
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:49,900
And the preparation time, again, just to reiterate, with all the star chefs on TV and all the

92
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,320
cooking shows, not one person has learned how to cook from watching that.

93
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,920
You will be entertained by it.

94
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,020
It's just like that TV show they call The News.

95
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:57,880
It's really entertainment.

96
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:06,240
So, excuse me, put these little, I don't know, hints and techniques in, because life can

97
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,160
be more enjoyable with good food, and I think it should be.

98
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,160
Oh, absolutely.

99
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,600
I noticed you didn't mention garlic there, though, when you talked about the onion.

100
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,460
No garlic in this.

101
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,400
No, no, that's true.

102
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,760
Garlic's played out.

103
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,660
I had some tuna steaks yesterday.

104
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,800
I made a sushi rice, and the next day I sliced the tuna very thin.

105
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:31,360
It was broiled, just blackened slightly on the outside for a minute on each side.

106
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,180
I sliced it really thin, had that nice mesquite smoke flavor.

107
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:43,420
But what I did with the leftover rice, I made some very hot sesame oil with a lot of crushed

108
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,960
garlic until the garlic turned brown.

109
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:53,440
Then I added the rice and basically did a toasted garlic stir fry with sushi rice and

110
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:59,780
had the tuna steak on top with some lime and a Thai pepper sauce.

111
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:05,600
Yeah, I call it pepper jelly, because it looks like a clear almost jelly, kind of like a reddish

112
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,620
jelly with floating pieces of chili in it.

113
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,040
Yeah, very simple.

114
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,100
By the way, the Thai chili sauce, sweet chili sauce and lime go very well together.

115
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,720
So yeah, you've got to enjoy it while you can.

116
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:22,580
By the way, speaking of enjoying it, I wanted to ... There's not much to address in the

117
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:29,900
chat other than the food thing and some general questions, but the yin and yang thing will

118
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:35,120
keep coming up with me until we figure out another way to call it, the process, it's

119
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,260
universal process.

120
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:47,300
Nothing is completely one or the other, but generally the condition of all organic stuff

121
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:47,860
is yin.

122
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,340
Plants, animals, people are yin generally, right?

123
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,060
Not as hard as a rock, right?

124
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:58,580
But within the body of the animal or the creature, the living creature, there is yin and yang.

125
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,940
All nutrition that's taken in, whatever is taken in as nutrition is yin.

126
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:10,020
Once it's considered to be a form of nutrition, then it's subdivided into yin and yang and

127
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,800
that will tell you which direction it will go.

128
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:21,940
So it's basically a method for looking at process more than what something is empirically,

129
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:22,960
right?

130
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:23,520
Okay.

131
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,200
So nothing is yin and nothing is yang.

132
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,080
It's a way to explain the processes of change.

133
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,480
Wow, I don't believe I got ... I think that's a really good explanation.

134
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,180
Yeah, that is a good explanation.

135
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,360
That's pretty much what it is.

136
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,700
Once you start to understand that ... Here's the thing.

137
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,100
You'll never understand yin and yang unless you work with it.

138
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,500
You have to have ... Yin and yang is something that you either have a working knowledge of

139
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,080
it where you're applying it or you don't.

140
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:57,220
There's no way you'll take a class somewhere and there'll be a chapter on yin and yang and

141
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,580
then you go to something else and you'll have any idea of how to use it.

142
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,800
It is a completely ... It's a working process.

143
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,680
If you can't work in it, you don't know it.

144
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,120
If you don't know it, you can't work in it.

145
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,180
So it's one of those things.

146
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,820
You said garlic is kind of played out, but one thing that I miss is I used to have these

147
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:21,020
little things where you could put it in the oven and then it just ...

148
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:21,120
Yeah, yeah.

149
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,580
A little terracotta thing that bakes it?

150
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,900
Like a garlic butter?

151
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,080
Yeah, and then that turns into just a garlic butter all by itself.

152
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:27,840
You don't add butter.

153
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,760
You just squeeze it out and boom, there it is.

154
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:35,020
What I mean it's played out is because it's very ... Well, it's stereotypical when you hear

155
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,000
spaghetti and pasta to have garlic, right?

156
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,179
I enjoy it, so that's why I have it.

157
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:41,520
Oh, no, so do I, but I have it because I did it yesterday.

158
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:47,320
But I think of these things also ... When you go to Michelin star restaurants, they minimize

159
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,520
the ingredients, right?

160
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:48,940
Yeah.

161
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,240
It's the absolute minimum, but it's the best prepared.

162
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:59,660
You use fewer ingredients and what you're using, have it used in a way where it shines

163
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:06,060
through and still retains some of its character and you have some contrast, unless you want

164
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,820
to put two things together that make a completely different flavor.

165
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,220
One of those things is I call it cheat and cheddar.

166
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,520
You know how there's cheese dip, right?

167
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,620
Typical of parties.

168
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,560
Well, if you want to make one that's purely vegetable, you take equal parts of miso, any

169
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:25,600
miso you like, paste, and equal parts of sesame tahini and you just mix it together and it

170
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,620
tastes like ... When I present it to quote-unquote white people, they say,

171
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,880
this is like cheddar dip.

172
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,320
I'm like, yeah, there's no dairy in here.

173
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,740
This is completely vegan, and they call it cheat and cheddar.

174
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,040
Someone ought to just put that together, put it out there.

175
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,620
It'll be pretty big.

176
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:45,260
It's actually quite delicious because if you go to Japan, for example, where miso is the

177
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:52,640
most popular, there's miso shops with 500 varieties of miso, broken down from white

178
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,520
miso all the way to very dark, broken down from various types of soybeans.

179
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:03,040
My favorite miso generally for flavoring, something like that, is a chickpea miso.

180
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,580
If you can find a chickpea miso, yeah, it's out there.

181
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:08,900
It's quite popular.

182
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,820
Do that with the sesame tahini.

183
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:18,180
The reason I brought that up, if you taste the flavor of tahini by itself and taste the

184
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:24,300
flavor of miso by itself, very distinctive, but when you put them together, they form

185
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,860
a completely new flavor.

186
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,400
If you didn't tell someone that was miso and tahini, they wouldn't figure it out.

187
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,020
I love that kind of stuff too, right?

188
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,140
It's a total transformation.

189
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,720
Speaking of transformation, I've gotten some requests to speak about Trevor James Constable

190
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,600
and that kind of work.

191
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:46,060
There's been some interest, especially the newer people about weather work because I've

192
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:50,540
gotten into it to a degree, but not in a rudimentary way.

193
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,100
Again, like Eden Young, where you have a working knowledge, and that's what I want to pretty

194
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:54,980
much discuss.

195
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:01,780
Ultimately, the more you learn about it, you'll find that it has less to do about working

196
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:09,400
with the weather and more to do about the soup that we're in, meaning the ether, denying

197
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,120
of the ether.

198
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,080
I've spoken to these Ivy League people.

199
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:21,860
By the way, Ivy League colleges or universities are brand names, and whenever you bring up

200
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,240
the ether, they really poo-poo it.

201
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,600
By the way, do you know how to game?

202
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,580
You can game the Ivy League, by the way.

203
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,600
It's a quarter of a million to 400,000 to get a degree there.

204
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,520
Once you have one of those, you're a desirable prospect for a lot of corporations.

205
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:43,760
You can game that system if you're young or if you're in that position before you go there.

206
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,960
I'll tell you how you game it.

207
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,580
Pretty simple.

208
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:50,680
Let's just pick an industry, the tech industry.

209
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,160
Very good.

210
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,200
All right.

211
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,760
Let's say IT, like Silicon Valley, right?

212
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:04,680
What you do is you do whatever it takes to apply to Harvard, and if you do really well,

213
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:12,020
they will send you for free an acceptance letter, and it doesn't cost anything.

214
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:17,920
You can apply to Harvard, and if you have good grades and recommendations and all that,

215
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,660
you get accepted, let's say, to Harvard, and they will give you that acceptance letter

216
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,960
for free, don't they, right?

217
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:29,540
So what you do is you take that acceptance letter and you go to Silicon Valley Corporation

218
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,920
and you say, hey, look at this.

219
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:39,360
I got accepted to Harvard, but I'd rather work for you, and they're looking at the thing

220
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:46,440
and they're like, okay, great, and they'll start you off just like they would start someone

221
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,480
who graduated from Harvard.

222
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:56,260
So now you have a Harvard reputation pedigree without paying the ... You see how you can

223
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:56,880
game the system?

224
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:57,360
Right.

225
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,080
You don't wind up having to pay the $30,000 a year or whatever it is to go there.

226
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,040
I don't even know what it is.

227
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:06,720
Because actually, when you get out of Harvard, if you ask most people that have graduated

228
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,240
from Ivy League, that's just part of your education, then you move on to something else.

229
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,280
Like, no, the reason I get this is I could wave it around and get a better entry position,

230
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,520
right?

231
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,240
They said if that wasn't used, in other words, about 90% of them that were able to be surveyed

232
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,800
said that, no, I did it purely so I can get a better position in the workplace.

233
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:33,000
I didn't do it for just basic education to edify myself at all, because they teach the

234
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,780
same stuff, right?

235
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:34,260
Right.

236
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,880
So this is how you can game the system.

237
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,920
You could also ... It doesn't have to ... You could be with a technical school, you get

238
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,860
into Northeastern for engineering, go to an engineering firm and say, hey, look, I could

239
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,120
have gone to Northeastern, but I'd rather work for you.

240
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:46,880
And they'll be like, wow.

241
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:51,640
They might even, in the lunchroom, the ... What do you call them?

242
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,320
The superiors or the seniors say, we have a Northeastern graduate or a Harvard graduate,

243
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,260
even though you're not.

244
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:03,920
Because you have enough credentials to also show that you have accepted into that world,

245
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,860
but you also show that you have more ... It's more than motivation.

246
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,840
What do you call it when someone starts out as a good starter on their own?

247
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:13,780
Potential.

248
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:14,940
You take initiative.

249
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,180
Yeah, exactly.

250
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,140
Someone who takes initiative.

251
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,640
Because they know that when you go work in a corporation, no matter what university,

252
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:27,360
after a few years, four or five years of being in that corporation, your education doesn't

253
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:27,920
matter anymore.

254
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,320
What matters is where you are and what you're doing in the company, right?

255
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:30,480
Yeah.

256
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,380
What you've done since you've been there now.

257
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,420
Yeah, exactly.

258
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:33,900
So, yeah.

259
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,100
That's how you can gain that.

260
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,040
Now, I had to bring that up because I run into these Ivy League idiots once in a while.

261
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:47,100
It's all social positioning, social signaling to ... You signal on from Harvard, or whatever.

262
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:53,860
They poo-poo the ether big time, and they make up all this flash physics that doesn't

263
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,480
matter and doesn't make sense at all.

264
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:04,120
So, I wanted to get into the weather work, especially my experience with Trevor James

265
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,580
Constable.

266
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:12,320
I've worked with him for about ... Up until 2013 or so, until 2016 when he passed away,

267
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:19,440
we would speak once a week for hours, and he sent me a few boxes, FedEx of his paperwork,

268
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,160
stuff like that.

269
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,380
It's quite interesting.

270
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,860
In the beginning, when I started speaking with him ... By the way, Trevor James Constable,

271
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,900
if you don't know who he is, he's furthered the work of Wilhelm Reich.

272
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:36,060
Anyway, he was very cautious, and by the three years or so after that, I was building devices

273
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,160
and sending them to him, and he was testing them out and saying, yeah, they worked.

274
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:46,260
Because a lot of people want to contact the hero worship or whatever, because he was quite

275
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:51,160
popular with his books and his internet presence that others did for him.

276
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:58,800
He gets a lot of people contacting him, so I had to, again, not game it, but I said,

277
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,320
listen, I've got some things I want to send you, and he said, no, no, don't bother sending

278
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:01,520
it.

279
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,140
Don't send me anything.

280
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,680
I'm like, no, I'm going to send it to you, you tell me.

281
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,900
So we had a very effective relationship in this.

282
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:14,940
But Trevor will always cite the weather work as being from Wilhelm Reich, and let me just

283
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,380
start off.

284
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,620
Wilhelm Reich did the Orgone work.

285
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,980
Now let me just get into this in a minimal way.

286
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,160
This stuff called Orgonite, where you mix this resin with metal shavings, this has nothing

287
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,240
to do with what I'm talking about, because the principle is layering.

288
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,820
It's like an inverted capacitor.

289
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:41,540
You have a distinct layer, if it's rectangular, box, circular, spherical, whatever it is,

290
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:48,960
of organic material completely closed upon itself, and then another layer, concentric

291
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:53,240
or applied to it, of metal, and then again, organic, and then metal.

292
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,600
The Orgonite is a resin where everything is mixed in, there's no distinctive layering,

293
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:58,640
right?

294
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,980
Yeah, they make that stuff in pyramid shapes, and then there's-

295
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,640
Yeah, it doesn't matter what, yeah, yeah, penis shape, whatever, it doesn't matter.

296
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,400
I don't do that stuff.

297
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:17,079
Now, it has a place, for example, it's called doping, but that's another thing, it's dielectric

298
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:22,000
is what it is, and it could be, if you know how to use it, it works well, but that's not

299
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,200
what we're going to talk about, I'd like to talk about, because the internet is flooded

300
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,920
with that stuff, and most of the purpose of it is junk, but it's not junk, it has a purpose,

301
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,140
but it's not with the weather.

302
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:42,840
So, Wilhelm Reich built these Orgon boxes, he was infiltrated, and by the agencies, because

303
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:49,480
they don't want to rock it, because, okay, he was a psychiatrist, psychologist type person,

304
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:52,160
and he stepped out into biology, you can't do that.

305
00:17:52,400 --> 00:18:00,440
Once you have, you can, but you will not progress, so let's say you have a professional degree

306
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,680
in something, you cannot go and do something else, you must stay in that narrow focus,

307
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:04,940
right?

308
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:11,600
So, he was bouncing around into physics, biology, psychology, all these things, oh, no, no, you

309
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,760
can't do that, he was infiltrated, because he was viewed as a threat, as others were,

310
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:23,600
and one of the reasons they didn't stomp him out immediately is because all the devices

311
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,300
he made, his Orgon boxes, which were layered boxes, basically, if you walked into an Orgon

312
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:35,600
box, it was exposed metal layer, the entire inside was metallic, then adjacent to that

313
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:41,260
was non-metallic, and then metallic, right, and you finished off with non-metallic on

314
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,540
the outside, metallic on the inside, at least three layers.

315
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:48,780
Okay, the reason why they kind of left him alone is because these devices work really

316
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,460
slowly.

317
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:50,660
Okay?

318
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:56,640
In other words, when you want to, let's say, garner an effect from them, you, whatever

319
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:02,440
you do with it, usually takes days, if not weeks, to see an effect.

320
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:08,080
It's not like the hundred-mile-per-gallon carburetor, right, where it works right away,

321
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,900
and you know, or a new weapon, or free-energy stuff, where you hit the switch, and boom,

322
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,920
it's off and running, right?

323
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:19,580
Nothing like that, it's very slow, typically a couple of days would be to see effect, so,

324
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:25,980
but it was profound, you know, in view of thinking, but anyone who understands the original electrical

325
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,200
engineering will see it as an unbalanced capacitor, right?

326
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:41,000
So, what, he was experimenting with this for many years, and the way it got to the weather

327
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,400
work was when he was up at Wrangley, I think it's Wrangley or Wrangley, Maine, he was building

328
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:53,460
a center, you know, a Rikian center for himself, in the country, because he knew that it was

329
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,580
the best place to be, away from the city, especially the experiments he was doing.

330
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:02,100
Part of the construction project involved like pipes, stove pipes, you know, those thin

331
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,140
galvanized steel pipes, right, four-inch diameter, like flue pipes, right?

332
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:12,280
Well, he was there on the site, and he noticed when some of these sheet metal pipes and other

333
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,560
types of pipe were delivered, there was a ditch that was going around some of the property,

334
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,900
you know, to prepare it for foundation work or wall work.

335
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,360
When one of the pipes fell into the ditch, where it slanted upward, it was still pointing

336
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:32,820
fairly upward, but the tail end of the pipe was in water in the ditch, and he saw that,

337
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:37,960
and he looked up at the sky, and it was a cloudy day, and he distinctly saw a hole in

338
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:44,900
the cloud forming, and he made the two connections, and he said, well, you know, if I move the

339
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,800
pipe the other way in the ditch, will the hole form on the other side?

340
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,460
And it did.

341
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,200
So he's like, oh, so you put a metal pipe in water, and you get a hole in the clouds.

342
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,820
So this was basically an accidental...

343
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:02,760
Yeah, just like Viagra and penicillin and Post-Its and escalator, in a way.

344
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,780
Start trying to use something for one reason, it turns out, hey, wait a minute, it does

345
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,300
something else.

346
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:11,640
He wasn't even trying to use it, it was a very superficial, you know, pipe delivery to a

347
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,480
construction site.

348
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,320
No one's paying attention to this stuff, right?

349
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:14,660
Right.

350
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,280
Go ahead.

351
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:15,520
Sure.

352
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,980
Yeah, so this is...

353
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,640
So it was by accident.

354
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,940
By the way, this is important.

355
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,920
Now, fast forward is just another thing kind of jumping around.

356
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:28,180
One of my mentors, when I first started getting into this stuff 25 years ago, or 24, 22 years

357
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:33,300
ago, was a guy named Joe Blankenship in Tucson, and he was really cool.

358
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:41,200
He met, well, actually more, he met Victor Schauberger, President Nixon would call him

359
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,840
every day after he got out of office, as a buddy-buddy thing, he was well-connected.

360
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:53,160
Howard Hughes, Joe Blankenship's mom had a diner here in Tucson, and Howard Hughes would

361
00:21:54,140 --> 00:22:00,100
patronize it, and before he would go in to have lunch, he'd send his guys in there and

362
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:04,040
pay her for an hour's worth of business, because they'd close the diner when he was there.

363
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,140
Yeah, that's the kind of thing Hughes would do, right?

364
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,740
Yeah, yeah, he paid for the...

365
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:12,040
Yeah, so basically, a burger cost him $50, back then it would be like $500 or whatever.

366
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,960
So anyway, cool story as well.

367
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,320
Joe Blankenship was running around in these circles, so when Reich came to Tucson in 52-53,

368
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:26,660
Joe was young, and he wanted to meet him, because he already heard about him, and Reich spoke

369
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:30,220
very little English, so Reich needed to be shown around, he says, I'll show you around,

370
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:38,100
and he ended up being Wilhelm Reich's driver, while for the couple of years that Reich was

371
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,940
in Tucson and built a house up on the northwest side and all that.

372
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:45,500
So he drove around Tucson and turned into a job for him, because he was going to move

373
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:45,960
to Tucson.

374
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:51,720
Well, yeah, well, he came here to show off, to break the drought, he had already discovered

375
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,260
the cloud buster prior.

376
00:22:54,060 --> 00:23:00,900
I'll mention one thing that you won't find on the internet, Wilhelm Reich was a nudist,

377
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:06,100
and Joe would tell me he hated that, because they'd arrived to the house that they built

378
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,680
that they were staying in, it was a lab in a place that he lived here in Tucson, Wilhelm

379
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,100
Reich did.

380
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:16,180
So Joe would go and unload the car, groceries or whatnot, and Wilhelm Reich's already in

381
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:19,900
the house, and Joe comes in with the groceries and all the supplies and whatever food that

382
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:23,820
they went out for, and there's Wilhelm Reich totally naked laying down on the couch with

383
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,220
a cigarette.

384
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,000
It wasn't even in the house two minutes, right?

385
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,980
So Joe didn't like it, he was, ah, I'm not into that, right?

386
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,920
So you know, whatever.

387
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:38,140
So it was quite aloof, and it was pleasant to be around from what I got.

388
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,540
All right, so that's pretty much the story of Wilhelm Reich, now, Trevor James Constable

389
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:49,040
had picked up on this, and Trevor James Constable knew, by the way, I'm not going to get into

390
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,880
how the cloud buster works, there's plenty of stuff online, it's basically pipes connected

391
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,180
to grounded in water, okay, there's many elaborate ways to build it.

392
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:02,200
Someone posted a picture of an aluminum one with rods and extended, in the chat, I did

393
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,100
not make that, no.

394
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:13,700
But Trevor was working on a merchant ship, he was a radar man, and he was playing around

395
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,720
with this in the ocean, it worked very successfully.

396
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,560
And he had running water and hoses and stuff on deck, and the captain said, you know, I'm

397
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,960
tired of this water running all over the place, you know, you got to keep a ship very tidy.

398
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,200
So he says, stop the operation, and that kind of bummed him out, but he's like, no, I have

399
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,740
to figure out a way to do it waterless.

400
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:38,260
So what he did, basically, you can find information about this also online, is Trevor James Constable

401
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:44,720
basically did the layering effect that you find in a orgone box, metal on one side, non-metal

402
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,560
on the outside, metal on the inside, non-metal on the outside, and started building these

403
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:54,100
things called translators, and evolved to the point where when you make a tube like

404
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:58,900
that, metallic on the inside, non-metallic on the outside, with a double mirror on the

405
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:03,540
end, you know, the business end is open, the back end is a double mirror, what I mean by

406
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:07,300
double mirror is, you know, a mirror facing inside the tube, and then a mirror on the backside

407
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,360
facing out, right?

408
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,920
And we'll simulate when you're moving on a moving vessel, and it worked well, he tried

409
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:18,640
many geometries and stuff, and now we've evolved it to the point where I say, we even

410
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:25,060
back then, and I still make them for people, even recently, someone, I sent one that was

411
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:29,840
about less than a foot long, two and a half inches in diameter, person sent me photographs

412
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:36,060
of a rainstorm, right, recently, with that device, and also you can do with towing, you

413
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:42,000
have to be on a moving, let's say, airplane or a car, it's more difficult in the car because

414
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,180
you're on the ground, less atmospheric effect.

415
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:50,980
What happens with these devices, call them P-guns, potential guns, I call them translators,

416
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:56,100
there's stuff online about that, there's a PDF you might be able to find, Loom of the

417
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:03,180
Future, it'll be posted in the chat as a PDF, it's called Loom of the Future, it's Thomas

418
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:09,420
Joseph Brown, it's basically a transcript of Thomas Joseph Brown of Borderlands, interviewing

419
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,380
Trevor James Constable.

420
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:16,040
But anyway, when you operate one of these in a car, you can make, actually the larger

421
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:19,960
they are, the better they work, but the small ones work well, well enough.

422
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:26,040
What you can do is tow a storm, so let's say you're in a, you're driving and it's raining,

423
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,320
and you know where you're going to, it's not going to be raining, or you turn around and

424
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:34,160
go back home, these devices will have the storm follow you home or wherever you go.

425
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,620
I call it towing, and so did Trevor, it's quite an interesting phenomenon, right?

426
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:43,960
So you could literally go to a place where it's raining and bring the rain to a place

427
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:48,380
where it's not raining, within a certain reason, because all these weather events, whether

428
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:53,900
it's a hurricane, a drizzle, a sunny day, are pulsations in the natural environment, right?

429
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,360
They have a buildup charging point, and then they discharge, right?

430
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,020
That's rain, basically, right?

431
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:04,600
So you have to understand that aspect of it.

432
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:09,740
Now, what is so interesting, this is working with what we call the ether, the soup that

433
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:14,540
we're in, we're in this stuff called the ether, which is not a stuff, it's an organization

434
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:22,800
of conditions that we call material, energy, our existence, and all that, and somehow,

435
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:32,640
the unbalanced capacitor, you know, the layering of metal and non-metal material, seems to excite

436
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,440
an area of influence, right?

437
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:38,240
Whether if it's a closed organ box, it'll be inside the box.

438
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:43,140
If it's open on one end and you can direct it, it'll excite the area where it's directed

439
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,200
towards, right?

440
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:52,300
And it excites it in a way that is not completely understood, but it's repeatable, and because

441
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:56,780
it's repeatable, if you're a really good observer, and you take notes of what's happening,

442
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,040
you make a list of effects, right?

443
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:05,820
And now you know what you can do with this device, and we call it the ether, right?

444
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,120
Because there's always a debate about it.

445
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:15,600
Now, with Trevor, he leaned very, very heavily on the dry devices, which is just basically

446
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:23,740
an orgone device, dry, but with conversations with him, he would call me sometimes, he would

447
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:27,800
watch a parade, and well, he knew like a holiday was coming, and there was going to

448
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,520
be a parade, and he'd call me, and he'd say, hey, you know, there's going to be a parade

449
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,940
in two days in New York, or whatever, why don't you make it rain on the parade?

450
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:38,360
And I was like, okay, there's no rain in the forecast, he says, yeah, I know, that's

451
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,260
why I'm calling you, because he was 90 years old at the time.

452
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,780
And I said, okay, so I make it rain, right, from Tucson to New York City, right?

453
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:54,720
So what, but on a call like that, we had already evolved to the point where I had conversations

454
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,160
prior with him, what device to use, and there's no substitute for a large water gun.

455
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:05,660
What I mean by a large water gun, a large water-based cloud buster, the kind of pictures that you

456
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:12,140
see where either multiple tubes, I think a large galvanized tube is more efficient.

457
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:20,740
You know how the geometry, pi D and pi R squared, right, the relationship of circles, right?

458
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,480
If you double the diameter of a circle, it's four times the area, right?

459
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:34,120
So like a four-inch or a six-inch stovepipe, a quality galvanized pipe, or like they use

460
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:38,140
it for air conditioning ducts, but the heavy ones, the wound ones, are far more efficient

461
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:41,640
than, let's say, a grouping of three-quarter or one-inch pipes.

462
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:45,480
And don't use copper, don't use, it should be, a magnet should stick to it, it should

463
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,520
be ferrous-based.

464
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:52,580
There are other things also, but copper doesn't work as well, that's another discussion.

465
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,920
So you're better off with the one with the larger diameter?

466
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,940
Yeah, more efficient, yes, in most cases, yes.

467
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:04,360
I do like the smaller diameter, they work well also, but not as efficient for portability,

468
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:07,380
because you can take them apart and have a small bundle of pipes, right?

469
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,080
Right.

470
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,840
And they're easier to break up into sections and couple them, and use couplings that fit

471
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,320
with friction than a large pipe.

472
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:20,620
So the smaller diameter are more efficient for packing on the go, and the larger diameter

473
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,380
is more efficient for just large field work.

474
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:29,960
The one that I predominantly use is an eight-inch pipe that's 12.5 feet long, on a tripod, it's

475
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:35,140
water-fed, it's water-fed with a mister, and it's grounded, there's a ground rod on one

476
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:41,180
of the hoses from the center body that goes down 10 feet, and there's another 10-foot

477
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:47,120
iron rod, it's actually a one-inch conduit, steel conduit, driven into the ground, and

478
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,060
it's filled with magnetite, and then I have wires that go from the bottom of that pipe

479
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,500
that's filled with magnetite, so you want a really good ground.

480
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:59,020
Just like if you read Tesla's Colorado papers, they couldn't get the experiments going until

481
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:04,120
you got a really good ground, the soil was too dry, so they had to dig these bores and

482
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:08,420
fill them with water for days to get lower the resistance, so you can get a good ground

483
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,060
into the earth.

484
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:16,160
So that's what I use and would use, and I've also done that to abate hurricanes, and whatever,

485
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,420
you can go through the earth.

486
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:25,920
So my experience with Trevor was, even like the stories I've heard from Joe Blankenship

487
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:31,080
about Wilhelm Reich, the internet is a good introduction point to get you a roundabout

488
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:35,420
working knowledge, maybe, but not enough to sort things out.

489
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:43,600
This is where you would need someone who knew Wilhelm Reich or Trevor to be in a community

490
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,700
situation where people can raise questions and whatever, because let's say you have

491
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,060
a group of people that want to do weather work, right?

492
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:53,600
They go online and research it, you'll find dozens of websites.

493
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,880
Some of them are pretty good, some are better than others, right?

494
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:00,960
I wouldn't say there are any bad ones, because they, you know, that are not, you know, maybe

495
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,420
whatever.

496
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,860
And you have a community of people interested in doing weather work based on Trevor James

497
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:11,460
Constable and Wilhelm Reich, just from internet, you're not going to, you can do, you'll be

498
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:16,040
able to make holes in clouds and you might make a bad weather, right, when it's unintended,

499
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,820
but you won't have the finesse and the understanding of what is really priority and what's not.

500
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:26,500
For example, if you research Trevor James Constable online, you will get the feeling

501
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:31,000
that you need to make these potential guns, you know, basically a metal tube wrapped with,

502
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:35,960
you know, a couple of feet long or a foot long, with a mirror on the back, and that's

503
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,740
the be all end all.

504
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,240
It's not.

505
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:42,900
You have to understand what you want to do, and what I want to bring up, and speaking about

506
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:48,840
this, with all the development that Trevor did over 50 years, let's say 35, 40 years

507
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:55,200
on the P guns, potential guns, the dry method, which is based on Wilhelm Reich's organ box.

508
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:01,200
He agreed every time that for a long distance or a big operation, you need to go back to

509
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:01,880
a water gun.

510
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,740
And the best and most efficient would be a large stovepipe type thing.

511
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:09,020
And this has been proven over and there's nothing like that.

512
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,140
You won't find that little bit of information online.

513
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:18,940
So what's important is to run into people that know Trevor and work with Trevor, Wilhelm

514
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:23,860
Reich, to give you not necessarily advice on what to do, but to at least say what they,

515
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:28,200
you know, those other people had said about it, right, and also from your own experience.

516
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:35,960
So but ultimately, my experience with Trevor was, when I first met him on the phone, he

517
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:40,460
was very standoffish, like, don't try to do weather work, you're just going to make bad

518
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:47,780
weather or won't work. Or, you know, by the time he passed away a few years later, he

519
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,400
was calling me to make bad weather.

520
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:54,820
But it was very not not in a way like just make bad weather, but like to target a parade

521
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:57,260
or something, right. Or stop the snow.

522
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:02,280
Another one was he called me and he said, you know, they're shutting down New York City.

523
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:08,699
This is in 2015 or 1615, I think, or 16, OK, the winter, they're shutting down New York

524
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:10,260
City because a big snowstorm is coming.

525
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,719
I said, is it so started yet?

526
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,860
Says, no, we'll be there tomorrow.

527
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,639
Why don't you do something about that?

528
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,699
Why don't you stop the snow?

529
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,620
And I did. I don't know if you remember, they even preemptively shut down New York.

530
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:26,420
And after that, the weather people got in trouble.

531
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:30,020
And it was very popular. So because we were using the European computer model, right?

532
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,080
Yes, I don't remember that in 2015.

533
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,080
Yeah, that's what that was.

534
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:35,480
Yeah, that's what Trevor calls me.

535
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,000
And he says, go ahead and do something.

536
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:37,940
Make stop the snow.

537
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:41,420
It might have been 16, 16, 16.

538
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,860
Yeah. So he would you know, there was like an Easter parade.

539
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:48,260
Once you rain on their parade, you know, and we rained on their parade.

540
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:53,480
Right. So but this is a full time job, you know, for it's going to take a day.

541
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,340
I mean, you really have to pay attention.

542
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:59,400
These devices, especially the water gun, you cannot lean into it.

543
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,600
And right. Called it drilling.

544
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:06,000
You cannot leave it in one place for too long because then the ether, the environment will

545
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,160
ignore it. Case in fact, if you look at houses that are being built, they have plenty of

546
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,440
these chimney stacks that are metal that go up vertically.

547
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,220
Right. Right. Those are ignored.

548
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,320
Those are not making weather.

549
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:21,880
Now, they will change the weather initially when you build suburban houses or a city

550
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,200
somewhere. The weather will change.

551
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,720
That's a fact. Very well known.

552
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:31,280
But because you have the same stovepipe as he has on his chimney or his hot water, his

553
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:39,020
water heater or his fireplace using the same thing and waving it around, he's doing the

554
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:45,000
same thing you are, because when you leave these devices stationary for too long, especially

555
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,560
I'm speaking mostly on the water grounded ones, the environment will ignore them.

556
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:57,340
Right. So you have to understand the subtleties of movement and the ebb and flow and

557
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:03,080
when to push. By the way, you can I think which it's clear is you can use these devices to

558
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,180
stop bad weather or to make bad weather, right?

559
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,520
Like, for example, tornadoes are some of the easiest things to make downwind.

560
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,940
Right. So.

561
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:18,140
But yeah, so it's a there's a wide gamut, but there's a lot of subtleties.

562
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:24,820
Now, if you have the Trevor's devices, the dry guns, the small translator tubes with the

563
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:30,500
mirror on the back, there is a benefit of aiming those horizontally or slightly up from

564
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:34,940
horizontal in a general direction to generally change the season slightly.

565
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,760
So if you know what's going to be, those can be left in position for as long as a week or

566
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:45,240
two. But the water guns cannot be left in the same position for more than 20 minutes to

567
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,460
an hour. You must move them.

568
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:52,340
Now, what I what I suggest about that is let's say you have you make a P gun, a translator,

569
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:56,320
which is basically a metal tube with non metal wrapped on the outside.

570
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:59,600
Trevor James Constable style with a double mirror on the back on a tripod.

571
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,540
Let's say, you know, it's going to be a cold winter, right?

572
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,220
Oh, it's going to be a cold winter.

573
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,520
Oh, no. You set one of these up.

574
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,480
It could even be indoors.

575
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,900
And you have it aim west.

576
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,180
And every day you nudge it a little bit towards the north.

577
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,300
You nudge it all towards the south for about two weeks.

578
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:22,060
Aiming west will whether this works, whether you're on northern or southern hemisphere.

579
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,000
Will create a slight warming trend.

580
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,440
And you're going to really baffle and change that.

581
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,840
Oh, it's going to be a really cold winter thing, although a really cold winter didn't

582
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,320
come. Right. So you can do it like that.

583
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,440
Another thing is, let's say, oh, it's going to be a really hot summer.

584
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,900
Heat waves coming. OK, well, you have a similar device on a tripod indoors.

585
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:47,720
It could be and you aim it east because when you aim it east, it creates a cooling trend

586
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:51,940
because it blocks things from passing slightly.

587
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:55,840
Right. And when you accumulate the ether, it has a cooling effect.

588
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,340
Right. When you rarify the ether, it has a heating effect.

589
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:06,200
Usually that's why deserts are places that are typically rarified ether.

590
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,980
And they're typically hot with a little bit of sun place like the rainforest, which is

591
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,360
concentrations of ether is typically cool.

592
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,920
Now, most people won't think so.

593
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:19,560
But if you're in a rainforest, it's hot and humid, but it's never as hot as it will be

594
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,760
in the Sahara or the Mojave Desert.

595
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:31,460
Right. So that's basically the small and long of it in a short way of what I got from

596
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:36,900
working with Trevor is a summary, basically, of that.

597
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:42,660
And I continue. I don't continuously do weather operations, but anyone can go online and

598
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,880
see what all that's about.

599
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:49,620
As a matter of fact, what spurred me on to do this is something someone posted greening up

600
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,060
things. It's a German website on.
