1
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:13,660
Apparently, that's what we're known as and 104 is this sonic event of rated Y.

2
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,600
So anyway, Greek, how are you doing?

3
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,980
Oh, I'm doing, you know, 104 is 41, right?

4
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,800
Not 14 on the palindrome.

5
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,600
Oh, well, I messed up.

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,200
Yeah, I looked at 14 zeros and ever factor in numerology.

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,680
Well, you could be 14.

8
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:33,240
No, couldn't it?

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,120
I mean, why is it more properly 41?

10
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:35,780
What do you think?

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,420
Because it's it's the way palindromes work.

12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,620
Oh, all right.

13
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:40,580
Fair enough.

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm not going to argue with you because I don't have a defense.

15
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:44,640
But that's fine.

16
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,560
We're recording now.

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,800
So we're going to go with it.

18
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,040
And because it's something that, you know, it gets dusty, right?

19
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,120
Yeah, I just want to bring something up.

20
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,020
You know, if you right now we have a really good orange crop and a really a really good

21
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,540
citrus crop, particularly lemons.

22
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,480
I'll post a picture of a basket of lemons and onions, by the way.

23
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,740
Is it time for oranges right now?

24
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,260
I thought oranges come later.

25
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,340
I thought it was after.

26
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,080
Yeah, it's a winter crop where it's warm, like in the southern like 30 latitude.

27
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,040
OK, yeah, yeah.

28
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,420
But you shouldn't have it if you're in New York, right?

29
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,980
No matter how much the medical technicians tell you, right, present it.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,880
So it doesn't work that way.

31
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,100
But because they always want to break it down to the chemical until you get the vitamin

32
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:26,800
C out of it.

33
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,800
But that's not what it's about.

34
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,120
No one knows what's in food.

35
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,840
No one knows what's in food.

36
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:40,660
That's why Rudolf Houshka, H.A., I guess it's H.A.U.S.H.K.A.

37
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,140
or Houshka, yeah, German studied.

38
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,280
He wondered why certain diseases and ailments were prevented when you eat certain foods

39
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,160
and you got those diseases and ailments if you didn't eat those foods like scurvy, right?

40
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:54,820
Oh, yes.

41
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,000
Things like sailors had to take things with them, you know, otherwise they would get ill.

42
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:03,900
And he says there's something in the food that's a vitality that can be that we could

43
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,340
examine and maybe extract.

44
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,340
And he worked on that.

45
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,040
And he says, well, it only works when the food is fresh and you have it within, you

46
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,540
know, a certain amount of time when you do the extractions.

47
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,960
But they said, hey, we could just tell the people, you know, you can extract nutrition

48
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,960
and vitality out of food.

49
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,300
We'll call it the vitamin industry.

50
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,020
So people that take these supplements, you do have to take a lot of them.

51
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:29,900
It's I'm not going to knock vitamin therapy because some people have gotten better with

52
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,200
it.

53
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,280
But the original research showed that it must be fresh.

54
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,580
So and of good quality.

55
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,000
But I want to mention onions.

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,060
Onions are one of those things.

57
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,840
We're talking about white onions, you know, the ones that are underground, not the green

58
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,380
spring onion.

59
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,840
It's a food that you can eat.

60
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,980
For example, you're usually look, if onions were hard to grow, they would be a delicacy

61
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:57,040
because there's nothing like onion and garlic that is such a harsh vegetable in its raw

62
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,860
state, no matter how you prepare it.

63
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:05,380
But when you heat it and cook it, it becomes as sweet as, you know, caramel or anything

64
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,140
else you could have.

65
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:06,400
Right.

66
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:12,160
So because of that quality, it would be considered a delicacy like truffles or whatever if it

67
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,920
was hard to grow.

68
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,200
But because it's not hard to grow, we take it for granted.

69
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:21,960
What I mean by that is raw onion, a white onion or red onion is more than most people

70
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,220
can handle because of this.

71
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:29,400
Again, it's supposedly, you know, you cut slicing onions and it makes you cry.

72
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,980
It's like a sulfur compound, you know, that can be measured at that point that does that

73
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,800
and a few other things.

74
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,760
If you can neutralize that, now you're making the onion more succulent in a sense.

75
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,220
And the way you neutralize that is go ahead and slice your onions thinner, thicker, however

76
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,500
you want to slice them in a bowl.

77
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:53,080
Uh, place them in a bowl and add a liberal amount of salt and a liberal amount of vinegar.

78
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,860
Lemon juice won't work.

79
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,480
I've tried this.

80
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,320
So vinegar, like a wine vinegar, balsamic vinegar, rice vinegar works the best.

81
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:07,760
And toss it and cover it and make a pressed salad with it for 15 minutes.

82
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,480
Pressed salad is like you ever see wilted lettuce, you know?

83
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:12,920
Yeah.

84
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,640
Yeah.

85
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:13,940
OK.

86
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,260
So the way you make a pressed salad, you have two saucers.

87
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:21,280
You just put the, uh, the, the onion on one saucer and place the other saucer on top of

88
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,600
the weight to push on the onions, right?

89
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:28,200
If you don't want to do that, you could put a piece of cling wrap over the onions and

90
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,300
then put another plate, you know, just to press them.

91
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,720
Or you could put them in one of those resealable Ziploc type bags and roll up the bag real

92
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,040
tight.

93
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,380
Put it under, you know, under your armpit or something.

94
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:37,880
I don't know.

95
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,460
I'm just joking.

96
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,220
Put some pressure on it for about 15 minutes.

97
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:41,860
OK.

98
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,180
The salt in the vinegar will neutralize that.

99
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,220
How would you call it?

100
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,620
Obtrusive onion or offensive onion flavor.

101
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,560
If you seal it really tight, it seems like the onion lets off.

102
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,000
That has nothing to do with sealing.

103
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,400
This has to do with neutralizing it.

104
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:00,780
Well, yeah.

105
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,140
But since you mentioned it in the salt.

106
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:02,420
Right.

107
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,360
But since you mentioned it.

108
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,640
By the way, you don't even have to press it.

109
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,320
You can just toss it.

110
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,740
You mix it with a fork for about 30 seconds.

111
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,620
That'll do it, too.

112
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,420
But when you press it, it almost acts like a mild pickling.

113
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,760
So try that, by the way.

114
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,660
And so if you end up with a 50 pound bag of organic onions that you don't know what to

115
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,940
do with, you can make an onion relish like this.

116
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,280
Right.

117
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,980
You know how you serve salt.

118
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,200
You see how like in Mexican food they have a salsa, which is fresh chopped tomato, onion,

119
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,260
pepper, things like that.

120
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:32,600
Right.

121
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,840
I've made something like that tonight with a lot of onion, a little bit of tomato and

122
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,580
some, you know, the salt and vinegar mixture.

123
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,620
It was you can basically eat it.

124
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:46,660
If someone walked into the room and saw you eating that copious amount of onion like that,

125
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,500
they'll say, wow, this guy is a monster.

126
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,260
Right.

127
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,780
Because who the hell can eat onion like that?

128
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:50,940
Right.

129
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,080
Well, it was wonderful.

130
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,540
It stuck with me all my life.

131
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,400
I had one uncle that used to eat a red onion like an apple, literally, like he would.

132
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,600
So he was probably a monster in that category, but not necessarily.

133
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,320
But what I'm saying is I've never brought this up.

134
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,800
This is just one of these simple things that I do.

135
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,500
And people that know me feel it.

136
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,340
That's fantastic.

137
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,220
When I do it, they're like, oh, my gosh, this is onion.

138
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,060
Oh, my gosh.

139
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,780
You know, it's like doesn't taste it's not it's not offensive at all.

140
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,820
It's actually quite delicious.

141
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,680
So I just wanted to bring that up.

142
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,960
So you take away a lot of the sharpness of the onion and you make it more and more qualities

143
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,100
of an onion and only the pleasant qualities are left when you combine it with salt and

144
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,420
vinegar and a little bit of time.

145
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,020
Time as in T.I.M.E.

146
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:35,940
Not the herb.

147
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,160
It needs it needs a few minutes to neutralize.

148
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,660
OK, no, but what I'm saying is, I mean, if you really neutralize it, you're left with

149
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,200
like a sweet kind of like very much.

150
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:45,460
Yeah.

151
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:49,500
All of the things that we consider the pleasant aspects of onion.

152
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:54,380
This is kind of like a miracle method because you're left with all the good stuff and all

153
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,280
the things that are typically offensive go away.

154
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,160
It's amazing.

155
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,600
And it is quite amazing when you prepare, let's say, a raw salad with a lot of white

156
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:09,140
onion and it's visible and people will look at that and they're like, I don't want any

157
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:09,520
of that.

158
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:09,780
Right.

159
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,120
Because they're used to the offense.

160
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,040
And whoever tries it is like, oh, my gosh, this is absolutely delicious because you're

161
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,460
getting the onion flavor without any offense.

162
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,600
So try that.

163
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,340
Well, what I did, I did.

164
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:28,300
I made the Roma one Roma tomato to an onion, which is a very crappy proportion, because

165
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:32,820
you would only use if you had an onion and you try to make a salad with just tomato,

166
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,380
you'd need like five tomatoes to balance out that onion.

167
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:35,680
Right.

168
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,280
Usually.

169
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:36,560
Yeah.

170
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:41,260
So this was this was an onion and a small medium onion and a small tomato.

171
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,460
And it balanced that was actually quite delicious.

172
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:49,240
I had that with a side of baby kale and baby spinach tossed with balsamic vinegar and slight

173
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,680
and shavings of Parmesan cheese.

174
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,220
You're talking about one of those little oblong tomatoes, right?

175
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,900
Yeah, they're firm.

176
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:00,020
They usually make them usually for sauce because they don't have a lot of seeds.

177
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:05,460
They were yeah, they're more of the vertical type, not the center of the round type.

178
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:05,900
I understand.

179
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,380
Yeah, yeah.

180
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,220
That's what I was picturing.

181
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,180
OK, the longer.

182
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:08,500
Yeah.

183
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,880
The aspect ratio is.

184
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,160
Yeah, I've seen some long that some that look like a small banana.

185
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,320
Sometimes it depends on, you know, the variety.

186
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:15,600
Right.

187
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:19,440
It almost comes out like a like a miniature squash, you know, like a miniature squash.

188
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:20,380
Yeah.

189
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,620
It's not round.

190
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,340
Yeah.

191
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:30,120
So I had that and with a two inch thick porterhouse steak that was slow, low and slow, 150 degrees

192
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,720
for an hour.

193
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:36,559
It was left out for about 30 hours, salted with a fan on it to dry it.

194
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,320
So you use your onion relishes like a condiment in this case.

195
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:44,460
Yeah, well, a condiment was actually a horseradish with lemon juice.

196
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,840
Yeah, that's another thing.

197
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:51,400
If you enjoy horseradish, if you can either grate it, some of the varieties that are coming

198
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,320
in a jar are very good.

199
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,040
Add some lemon juice to it.

200
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:54,560
Squeeze a lemon.

201
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,380
You'll see what happens.

202
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,340
It just turns the notch up, turns it up in terms of the flavor of the horseradish.

203
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,180
Yeah, just really delicious.

204
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:05,200
No starches, you know, just some greens and gardens doing really well.

205
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,100
And yeah.

206
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,080
So this season here.

207
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,580
Yeah, I used to like a little bit of almost a thousand island mix with the I know it sounds

208
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:14,740
good.

209
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:18,480
Nobody likes thousand island dressing that thousand island would also be the ketchup

210
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,360
mayo relish.

211
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:19,760
Combinator.

212
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,540
They call it they call it Russian dressing back east, don't they?

213
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,240
As some well, some people used to.

214
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,800
But, you know, to me, no, it's Russian.

215
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,020
What is the thousand?

216
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,920
Is that white and creamy or no, no, you had it right the first time.

217
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,080
Mustard.

218
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:36,120
Basically, if you put mustard, excuse me, if you put a little ketchup, a little mayonnaise

219
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,880
and a little bit of relish together, you've got the basics for it.

220
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,020
Right.

221
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,420
Yeah, that's good with iceberg lettuce.

222
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,980
But I like taking that and then putting some horseradish in that.

223
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,700
You know what I mean?

224
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,720
Yeah, you could for spice.

225
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:47,240
Yeah.

226
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,440
And then when I do sushi at home, I can't find I like that.

227
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,720
That's why I like that on steak myself personally.

228
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,220
I know.

229
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:55,580
Oh, yeah.

230
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,500
It's horseradish.

231
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:56,700
Yeah.

232
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,360
Balances out the yin and yang, the root.

233
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:58,640
Right.

234
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,560
I do.

235
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,480
We get sushi, great fish, typically yellowtail tuna salmon here.

236
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,460
And I make it at home because I'm just not happy with what I get out.

237
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,660
It's way better than what they serve in the restaurants.

238
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,420
I think I posted pics quite a bit.

239
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,780
I can't get Japanese horseradish here.

240
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,980
And the one that you can get is powdered form and it has algae in it.

241
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,540
Actually, did you post pictures of that roll in the chat room that you made?

242
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,400
The actual roll?

243
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,300
Yeah, I made a roll the other day.

244
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,060
I didn't post it.

245
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,560
But yeah, it looks like a hockey.

246
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,780
Well, the one that you made like a couple of months ago that you showed me pictures of,

247
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,720
I was like, it's a very, I mean, tightly professional looking roll.

248
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:34,520
You know, it looks like.

249
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,520
Yeah, you got it.

250
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,040
Yeah, right.

251
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,960
You got your bamboo mat and all that.

252
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,000
But yeah.

253
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So anyway, sorry.

254
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:40,280
Go ahead.

255
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,480
What I do is I use the standard horseradish instead of the green.

256
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,480
And it works just as well.

257
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,080
You know, they call it wasabi in Japan.

258
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,040
I can't get fresh wasabi here.

259
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,940
For some reason, I might be able to order it or find someone who can send me some and

260
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:55,700
try to grow it.

261
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,300
But I use the standard horseradish, which is the same family, just like white onion and

262
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,700
red onion are in the same family.

263
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:02,980
Right?

264
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:03,340
Right.

265
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,440
So anyway, that's the food talk.

266
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,580
By the way, before we started recording, you got on and saying that there's stuff

267
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,440
going on in the news.

268
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,360
You want to you want to just fill me in on that?

269
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,260
Yeah, absolutely.

270
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:18,120
Well, what we got going on at the moment is apparently, you know, according to reports

271
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,400
right now, again, I'm not saying this is the day.

272
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:20,800
What is it?

273
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,360
The middle of April twenty twenty four on the Pope's work schedule on the Pope's work

274
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:24,720
schedule.

275
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,080
Right.

276
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:30,860
What we're looking at here is what we're about to enter the 14th, depending on what

277
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,040
part of the world you're in.

278
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,660
We're on the 13th where we are on the Pope's work schedule of April.

279
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,040
Right.

280
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,400
Which is the fourth month on their work schedule.

281
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,640
So but, you know, nearly tax day.

282
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:42,900
Right.

283
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,120
Nearly the 15th of April.

284
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,360
That's your normal tax day.

285
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,240
All that good stuff.

286
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:46,540
OK.

287
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:55,080
And, you know, this Friday, apparently this Friar's Day kicked off attacks that were

288
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,880
allegedly launched from Iran directly.

289
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,020
But they're drone strikes.

290
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,160
It's not conventional warfare, but drone strikes.

291
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,100
And they're being directed at Israel.

292
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:07,220
And now everybody's watching to see what the White House response is.

293
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,360
There are people from the Pentagon talking about containment and how they don't want the

294
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,180
region to become completely involved.

295
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,420
The entire region.

296
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,340
Right.

297
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,440
Which is it's too late for that because we talked about that nine years ago.

298
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,340
Well, that plus for six months now, allegedly, there's been this activity that was kicked

299
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,480
off from October on their calendar.

300
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,880
You know, this event that took place that was supposed to be a, quote, terrorist attack,

301
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,260
end quote, from Gaza into Israel.

302
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:43,300
Anyway, what's happening now is apparently Iran is making these moves with drone strikes.

303
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,740
And this is making, you know, the usual.

304
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,780
And by the way, it's Iran.

305
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,600
Iran is not an Arabian country.

306
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,440
They're not Arab.

307
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:55,860
They're basically similar to Farsi extraction, like the Afghanistan.

308
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:01,140
So when you look at it from a cultural perspective, I want people to think of it that way, not

309
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,600
like although geographically Persia.

310
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:03,940
Yeah.

311
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,000
Geographically, though, was part of Persia.

312
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,480
But the people that are there.

313
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,080
Sure, sure.

314
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:17,140
But the people in terms of in terms of I would say like Mexican versus Spanish from Europe,

315
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,600
it's even more of a difference than that.

316
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:19,840
Right.

317
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,220
Because the language is different.

318
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:21,920
Yes, very.

319
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:22,160
Yeah.

320
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,660
It's in other words, it's a completely different culture than the, quote, unquote, Arab Israeli

321
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,180
conflict.

322
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,740
They're not Arabic.

323
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,340
Well, should we bring that up?

324
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:36,360
What the what the thing is, the common idea is that Iran is the backer of all of these

325
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:36,880
other groups.

326
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:37,160
Right.

327
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,860
So when I do not.

328
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,760
Well, but I'm just telling you the narrative.

329
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,760
I'm not saying that's true.

330
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,380
But they say that they back Hamas.

331
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,080
They back Hezbollah.

332
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,360
They back Boko Haram.

333
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,280
They back every one of them.

334
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,740
They basically say basically for the public.

335
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,940
According to the public, all of the financial backing for every terrorist group that has

336
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:01,040
ever been given a name, you know, basically, I could tell you this.

337
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,980
I can't prove it.

338
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:10,680
But from seeing people who I've seen years now, everyone thinks the U.S. is Israel's

339
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,400
biggest ally.

340
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,060
Yeah, commercially it is.

341
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:21,180
But the biggest ally financially of Israel is Persia is the is Iran in terms of how would

342
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:25,440
you call the under mess, the black stuff that happens, that runs the stuff?

343
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:32,160
It's the black world, you know, versus the vanilla world, you know, the non what would

344
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,540
you call non normal, the non meet mainstream world, the underground, the underground.

345
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:37,840
Yeah.

346
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,560
That's what Greece is the wheels of the of the mainstream, by the way.

347
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:48,220
Just like, for example, if you go to a mainstream person's party, if they want to get, quote,

348
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,900
unquote, illegal drugs, they all somehow they're able to find it.

349
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,200
Right.

350
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:52,680
Of course.

351
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,700
So, yeah.

352
00:14:53,760 --> 00:15:00,760
So in terms of the black world, Persia and Iran and Israel are very, very close, closer

353
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:05,720
than the U.S., by the way, because in the black world, in the underground world that

354
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,560
the U.S. and the Israeli interests are in competition.

355
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,780
But in the mainstream world, it's the it's the opposite.

356
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,920
So I just find that to be very interesting.

357
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:22,260
And I can tell you the experience from that comes from Mossad in Tokyo.

358
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,860
Now, they've really publicly cracked down on the Yakuza, which is the old Yakuza, but

359
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,020
the new Yakuza is the new Yakuza, which runs the underworld in Japan.

360
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,420
OK, amongst the Yakuza without because they're not isolationist.

361
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,120
There are two other groups that work dynamically in Tokyo.

362
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,860
And Tokyo is bigger than like half the countries in the world.

363
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,080
Right.

364
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,340
You know, just the city itself.

365
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,760
That's 50 million, 60 million people in Tokyo.

366
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:54,000
You know, an odd headline, too, which is not, you know, at the at the apex of the current

367
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,220
media headlines is this new thing where they're trying to encourage Japan to stop with this

368
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,180
purity of blood issue.

369
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,680
But that's which again, Main Street.

370
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,080
Yeah.

371
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,580
But it's weird because it seems like an odd time to be talking about, hey, look, you

372
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:08,860
know what?

373
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:13,780
They're starting to act like they're the master race again, which is part of the trope.

374
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:16,580
But they are in a way, you know, give an example.

375
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,220
If you go to Japan today, food prices have not gone up in five years like they have

376
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:20,920
everywhere else.

377
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:21,540
Right.

378
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:22,980
They haven't doubled.

379
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:28,540
So anyway, they have a different the most people's pets in Tokyo live better than most

380
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,720
average Americans do.

381
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,300
But OK, so let me just go back to this.

382
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,480
So the under the Yakuza share the underworld with the Mossad.

383
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:40,300
Electronics prices, by the way, even the Chinese electronics that are imported from elsewhere

384
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,140
and everything else are at a fraction of the cost in Japan.

385
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:43,660
Sure.

386
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,000
Sure.

387
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:48,440
And like broadband, what they pay for a cell phone and Internet access is less than a

388
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,600
fifth of what is paid here.

389
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,640
But they're paying like twenty dollars for stuff that we're paying a hundred dollars.

390
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,440
Yeah, yeah.

391
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,080
Pretty much.

392
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:54,320
Yeah.

393
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,680
The same in Malaysia, by the way, which is another tech capital.

394
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,500
And by the way, a computer, no computer, no problem.

395
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,319
Like brand new top of the line stuff that you pay twelve hundred two thousand dollars for

396
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,980
here is two hundred bucks there.

397
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,220
Just say it can be.

398
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:07,480
Yeah.

399
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:07,760
Yeah.

400
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,260
All right.

401
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:12,500
So they share the underworld with the Israeli Mossad and the Persian mob.

402
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,880
The Persian underworld.

403
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,819
Those are the three players that pretty much run the underworld in Tokyo.

404
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,420
Can I prove it?

405
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,180
Do I have certificates to show?

406
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:22,760
No.

407
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:28,120
I'm just telling you from what I've heard and seen since my spring two days in L.A.

408
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,120
How would I say?

409
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,460
Let me give a short story.

410
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,400
You're going to do any off the books business in Asia.

411
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:41,340
Here's a guarantee you are at some point going to have to encounter someone who is connected

412
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,220
to that.

413
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,540
Well, let me just give a short story that might help my perspective.

414
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:45,940
Sure.

415
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:52,940
We were able to via studying Victor Schauberger, by the way, Sam reached out to Victor Schauberger's

416
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:57,620
grandson at the PKS PKS Institute.

417
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,240
I think it's in Austria.

418
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,880
And the grandson responded and he's interested in what we're doing.

419
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,720
Quite interesting.

420
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,560
That's that's that's a really good thing to put on your CV.

421
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,460
You know, the scale.

422
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,400
Yeah, he's interested in that.

423
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:10,620
Yeah.

424
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,920
So we'll see.

425
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,260
We're having active correspondence right now.

426
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,740
So that's really cool.

427
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,980
That's really, really cool.

428
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:17,320
Sorry.

429
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,000
Which institute did you say that was?

430
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,520
PKS.

431
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,360
PKS.

432
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:21,680
OK.

433
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:22,200
Yeah.

434
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,040
Victor Schauberger's grandson runs that.

435
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,040
And I was also in Kurt Hallberg was another water guy in Sweden.

436
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,600
He invited me to go out there.

437
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,160
They meet once clandestinely once a year.

438
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:33,900
I said, no, no, no.

439
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,240
It's all right.

440
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,900
Do a video if you want to.

441
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,000
They don't speak any English, you know.

442
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,460
Anyway, OK.

443
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:45,860
So when I was doing the the the only person publicly to show a Victor Schauberger water

444
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,280
spring water synthesizer.

445
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,080
Publicly show it and put it in action.

446
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:56,000
We were bottling water at ten dollars a quart and we were selling it at places like Erewhon,

447
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:00,300
which is a very prestigious health food store.

448
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:04,080
It's so prestigious that the tour buses in L.A. stop there as well.

449
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,860
That's one of the things places sites to see on a tour bus for L.A.

450
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,660
Right, right.

451
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:14,080
Another place we sold that was Rossum when it got shut down, when the feds busted them

452
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,880
for selling raw milk, which was an illegal bus because it's a private club.

453
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:24,800
Anyway, the vice president of Japan Airlines, his contacts got our water and he started

454
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,460
putting doing the math on it.

455
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:32,080
And the story got back to me through an Israeli person that lived in Tokyo that did a whole

456
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:38,920
bunch of business who had very strong Iranian contacts, also money contacts, all working

457
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,340
together.

458
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,320
And the story goes like this.

459
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,960
Well, the first time we served the water to the Israeli Mossad guy.

460
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:45,700
Did I say that?

461
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:45,940
No.

462
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,340
He says, you guys are a bunch of liars because you're putting cocaine in the water.

463
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,700
I was laughing because it was so vibrant, like he took it.

464
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,860
I said, first of all, how would you know what cocaine tastes like?

465
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,080
Right.

466
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,080
So, right.

467
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,620
When someone says, right, it tastes like an illicit drug.

468
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,240
Well, how would you know?

469
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,260
I'm sure it's cocaine.

470
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,140
Well, that means you have a point of reference.

471
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:10,180
By the way, PKS, just for somebody who's unfamiliar completely, I'll give you the simple

472
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:10,560
phrase.

473
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,700
Comprehend and copy.

474
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,440
Nature is the basic fundamental principle.

475
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,500
The Shawberger stuff.

476
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:16,860
Yeah.

477
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:21,660
B-I-K-T-O-R-S-C-H-A-U-R-B-E-R.

478
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,460
I think Shawberger.

479
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,580
B-E-R-G-E-R.

480
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,280
B-E-R-G-E-R.

481
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,360
Yeah.

482
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,440
Berg means mountain.

483
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,120
Right.

484
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,080
So, anyway, they started doing the math on this.

485
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,900
And the story got back to me was this.

486
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:41,220
If you go down to the main ports, the shipping ports in Japan, every day you'll see shipping

487
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:46,740
containers unloading many containers of bottled water from all over the world to serve to

488
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,680
the Japanese people.

489
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:48,260
Okay.

490
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:53,660
And he said that this tap water that we were synthesizing, the way I was, the technique

491
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:59,160
that we had, was way far superior than any bottled water.

492
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,540
Way superior.

493
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,200
Not just, you know, slightly, but way superior.

494
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:09,040
And far superior to any springs that he's ever had, other than maybe once in his life

495
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,780
he had a spring that might have been equal to that.

496
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:17,540
That if it all is required is this device, it's a string of devices, it's three devices

497
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,020
basically.

498
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:21,680
You could put them on a pallet in a forklift and move them, you know, wrap them up and

499
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,080
ship them on a pallet.

500
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,300
Right?

501
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,020
Let's say, right?

502
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:24,280
Okay.

503
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:24,980
So it's very portable.

504
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:31,300
So we could set up a station somewhere and take the Japanese institute of in-place water

505
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:35,160
and convert it to this and serve it.

506
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,720
And we eliminate the cost of shipping and bottling and all this other stuff that has to be brought

507
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,060
over.

508
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:40,600
Yeah.

509
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,040
One time you ship a pallet one place, one time, that saves you a whole lot from having

510
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,320
to constantly import bottles.

511
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,220
No, well, I meant the pallet, the equipment fits on the pallet.

512
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:49,620
Okay.

513
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:53,520
The equipment to make the water, but then you can make thousands and thousands of gallons

514
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,580
of water a day with it.

515
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:54,780
Right?

516
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,220
Well, that's the point is if you import it to another location, just import the equipment.

517
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,160
Yeah, well now you don't need the water itself to be shipped from France or Sweden or Switzerland

518
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:03,700
or whatever.

519
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,580
They can take their own water and convert it to the super high quality water.

520
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:14,520
And he was looking around for investors to give to, and my answer was, I don't want any

521
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,620
investment money because I don't know how to run this particular water business.

522
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,700
This is something unusual.

523
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,440
This is not the regular water business.

524
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,240
This is something different.

525
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:27,500
And so the only way to grow what I'm doing is just buy more water.

526
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,000
I don't need money.

527
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,700
We don't not looking to invest.

528
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,140
We don't know what to do with it.

529
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,740
You know, it's like we don't know how to grow this because it has nothing to do with the

530
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,660
typical model, bottled water model that exists.

531
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,680
This is completely different.

532
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,660
So we need to sell more water and we'll learn that way.

533
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:49,280
Well, it turns out these guys were making a lot of rounds to disturb the bottled water

534
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,780
industry in Japan, and I was at the center of it.

535
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,660
Now, here's the thing.

536
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:59,200
You don't have to even be good at math or know a lot about history.

537
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:05,280
Just watch some old movies and you will find out that most of the mobster movies somehow,

538
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,460
except for the Godfather or whatever, maybe the Godfather 2 implied it, always end up

539
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,440
somewhere at the loading docks, don't they?

540
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,880
Yes, there's always a mobsters are always near the loading dock.

541
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:18,040
So now why are they to load?

542
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,120
Because they get a cut from things getting moved.

543
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,180
So now we have containers that no longer are going to be unloaded.

544
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,740
And oops, do you see where I'm going with this?

545
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,560
Well, yeah, even during World War Two.

546
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:30,960
Right.

547
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:36,560
What was the deal that was struck with my great great uncle Sal, who history would remember

548
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,000
as Lucky Luciano?

549
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,620
Why is it they let him out of prison?

550
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,980
Well, because he helped them out with the dogs.

551
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,440
Yes.

552
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,420
Speaking of just to go on a little segue here.

553
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:52,260
You only hear about the battles, sort of what people don't know.

554
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,660
It's like, was it a quarter of a million Americans?

555
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:59,840
Half a million Americans died in the U.S. from sabotage in the U.S., like factories

556
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,280
exploding, bombs, fuel depots, all this other stuff.

557
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,400
You don't hear any of that.

558
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:10,300
You hear about Americans dying on the beaches of attacks and stuff like that.

559
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,240
If you do read about.

560
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:11,760
Yeah.

561
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,200
If you do read about that, it's called an industrial accident.

562
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,360
And they state that there was some accident at the shipping port or at a warehouse where

563
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,680
suddenly a factory burst into flames and it happened to blow up this other place.

564
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:22,960
Yeah.

565
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:23,840
Yeah.

566
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,040
There's a lot of I mean, like there's Torpedo Alley.

567
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,920
Five thousand ships were sunk.

568
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,940
You don't hear about that.

569
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,260
Right.

570
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:30,920
Right.

571
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,540
You know, on the East Coast.

572
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,220
Yeah.

573
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,460
West Coast, too.

574
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:42,180
I knew I pulled out of that because now if you know these shipping containers and ships

575
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:46,420
are no longer coming to Japan to unload, someone is going to lose, quote, unquote,

576
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,060
their what would you call it?

577
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:48,580
Their cut.

578
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:49,440
Yeah.

579
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,100
Right.

580
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,000
And that wouldn't be a good thing.

581
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:57,640
That's what came back to me eventually, is that this is in place because of other things

582
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,380
that are in place.

583
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:58,640
Right.

584
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,620
It's sort of like the initial pressures on some state lotteries.

585
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:07,140
Don't bring the lottery in because you're going to cut into the numbers business that

586
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,100
already exists.

587
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:09,420
That's right.

588
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:14,680
So anyway, from all these machinations, I learned a lot about the underworld in Japan because

589
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,560
of the interest there.

590
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:20,520
And by the way, if you have high quality stuff, like, for example, there's a speaker company

591
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,660
called Magico, Ilan Wolf.

592
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:29,340
And he made his money in the 80s with his brother selling security systems to the wealthy

593
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,420
people in L.A. and stuff like that.

594
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:36,180
A lot, like in the 50, 100 million range, which is a lot in the 80s.

595
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,960
So he opened a really high end speaker manufacturing.

596
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,120
It's called Magico, M-A-G-I-C-O.

597
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,980
You can buy a pair of speakers for nearly a million, whatever.

598
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:53,200
I don't think they sound that good, but they're considered the best speakers in the world.

599
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:59,560
Anyway, these top of the line flagship speakers, I think there's only two that were sold in

600
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,640
America and like 15 that went to Asia.

601
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,760
So do you see my point?

602
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:11,500
So if you have an elitist, upper crusty product, Asia is your market, right?

603
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,020
Right.

604
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:21,060
So actually speaking, and we're talking 2011, 2012, when this was going on, 2010 even.

605
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:27,820
I knew that that was a fact without giving a direct analogy like with Elon and Magico.

606
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:32,020
In other words, a lot of the top of the line products that are made in America are not

607
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,560
sold to Americans, they're sold to people in China and Japan.

608
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,740
Yeah, so I just wanted to bring that up.

609
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,560
So just tie that back to what's going on.

610
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:47,520
Breshears, again, to bring up archaics, he talks about the second seal being peace taken

611
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,560
from the earth with small arms conflict and all that.

612
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:54,520
Yeah, I pretty much see he made a pretty good point of that.

613
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:01,660
Combine that with since 2009 or 10, since I've been on the internet, I talked about

614
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,820
seven year periods.

615
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:07,660
Breshears talks about the four year Olympiad, but I also talked about the four and a half

616
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,420
year because that's the middle of the seven year period.

617
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:20,120
I also discussed on Sonics with you, 2017 to 2024 being another period and another period

618
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,980
starting in the spring of 2025.

619
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,840
And by then, the Middle East will be in the news every day and a center focus in the world

620
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,000
and look for that.

621
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:33,960
So things going on in the Middle East, especially the thing that chalks up as being a little

622
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:40,300
more advantageous to focusing on like what I talked about in Breshears and all that

623
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:43,720
and all the talk behind the scenes, not what the mainstream people are saying, but what

624
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:49,780
I if you've listened to old Greek speak, I did keep bringing up 2024 2025 as the Middle

625
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,480
East as being a big deal.

626
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,220
Right.

627
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,940
Which is years ago and being very relaxed about it, which is why I've gotten messages

628
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:59,100
recently about, you know, is this still on time?

629
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:02,380
This idea that you had about the way the union.

630
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,400
But but but here's the thing about it.

631
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,460
There's nothing that can be done about it.

632
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:08,720
Right.

633
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:14,260
And the thing is, are you involved in anything you whoever's listening that have business,

634
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:19,300
family, whatever affairs or whatever, you know, any business affairs, personal affairs

635
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,780
that has to do with that area.

636
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:24,560
You we've talked about it for many years now.

637
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:24,880
Right.

638
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,120
So it shouldn't be a surprise.

639
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,760
And hopefully, if you some people might have more intensive, like, for example, again,

640
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:35,540
when I was in L.A., I gave the typical Greek speak on what's coming in the Middle East.

641
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:39,900
And there was a pretty wealthy Palestinian lady that has a jewelry business in Beverly

642
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,260
Hills.

643
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,400
Now, there's a lot of people that have jewelry businesses and stuff.

644
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:46,380
But when you have a storefront in Beverly Hills and your palate, you know, you're pretty

645
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,260
well off.

646
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,020
Right to do.

647
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,380
And most of her family was in Palestine.

648
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,540
And she took what I was saying very, very seriously.

649
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,780
And I said, well, there's no reason to get upset.

650
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,720
You have about nine or 10 years.

651
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:01,260
This is nine or 10 years ago to do something about it.

652
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,060
You see what I mean?

653
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,860
OK, so that's the value in this.

654
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,420
If you feel like you have to do something now, it's it's now you're getting swallowed

655
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:12,000
up into the fear mode and all that.

656
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,520
No, it's a little late, too.

657
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:19,200
I mean, look, the best time to get out of the way of the, you know, the oncoming train

658
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,580
is to not be on the tracks.

659
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,360
You bet.

660
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,280
It's still a bet.

661
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,700
Like, you know, who's this guy is the only one talking about it.

662
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,000
Right.

663
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,900
You know, so you have to weigh it out yourself personally.

664
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:31,080
If it's not meant for you to weigh it out and to go through some tragedy or whatever

665
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,140
because of it, then that's that's fine, too.

666
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:39,540
So but yeah, this is all talked about it a while back.

667
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,540
Was this accurate?

668
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,560
The the the events are going to be I'm not one hundred percent sure, because, again,

669
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,320
I'm going off off the biblical information, which is quite sparse.

670
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:53,580
Well, do you still feel as though we're looking at something coming called the Assyrian?

671
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,700
Yeah, OK.

672
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,240
Because that was that was the thing there.

673
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,280
That was the key thing that everybody prompt.

674
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:05,760
And the logic behind that is a civil war in Iraq that was split off.

675
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:14,480
Now, ancient Assyria had parts of Turkey and parts of Syria and parts of Iraq.

676
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:18,120
Geographically, geographically, in order for it to come back.

677
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:24,040
It has to somehow retreat, somehow dominate and, you know, gain those territories,

678
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,020
territories as part of the country.

679
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,000
And years ago, I talked about watch.

680
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,780
Syria will be in the news and watch.

681
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,920
Turkey will be everything.

682
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,160
All that has happened also.

683
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:39,280
So, yeah, it's not a big deal once, you know, because I'm actually kind of tired to talk

684
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:44,300
about it because I don't have any more information other than the little sparse stuff that you get

685
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:44,760
in the Bible.

686
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,540
And it's basically just extrapolating off of like a single verse.

687
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,260
Right.

688
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,160
What does that mean?

689
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,460
And you have to parse it out to where else you can make connections.

690
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:57,760
But I'm happy with what I've said.

691
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:02,460
And I'm always open if we're here to learn like this person, someone comes up with more

692
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,600
information or better information, obviously go with that.

693
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:10,060
And the only person that I could see that speaking on that note would be Jason Breshears

694
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:15,000
of Archaics to supplement stuff that I've said, right, regarding the Middle East.

695
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,060
Right, right.

696
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:20,020
Because I think the point that he made on the second seal and the first seal is pretty

697
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:20,500
solid.

698
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:21,840
It's pretty good.

699
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,540
I like it.

700
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,700
You know, and, you know, you've known me for a while.

701
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,660
People have heard me speak for a long time now.

702
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,380
I rarely say that.

703
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,840
So you got to give credit where credit is due.

704
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,700
And it's based strictly on merit.

705
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,900
So, you know, whether it's you want to consider it purely academic, that's fine.

706
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,420
But see how it pans out.

707
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,140
Well, here's the thing to consider geographically.

708
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:42,480
Right.

709
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:48,220
I mean, there are loose ideas about what the borders are currently as compared to what

710
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:48,920
they used to be.

711
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:53,800
So when one looks at Iran, which is in the headlines currently, right, you can see that

712
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,500
it directly borders Iraq, which we all know because of the Iran-Iraq conflict.

713
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:57,740
Sure.

714
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:02,120
It's just slightly adjacent to Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan.

715
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,480
But they don't really live that.

716
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,140
OK.

717
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:09,860
The concept of borders is something when the English went in there and did all these

718
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:14,320
Mohammedan treaties, you know, and that's why all their flags have red, white and green

719
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,100
and all that.

720
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:15,440
Yeah.

721
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:18,420
So their concept of borders is very different than the Western.

722
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:23,780
They are, let's use the word tribal, but not in the way that Westerners think of it.

723
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:27,980
They are like a tribal way to say it.

724
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,800
Basically, the borders are not federal like they are in other places.

725
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,820
They're more tribal.

726
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:36,540
Right.

727
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:40,720
By bloodline, there's a subnationalistic culture.

728
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,000
So you have the overall Persians.

729
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,460
OK, this is like Italy that we look at modern Italy.

730
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:51,000
Most people don't know that Italy has a lot of subnational groups.

731
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:51,760
Yes, you're Italian.

732
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,580
But if you're not fully done, you want to go have you're not going to go hang out with

733
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,480
people from Palermo, Sicily.

734
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,640
You don't want to do that.

735
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:58,920
Right.

736
00:32:59,120 --> 00:32:59,480
Right.

737
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,960
There's a bit of a cultural clash there.

738
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:05,040
And that's because, quite frankly, Italy is.

739
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,760
Yeah, it not it wasn't really recognized as a country until recently.

740
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,120
Yeah, it was sort of a loose monarchy.

741
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:17,640
And it was it was sort of viewed as a colonial power over Libya.

742
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,940
And it had culture.

743
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,980
And you have Sardinia, Switzerland.

744
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:27,640
Actually, if you wanted to know about more about the Italian culture, you had to be part

745
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,440
of the Swiss.

746
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,220
It was really odd.

747
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,120
Well, Sardinia were not considered.

748
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,300
Yes, Sardinia is in on this mix.

749
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,380
It's not just as simple as the Sicilians versus the rest.

750
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:38,700
Right.

751
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,500
It's not a matter of squirting ink on paper and saying this is the border.

752
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,660
This is how we're going to live now.

753
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,740
They don't work that way.

754
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,040
Right.

755
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:49,580
That's why I always said what you will see is a loose confederacy, not like the EU.

756
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:54,040
Where everyone just capitulates to some federal type federal meaning central.

757
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,360
By the way, the word federal is a religious term.

758
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,840
Look up in etymology what it means.

759
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,100
Right.

760
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,820
It's a it's a religious term.

761
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:06,280
But anyway, I think that it's no surprise.

762
00:34:07,239 --> 00:34:12,219
But on the other hand, do the anyone listening that wants to learn more about it?

763
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:16,460
If you do learn more about it, let me know, because I think I've pretty much said everything

764
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:21,040
that could be said on the matter from the sources that I went to and sources would be

765
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,659
singular, not plural.

766
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:25,840
I pretty much try to extrapolate biblical prophecy.

767
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,360
And the only reason I did that and have been doing that in my life is because we all heard

768
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,080
about the Bible.

769
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,360
We all are part of the Judeo-Christian.

770
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:40,360
Even if you are Muslim, it venerates a lot of the similar things.

771
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:43,380
And we live in that culture.

772
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:49,159
And what things that I heard about within the religions were not in the Bible and things

773
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,620
that are in the Bible are not discussed.

774
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:55,820
So I felt it was kind of like a personal duty, almost like a hobby of mine to just simply

775
00:34:55,820 --> 00:35:01,420
go into the Bible and, you know, especially the languages of preservation, see what it

776
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,160
says and start telling people about it.

777
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,220
Very simple.

778
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,640
Just kind of like, you know, we do with the medical stuff.

779
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:11,440
And for somebody who might question that idea about federal being a religious term, let

780
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,220
me just go to etymology online.

781
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,560
You want to look it up, etymology?

782
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,880
Put in federal in etymology and read that.

783
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:16,800
Yep, I did that.

784
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,180
And just let me give them a snippet of it, if you don't mind.

785
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:19,600
Yeah, go ahead.

786
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,280
Is it?

787
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:20,520
Yeah.

788
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,500
Am I on the mark?

789
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,640
I haven't looked it up in a long time.

790
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,620
Absolutely on the mark.

791
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:31,960
1640s as a theological term in reference to covenants between God and man from French,

792
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:40,380
excuse me, federal, an adjective formed from Latin, fotus, genitive, foderis.

793
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,540
OK, anyway, there's a bunch of things there.

794
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,760
Covenant League Treaty Alliance.

795
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,780
And all of it has to do with a covenant between God and man.

796
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,820
That's what we read it again.

797
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:57,340
Just the first part, I think, had the most impact as a definition as a theological term

798
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,700
in reference to covenants in quotes.

799
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,140
OK, so federal is a theological term.

800
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:02,740
Yes.

801
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:03,920
Yeah.

802
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,960
In reference to covenants between God and man.

803
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,620
That's that's that's where that's the whole thing, basically.

804
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,060
All right.

805
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,160
So my memory is still good.

806
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:12,560
Yes.

807
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,120
OK.

808
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:18,320
Just wanted to verify that, you know, and these things are, you know, whatever, you

809
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,720
know, and like I say, your law comes from your God and everybody bows down to the federal

810
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,420
law or whatever.

811
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:23,700
Right.

812
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,360
There you go.

813
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:29,400
And by the way, the second things work out the second separated paragraph, which, you

814
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,120
know, is significant.

815
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,000
It means the secondary, you know, completely secondary meaning.

816
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,580
Then it says secular meaning pertaining to a covenant or treaty.

817
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:40,200
Still, the word covenant is used, which is contract.

818
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:40,480
Yeah.

819
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:40,900
Yeah.

820
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:46,800
Which is contract and led to political sense of form by agreement among independent states,

821
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,580
blah, blah, blah.

822
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,860
Anyway, that's right.

823
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:52,180
But they never mentioned people in any of their codes or laws or statute.

824
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,340
You'll notice it's persons.

825
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:56,140
Federal union, union based on a treaty.

826
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:56,880
Yeah.

827
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:57,280
Yeah.

828
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,420
No mention of people in there anywhere.

829
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,420
Never, never.

830
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,900
Because it's so pure.

831
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:02,960
It's a business prospect.

832
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:07,580
So yeah, that's where you got to give the credit to.

833
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,880
He passed away.

834
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,680
He talked a lot about the money.

835
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,340
You've interviewed him a few times.

836
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,080
Jordan Maxwell.

837
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,000
Yeah.

838
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:19,660
You got to give him credit because he his whole thing, whether he was how accurate he was

839
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:24,640
or whatever, his whole thing was, it's all contract, right?

840
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,320
It's all business.

841
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,020
It's a business.

842
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:31,580
So that's where, you know, if you're going to get into Jordan Maxwell and walk away from

843
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:35,980
what he's saying, that's what you should take with you, basically, put that together with

844
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,280
the definition you just read.

845
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:37,520
Yeah.

846
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,760
It's all about contracts.

847
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:42,960
Even when he would also he'd love to take it to the personal and tell you, look, whose

848
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,880
business is it?

849
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,220
You're right.

850
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,400
You're in bad company.

851
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,080
All these things.

852
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:50,060
And he talked about the marital contracts and how those things work.

853
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,080
What are what are children?

854
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,640
They're a product of the marriage.

855
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:53,440
Right.

856
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,100
And what is it?

857
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,400
The union of two corporations.

858
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,520
If you take a look at all the language in there, all the language with the work week,

859
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:03,380
right, the week and your week at the end of the work week, get it?

860
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:03,860
Yep.

861
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,800
Aren't you a week at the end of the.

862
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,240
That's why it's a weekend weekend.

863
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:07,820
Yeah.

864
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:08,460
Yeah.

865
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:13,080
So, yeah, it's all the people are in a daze when they go into a supermarket because when

866
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,980
they walk in over the door, it says entrance.

867
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:19,220
And, yeah, it's yeah, you're in a trance.

868
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,720
So, yeah, the word magic, it's all spells.

869
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,740
You know, there's probably in a society that is telepathic.

870
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:28,720
There probably is very little, if not no spellcasting then.

871
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:29,420
Yeah.

872
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,680
Wouldn't be necessary, would it?

873
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:31,940
No.

874
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:32,560
No.
