1
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:17,580
Rated Y Sonic Event 105, it almost rhymed and we're definitely not live because you're

2
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,180
hearing us due to the fact that you are subscribed. I don't know, that sounded like I was gonna

3
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,820
make some poetry and then got lazy about it on the way, but isn't that the way the world

4
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:31,560
works? Anyway, Greek, how are you doing this, uh, Tuesday? It's supposed to be at the moment,

5
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,560
according to the works. Yeah. We started talking. I said, hit the record button because I'm not

6
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,960
familiar with what's going on in the news. Can you do give me a, uh, you said bit something

7
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,620
about Bitcoin and something with the Middle East. So it was, let me just preface. If I,

8
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:51,680
if you don't follow current events and you have a pretty good foundation in the way things are here,

9
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,740
you'll be able to explain them much better. I'll tell you why, because if you follow current

10
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,980
events by the hour, by the day, there's programming in there. In other words,

11
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:08,380
about 20 or 30 years ago, more like 25 years ago or so, it was decided with TV commercials that

12
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:14,380
people get up and walk away. So they started designing the TV commercials to be, to be more

13
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:20,000
penetrating and more effective on the mind. If you weren't paying attention to it. Now that's some

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,580
crazy subliminal shit that they're into. Right. So, you know, uh, there's a few acts that were

15
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:30,260
passed that it's okay to use anything on the American public. Right. So, well, right. Cause

16
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:35,540
there used to be bans against doing the subliminal advertising where you were, you know, you insert

17
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:43,600
a couple of frames, chemical warfare is on biological warfare is on, uh, what is it called?

18
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:49,300
Psyops is on. It's all on. Oh yeah. But at one time there was that idea, just like people talked

19
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,640
about in the movie theaters where they would insert the picture of a popcorn and then people

20
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,660
would want to go back. Yeah. There was a book called subliminal seduction that I read partially

21
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:04,200
in the eighties. Uh, no, no, no, no. Uh, what happens is the residue from things supposedly

22
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:11,060
not being the way they are is, is still there. Right. The residue meaning like if you go out and

23
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,340
you don't say, well, you know, you can't use the military against the U S public, you know,

24
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:21,960
that's right. That's possible. That's right. Bullshit. So the residue people don't understand

25
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:28,600
the fine points. Right. And it's all open. It's all fair game, but it's much more interesting to,

26
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:34,680
okay. To do what they're doing. You've heard of the silent, uh, weapons for silent wars or

27
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,780
whatever. Oh yeah. Of course. Yeah. That's exactly what's going on. But okay. So when you're up on

28
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:49,260
current events, there's a trickle in, to accept in the mind, to accept what you're hearing,

29
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,520
whether even whether you think it's bullshit or not as something real. Now it's not much of a

30
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:02,480
task to convince the people who believe everything that something's real. The task here is how do

31
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:08,580
you convince the people that radio TV print say to themselves, oh, here's some more bullshit,

32
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,440
right? Though that's the system. So it's very, very nefarious. So most people,

33
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,320
especially the patriotic type that approach anything that say, oh, this is all bullshit.

34
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:25,580
Cause it's the media. They wholeheartedly take stuff more seriously than the people that don't

35
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:30,200
say it's bullshit. Think it's real. Well, right. Because there are, they take offense to the

36
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,340
idea that they're being lied to supposedly that that would be a normal reaction. I mean,

37
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,980
I get mad when people lie to me about things that are important when I want information about

38
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,160
something. Right. But here's a question I have for you. Actually, that occurs to me,

39
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:48,000
forget about the emails or anything else lately, but I know you say, look, there's no such thing

40
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,640
as general health, but what about mental health? Because there is a constant state,

41
00:03:53,700 --> 00:04:00,040
same, same, same, same. Okay. But what would you call the perpetual state? The almost constant

42
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,200
condition that somebody is in mentally? Because when it comes to TV shows, like if you notice,

43
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,060
someone who is oppressed or possessed, oppressed or possessed. Yeah. Very,

44
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,660
there's very little possession. If you, no matter how bad someone mental state is, if you ask them,

45
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,680
let's see for the name that they're given as a child, wherever they could still recall that

46
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:28,220
they're not possessed, but they're heavily oppressed. Right. Yeah. No, no. It's a mental.

47
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:34,820
Uh, well, look, so you get impressed to be oppressed basically. Right. You get an impression

48
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:39,140
laid on you that becomes oppressor beings. There are more beings than there are people

49
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:46,440
in this realm, but they're not material. Right. So, but, but back to this constant state idea.

50
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,920
Right. I take note that when, you know, people that, uh, get obsessively, like they,

51
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:56,500
they constantly watch like crime shows. I took notice of this a few years ago because of the,

52
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:03,600
uh, law and order SVU, very popular syndicated show. By the way, that's a typical newlywed

53
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,460
problem. When newlyweds or people get into a relationship, one of the main things is the

54
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:15,880
guy trying to figure how to get the chick off the crime shows. The crime show thing is a chick thing,

55
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,000
by the way, but mainly, yeah, especially the true crime, you know, where it's like,

56
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:26,040
here it is. Here's the husband. Here's the matter. Well, the fictional one because crime shows. Yeah.

57
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:32,540
Most, most new relationships are married. It's a, the guy's like, how do I get her from stopwatch

58
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:39,100
cop shows? Yeah. Well, the cop shows, especially when there's a constant feed, right? I mean,

59
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,740
today you could create a constant feed any way you want. It's on demand. But a few years ago,

60
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:49,400
when people were still dependent on broadcast TV, law and order SVU was on seemingly 24 hours a day.

61
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,020
There were people that pointed this out and there were people that I swear to you, that's what they

62
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:57,660
had on in their homes, right? Now, I took note of the fact that since they were constantly being

63
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:02,500
exposed, even though it was fictional, they were constantly being exposed to the concepts of

64
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:08,220
violence, especially sexual, intimate violence. Look, look, I enjoyed this thing fall out on

65
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:13,700
Amazon Prime recently, right? And the level of detail and duration of the Gore, meaning like a

66
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:20,680
gunshot wound with an exit and splash on each violent scene was overly enhanced to get you used

67
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,760
to that, right? And that this has been going on since the eighties, by the way. So it wasn't like

68
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,260
Quentin Tarantino where it's cartoonish and over-exaggerated to be like, it was actually

69
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:36,300
what these guys did. They actually studied safety films. You know, when people get turned up or in

70
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:41,500
a real bad accident, occupational hazard, they're, they're usually filmed and also photographed very

71
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:49,840
well and also in the military. So, and I've seen a lot of it by the way. And it's, it's pretty

72
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:56,660
accurate. It's not, it's not just like it used to be where just all the fake blood everywhere,

73
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:01,600
whatever they're showing, like the edema on the tissue, the different, the details of the

74
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06,960
different types of tissue, how the body reacts after two minutes of being injured. Yeah. They've

75
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,260
got that down like a swelling collar around an entry wound from this kind of thing. So all that

76
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:17,660
they're really super detailed. Okay. Well, fair enough. Okay. Let's okay. Hold on. The violence

77
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:25,520
is not a big deal. I'll tell you why, because the result of violence is around us everywhere.

78
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:31,960
Just like there's a saying, their power is not given it's taken. So for example, when you hear

79
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,820
about the bullshit they give in the Western governments, while the people give power to

80
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:43,620
the government through democracy, that's bullshit. It was taken from them and they're given a, a, a,

81
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:50,440
and they think that's why, you know, the, the they can vote, whatever the only way to make any

82
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,680
changes by taking it. And it's usually violent because that's just the way it is. It doesn't

83
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,660
have to be actually, but the people are not intelligent enough to do it nonviolently.

84
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:07,920
So in the, by the way, the way you take power back nonviolently is by not participating in the system,

85
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:16,660
uh, but you participated in it as, as you, uh, as you need to, but then you have these, uh,

86
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:23,740
you understand of, of rapid trades, right? How it works. So, uh, years ago they did a strike for a

87
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:29,040
week or two or three to make an effect. If you do a boycott or strike of the banking system for three

88
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:34,000
days, it'll pretty much cripple it. Right. Cause they're, cause they they're used to doing billions

89
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,559
of transactions per hour or per several hours. So if you stop that, those computers don't know

90
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:46,520
how to run anything else. And what it'll cost to adjust for that is massive. And they will listen

91
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:52,780
to that, right? The same, like with court, nobody show up to court. And if someone does, well,

92
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,200
you see, there's a thing. Well, I'm going to be arrested. No, but if nobody shows up, you won't

93
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,520
get arrested. Right. What will happen is, uh, these, these are not courts, by the way. I hope

94
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:05,780
you guys know that by now. Right. They're just, uh, yeah, it's the bar association. It's like

95
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:13,720
McDonald's or Walmart has a, uh, whatever, you know, uh, imagine like, uh, Amazon or like the

96
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,780
Italian pronunciation. I'm awesome. Uh, opens up a court system and they, uh, they don't even,

97
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,000
there is no license to practice law, by the way, it's just a bar card. It's all bullshit.

98
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:27,680
Um, but it has to be that way right now. Cause the people are so incompetent. They don't know

99
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:35,460
what, how to mitigate or legislate, not legislate, but, you know, perform a, uh,

100
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:39,300
what's right or wrong or arbitrate. Yeah. Thank you. They don't know they're too ignorant,

101
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:45,920
but if no one, here's the same thing with voting the same with court. If no one, absolutely no one

102
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,560
showed up to vote within a few days after that, the buildings would be emptied out. There'd be

103
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,260
no one there. Why? The only thing that would function with nobody showing up as the stock

104
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:00,120
market, because they have these computers that are preset to, as soon as the market opens,

105
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:05,280
they make a million trades in three seconds. Right. But they do require a human element

106
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:10,720
on the other side because the stock market is where the stock guy rings on the stock market.

107
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,280
That's why a guy rings a bell. That's why a guy rings a bell and another guy pushes a button next

108
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,800
to him. That's why there's two guys. It's not about the machines are not there yet.

109
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:24,460
They're machines. You'll know the machines are there when they start doing automatic abortions

110
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:30,400
and killing people. So here's the thing, OK, because every advanced planet, every other

111
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,240
advanced world doesn't have animals on this planet, by the way, it's just the beings. But anyway, here

112
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,500
let's let's just say it this way. If no one shows up to court for a traffic ticket or whatever,

113
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:44,480
whatever, you know, they're not incarcerated. Zero attendance. Zero. And no one votes.

114
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:49,080
You will go back to the court building government and they would be emptied out because the people

115
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:54,440
that are there will say, oh, no one's showing up. I guess they found out and they figured out what

116
00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:00,220
we're doing. We better run. We better run and hide because when they do show up, it ain't going

117
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:08,140
to be good. So it's their own guilty conscience that will shut it down. Right. But this will never,

118
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:14,280
ever, ever happen with the current stock that you and breed that you see, whether it's the person

119
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:19,180
sitting next to you while you're listening right now or the person you see at work or on the street.

120
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:27,840
This current stock and breed of people that are here are not they ignore just like the commercials

121
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:34,580
are designed to impress the mind when you're not paying attention to them. The people do not pay

122
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,880
attention, do not pay attention to any of these systems. Right. And there are horrible systems,

123
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:46,600
by the way. The actual virtue of having, quote, unquote, a law system or a government system or

124
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,760
a health system or whatever, there's no such thing as a health system. That's ridiculous. But,

125
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:56,240
you know, medical system is fine. But what it's turned into is so horrific that, you know,

126
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,640
we could actually do three or four sonics just on the legal system in the banking system. I know we

127
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:07,100
did quite a few on the Federal Reserve on fractional reserve banking and how the system works

128
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:13,280
a while back. But the next run and the medical system, we've done a little bit of that. I think

129
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:18,280
the next run we should get into the banking, legal, the medical and really talk about how horrific it

130
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:24,540
is and try to objectify it. And it's way more horrific than anyone I've ever heard out there

131
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:29,060
talk about it. And I'm like, I need to start piecing this together because it's really, really bad.

132
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:34,600
Well, instead of using their language, shouldn't we use the proper terms and describe, you know,

133
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:40,100
use proper adjectives for descriptions? Right. Wouldn't that be more accurate instead of calling

134
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:45,620
somebody a banker? Call them what they are, you know, instead of calling somebody a lawyer or an

135
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:50,320
attorney, depending. There was a bit. They're not lawyers or attorneys. Yeah. So attorney is just

136
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:56,000
attorney is like a babysitter or a guardian that brings you to somewhere where you're not allowed

137
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,200
to go without. Right. Which, by the way, is what if you read things properly, you will see that

138
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:07,320
that's why the attorney is OK. There is no reason you will not find a government form in any country,

139
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:12,680
any municipality, federal, local or that in any language that's done in proper grammar.

140
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:20,300
Why? Why do they deliberately do that? Because if there is a Nuremberg style thing in the future

141
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,400
where these people are, let's say, brought that, you know, they're going to say that we're just

142
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:30,560
following orders. Right. Right. But if you bring them to a place, a trial, they will say, well,

143
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:36,220
these cannot be admitted as evidence because they're not in proper grammar and you're being

144
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:42,380
set up so you cannot be done using the current system. There's an old thing like you cannot

145
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:49,000
use the devil to exercise the devil. Right. So a new system will come. But unfortunately,

146
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,040
I don't see it with the current stock and breed of people that exist. And I'm not talking about

147
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,220
some people far off. I'm talking about the people next to you right now, wherever you're listening

148
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:04,800
to this people at work, people when you open your door, just look around you, look around you.

149
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:11,480
These people will not participate in any kind of clearing or cleansing or whatever. That's why it

150
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,760
requires a mop up crew, an external force to do it. And they're and they're very, very brutal.

151
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:25,440
But the the the violent aspect of it is what people are used to hearing. So I'm tying this

152
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,040
back to what you're saying about all the violence. What's more violent? There's an old Buddhist way

153
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:38,420
of thinking about it, where you have, let's say, someone, two people, they're both going to take

154
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:44,460
someone else's money through violence. The first one points a gun at one person to take their money

155
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:50,840
and says, Give me your money. The second person befriends the person who was money they want.

156
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:55,440
And as they're befriending them, and they establish that then they take their money

157
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:03,360
in secret. They are both forms of violence. So right now, the medical system, the legal system,

158
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:10,860
the government system, the health system is that second guy. Right? It's just as violent as any

159
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:16,000
other violence. Now, you can say, well, it's a hell of a lot more uncomfortable for someone to

160
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,340
put a gun in your face, right? Or live in a dystopic kind of dictatorship. But I'm still I'm

161
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:28,200
telling you, the end result is the same. And right, and, and they're both based on ignorance.

162
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:35,500
Now, the first one, with the gun pointing at the victim is also ignorance, because if you are fast

163
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:41,840
enough, and skilled enough, you can take the gun away. Right? And the second, right, so and the

164
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:46,560
second one's based on ignorance, because you cannot discern what's going on. So I'm telling

165
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,780
you that the system of violence that's being put on people, especially in the Western world,

166
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:58,900
is far more violent than they imagined by watching cop shows or Holly water, it's far more violent,

167
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:04,960
because it will persist. For example, if someone puts a gun to someone to take their money,

168
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,220
that person may net may be changed forever. For the rest of their life, it might want to carry

169
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:15,300
a gun down this next time it happens. The success rate of the assailant might be 50% instead of 100%

170
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:19,860
because the person's packing, right? Right. But if you condition somebody incrementally,

171
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:25,880
you're not going to have that rubber band snapback effect where it's not going to be so sudden. So

172
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:30,600
you're not going to have a sudden reaction, right? It's the slow roll the mission creep,

173
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:36,140
if you will, it's a one way conditioning. Okay, if you're born into slavery, and that's all you know,

174
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:41,520
just like when I get puppies, I always raise them in the kennel, I have a kennel,

175
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,720
and they kind of eat by it, I always put them in there, show them love in there, whatever.

176
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,220
And then I train them with a certain sound. So they go into the kennel, right? And you can only

177
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,540
do that when they're a little puppy. So when they go to sleep, they want to go to the kennel, right?

178
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,860
And you close it and make you know, safe place for the dog. Yeah, because they're used if you

179
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:01,640
tried. Yeah, if you tried, but you're raising, that's all they know. So what's going on if

180
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,760
you're raised in slavery, and that's all you know, okay, it's, it's not a one way street,

181
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:13,900
you're standing on a dot is no movement. But if you take people that are like that, and you try

182
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:19,040
to make them into become free to live in freedom, which you have to, it's very difficult to be

183
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:25,980
living in freedom, by the way, they cannot do it. Also. So that's kind of like a halfway street

184
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,480
instead of a one way street. A one way street also is when you have people that are free,

185
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,780
and you enslave them, they cannot go back. It's a one way street.

186
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:39,580
They don't know how to get they do not want to get out. Because it's very, very, very comfortable.

187
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:45,620
It's people don't understand, like, for example, if you hear of super wealthy people that have

188
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:50,760
mansions everywhere, right? If those mansions are not lived in, and I mean, lived in, they fall

189
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,320
apart, right? Or they could be vandalized and squatters or whatever, right? Doesn't matter what

190
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:01,220
kind of security you have, they have to be lived in. So someone's got 10 mansions. They can't live

191
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:06,400
in all of them at the same time. Right, right. So people are living there, their slaves are living

192
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:12,080
in there, and their slaves are living in splendor. Now, if you take that person based on the salary

193
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,960
they get as a slave, and get them out of the mansion into the real world on that salary,

194
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:21,780
they'll be on like public housing. They'll hate it. Right? You see what the because they're in

195
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:25,820
other words, they will not up their what their earn more, if you keep them at that earning and

196
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:30,600
have them go out on their own, quote, unquote, more free, they will not like their living conditions,

197
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:37,360
I assure you, they want to go back and be a slave in splendor. Now, most people that are free live

198
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:44,400
in squalor, by the way, because for the whatever time you're using, to not gain whatever you're

199
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,380
going to earn in food, or whatever you're spending on protecting yourself and your family from the

200
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:54,720
other violent ones that are not so free. Because free people do not bring violence onto other free

201
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,220
people. This is the opposite of what you've been told. Well, that's why anarchy, you know,

202
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,740
when when people discuss anarchy, I say it's not an idiotic thing, right? Anarchy is when free

203
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:09,980
people meet the non free people. Well, but no anarchy in and of itself. That's that's a problem.

204
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:15,500
That's a question. No one will mean no one at the top, right? So if you have a castle doctrine,

205
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:22,160
each person, the anarchy actually was Switzerland up until 2002. Like, they could not send,

206
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:27,340
they could not be part of the United Nations, because they could not have each person,

207
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:32,160
each man or woman that lived in especially men that lived in sweet, Switzerland had to decide

208
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,440
who would represent them was impractical. So they had to bring them all in under a corporate umbrella

209
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,940
and have them agree to it so they can send a representative, right? So the thing about free

210
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:47,620
people, you very difficult to have someone represent you. That's why they're always put to

211
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:52,680
the side. As those people are like this with a you know, they don't have ambassadors, they don't have,

212
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:58,940
right, right. You see, this is something that's been taken out of history completely. For example,

213
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:03,740
when you look at the quote unquote, Roman citizenship and the and the hierarchy of

214
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:09,300
order of social structure, they had problems with the the Britain, the Britain, or the

215
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:14,480
not sort of the goals also, when they went into what's known as modern day England,

216
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:20,140
because they didn't, they, they, they did the people that lived in modern day England back

217
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:25,780
then that fought the Romans did not have a concept of sending a representative to negotiate each

218
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:32,120
individual person or man or woman that lived there had to be dealt with individually, where the

219
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,780
Romans, you know, they had a council and they had a representative just like the Greeks and

220
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:42,740
every other country did, right? Yeah. So it ended up being a mismatch, and they fought.

221
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,880
So until they picked up the traits of the, of understanding the concept of council

222
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,340
with foreign relations, no pun intended there.

223
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:56,320
Well, and the only way that that was actually normalized was through creeping in. And then

224
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,260
what happened is that both societies affected each other at a connection point. And then you had,

225
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:05,880
you know, the alleged Romans going, I said earlier, those some of those early Brits

226
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:13,280
saw how much more splendor they could be living in, if they just followed the Roman rules, right?

227
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,720
And they adapted and became enslaved by the Romans. So when I say it said, you know, is

228
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:22,540
when you join that society, now you're subject to the rules and regulations. So if the,

229
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,840
if the council, the legislator says no shirts on Monday, or you go to jail for three days,

230
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:34,480
right, you have to follow that where it was absurd. So yeah, so they just figured that

231
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:42,140
it's in the Bible, in the Bible, also a lot of criticism of ancient Israel about, you know,

232
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:47,720
you left, you know, me meaning Yahweh to go and pursue these fine things that they had, right,

233
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,440
like the trinkets and jewelry and all that you were impressed by how well, you know, fashionable

234
00:21:52,440 --> 00:22:00,420
they were and all that, right. So that's one of the things that is part of the dressing.

235
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:06,100
So if you're going to have a society of slaves, you have to always make sure that there's something

236
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:12,160
to aspire to, that they cannot make on their own. Like how many people these days, for example,

237
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,880
this, I remember this from many years ago, but how many people these days want to build their

238
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,160
own car from scratch, like a kid car or build their own quote unquote vehicle? Nobody, nobody.

239
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:28,060
You know, and they tried to roll that out, by the way, about 15 years ago, where, you know,

240
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,960
when they started doing the, you know, 3D printers and all that stuff. And they said, look, we can

241
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:39,740
send you directions and a kit and you could build a vehicle, which would be, you know, and they

242
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:45,340
tried this. Yeah, but also here's the criticism I have on that. I said a kid car, whatever.

243
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:51,080
Don't copy that. Okay, start from scratch, new design, new everything, you know, like the easiest

244
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,580
thing to do right now is these electric cars, because it starts off with what's called a

245
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:01,080
skateboard. It's just four wheels for motors, basically some controllers, and on a flat

246
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:06,260
platform that the batteries are hiding in. And it's there's almost no engineering once you these

247
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:12,320
are all off the shelf parts, you get you in Tesla, all off the shelf stuff. It is so simple and easy

248
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,740
to build. I mean, if I started this morning, I'd have most of it done by this afternoon, just using

249
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:22,940
hand tools. And you can build it's going to bring back the coach body works. Years ago, you bought

250
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:26,700
the chassis and then you went to a coach. That's why if you're a coach builder to build you the

251
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:33,000
outside, right? That's why years ago, if you saw a GM car from the 60s, or 50s on the running board,

252
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:38,340
when you open the door, even the 70s, it said body by Fisher, all the GM cars, you remember that and

253
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:43,540
had a stagecoach wagon on the emblem? You know, I remember body by Fisher. I remember that I don't

254
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:50,000
remember. So joined with Jeff. So anyway, right now we had a point where you can buy all the guts to

255
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,840
make an electric car, right and build your own outside, but don't start copying the way they

256
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:59,880
build it and make it the way they do it. Because it's very inefficient. If you try to do it that

257
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:05,820
way, you know, one at a time that when you look at production items, it's efficient when it's

258
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:11,760
mass produced. So this is the problem. The ingenuity and the creativity is is gone in the

259
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,260
toilet. I don't see much. I mean, I know if you do some research, maybe online, you'll find people

260
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:22,900
doing that. But it has not hit home that there's so much accessible right now, because everything

261
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:29,680
is so sloppy. The the your freedom within the slave system is maximized right now, by the way,

262
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:34,200
like you said, with the 3d printer, there's a thing that I saw recently about, you know,

263
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:39,640
where guns, certain types of weapons are banned, people can 3d print a one shot gun.

264
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,000
Oh, yeah, they go in the ghost guns and the plastic guns. And yeah, yeah,

265
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:47,420
yeah, you just need one shot. I mean, that's a talk to anybody in the CIA,

266
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:51,180
they make they put them in umbrellas and all kinds of James Bond stuff, a cigarette lighter,

267
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:55,720
right doesn't matter. Just one shot pens. Yeah. Yeah. If you're if you're two feet away from

268
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:00,680
someone, you point it right at their neck, you know, and it's only 22 round is very small.

269
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:07,660
It's no bigger than a barrel of a pen. Honestly, you know, yep, I've seen someone catch a 22.

270
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:12,000
Remember the bomber jackets in the 80s with the fuzz brown with a fuzzy brown collar and the

271
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,720
leather jacket? Oh, yeah. Yeah. popularized. Yeah. popularized after what do you call it?

272
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:21,280
Top Gun came out? Yeah. Yeah. Way before that. But yeah, the 70s. Actually,

273
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:25,180
they're called bomber jackets at a police line that the cheap version of it, whatever.

274
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:31,620
Yeah, I remember another two. Yeah. There was the local weed dealers like 1978. Right.

275
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:35,740
And he couldn't zip. It was really cold. He couldn't zip up his jacket. He says here and he

276
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:41,300
points the top of the zippers. I can't zip it up. And it's shattered, right? It's split open. He

277
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:47,760
says that that caught a 22 bullet. So someone shot at him and the zipper caught the anyway,

278
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:53,000
long story made short there. No problem. So I mean, that's how small the projectile is. But

279
00:25:53,600 --> 00:26:00,420
if you do a hollow point, it'll work way, way better. Well, because because of the sheer Yeah,

280
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:05,240
it's shot. And also when it hits a bone or something, it just it's it shatters and sprays

281
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:11,800
about and creates a whole bunch or the other thing is a tumbler. If you can make it tumble,

282
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:17,640
then it'll just rip every you know, right? It's but here's the whole thing. We're going back to

283
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:23,680
violence and projectiles and all that. Totally unnecessary, totally unnecessary. All you need

284
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:30,580
is everyone. Here's the thing. The more people that participate in withdrawing from a system,

285
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,280
the less time you need to do it for. Right. You give an example. Remember that stupid protest

286
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:43,040
about the 1% back in 2011 occupy this and that? Yeah, that was stupid. And they went on for weeks

287
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:47,900
and months or whatever, because there's a small group of people, right? You know, look, even now,

288
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:52,560
they they'll have like, what, 2 million people marching and was it Argentina, Venezuela recently,

289
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,700
or somewhere? That's still not enough. You have to have everyone and that's not going to happen.

290
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:03,060
Do it for a day. That's enough to really change the system. It's so simple. No violence is

291
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:08,100
necessary. You know, mathematically, I think one third of the people really if one third of the

292
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:13,880
people collectively did that, that would probably do it. No, it wouldn't do it. But it would

293
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:18,680
definitely, it would definitely have enough of a result that if the result was not hidden,

294
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,920
or covered up, it would inspire more. And the next time it would be half of the people.

295
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:28,880
Well, I don't think you could you could hide a one third action because you could hire the

296
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:34,120
no, you would hide the results of their action. Okay. Right. That's what's always being done.

297
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:38,440
Right. Well, just like we talked about any terrorist event, you see, it's publicized is not

298
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:43,620
a real terrorist event. There doesn't mean that there are no real idiots trying to do terrorist.

299
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:48,100
There are no but when that happens, they'll call it a drill. No, yeah, it's completely blacked out.

300
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:52,260
Yeah, because it's not in their control. Everything you see is in their control. And the same thing

301
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:58,120
here, like, for example, we're doing this rated y sonic or whatever. Let's say it was the old

302
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:02,760
telephone lines were memory to be on a conversation, you can hear someone else speaking. And yeah,

303
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:07,200
let's hang up and or sometimes you can participate in the dialogue, right? You know,

304
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,620
crosstalk or whatever. Yeah, they used to call them party lines at one point, because you end

305
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:17,040
up with a phone that would just somehow connect to another phone. And this is before the days

306
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,840
when you can do it intentionally. But yeah, so we're doing the sonic now, let's say we connected

307
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:25,980
to some other thing. And they started speaking over us or with us or whatever, it would be like,

308
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:31,400
wait a second, Chuck, let's know, let's let's stop this, right? Yeah. Somehow. Yeah, we're

309
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:36,000
connected to somebody we didn't ask to be connected to. Yeah, right. So the whole thing

310
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,940
here is about we are all guilty, potentially of it. That's why you always have to mind yourself

311
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,280
and be impeccable and very intentional in what you say and do. I mean, sometimes people say,

312
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:49,780
oh, you're very harsh. And the things you said, and I'm like, you know, before I say something,

313
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:55,500
I think about it a lot. You know, I think about it a lot. So if I said it, it was there was a

314
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:00,180
very strong reason it was for your benefit. Well, that's why I find it very weird that you say that,

315
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:04,680
power is always taken, it's never given. Because here's an interesting part of that to me,

316
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:09,260
is that all along the way, you're telling me about a lot of choices here, where it seems like

317
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:15,900
consent is given. I mean, it's not given freely, where somebody is allowed to consider what's

318
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:22,060
happening. It's what they called an unconscionable contract, unconscionable act. It's done

319
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,900
unconscionably. Right means that you're right. Yeah. Okay. So this is this was very popular,

320
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:33,740
you know, one name signature, two name signature, unilateral contract, unconscionable contract,

321
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:41,240
all those things were very popular in the common parlance. Boy, oh boy, what would be the 1930s?

322
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:47,860
That would be 90 years ago. I wasn't around then. But I was surely was around a lot of stuff that

323
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:53,840
was going on there in print and more stuff that was written about the big stuff going around back

324
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,720
then was unconscionable contract, unilateral contract, and all this other stuff. And there's

325
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,800
no talk about that. Most people don't even know what the hell that means. So because yeah, that's

326
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:09,080
why going back to what I said earlier, the current breed and stock that you see around you, pretty

327
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:15,060
much everyone cannot do this. That's why they're going to have a quote unquote, calamity that

328
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:19,880
they're going to have a series of them. And that's why they're going to keep going, you know,

329
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:24,600
with the current systems, no matter what they are, which are going to get worse and worse. And

330
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:29,260
why is the current banking system, medical system, legal system getting worse and worse,

331
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:34,800
because the general stock and breed of the people is going down the quality of the people. And when

332
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:40,540
they get in there, now, it's just like, we've been doing it this way for so long, no one cares.

333
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:45,940
Just you know, let's let's let's have some fun. Because if you keep a system that is perpetuating

334
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:54,180
fraud long enough, it's a thrill to do that. Right? So the medical system, the legal system,

335
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:57,960
governmental systems, scientific, they've been they know they're perpetuating frauds,

336
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:02,280
and it's a thrill. But after a while, the thrill wears out, it's like shooting fish in a barrel.

337
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,820
And now they want a little bit more risque. That's why when you watch the media,

338
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:14,200
or current events in any way, the stuff that's going on with all these systems is so outrandish,

339
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:20,920
outrandish, outlandish, and whatever that would have never been even 10 years ago,

340
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,940
wouldn't be accepted. So it's going to get much worse from that thing. From that perspective. But

341
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:31,140
is there a reason? Okay, like a lot of relatable, even if you go back to what they call obscenities

342
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:39,240
on TV, or whatever, you can literally use the F word on broadcast TV, so long as now that you know,

343
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:44,100
you know very well that people used to get thrown off the air, their businesses taken away,

344
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:49,620
all kinds of stuff, people lost jobs, when somebody dropped an F bomb on on TV or radio,

345
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:57,000
right? Well, so tell me that they're dropping F bombs now on TV. Nowadays, you can Yes, as so long

346
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:03,140
as it has a certain context, or the other thing is, you can do it once a season you're allowed.

347
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:07,840
I mean, it's just weird. Like they've made up some weird random rules about it. And somebody

348
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:12,600
can literally say fuck on TV books that they're putting in elementary school and all that. But

349
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:18,140
look, yeah, up until the late 80s, early 90s, toplessness for women was allowable on Italian

350
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:23,160
television, Italian and British. I remember watching stuff from Britain where they had to

351
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,940
put black bars over it when they sent it to America. And they go, well, in America, we can't

352
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:31,480
show nipples. You know, the only thing that's still offensive is the bucket, the middle finger in

353
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:37,580
it's an offense, right? And it's a justice gesticulation in the towards a victim.

354
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:43,480
In the Middle East, it's the bottom of your foot, the bottom of a shoe. That's why, for example,

355
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:49,020
I'll see a clip from a film. There was one recently I pointed out to someone and it's

356
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:54,360
Nicolas Cage in the movies laying on the bed and the camera starts zooming in past him and his feet

357
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:58,380
take up half the screen and then pass the feet up his leg and you see him there on the road

358
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:04,700
laying down. So that would have to be edited out for Middle East countries. They do cannot show.

359
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:10,420
Well, you know, when you have, for example, a talk show host and they cross one of the guests

360
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:15,800
crosses their legs and the bottom of their shoe is showing that would have to be edited or they

361
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:21,480
have to change the angle because they would find it offensive. So when they let the the F-bomb

362
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:30,980
or this or whatever, it's it's OK. If if I hear that in the Middle East, they're allowing the

363
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:36,220
bottoms of feet and shoes to be shown, then I will see that as a worldwide trend with the F-bombs

364
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:42,380
here. You see what I mean? OK, well, two quick questions. Well, one observation and one question.

365
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:46,120
How about this? First of all, I guess Quentin Tarantino movies never get shown in the Middle

366
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:52,320
East because he's got an obsession with with with showing feet in his movies. Weird bear.

367
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:57,960
He likes cute women's feet. Yeah, he's he's very much about it. It's the bottom. It's the bottom.

368
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:03,700
But often that's what he shows. So the solely the sole of the foot. Right. And that's what he shows

369
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:08,540
often, usually a little dirty. And that's what he does. And he does it in every movie. If you if you

370
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:13,739
check. Yeah, he's got a foot. He's got a foot fetish for sure. But why is that? I mean, look,

371
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:17,420
we know about the middle finger, right? We've talked about it. Feet are very important,

372
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:22,400
especially with women. Yeah. But we've talked about the middle finger before and why that's

373
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:27,920
offensive. Right. It just became that way because it has to do with not having it amputated. You

374
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:33,159
could pull a compound bow from back in the French wars. Right. So historically, you waved it at

375
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:37,639
somebody to show you I still got mine. You could in other words, if they started running, you

376
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:41,420
could hit them further than they can hit you because you have a compound bow. Right. And

377
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:45,800
you should only have a compound bow with the middle, because if you use any other finger,

378
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:50,360
you could tear your forearm off because you're the maximum amount of clearance. Right. You know,

379
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:55,679
when the the bow, the cord goes back and by. Right. I know. I know. I've hurt myself. I don't

380
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:00,640
know exactly the mechanics on all that, but I know I've hurt my hands before pulling a bow with other

381
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:09,060
than the middle finger being involved. But anyway. But why is the foot so. I don't know why.

382
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:14,060
You don't know why. Well, because it's tread. It's tread. Right. Well, I'm just thinking where

383
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:19,260
you tread. It's the lowest part of the body. And you would just gesticulate that towards.

384
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:23,760
I'm doing it because it represents the dirtiest things, because everything eventually that is

385
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,640
dirty. Left hand would probably be dirtier, I think, in that culture. The left hand would be

386
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:33,660
dirty. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, even in Latin, the left hand is sinistro. The sinister sinister

387
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:38,740
means left. Yeah. Left is always seen as the matter of fact, they call it a path when it's

388
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:42,600
about the dark side of things and etc. Yeah. Well, it's Spanish. It's asked, you know,

389
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:49,480
which is askew. And in Italian, it would be sinister. I think Latin, it's also sinister.

390
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:57,660
Yeah, it is. No, fair enough. But yeah, so that was a yeah, that was that I wouldn't dive into

391
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:02,500
why things are they, you know, offensive or whatever. It's just that things are it's part

392
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:06,940
of the programming. And by the way, it's very, very easy to program people. I think it's good

393
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:11,540
to know why people react because as I as I started out with the whole TV thing, right?

394
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:18,060
It's because I took note that when people choose to when they consent to expose themselves to

395
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:24,860
certain things consistently, it creates very I've seen negative effects to this and other people

396
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:30,480
claim positive effects, right? If they expose themselves to if they constantly play, you know,

397
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:35,740
positive, light feeling music, you know, very yin sort of music. It makes them young, right?

398
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:39,080
It makes them feel stronger to deal with this lighter music.

399
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:45,420
And what will happen is, let's dabble into this and we'll call it a night. Absolutely.

400
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:52,160
When you dabble in a particular, let's say, force direction, we are young.

401
00:36:52,960 --> 00:37:00,280
When you start exposing yourself to yin, you will become yin also. It's when it you cannot it's

402
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:04,840
when the system that's exposed to the yin cannot take any more yin that it flips and becomes its

403
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:10,560
opposite to bring balance again. You see? Well, that's why the constant exposure, I think,

404
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:15,300
works that way. Right. So if you listen to music, you will not become automatically young,

405
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:20,560
you will you will become yin until you're over and overly yin and then

406
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:27,740
young either external or internal will manifest. And this is why there are no laws of physics.

407
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,640
They're merely observations in physics. Right. But like that constant exposure,

408
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,280
though, to I'm telling you, the deviant acts and the ideas and the negativity,

409
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:41,580
I think that does cause and people start, you know, they call it.

410
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,960
It won't make them positive, right? And they have to cut it off

411
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:50,840
before it makes them positive to keep them. It can go either way.

412
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:54,200
See, it almost looks addictive, though, in the way that people behave,

413
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:59,120
they're almost seemingly addicted to being oppressed by the negativity. It's like

414
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,920
if I don't have my negativity, I don't know what to do with myself.

415
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,840
When you say people, though, they remember that it's a current breed and stock.

416
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:11,400
It's very, very downgraded. Well, without a time machine, I can't really.

417
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:15,360
Well, without a time machine, I can't directly observe people from other time periods,

418
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,340
except the time periods I lived in. I can observe them from the since I remember being young.

419
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,720
Well, that's what I'm saying. From memory, I can think back and people are different,

420
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,540
even in this space of our lifetime, 20 years ago. Yeah.

421
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:31,580
They were already softened and ready, but they were not accepting of would not be accepting of

422
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:35,240
what is happening now and what will be happening. I've talked about this in the past.

423
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:44,260
But essentially, they they are like chihuahuas, meaning if you imagine a what a dog would be

424
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:49,020
like in the wild. Right. You cannot take a chihuahua and put it out in the wild.

425
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:52,100
They won't live because it's bred to be a chihuahua. Right.

426
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,680
Just like what came first, the chicken or the egg, the chicken farmer.

427
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:00,600
Because if you ever found a natural wild chicken and wanted to have it for dinner,

428
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,120
you wouldn't do it again because there's no meat on it. Right.

429
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:08,240
So it had to be bred for that. So the current breed and stock of people,

430
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:18,280
I cannot compare and say with what I consider, let's say, to be a proper more proper breed and

431
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:25,340
stock, you see, with to them, you know, chickens, chickens are the only birds, quite frankly,

432
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:29,100
that I have never seen an example of. Here's a wild chicken.

433
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:34,320
I don't think I've ever seen an example of it. Really? Where is their genetics?

434
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:39,920
If there's well, if there's no people around and they end up staying in the wild long enough,

435
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,280
they will revert back to their. Yeah, theoretically. Sure. But have you ever

436
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,520
seen an example of that in the wild? Like I know you've watched nature shows. You and I

437
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:52,880
talked about watching nature shows years ago. So I know you've watched them. I don't think

438
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:57,900
I've ever seen an example like you see wild turkeys, you see wild ducks, you see almost

439
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:01,320
any of these birds that are bred either for pets or for food or whatever.

440
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:07,340
I see examples of them in the wild. I don't recall ever seeing a wild chicken.

441
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,480
No, you won't. You won't. Because the current iteration,

442
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:17,160
just like you'll see, you won't see a wild chihuahua. Right. Yeah. So they go.
