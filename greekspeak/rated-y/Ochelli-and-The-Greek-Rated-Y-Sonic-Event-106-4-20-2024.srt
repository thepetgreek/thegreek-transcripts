1
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:09,320
And why, cuz, uh, whatever, we're not doing the Mickey Mouse Club thing.

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:10,500
Greek...

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,840
It is worse than the Mickey Mouse Club out there, but...

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,020
You know, the Mickey Mouse Club wasn't so bad.

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,020
Nickelodeon seems to be scarier when it comes to grooming and being more pedophile friendly.

6
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,840
Well, at least they're putting pornography books and all that, and doing, you know, sex

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,580
changes at four years old and all that.

8
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,860
They're telling you what they're really about, finally.

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,100
You know, I've been looking at stuff from the 40s and 50s, music from the 30s, and they

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,440
were pretty sick people back then.

11
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,160
Yeah, there's a song called Butcher Pete.

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,500
Listen to that.

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:47,840
You know, I mean, really crazy stuff that would be up to par with what's going on right

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,100
now.

15
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,700
So it's just an exposé.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,880
That's what the word apocalypse means, to expose.

17
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,920
Yeah, you listen carefully, actually, to music from the 30s and the 40s, and the lyrics

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,400
and stuff.

19
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,360
You'll hear cannibalism, you'll hear, you know, I'm going to bang a 12-year-old girl,

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,740
you'll hear, you know, you're too young, you'll hear, you know, I mean, crazy stuff.

21
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,800
All throughout that, you know, really clean music, Greek, right?

22
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:13,260
No.

23
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,840
I mean, really weird.

24
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,520
And I'm not just talking like blues musicians, because, you know, the whole, oh, the blues

25
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,180
musicians sold their souls to the devil, or...

26
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,980
I always wondered what you thought about that kind of stuff, like the Robert Johnson story.

27
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,120
It's just a saying.

28
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:33,140
I mean, you can sell your soul to the devil by just joining the underworld, literally

29
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,780
the black market, you know.

30
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,760
And if you're really knowledgeable in chemistry, there's a lot of stuff that goes around in

31
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,900
the black market that gets stepped on.

32
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,300
Stepped on means when it gets passed from one dealer to the next, they dilute it, right?

33
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,740
So they increase the product.

34
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,460
That's the way I always understood the term.

35
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,320
I was involved in that as a kid, and what it meant to me is you take it and you whack it

36
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:55,480
up.

37
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,480
You mix it up with something else so that you can split it out and make it bigger.

38
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,780
You know, we used to call it bulking, too, where you bulk it up.

39
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,340
So if you have a pretty good knowledge of, let's say, food and chemistry, chemicals and

40
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:12,180
substances, and you're working on the surface world, you can go join the underworld.

41
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,260
They will welcome you as putting out stuff that was, you know, the best quality stuff,

42
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:17,520
right?

43
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,100
Well, I got to be useful as a young kid mixing things together, because I knew what could

44
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,900
be mixed and what could be properly ground and things like that.

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,780
I mean, just knowing how to grind things was a useful skill.

46
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:29,740
Yeah.

47
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,380
The people in the Latin community called porqueria, it's the white powder, and there's various

48
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:39,460
of them, and they're really ignorant in terms of, you know, they want to step on stuff and

49
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,080
increase it.

50
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,580
And I'm telling them, like, why don't you study the food industry?

51
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:49,500
There's like dozens of things that are not harmful, right, that you can add to it that

52
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,900
will actually enhance it, complement it, especially if you know yin and yang, right?

53
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,340
Well, a lot of neutral stuff.

54
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,780
But I mean, we got the easy chemical things.

55
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,620
That's why I tell people all the time, this old fentanyl is a brand new.

56
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,460
That's not new.

57
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,280
We had that in 81.

58
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,880
I think it was worked on in World War II by the Germans, and then they evolved it and

59
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,880
recently again.

60
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:15,760
I wasn't alive then, but I know we had it in Jersey in like 80, 1980, easily, you know,

61
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,240
it's not new.

62
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:17,840
So anyway.

63
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,480
Yeah, so these synthesized things, that's what World War I was about, stop the Germans

64
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,160
from synthesizing everything natural.

65
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,840
They had a pretty good key on synthesizing everything, because remember, around the turn

66
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,760
of the century, everything was paper-based, and you needed good quality ink, and the

67
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,260
India ink was the best quality ink, and it was a hold on the market by the British.

68
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:44,520
So the Germans started synthesizing even better quality ink, and then they started synthesizing

69
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:52,300
petroleum from plant, and all the drugs that are still most commonly used today.

70
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:57,440
India ink, as a matter of fact, if you see a tattoo that somebody's had for 30, 40 years,

71
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:03,380
and it's not stretched out, or it's not green, guess what, if it's still black after 30 years,

72
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,700
that's probably India ink.

73
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,300
Just saying.

74
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,280
Yeah, the synthetic, so anyway, it goes on and on and on, but you wanted to talk about

75
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,200
protesting, supposedly, someone lit himself on fire at another trial, you said, right?

76
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,960
The Trump trial, which is just, Trump, he's Trump, the Trump trial, yeah.

77
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,360
The Trump change, if you will, right?

78
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,300
Okay, so just a recap for the listeners.

79
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,660
So what was his reason for lighting himself on fire, he doesn't like Trump?

80
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,480
I would love to figure it out, you know, he wrote a manifesto, all right, let me just

81
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,140
lay it all out.

82
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,240
Just a short of that, don't lay it all out, please, please, that's like torture.

83
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,420
If it's in the mainstream, just give me the super abridged, the abridged version.

84
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,460
How about 20 seconds, I'll give you the whole story.

85
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,000
Yes, that's fine, 20, 19 seconds.

86
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,340
19 seconds, done, here we go, start.

87
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,560
So this guy decided to write a manifesto explaining that he was gonna light himself on fire outside

88
00:04:53,560 --> 00:05:00,260
of the trial, which is being held in Manhattan for Donald Trump and fraud, a case of fraud

89
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:00,740
against him.

90
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:05,540
Anyway, the guy lit himself on fire, did it, but he wrote a substack beforehand explaining

91
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:10,300
it, and in his explanation, quite frankly, I can't decipher exactly why he decided to

92
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,620
do it outside of the fact that he wanted attention, and he says, you know, the system is rigged

93
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,080
and everything is rigged and that's the way it is, and I want attention.

94
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:23,260
So he lit himself on fire, and the end of the story is this, about a day ago from when we're

95
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:27,640
talking now, he died, and about a day before that is when he lit himself on fire.

96
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,160
So he lit himself on fire, he even apologized to the first responders, sorry, that's it,

97
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:32,540
there you go.

98
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,780
Yeah, okay, so he said the system's rigged.

99
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:38,700
So, I don't know, it's very realistic, but protest doesn't work, and I'll get into why.

100
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:44,320
Usually the protest is what they want you to do, you know, again, because it satisfies

101
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,900
an impulse, it's impulsive, right, other than the people planning the protests, those who

102
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,200
join it do it by impulse, and it's based on ignorance.

103
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:59,180
Anything that's going to change anything else, other than extreme violence, a power move,

104
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:05,360
right, like a coup, a military coup, is a lack of participation, there used to be strikes

105
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,520
years ago for that, you know, like boycotts.

106
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:15,240
The reason why protests don't work, and withdrawal does, is when someone is going to withdraw

107
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:20,260
from doing something as a boycott, they are usually much more schooled and educated in

108
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,080
the subject matter.

109
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:27,220
Like, for example, when you do the protest, the money system, the best way to do it is

110
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,200
to withdraw from it.

111
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,460
In other words, just for three days, don't use it.

112
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:35,840
That's enough because of their speed trading to really cripple the speed trading aspect

113
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,420
of it.

114
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:43,700
And the protests don't work for the simple reason is, in order to do an effective boycott

115
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:48,180
on the money system, you have to understand the bankruptcy, you have to understand the

116
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:53,640
codes, you have to understand the inner workings of how the system currently works, and that's

117
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,220
not going to happen with just a protest.

118
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,800
In other words, if you have a protest with anything, especially the money system, walking

119
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,280
down the street, and you're going to grab more protesters, they're so stupid, they're

120
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,620
so ignorant, they need at least three months of research to figure out why they're protesting.

121
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,860
So it doesn't work.

122
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:18,540
Well, does it help as an introduction, though, to some of the ideas that maybe people need?

123
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,580
No, it's the wrong direction.

124
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:24,700
So you don't think that even introducing somebody to the real ideas, if you held a public demonstration

125
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,160
to get people's attention, that would not be the way to go?

126
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,140
No, no.

127
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:28,620
Okay.

128
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,380
You hold a demonstration that they need to against ignorance.

129
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,240
That's what the demonstration should be about.

130
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,220
Absolutely.

131
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,000
Against ignorance.

132
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,960
And then start, and then you break it down in various, it's funny, I was at an academics

133
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,780
house, a doctor last week, and I told him, you know, basically, the way the world works

134
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:53,540
is you have the business world, which is a smart system with dumb people.

135
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:59,180
And then you have the academic system, which is usually intelligent people in a dumb system.

136
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,520
So let's go back to the business world.

137
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,000
It's a smart system with dumb people.

138
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,040
But if you're in that system long enough, you'll be smart.

139
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:13,020
Now the academic system is a dumb system with intelligent people.

140
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,880
But if you're in there long enough, you're going to be dumb also.

141
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,520
So typically, it depends on the duration.

142
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,280
And that's the same thing with protests.

143
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:28,160
The duration of how long you've been involved in a system, the system will eat you up.

144
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,480
So we all know that the majority of protests have been proven to be planned by, you know,

145
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,280
planned opposition.

146
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:34,320
Right.

147
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,240
Okay.

148
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:39,520
So what will happen is if you keep protesting or get involved in that, you will become part

149
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,580
of the system that does the planned opposition.

150
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,680
This is very well known.

151
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:50,460
If you go look, for example, on a mild perspective, oh, there was more than one group, this whatever

152
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,960
underground and the Black Panthers and so on and so forth, right.

153
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:59,100
And over a period of about 10 years, they exposed that, you know, the leaders were all

154
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,060
FBI informants.

155
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,360
Right.

156
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,060
One by one.

157
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,960
They didn't say all the leader.

158
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:08,580
But if you followed what they put out in the public, this leader of this movement was

159
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,060
an FBI.

160
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,180
Then this leader and this guy, and then you piece it all together, or 10 years, they pretty

161
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,860
much exposed like the top 20 people as being working for the feds.

162
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,260
Right.

163
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,620
And in the meantime, what that accomplishes, though, is to put everybody at everybody else's

164
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,360
throat so that there can be no cooperation and no collaboration to get anything done.

165
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,480
Because it goes back to the analogy I gave about business world being a smart system

166
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,880
with dumb people, academia being a dumb system with smart people, let's say.

167
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,200
If you stay in one of those systems, you will be the overarching element of that system

168
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,880
will take over.

169
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,680
Like, for example, when you're new in business, you're not that good.

170
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:44,980
Right.

171
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,420
Right.

172
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,740
How many times you hear people?

173
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:47,260
Oh, yeah.

174
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,680
I got into selling insurance and I didn't do my first sale until two years after being

175
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,280
in that.

176
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:52,520
Right.

177
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,480
And now they've been working in it for 40 years and they're kind of smart, you know,

178
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:56,900
about it.

179
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,180
Right.

180
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:57,540
Right.

181
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,760
If you look at academics, when they get in, they try to do things by the book.

182
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:00,980
Right.

183
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,780
You know, they actually.

184
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,500
Oh, how would you say have reverence and venerate the base of knowledge?

185
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,760
But as they stay longer and becomes peer review.

186
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,560
Oh, don't say that.

187
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,400
You can't say that.

188
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,520
No, you can't say that.

189
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,460
That's what you hear from them.

190
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,340
You can't say that.

191
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,040
Right.

192
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,200
Right.

193
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,040
Right.

194
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,040
So they become dumb if they stay in it long.

195
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,780
And if you don't believe it, if you have any family members or friends that are professors

196
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,900
with tenure that are over 60 or in their 50s, they're dumb.

197
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,940
They're not smart people.

198
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,060
The system has turned them into that.

199
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,820
But if you look at how they were when they first started, they would you would say they

200
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,420
were seeking knowledge and all that.

201
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,200
Now, the same thing with business.

202
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,540
Again, it's a very smart system with dumb people.

203
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,320
But if you're a businessman for many, many years, you end up being a pretty smart person

204
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,620
because you study protesting.

205
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,460
Protesting is controlled opposition.

206
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:53,280
And no matter how good you you want to, let's say, participate and change, you stay in that

207
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:53,680
system.

208
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,740
And and let's say there's people that are career protesters, right?

209
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,320
They protested as teenagers.

210
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,740
Some of the old people that you see out at protests have been if you interview them like,

211
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,160
oh, yeah, I protested against this in 1979.

212
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:05,760
Right.

213
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:06,980
Yeah.

214
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,940
Now they become part of the controlled opposition.

215
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,140
You see, they become.

216
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,340
If you any system.

217
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,300
So the thing is, diagnose the system.

218
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,360
What is it based on?

219
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,060
Right.

220
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,320
So, for example, look at the food and nutrition system right now.

221
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,880
They're making fun of the food pyramid, the actual establishment is right and stuff they

222
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,760
put out on their own.

223
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,100
It's like the food system is based on chemical compounds and not how they relate to the body,

224
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,080
but how they relate in the laboratory.

225
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:34,920
Right.

226
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,580
The medical system is based on cadaver study.

227
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:39,680
Right.

228
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,080
Yeah.

229
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,360
So you see.

230
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,960
So anyone involved in these systems will ultimately.

231
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:50,080
So if you were, let's say, a doctor for a long enough time, you will have a long number

232
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,720
of cadavers behind you.

233
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,380
What wouldn't you?

234
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:58,320
A lot of you've killed a lot of people to guarantee knowingly, knowingly after a certain time.

235
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:03,740
For example, I had a client who worked in a hospital and it was a doctor who became an

236
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,400
admin and we needed room in the garage.

237
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:11,000
It was a three car garage and he had these banker boxes and they were floor to ceiling

238
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,920
about 10 deep.

239
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:15,060
I know it took up an entire one and a half parking spots.

240
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,320
It was like you think he was moving.

241
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,840
All of that was his own personal lawsuits over a period of 30 years.

242
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,780
A million pages.

243
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,820
It was at least a million pages of lawsuits there.

244
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,280
These are all malpractice lawsuits?

245
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,120
Yep.

246
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:29,640
Wow.

247
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,240
On him.

248
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:30,640
Yeah.

249
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,540
Him and his group and whatever he works with.

250
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:36,820
So there's actually, I'd say it's about halfway down the middle.

251
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:42,840
In other words, about 50% of whatever, whoever a doctor does is malpractice.

252
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:50,960
So if he has 100 patients, 50 of them got malpracticed on and out of those 50, maybe five or two

253
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,260
will sue.

254
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,640
We do arbitration.

255
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,060
And what you're saying is when they're new to the field, it's out of ignorance, but after

256
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:57,520
a while.

257
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:57,900
Yeah.

258
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:58,860
After a while.

259
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,060
Yeah.

260
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,740
In other words, they might do better after a while.

261
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:01,940
Yeah.

262
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:07,140
It's like anyone that tries to prove anything in the medical industry, they get stepped

263
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:11,540
on and they tell them, no, you're supposed to do it the standard way, not the better

264
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:11,900
way.

265
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,180
Right.

266
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,120
In this case, they either get the pay off or the kiss off because they're either gotten

267
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,300
rid of or paid off.

268
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:19,560
Right.

269
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,420
I mean, yeah.

270
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,760
And if you go study medical patents, they're all really frivolous.

271
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:29,960
It's like the one I just recently saw was just like the labeling on some medical, he patented

272
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,420
a thing or someone where it was slightly holographic, easier to read with a warning

273
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:33,820
label.

274
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:34,380
OK.

275
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,800
I mean, ridiculous stuff.

276
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,020
They still haven't even.

277
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,640
I mean, yeah, it's just totally ridiculous.

278
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:44,260
So you're going to end up defining a system, in other words, how the system works in this

279
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,600
reality, this world.

280
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,760
And then anyone involved in that eventually will evolve to being what the how that system

281
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,220
is defined is what I'm saying.

282
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:57,400
So if people in university will end up being stupid or dumb, if you spend enough time in

283
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,680
it, because it's a dumb system.

284
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,600
People in business who end up being smart, if you end up spending enough time in it,

285
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,940
because it has to be sort of like an oven.

286
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,540
I mean, once you're once you're in there cooked under those conditions, I mean, that's

287
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,600
right. You're going to take on, you know, eventually you're going to dry out the dry

288
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,020
oven. I mean, it's just that simple.

289
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:19,040
Yeah. I was trying to explain the money system to someone who's pretty high up in the

290
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,460
business world. They didn't know about it.

291
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,640
Honest. I was like, come on, you can tell me if you've been told not to talk about it.

292
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:27,420
And they weren't so basically told them, OK, you understand that the money supply is

293
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,480
expanded through lending.

294
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,980
And they're like, I know what that I know what those words mean, but I don't understand

295
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,360
how. Right.

296
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,900
In other words, the banks have no way you set up a bank is you get an office with a

297
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,960
phone and you tell people you give loans and you have a ledger.

298
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,800
And what you get from the Federal Reserve is a list of transaction numbers that's in

299
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,060
your inventory transaction numbers.

300
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:51,600
And then someone wants a loan, you know, you run them through a dog and pony show.

301
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,980
You got demographic and all they're going to be doing psychographics pretty soon, by

302
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,540
the way. That's what social credit system is.

303
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,820
It's psychographics. Right.

304
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,500
And behavioral graphics.

305
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:07,080
But anyway, when someone wants a loan, basically you write down the amount and

306
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,460
next to a transaction number and whatever that amount is, the Federal Reserve OKs it.

307
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,500
It's called the window goes through the window.

308
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:19,400
And in the back, the back of the store of the Federal Reserve, whatever that amount

309
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,700
is, gets multiple. It's ten to one gets multiplied times nine.

310
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:27,320
They give the person who supposedly got that loan from their signature, drawn from

311
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:32,120
their signature, that amount, whatever is left over the 80 percent, let's say, a split

312
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,320
between various groups or whatever.

313
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:41,340
So and then you go on to how things are collateralized and it was very difficult for

314
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:45,820
me to understand, even though it was rather intelligent, because it's so new, no

315
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,740
matter how simple you make the information.

316
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,640
Now, by the way, when money is expanded by lending.

317
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,440
So when someone gets a loan, that money didn't exist prior to that loan.

318
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,700
That means that the money to pay it back does not exist.

319
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,440
That has to be created somehow again by another loan.

320
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,100
Right. So that's why the system gets inflation very fast.

321
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:10,120
And it's a terrible, terrible it's there's no moral or morality ethics, by the way.

322
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,620
That's why the American law.

323
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,480
Actually, most countries have laws.

324
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:20,100
12 USC for 11 tells you about Federal Reserve notes are to be issued by Federal

325
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,380
Reserve banks and through Federal Reserve agents and no other use is authorized.

326
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,060
So you're not authorized to use something when you found using it.

327
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:32,500
It's contraband. You have to pay a fee, an excise tax.

328
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,760
Right. So that's that's normal.

329
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:39,980
It's just like if you rent a tool from a shop, you bring it back and you wave

330
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,440
goodbye. No, they're expecting a fee.

331
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,560
So if you're using. So, in other words, the public money is owned by private hands.

332
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,120
And this is very normal, by the way.

333
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,920
If you were in the military and you're abroad, what do they call it?

334
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:59,000
The mess, you know, at the at the base where they they serve food

335
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,020
mess. It could be a mess hall.

336
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,700
It could be a cafeteria. It could be.

337
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,180
Yeah. You'll see a pizza hut in there.

338
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,800
Yeah. And various other fast foods.

339
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,440
That is not a government entity.

340
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,800
It's a private entity.

341
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:15,819
Right. So so what I mean by this is the same thing.

342
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:20,160
You have a private entity that is demanding based on its privateering

343
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:24,220
system. OK, so medical system works the same way.

344
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,080
It's all you know, it's it's for privateering.

345
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,500
You know, it's a private system, no matter how much they say it's government.

346
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:36,560
By the way, when they say fraud, fraud is one of anyone,

347
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:41,000
any seasoned attorney or lawyer or anyone that well versed in the law

348
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,580
will tell you fraud cases very rarely pan out.

349
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,000
It's very difficult to prove.

350
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,940
So when someone is charged with fraud, if you go study the case,

351
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,720
if they, let's say, are found guilty or have to write,

352
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,080
you'll see if you read the document, the conviction is not fraud.

353
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,780
It's actually false information

354
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,920
to a government agent or false information

355
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,940
to an official or false record keeping, not fraud.

356
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,880
It's like when all the other charges fall away

357
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,000
and a lot of criminal whatever is the last charge to fall

358
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,900
is usually lying to the FBI. Right.

359
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,080
I mean, it's that's right.

360
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:14,900
False information.

361
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,540
Stewart did not do insider trading at all because it's all insider trading.

362
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,060
If you go look at her case, it was she was when she was interviewed.

363
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,160
She lied by the FBI.

364
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,080
She lied to this.

365
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,260
So she got time for false information to a government agent.

366
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,780
And that could also be hard because they're not government agents,

367
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,080
which is another.

368
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,720
Yeah, yeah.

369
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,220
So the thing is, if you see that coming, it's like you're not.

370
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,580
How are you a government agent?

371
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:40,420
You're a subcontractor.

372
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,020
Right. Right.

373
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,860
They're all contractors. Yeah.

374
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:50,340
That's why if you work in an agency, anyone, please get in touch with me.

375
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,520
If you do, you have like a sheet.

376
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:55,540
If you work at the FBI and you're going to go investigate,

377
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,660
let's say, a medical thing, some medical place, federal investigation. Right.

378
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,480
Your in-house paperwork.

379
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,080
When you start the paperwork, the play,

380
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:08,060
who let's say the DOJ orders you to do that. Right.

381
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,340
Or the FDA orders you to do that.

382
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,800
You put the field for filling out his client.

383
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,840
So when you work at the FBI, you're going to do an investigation for the FDA.

384
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,440
The FDA is a client of yours.

385
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,700
Yeah, you're all subcontractors, which makes no sense,

386
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,280
because if you were part of the same government,

387
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,420
then you'd be acting on behalf of the same thing with the.

388
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,080
Yeah, same thing with the IRS has it as taxpayer.

389
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,880
Right. I don't even know what that is.

390
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,540
So but it's all subcontractor, all of it.

391
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,700
As a matter of fact, this the police are also subcontractors of the city manager.

392
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,380
So when you run into anyone's in the police,

393
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,480
roll down your window, whatever it's a how's the city manager doing?

394
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,040
You should know the city manager's name because that's who they work for.

395
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,840
Right. And they're also subcontractors.

396
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,000
This couple of cases were lost by the police on this.

397
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,860
And the attorney general in Virginia and another state

398
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,800
put out a public announcement to police to take if they have anything in their name

399
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,780
to take it out like cars, homes or whatever bank accounts,

400
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,600
because they can be held liable because of this last case that went through

401
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,720
that they're all subcontractors.

402
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,600
They don't work for the government.

403
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,100
No one works for the government because the government's bankrupt.

404
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,900
How can you work for an entity that's bankrupt in law?

405
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,560
There's no legal standing even.

406
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,620
Well, if they can't pay you, then you can't be,

407
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,740
you know, what do they call it?

408
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,640
You don't get compensation for your work.

409
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,780
So therefore, because they don't have money to pay you with.

410
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,860
That's right. Well, then they'll.

411
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,800
So there's the corporate structure and all that is the way that it is.

412
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,240
So we don't have a government.

413
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,620
It's just people saying that they're part of the government.

414
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,240
That's that's the crazy part about it, you know.

415
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,040
And it's a it's a big it's it's a serious inaccuracy.

416
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:50,840
It's so inaccurate.

417
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,240
It's actually a big fat lie.

418
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,780
And meanwhile, they charge other people with,

419
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,620
you know, falsely claiming to be an agent of the government or whatever.

420
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,840
Right. But they go, OK, any attorney general that you know that I got,

421
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,900
let's say there's a case, someone, you know, or heard of that got railroaded

422
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,260
and was all bullshit.

423
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,920
They railroaded them, false accusations and all that.

424
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,160
You go talk to the attorney general in person, say, hey, this is all false.

425
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,680
Yeah, but he agreed to everything or she agreed to everything.

426
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,080
And the Constitution upholds that, by the way.

427
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,260
It doesn't. It says if you're convicted of a crime,

428
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:28,960
it doesn't say lawfully convicted or properly convicted, just convicted.

429
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,860
Right. That's why that scumbag, Judge Salia, whatever the guy, they choked.

430
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,160
The earth is a better place without him.

431
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,140
What does the Scalia that Scalia?

432
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,980
Yeah, Scalia, that scumbag. Yeah.

433
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,700
Scalia, the scumbag.

434
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:44,560
He did a case where someone said that they were in prison falsely.

435
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,120
And he he stayed with the Constitution.

436
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,260
He says the Constitution just says convicted.

437
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,240
So that means if you're falsely convicted, the Constitution still holds.

438
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:58,080
You can. The Constitution basically does not make an allowment

439
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,180
for a lawful conviction.

440
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,320
And he appealed. I didn't have to.

441
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,540
They could have all did a summary that if it's in the Constitution,

442
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:10,520
it should be a lawful conviction and kept that as their opinion,

443
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,600
that it means lawful.

444
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,520
But he says, no, it doesn't say lawful.

445
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,100
So it's it's OK to be falsely convicted.

446
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,420
And he turned it right.

447
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,400
So this is the world that you live in now.

448
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,100
OK, just in the past 15 minutes, stuff that name one protest

449
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,720
or anywhere that knows anything that I just mentioned or would be,

450
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,340
let's say, adherent to that.

451
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,920
None. Think about how the protesting mind works.

452
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,940
Right. Yeah, I think.

453
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,360
All right. Burn the whole thing down.

454
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,840
Don't white protest. Right.

455
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:45,040
Burn the whole thing down and start all over the whole thing.

456
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,980
Not one side.

457
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,480
You see, that's where you're at.

458
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:53,440
So, in other words, protesting is I don't understand.

459
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,960
Well, that's always been my argument about, you know, people that say

460
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,080
we should run it like a business.

461
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,180
And I say, well, you know, when somebody comes in and takes over a business

462
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:04,220
and says, all right, this place is not running right and we need to change it.

463
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,520
They don't turn around and make new rules and change a little thing.

464
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,440
You get rid of everybody to start with.

465
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,780
Everybody's fired. Right.

466
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,680
And then you go, look, because everybody's doing everything wrong.

467
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,700
Get them all out of here.

468
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:19,880
Bring in new people and start to do this again.

469
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,000
The right way is the same place.

470
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,940
The breed and the crop. That's you can't.

471
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,440
You can't do it with the stock that's here.

472
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,860
The stock is too diluted.

473
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,000
Yeah, but what I'm saying makes sense, though, right?

474
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,040
I mean, isn't that what you should do?

475
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,320
Yeah, but it doesn't work that way.

476
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,760
We are so close to.

477
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,400
We're so close to the whole thing is being burned down,

478
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,220
which it's a good thing, by the way.

479
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,380
I mean, literally burned down.

480
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:48,140
It will happen with forces that are much higher than we can contend with.

481
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,800
So what I'm trying to say,

482
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,240
you ever notice how when we do these sonics,

483
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,120
I constantly try to put little improvements, like put soap in a spray

484
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:58,940
bottle with water.

485
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,600
It's much better than pouring out, pouring soap down the drain, right?

486
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,100
Yes, of course. Or, you know, I've gotten so many.

487
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,480
Well, you try to make little things make your life better here

488
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,180
because the shithole and

489
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,480
because of the society is a shithole, every society.

490
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,160
And they have certain perks, you know, like if you live in Japan,

491
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,420
you'll notice a much higher quality of life

492
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,480
once you get used to the things that are traditional.

493
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,820
Other places, it's lower, you know, whatever.

494
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,480
Also, I've been getting a lot of messages,

495
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:32,880
a lot is like four or five messages in the past since I've brought up

496
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,320
the recipe for the cabbage pot roast, right?

497
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,200
Or pot roast cabbage.

498
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,480
It has nothing to do with any cabbage that you've ever had before.

499
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,600
Once you prepare it, what when people.

500
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,560
Message me, I message back, did you

501
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,120
use the recipe or the directions that I gave in the sonic?

502
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:55,880
Because this is not cabbage the way grandma cooks or the way you cook

503
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,760
or where your mom cooks or the way you ate out.

504
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,180
This is completely different animal. Absolutely.

505
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,240
No pun intended.

506
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,220
If you do that and they're like, yes, that's why I'm messaging you,

507
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,700
because I never had cabbage.

508
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,960
I'm not a fan of cabbage.

509
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,720
I did that because, you know, they've heard me say things

510
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,700
that turn their ideas around and they tried it

511
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,300
and it was most delicious thing they've ever eaten.

512
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,220
So things like that, I need to keep bringing up because.

513
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,120
And the rice, the features and benefits.

514
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,860
Yeah, the features and benefits are being here are very simple.

515
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,880
It's in all the old texts.

516
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,760
Also, we have good conversation, good food, good drink, good company.

517
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,820
You know, you're going to have to slave away and go to work. Right.

518
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,240
Stuff you don't like.

519
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:38,260
And you're going to have people say and do things that you don't like.

520
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:42,180
So food and drink and some time, casual time

521
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:45,240
that's of quality is really is really what it's about.

522
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:48,720
So what I just said about that, how does that factor into protesting?

523
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,220
I think everyone should just when they're ready for protests,

524
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,740
just go have a party. Forget about the protest.

525
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,080
That's not going to change anything.

526
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:59,140
Wouldn't you rather have a party or a rave or whatever, or a dance or,

527
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,480
you know, a concert to do that instead?

528
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,060
It's a waste of time. Enjoy what you can.

529
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,360
While you can is what it sounds like to me.

530
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,200
You know? Yep.

531
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,340
So, I mean, that's that's the way to go with that.

532
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,120
But so ultimately.

533
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,800
Well, no, it's not. It's not the way you know.

534
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,380
There is there's many ways. There's many ways.

535
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,680
But I've settled on that because it's the simplest thing to communicate.

536
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,840
There's many ways to do it.

537
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,260
OK, give another example.

538
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,140
Another way to do is bury yourself in your work.

539
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:32,060
And when I say your work, it's like if you really like what you do

540
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,800
and it brings you joy.

541
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,640
You've never worked a day in your life.

542
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,120
Right. If you're there, 12, 13 hours a day, every day.

543
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,820
That sounds like a 1970s grandpa thing right there.

544
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,980
You know, you've never worked a day in your life.

545
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,740
If you really enjoy what you do, if it brings you joy and excitement.

546
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:48,720
Make an example.

547
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,480
When I build scalerators, it's like

548
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,140
I'm in total bliss.

549
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,560
So you enjoy doing that?

550
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,200
Oh, I'm in total bliss doing it.

551
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,520
Yeah, because I know what it does.

552
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,140
And so far, I'm the only one who can make them that way.

553
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,520
Right. And I did the seminar and all that.

554
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,120
And a couple of people rose to the occasion.

555
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,080
But still, I mean, everyone's trying.

556
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:12,200
But no one can come near to the precision and the function

557
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,700
that the way that I'm doing it.

558
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,940
So it's one of these things that it's a I'm speaking to a guy, Harry,

559
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
who wants to promote it.

560
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,320
He's become a good friend.

561
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:25,920
And he I'm trying to explain to him it's not promoting the scalerator.

562
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,340
It's promoting me as an artist.

563
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,000
It's my craft.

564
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,460
It's what what I do.

565
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,560
Right. It's not it's not the product because, you know,

566
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,460
and I've had someone, Jonathan Butts, who has an engineering back

567
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,160
where he passed away from natural action technologies.

568
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,000
There's a couple of videos.

569
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,440
He got interviewed by a few people.

570
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:47,240
He looked at it and he had his engineer, a retired engineer.

571
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:51,060
He looked at it says, whoever built this is really meticulous attention to detail.

572
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,560
And he looked at his engineer and he says, well, he gave us the OK to build these.

573
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,140
Um, what do you think?

574
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,240
And he says it's going to take about 200 hours of engineering

575
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,220
just to figure out how to make it right now, 200 hours of engineering.

576
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,960
OK, if you have a 40 hour work week, that sums up to about a month and a half.

577
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,140
Right. Yeah. OK.

578
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,480
So five, five weeks for an engineer to figure out something.

579
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,040
I just came up with just by, you know, into intuitively.

580
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,680
So, you know, to copy it and improve, improve it, let's say.

581
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,140
So this is the level

582
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,440
of of work that I when I say work.

583
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,020
Right. It's it's fun.

584
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,500
It's enjoyment. And it also, you know, does things.

585
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:35,840
And by the way, the scalarator is a dumbed down, minimalistic device.

586
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,800
There's other stuff that will be put together.

587
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,760
But it's very elaborate.

588
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,100
It will give people a headache.

589
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,840
I know so far I really like the people that have come forward.

590
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:50,140
But I know so far, if we do the Turbidurator, no one will be able to do that.

591
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,300
There's there's no sense in even putting it out

592
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:59,440
unless you you're you've got some serious

593
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,940
gone us, which is spent.

594
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,400
As for desire, you need to make it.

595
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,660
And yeah, right.

596
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,360
But that will I will be doing this.

597
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,000
You're breaking it.

598
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,760
You're breaking up a little bit, Greek.

599
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,900
I don't know why you started breaking up.

600
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,040
Oh, it shouldn't be. Yeah.

601
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,660
You started breaking up.

602
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:21,340
Turbidurator is what is a Turbidurator, by the way?

603
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,540
It's a it's a three function unit.

604
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,580
It's like the scalarator.

605
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,040
And you run dirty water through it.

606
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,820
It comes out clean. Turbid water would be like coffee or tea.

607
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,080
Oh, OK. OK.

608
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,140
And then it comes out clear and it comes out just as good as clear.

609
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,260
But you get through the scalarator now, basically.

610
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:40,560
No, the scalarator is just for descaling and enhancing water quality.

611
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:46,220
But clean water, like coffee on one side, clean water comes out the other.

612
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,440
Clean water. Yeah, that's right.

613
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,980
Yeah. Well, that's right.

614
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:53,540
And yeah, I'm not bothering with the seminars or whatever on that

615
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:57,100
because it's just too it's too much, too much for the people that I've seen

616
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,520
try to make whatever they're going to make.

617
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,640
Then there's no way there's no way it's an entire that's something

618
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,380
you go to Halliburton and you go to a big engineering firm

619
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,460
that has very well, very well endowed.

620
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,940
You know, unless you've got a machine shop

621
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,920
and a whole bunch of other stuff, you're not going to be able to make it.

622
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,860
So, oh, by the way, I challenge anybody to explain to me

623
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,820
why that guy lit himself on fire, really.

624
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,040
Outside of he wanted to know.

625
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,960
Well, here's there's no challenge there because it's on TV.

626
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:32,020
Remember we talked about there's real terrorism, but you never see it on TV.

627
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:35,880
Oh, yeah. But here's the funny part about this, which which I didn't tell you

628
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,140
to begin with. They're not showing this on TV.

629
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,400
This isn't part of the TV news.

630
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,380
The broadcast news hasn't even picked it up.

631
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,800
It's only been in print so far that I've seen.

632
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,460
I know there's a video out there, but none of the like broadcast media

633
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,180
carrying it, which is weird.

634
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,540
They're showing they're showing.

635
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:55,640
Well, OK, so the idiots, the zombie, which is typical American

636
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:59,780
that might pick up on it in print or whatever or on the Internet

637
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:03,600
and not see it on their mainstream TV is being jostled a little bit,

638
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,420
like poked a little like, hey, wake up.

639
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:09,340
You're you're watching very finely filtered bullshit on one end

640
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,240
and then you're getting raw bullshit.

641
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,860
The guy burning himself, this guy was a moron to do that.

642
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,880
You know, if he wasn't a moron, he'd say, hey, man, I'm just passing through here.

643
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:25,500
Fuck him. You know, burn the place down.

644
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,440
You know what I mean? Protest. What the hell?

645
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,160
Do you get it? You notice I keep saying burn the place down, right?

646
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,060
Oh, yeah. OK, because he burned himself, you know.

647
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,980
Well, it made me think of that monk, which we talked about

648
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,240
just before we started recording.

649
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,800
And that monk can say he's an idiot.

650
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,060
Yeah, he's he's not.

651
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,840
He's a fake monk because a real monk would would be more like one of the Jedi.

652
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:45,880
Imagine one of the Jedi.

653
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,920
Would one of the Jedi light themselves on fire?

654
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,380
No. Yeah. So he's a real idiot.

655
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,920
You know, it's just a bag of meat.

656
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,780
The monk and most monks are. They're very.

657
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:58,480
By the way, this is from someone that I knew that had gone to Tibet

658
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,620
when they bring them a computer, the Tibetan monks,

659
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:06,660
and they leave them with a computer that's online for more than 20 minutes.

660
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:09,920
The they all of them without this happened over a period of two years.

661
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,640
They all immediately go to porn.

662
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,280
All of them, every single one get porn immediately.

663
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,320
All of them. Yeah.

664
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,800
So these monks are a bunch of jerkoffs.

665
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,940
It's just a community. Think about

666
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:27,620
it's like a bunch of Americans and turn them into monks and go visit them.

667
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,760
You say this is a cult, right?

668
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:32,880
Yeah, that's exactly if you're in Tibet or wherever you go, China

669
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,400
and the people that live there view them as a cult and they're a bunch of idiots.

670
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,580
You wouldn't do anything like that.

671
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,100
Again, it's like with Jason Breshears.

672
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,480
It's dungeon programming.

673
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,380
You're going to let yourself get into that kind of a thing.

674
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,600
You just fucked yourself.

675
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,760
That's not a family term, but it's a medical term.

676
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,120
This is just hilarious to me.

677
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,700
The jerk offs who fucked themselves.

678
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,520
OK, fair enough.

679
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,800
Oh, yeah. They are just.

680
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,420
Yeah. No, the monks did useless, completely go.

681
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,220
That's for the weak brain people.

682
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:05,940
Oh, they're monks.

683
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,480
Got from. Oh, yeah.

684
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,820
Or you ever hear this alternative podcast?

685
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,000
They they're so happy they have a guest in who has a doctor degree.

686
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,660
You know, it's like, oh, my gosh, that means the guy is a total idiot.

687
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,580
He didn't realize by the eighth grade the whole thing is a fraud.

688
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,260
He kept going.

689
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,060
Well, if you're going to look, if you're going to strive to have idiots

690
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,500
to talk to, you might as well get the best idiot you can.

691
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,980
Oh, my gosh. Right.

692
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,940
Oh, my gosh. You realize by the eighth grade.

693
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,440
Oh, kind of. What's wrong with you?

694
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,180
It's all backwards.

695
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,460
You know, hey, look, I like making things simple,

696
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:41,260
but it's already really simple, you know, it's already very simple.
