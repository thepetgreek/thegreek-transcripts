1
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:18,780
Rated Y 107, okay, so here we are, and looking back, in 71 we were talking about wrapping

2
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:23,960
wounds tightly, properly, why you do that, why you don't do that, and there is a time

3
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,240
to do it and a time not to, and you were going over that.

4
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,040
Time went by fast, so that would have been quite a few months ago, but still.

5
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,880
It seems like it was very recent though, doesn't it seem like we were just talking about this

6
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,220
as well?

7
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:44,400
Yeah, well, yeah, I think this has never come about, eventually I'm going to just switch

8
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:51,680
to doing classes, like seminars, you know, these conversations we're having are fine,

9
00:00:55,060 --> 00:01:00,940
but we were going to do some solo sonics, Sam got involved, so it's like the three

10
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:05,400
of us working it now, I do all the talking and you guys provide the platform and whatever,

11
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:13,240
but my usefulness is, well, first of all, I'm very novel, new sounding, especially the

12
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,480
older stuff, the older the subject matter, the newer it sounds, because no one knows

13
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:24,060
shit anymore, and there's a joke about that, by the way, you don't know shit, right, but

14
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:32,800
to be more poignant and to the point is really where I'm at, because sometimes people say

15
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,300
you're a jack of all trades, and I'm like, no, no, I'm actually a master of quite a few

16
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:44,580
trades, quite a few things on mastership level, so someone like that, if I can separate myself

17
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:53,640
and talk about myself this way, is best by, if you indeed have mastered many things, traditionally

18
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,640
and culturally and whatever there is, when you attain that level and you have enough

19
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,260
social graces, meaning you can be in the room with two or three people, digital or not,

20
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:10,540
you should be teaching and imparting that, because the reason to impart this stuff is

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,060
to save on time, it's for the sake of efficiency, and it's not even time, some people, okay,

22
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:23,220
let's say time is graced by the distance between when you were born to when you die, I'd say

23
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:29,300
about 99% of the stuff that I've ever discussed on Sonics, most people will go that distance

24
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:35,720
from the cradle to the grave and not ever know or hear about it, ever, right, so actually

25
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:43,740
making a concerted effort to bring forward stuff that I know I'm good at, and okay, I'm

26
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:51,140
going to expand on that, because it's not what it sounds, is what I'm saying, to expand

27
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:56,920
on that for efficiency's sake, so people can hear it and catch up very quickly, of course,

28
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:02,280
if they're interested, now what I mean that I'm good at, is what I want to expand on,

29
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:09,080
is a very simple way that you don't need a lot of background, but you get everything

30
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,640
up front, okay, what do I mean by that, by the way, this goes into criticism also, you

31
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,780
should never accept criticism from someone that you normally would not ask for advice,

32
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:28,740
right, because think about what criticism is, so first of all, second of all, the form

33
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:36,380
of what advice is to advise, right, also has to fit, right, so there are a small concerted

34
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:42,580
group of people on this planet still, I believe, and it's evident by the subs, that want to

35
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:48,760
catch up with something that they don't know about, you know, right, but they know it'll

36
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:54,420
be interesting if they do, what I'm good at is, for example, when it comes to criticism,

37
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:02,320
like recently I helped out someone clean a professional space, now I'll give you the

38
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,560
little background, typically when you say you do cleaning work, I don't do cleaning

39
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,800
work, that's all I do, right, someone who does this cleaning work, they're looked down

40
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,680
upon, but they don't understand that in certain fields, like semiconductors, the clean, the

41
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,540
people that maintain the cleanliness of facilities like that, are at the paramount, at the top

42
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,480
of the pyramid, really, other than the engineers that, you know, so...

43
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,300
Well, the same thing with the old development of photographs, the people that actually kept

44
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,700
things clean and in order and all of that, and kept the chemicals straight...

45
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,380
Oh, yeah, you couldn't expose, yeah, digital is different, the pixels don't get dirty,

46
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:36,760
but...

47
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,200
Right, but in the days of chemical photography, like I'm saying, the people that...

48
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,300
Well, anything, see, well, anyway, one of the principals walked in and says, wow, I'd

49
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,360
like for you to do my space also, and I said, well, you know, it's expensive and it's not

50
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,840
what you think, I basically said to them, when you say you do cleaning work, it's looked

51
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,760
down on the society, but it's actually a very high attribute, and the principal response

52
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,200
was, yeah, you know, when I was young, my mom said, you didn't clean that, that's not

53
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,280
clean, and I said, is that all she said?

54
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:13,280
Pretty much, when you give criticism, and this is what I do, if I give criticism, I'm

55
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:20,320
going to produce the criticism as a gesticulation to the victim, right, because you're victimized

56
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:29,560
if you criticize, basically, that's the category, well, then I produce why it's what I criticized

57
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,400
it about, and then how to fix it.

58
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,300
If I can't do all those three things at once, I will not criticize, or those other two things,

59
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:42,100
if they can't follow, if I can't do a follow-through of why I'm criticizing it, and specifically,

60
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,560
and then how to remedy it, I will not form a criticism.

61
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,160
So it's fair to say that you're not going to bother to pick on someone or something unless

62
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,480
you know how to fix it, and then you'll also include that in picking on it.

63
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,880
What they can do about it, exactly.

64
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:58,700
I'll never call someone out on something, even derogatory, unless I can finish with

65
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,820
a component that will show them a way out of that, or a remedy.

66
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,420
Okay.

67
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:03,900
A remedy.

68
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,960
I always provide the remedy in the same breath, unlike the systems that you have now that

69
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,600
do not do that, do not provide the remedy.

70
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,120
So immediately.

71
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,700
By the way, when you hear of legal remedy or financial remedy, that means you're sick, right?

72
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,320
It's a sickness.

73
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,800
So, okay.

74
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,700
So what I'm thinking of is producing a seminar thing.

75
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:28,580
I did a take on it with the Scalarator, which I think I voiced on the last Sonic that anything

76
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,820
that I pretty much do, I've given up on doing it as a business or with an organization.

77
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:37,740
What it is, it's like I will promote myself as an artist, right?

78
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,040
Stelios the Greek, whatever, whatever, or however.

79
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,200
And this guy makes extraordinary devices.

80
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,900
And if you want one of his devices, you're actually buying a part, a piece of his time.

81
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,640
It's not something, right?

82
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:56,400
So when I worked in different fields and it always turned out the same, it always turned

83
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:56,940
out the same.

84
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:02,260
I've worked in various things and when I took one or two days off, I came back and everything

85
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:02,900
fell apart.

86
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,300
Now, it didn't fall apart at a critical failure.

87
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,840
It would have been fine for any other business, but for the level that I wanted it to operate

88
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,760
on, I considered it falling apart, right?

89
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,560
Because then we're just like everybody else.

90
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,860
So, right.

91
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,880
So what I'm planning is a long-winded explanation of what I'm thinking of in the background

92
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:29,860
is doing the prototype, the beta test of the Scalarator seminar, the way I went through

93
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:34,980
that, doing a series of those and getting into medical, legal, lawful, historical stuff.

94
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,640
And also, just to asterisk on the historical stuff, I'm leaning heavy on the material that

95
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,800
Brashear's, Jason Brashear's at Archaics is putting out, because everything historical

96
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,340
is based on chronological accuracy, right?

97
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,920
So I'm looking at what he's digging up and I'm finding some holes, but generally it holds

98
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,380
together.

99
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,400
In other words, it's a leaky boat, but it floats, if that makes any sense.

100
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,740
It's not airtight or watertight, right?

101
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,100
But it floats.

102
00:07:59,260 --> 00:07:59,420
Okay.

103
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,860
So I'm revising a lot of the stuff that I've said in the past and thought about because

104
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,620
of his work, which I appreciate.

105
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:11,660
But again, nothing is flawless as far as I can tell or no one is, I should say.

106
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,740
So I'm thinking of, I could get some feedback from people and do it, quote unquote, democratically

107
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:26,620
by the numbers, meaning what you would like to see or hear on these seminar sonic type

108
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:26,900
things.

109
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,400
And it'll be by myself and I'll be doing the admin, I'll be doing the whole thing on my

110
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:31,620
own.

111
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,299
So I have to learn how to use the digital payment systems and all that.

112
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,700
I just, I'll sit down and have complete control over it.

113
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:43,480
Maybe use something like Podbean, I don't know, something that offers it all together.

114
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:49,360
And something that doesn't rape you, like I found that from speaking with Sam and other

115
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:57,180
people that it's normal to pay over 10% of whatever fees you lay out to the host.

116
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,360
And that's like robbery, really anything over.

117
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,260
And I found that the younger the people are, the less they mind it.

118
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:12,540
But yeah, being a child of the early 60s, you know, and growing up in the 70s and 80s, anything

119
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:19,220
even even to the 2000s, anyone or anything that asked for more than 5% was scrutinized

120
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:19,880
very heavily.

121
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,060
Right.

122
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,980
I'm talking about like a non partnership, you know, like basically you're not doing anything,

123
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:25,580
you're just providing.

124
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:25,900
Right.

125
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,840
So, yeah.

126
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:33,060
So I'm like, oh, my gosh, you know, this is I don't think, you know, so I'm going to look

127
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:39,200
at all that stuff and put it out there because they by the way, my compensation is 150 bucks

128
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,680
an hour.

129
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,360
If people want to hire me, I just put that out there because I've gotten some messages

130
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,880
wondering what I would charge for doing something.

131
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:58,860
So my personal time at the minimum is 150 and it goes on a scale, right, depending

132
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:07,360
on like, for example, I used to do calls with consultation calls with professional people

133
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,400
and a two hour call, they would send me 500 bucks.

134
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,260
So that's more than 150 an hour.

135
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:13,800
Right.

136
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:14,980
It's 250.

137
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,460
Yeah.

138
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:16,800
Yeah.

139
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,740
And that's normal, by the way.

140
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:21,680
These psychics, you know, now, you know, the tarot reader, that's 250 an hour.

141
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,580
You go to their website.

142
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:28,080
Actually, I was thinking about the private readings run about 200 bucks an hour.

143
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,360
Yeah.

144
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:28,660
Anyway.

145
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,200
Yeah.

146
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:29,660
Yeah.

147
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,820
And what do you get for that?

148
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,980
I mean, I'm not going to criticize that because I don't have a remedy for it.

149
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,140
Right.

150
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:35,600
Yeah.

151
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:35,700
Yeah.

152
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,580
Other than to avoid it.

153
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,060
So I just want to put that out there.

154
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,240
That's what I see in the future.

155
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,040
A little bit.

156
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,720
Maybe that'll be my retirement so I don't have to eat out of a garbage can.

157
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:44,680
I don't know.

158
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:45,320
I don't know.

159
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,580
I just want to share that with everyone.

160
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,520
But what I also wanted to share also was the the aspect of criticism and all that.

161
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,520
You must provide the remedy and the solution.

162
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,360
And that also helps you with your own character development because it kind of slows you down.

163
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:03,940
Some people say I've been very harsh with them in the past and I don't come around and

164
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,760
say I'm sorry.

165
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:11,140
Everything I said, I still would say maybe it's the way I delivered it that was harsh.

166
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,060
Right.

167
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,740
But I don't take the content and the syntax and all that was correct.

168
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,300
But the way that it was done, maybe.

169
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:20,360
Yeah.

170
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,080
But no.

171
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,620
And that's very important.

172
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:30,380
So when I give frankly, I think automatically I would feel less of a harsh feeling for somebody

173
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:35,940
who criticizes me and provides a solution, like you said, or exactly automatically, that's

174
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,680
better because, look, if you're just going to pick on me and tell me what I you know,

175
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,160
and pull me down.

176
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,220
Well, you know, then you suck.

177
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:42,740
So what?

178
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,880
You know, but yeah, the Children's Indoctrination Center is known as the public fool system.

179
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:56,520
I mean, public school system sets up people for this kind of like prison rape molestation

180
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,420
system.

181
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:02,940
So in other words, what when you're in what they get away with doing in the schoolyard

182
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,500
will land them in jail at the off at the workplace.

183
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:05,880
Right.

184
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,380
Absolutely.

185
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:06,740
Yeah.

186
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,960
And that's, you know, the attorneys, by the way.

187
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,880
When you hear legal or illegal, illegal means that you don't have a license to do it.

188
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,940
It's not unlawful.

189
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,020
It has nothing to do with law.

190
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:22,740
So the society in terms of legal is raised like they're, you know, if you speak to someone

191
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,700
like they're eight years old for their entire life and you go and speak to them again when

192
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:33,060
they're 70, they can only comprehend that eight year old the way you talk to young children.

193
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:38,820
So if you look at way attorneys speak, doctors, the politicians, television, the school, whatever,

194
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,000
that is a juvenile approach.

195
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:46,240
These people grow up, you know, like if you live, if you have parents that are older workers

196
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,460
or whatever, you know, you look at them and they're older or whatever.

197
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,440
But yeah, if you think and listen to what they say and how they say it, it's no different

198
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,600
than an eight year old.

199
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:54,900
Right.

200
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:55,340
Right.

201
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,000
I've gotten a lot of feedback when I said that.

202
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:57,980
It was funny.

203
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,080
Once we had this lady, I really knocked how old people are useless.

204
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,480
You know, they were supposed to be bastions of wisdom years ago.

205
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:05,200
Right.

206
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,100
Oh, there was a comment about eight years ago.

207
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,700
Wait until the Greek heats.

208
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,300
What do you mean?

209
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:15,440
Well, old people are full of truth or the Greek is the terrible comp criticism.

210
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,200
I wait till he turns 50.

211
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,260
I was already past 50.

212
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:18,620
Right.

213
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,500
Well, I remember that on the old O.N.G.'s.

214
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,420
Yeah, I got responses like that.

215
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,220
People were like, well, what?

216
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,000
Learned elders.

217
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,700
How dare you?

218
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,360
Because they have been through more than you ever have been through.

219
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,280
And, you know, OK.

220
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,000
They've been through more diaper changes at 50.

221
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,700
Shame on them.

222
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,260
You know, then.

223
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:33,940
Yeah.

224
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:38,120
So so what's going on, for example, going back to the legal thing, when you hear illegal

225
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,540
all the let me translate that in plain language.

226
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,340
That just means you don't have license to do that.

227
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,060
So but here's the follow through.

228
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,520
Prohibition is prohibited, prohibited, by the way.

229
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,580
There is no prohibition.

230
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:55,220
Like after the prohibition laws were done on alcohol, it was an amendment to the Constitution

231
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:55,680
and all that.

232
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,840
And it was reamended, I think.

233
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,540
I think it went up to the Constitution, didn't it?

234
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:58,920
Yeah, it did.

235
00:13:59,020 --> 00:13:59,920
It was a constitutional amendment.

236
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:00,720
Yeah.

237
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,000
OK.

238
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,660
So that's why it was repealed.

239
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,520
That's why they say it was repealed, because they actually repeal the amendment.

240
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,020
Yeah.

241
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:08,620
Right.

242
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,460
Well, what they also did was they also prohibited prohibitions.

243
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,940
That's why you don't hear about prohibitions anymore.

244
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:23,000
So if they're telling you something is illegal without offering or telling you because due

245
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,760
to failure to have a maintain a license or acquire a license, they're actually not practicing

246
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,820
illegal, convicting you or charging you with illegality.

247
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,000
They're actually charging you with prohibition.

248
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,820
In other words, they're prohibitive.

249
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:38,680
Right.

250
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,500
So in other words, if someone says that's illegal, what you do is, well, I never was

251
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,600
aware that you were offering a license for it.

252
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,720
So how could it be illegal unless you offer a license for it?

253
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,220
See, yeah, this is pretty advanced, by the way.

254
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,880
The only people I could have a conversation with on this is like a fifteen hundred dollar

255
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,940
an hour attorney or a retired Supreme Court justice.

256
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,140
The regular attorneys don't know anything at all.

257
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:05,360
I mean, if I if you know an attorney, especially one that's been doing it for more than 20

258
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,380
years and bring up what I just did, he'll he'll flip out.

259
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:08,900
He'll laugh.

260
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:15,320
But if you press on him to research it about the same about a year, in about a year, he'll

261
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,440
come back, says, you know, what you're saying is actually correct.

262
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,560
I just never heard of it before.

263
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,860
This is how the I'm giving this as an example, because this is what you're this is what you're

264
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,400
dealing with.

265
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,680
Because remember, the attorneys, attorney generals, they're also operating as if they're

266
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,320
eight years old.

267
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,380
Doesn't matter if they're 70.

268
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,380
Well, because here's the reality about a common thing.

269
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,020
Drug charges.

270
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,320
Right.

271
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,340
When people get charged, you know, for for drug distribution, it's a prohibition.

272
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,500
They're telling you it's illegal.

273
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,160
It's illegal to sell because you don't have a license to do it.

274
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,800
That's what it basically comes down to.

275
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,540
Is that right?

276
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,620
You can get a license.

277
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,060
They don't finish that thought.

278
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,100
They don't finish that.

279
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,360
It's less left open.

280
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:49,600
You see?

281
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:50,160
Yeah.

282
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,400
But that's the reality of it is you don't have the right license.

283
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,540
When it comes to legal.

284
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:53,860
Yeah.

285
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,220
Right.

286
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,000
And lawful.

287
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,240
There is no unlawfulness with that unless you're deliberately doing harm to someone else.

288
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,800
There is no unlawful drug, by the way.

289
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:02,500
Right.

290
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,340
Not in and of itself.

291
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,140
It doesn't have.

292
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:05,800
No, there is.

293
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,260
In law, there's never been anything unlawful.

294
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:08,600
Right.

295
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,980
At all.

296
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,140
Not like like that.

297
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,020
Substances, foods or anything like that.

298
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:13,300
Right.

299
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:18,300
Permissible or non permissible in certain case, in certain situations.

300
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,940
So basically the whole legal system is based on you don't have a license to do that.

301
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,360
Like police have a license to kill.

302
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:25,860
Right.

303
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,320
And they pull that license from them.

304
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,040
It's very complex how they do it.

305
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,380
They will never charge a cop.

306
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:35,740
If you ever look at these cops, when they get charged for murder, a lot of them recently

307
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,560
have been going to prison for like second degree murder, right.

308
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,640
For shooting a perp.

309
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:39,860
Yes.

310
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:40,420
Right.

311
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,060
OK.

312
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,020
If you look at it, it doesn't work the way they show you on TV.

313
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:48,720
But if you look at how it works, how they do it, they cannot charge him unless they

314
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,580
relieve him of his badge number first.

315
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,980
That's why they're always fired first.

316
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,640
It's not because of the reaction from the community or any of that other stuff.

317
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,340
It's because they have to take that office away from them.

318
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,120
The badge number.

319
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:00,520
Yeah.

320
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,300
Not the badge.

321
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,660
Just a piece of metal.

322
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:07,660
They have to separate him from that number, which is a license, which indeed is not because

323
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,640
all police work for the city manager.

324
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:14,200
And the city manager is bankrupt, just like the city is.

325
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,240
And the city manager is working basically for their creditors.

326
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,339
But basically, I say if you run into a cop, say, hey, how's the city manager doing?

327
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:26,180
And they go back because they know that they know that it gets drummed out of them after

328
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:29,280
a while because they have these meetings with the sergeant every day, what they're supposed

329
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:29,700
to do.

330
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,020
Yeah.

331
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,820
And they don't bring it up, but they will bring up the importance of the city manager.

332
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:38,800
That was very much like in the commissioner in Batman, you know, it was basically a city

333
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,260
manager.

334
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,160
You know, it was the commissioner or whatever.

335
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,780
So it's all business.

336
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,720
There's no pulley in.

337
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,500
But in law, there is no police in law.

338
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:56,080
The only time police come around is when someone owns your town and they have a personal interest

339
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,960
in providing their own protection, just like a Wal-Mart, for example.

340
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,120
You'll have a Wal-Mart cop or a security guard on Wal-Mart.

341
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,220
He won't start walking the streets, the neighborhoods, right?

342
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:07,900
No.

343
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,360
Yeah.

344
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:13,880
If you if you pick another business that has the rent to cops, you know, they stay within

345
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,440
that area.

346
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:14,720
Right.

347
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,340
So it's the same thing.

348
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:19,820
Now, why does Wal-Mart hire a cop actually hiring cops now for a while?

349
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,380
Why do they hire the security?

350
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,760
Because they need the extra security.

351
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,240
They just to protect their property.

352
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,500
It's called loss prevention.

353
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:28,300
Right.

354
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,860
So that's what the police are there to do.

355
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,360
Loss prevention.

356
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,980
But also at the same time, because they work for the banks, they put out a lot of charges.

357
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:42,160
So this whole system or systems is based on very, very simple matter.

358
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:47,080
So I think that through the years, whenever I've gone into Greek speak subjects, I've

359
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:52,740
always provide within the first few breaths after bringing the subject, what's wrong with

360
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,400
it and why it's wrong, why and then how it could be fixed.

361
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:56,680
Right.

362
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:01,320
And basically, when you listen to Greek speak, the way to fix anything really is to just

363
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,840
be silent and non-participatory.

364
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:11,060
So if you see something heinous going on that you want to stop, don't address it because

365
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,440
it gives it energy because remember, they work both sides.

366
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,920
And we talked about last time.

367
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:15,500
Don't protest.

368
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:15,800
Yeah.

369
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,060
And don't protest.

370
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,440
But just withdraw any possible support.

371
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,020
They do it all the time.

372
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,600
They say, we're going to withdraw funding.

373
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,300
Are you outside or do you have an open window, by the way?

374
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,740
No, I'm outside in the birds.

375
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,720
Bird migration.

376
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,060
Yeah.

377
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,160
I was hearing birds chirping.

378
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:30,940
That's why I was wondering.

379
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,420
OK, sorry.

380
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:32,800
Yeah.

381
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,660
It's cool.

382
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,060
In the desert, you have bird migration.

383
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,500
Not so much in the back east, I remember, but you have bird migrations and they get

384
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,480
really chirpy, really chatty at night.

385
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:42,900
Right.

386
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,240
No, I was noticing that.

387
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,520
Yeah, I was just noticing it.

388
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,140
And I was like, wow, it's cool, though.

389
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,040
I mean, it's not distracting.

390
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,440
It's just this like late in the background.

391
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,220
Sure, it's distracting.

392
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:51,740
It's distracting.

393
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,960
It made you voice about it.

394
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:54,320
But OK.

395
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,440
The other thing I want to bring up was offensive.

396
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:57,860
Some people.

397
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:58,360
OK.

398
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,940
How people take offense.

399
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,600
Not legal offenses.

400
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,720
I'm done with the legal stuff.

401
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:03,980
Right.

402
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,120
Well, people feel offended.

403
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:06,660
You know what?

404
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,080
They're too dumb to be offended.

405
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:14,540
In other words, when people say they were offended, it's part of the training mechanism.

406
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:18,340
In other words, they heard somewhere like, you have a right to your religion.

407
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,520
And if anyone says anything, it's offensive.

408
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:20,980
Right.

409
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:21,920
And so they.

410
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:22,340
Right.

411
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,920
You see, people are too dumb to be genuinely offended.

412
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:25,180
Yeah.

413
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:29,120
I find most people that use that phrase that say they're offended have no idea why.

414
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:29,600
Actually.

415
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:29,900
Yeah.

416
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,600
It's all pre-packaged.

417
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,460
Because that's offensive.

418
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,000
That's it.

419
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:33,740
And it's like, well.

420
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,740
But why is it offensive?

421
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,340
Well, because they learned it on TV.

422
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,360
Like, for example, this morning I made a pancake.

423
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:40,980
Now I don't make pancakes.

424
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,180
I make pan cakes.

425
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,600
You know the difference between pancakes and pan cakes?

426
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:46,900
No, I don't.

427
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,340
What is it?

428
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:47,900
OK.

429
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,240
Pancakes are like what you need.

430
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,120
Stacks and all that.

431
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:50,560
And you get them.

432
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,400
They're not very good.

433
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,220
And people say my grandma makes great pancakes.

434
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:53,980
Go over to grandma's.

435
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,260
And he's like, oh, I wouldn't use these.

436
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,400
I'll use as a doorstop.

437
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:56,640
Right.

438
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,280
By the way.

439
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,160
Anyone ever tell you my mom's a good cook or grandma's a good cook?

440
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:00,980
Bullshit.

441
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:01,900
They can't cook.

442
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:02,780
But anyway.

443
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,880
Especially if they're white.

444
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:06,760
I know.

445
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,140
So, yeah, it's true.

446
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,820
It's just that needs to stop.

447
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,640
And it has stopped.

448
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,960
Because most of them have passed away.

449
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,220
But OK.

450
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:19,080
The difference between a pancake and a pan cake is the first one most people know about.

451
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:19,960
They're not that good.

452
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,400
Even if you like them, you know they're not that good.

453
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:22,820
Right.

454
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,680
But a pan cake is more like a cake.

455
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,880
But it's made in a pan.

456
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:27,260
But it looks like a pancake.

457
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,180
OK.

458
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,800
It's just delicious.

459
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:31,120
OK.

460
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,080
Why is it delicious?

461
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:37,420
Because I use almond flour and hard wheat, like a Hungarian high altitude wheat.

462
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:37,940
OK.

463
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:38,260
Right.

464
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,280
And other things in it.

465
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,800
And it's really wonderful and moist.

466
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,060
And it's just like a good white sponge cake.

467
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:44,960
But it looks like a pancake.

468
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,020
OK.

469
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:46,380
So anyway.

470
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:47,740
With that, I made.

471
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,320
I had some fried eggs.

472
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,320
And it's funny.

473
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,040
And when I lay the eggs down, people always watch me.

474
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:56,440
Because when you crack an egg into a pan, most people do it how?

475
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,740
The way they saw it where?

476
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:58,780
On TV.

477
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,240
On TV.

478
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,460
And how do they do it?

479
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,340
They got some guy.

480
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:01,760
And boom.

481
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,400
He breaks the egg.

482
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:05,120
It's about anywhere between four to six inches off the pan.

483
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,100
Splashes the egg down.

484
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:06,740
Wrong.

485
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,580
That's not how you do it.

486
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,760
You crack the egg very carefully.

487
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,320
And never do it on a sharp object.

488
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,000
Always on a blunt object to crack it.

489
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,600
And you lower the egg.

490
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:18,940
Now, if you have asbestos fingers, fingers like asbestos that can take the heat, it's

491
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:19,240
even better.

492
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:23,920
You lower the egg into the, as close as you can take to the pan without touching the hot

493
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,500
butter or oil to burn your fingers, as low as possible.

494
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,980
And as slowly as possible, open the shell into the pan or the griddle.

495
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,100
Very slowly open it.

496
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,480
And as low as possible.

497
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,860
And let it flow out.

498
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,280
Right?

499
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,060
You have more control.

500
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,340
And the egg turns out much better.

501
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:43,680
Now, if you watch most people prepare breakfast, they'll open a fried egg.

502
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,880
They'll drop the egg at a pretty good height.

503
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,040
Right?

504
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:47,860
Why?

505
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,680
Because they saw it on TV.

506
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,080
And you wouldn't believe.

507
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:56,880
I've been watching people, including my wife, for a long time.

508
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:04,240
I'd say about 75 to 90% people around me, the things that they do, they got from TV.

509
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:04,920
Wow.

510
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,760
And that's one of my criticisms.

511
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,380
I say, you do that like they do it on TV, which is absolutely wrong or deficient.

512
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,640
And it will not give good results.

513
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:12,980
Why?

514
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:18,140
Because no matter how good it looks to drop an egg from six or eight inches or two stories

515
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,400
up on a griddle, guess what?

516
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,260
TV uses.

517
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,080
TV magic.

518
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,540
They have what's called editing.

519
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,060
Right.

520
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:27,500
Then they have the stunt chef in the background make the eggs that they present.

521
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,100
They're not going to present the eggs that you saw the guy drop.

522
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:30,920
Right?

523
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,980
Well, a lot of them they do right in front of you where it's like the guy's preparing.

524
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:34,740
He's moving stuff.

525
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,780
He's doing all that for you.

526
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,740
And then he goes, and by the way, it'll turn out like this.

527
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,220
And he grabs a pan from behind him.

528
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:39,540
Yeah.

529
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:45,160
Just like I've educated a lot of people with these fixer-up things and stuff that they build

530
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:45,700
out in the jungle.

531
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,980
I said, that's all done by stuntmen.

532
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:47,780
Right.

533
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,100
There's actually, it's very well known.

534
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,180
Nothing is real.

535
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,300
Nothing is presented.

536
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,960
Just like the World Trade Center.

537
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:58,300
Only the people with a TV saw airplanes go into the building.

538
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,680
Everyone else saw the buildings explode.

539
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:04,520
Right.

540
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:09,760
So, but how many people know about that event from television and how many people know about

541
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,220
that event because of the boots on the ground?

542
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,880
It's like a million to one.

543
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:13,440
Yeah.

544
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:14,440
Right.

545
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,260
So you don't stand a chance.

546
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:21,760
So again, when you watch someone frying, dropping fried eggs into a pan or a griddle, guess

547
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,720
where they learned that from?

548
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:26,180
So that's one of the things I want to counter with Greek speak, because one of my criticisms

549
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:30,660
has been released for the past 10 years is you learn to watch, you do that just like

550
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,540
they do it on TV.

551
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,180
And now most people don't know how to take that.

552
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,860
They'll say, oh, well, thanks because I'm famous.

553
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:40,240
But no, that's stupid because everyone knows TV is stupid.

554
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:40,860
Right.

555
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,200
So it's a known fact.

556
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,100
It's very well known.

557
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:43,960
So.

558
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:50,620
Again, just about everyone I met, about 70 to 90 percent of what they do, they and say

559
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:53,800
and say and offends them, they get from TV or they learn from.

560
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:54,360
Right.

561
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:54,960
There is no.

562
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,820
It's authentically stupid.

563
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:58,980
Put it that way.

564
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,280
Right.

565
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:05,500
So if I can counter that with a few last breaths, I have few, meaning how many breaths I have

566
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:10,620
left, that would be a better contribution than just having these conversations, even though

567
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,980
I think these conversations have aided many people.

568
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,700
Another thing I want to just suggest is that there's quite a few new people.

569
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:22,060
By the way, we don't have a big sub subscribership or listenership, but there are quite a few

570
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,740
new people, quite a few.

571
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:24,200
Right.

572
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,440
And most of them, like I was communicating with someone this morning, he did not know

573
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,260
about lawful timekeeping, barely heard of it.

574
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,860
But he listens to the Sonics now, you know, because he's recent.

575
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:44,900
So I think Sam has provided on the page or page free to anyone, especially if you're a

576
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,380
sub past events.

577
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,900
And I think you and I did one on how to keep time.

578
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:50,440
Absolutely.

579
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:50,940
Yeah.

580
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:51,840
Yeah.

581
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:57,440
So what I might do if I do the seminar thing, which I think I have to do the seminar thing

582
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,200
because I have I've been speaking with you and others for such a long time and there's

583
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,640
still a majority of stuff that I just haven't put out because it's not a subject that I

584
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,660
could just bring up and discuss.

585
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,740
It's a subject that I have to bring up.

586
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,880
I have to preface.

587
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,920
I have to inform and then discuss with time in between.

588
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,100
It's kind of like the weather work.

589
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,540
We can talk.

590
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,680
You and I could do three Sonics on weather work.

591
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:21,980
Right.

592
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:22,420
OK.

593
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,740
And how to manipulate the weather.

594
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:30,000
I'm talking about DIY, not about the all the fear mongering stuff about harp and the guy

595
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,480
that winning Dave Whittington talks about the chemtrails and none of that stuff.

596
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:33,780
Right.

597
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:38,680
You can't do it in three consecutive Sonics from back to back because you need to give

598
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,320
people that are industrious.

599
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:43,960
By the way, if you want to do weather work, what I mean by being industrious, you just

600
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,180
walk around your neighborhood and pick up junk that people throw out in a scrap bin.

601
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:52,520
That's what it seems to have more effect when you find the stuff in the garbage than do

602
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,440
you go out and buy it.

603
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,960
Meaning like a two piece of pipe.

604
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:55,260
Right.

605
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:55,700
OK.

606
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,100
Seems to work better.

607
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,420
But I'm only kidding.

608
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,060
It doesn't work better.

609
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,020
Just more satisfying.

610
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:01,420
Right.

611
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:05,080
It's more satisfying to find like a four foot piece of pipe in the garbage and you end up

612
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,100
making that a rainmaker.

613
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,780
Well, purchasing something that seems to have been discarded into something useful.

614
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,100
Yeah.

615
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:10,680
Yeah.

616
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,860
Extremely satisfying.

617
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:12,140
OK.

618
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:17,640
So I think giving people time in between weather work at least a week or two or three to practice

619
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:22,140
on their own and then you could do more of a Q&A and develop it.

620
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,700
Recently, I've gotten positive feedback from someone that I sent a small custom built device

621
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,000
that they've over a year ago now.

622
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,720
And they haven't had much success.

623
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:37,260
And we finally got into a more detailed discussion.

624
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,400
And he was it was not set up optimally.

625
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,620
They didn't really even though I had gone over these fine points, they didn't get it.

626
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,560
And they were it was not set up optimally.

627
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,080
It was set up.

628
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,240
It wasn't really working that well.

629
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:51,780
And then once I started discussing the fine points, why we set it up this way, he's been

630
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,040
getting results.

631
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:53,500
OK.

632
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:54,140
Right.

633
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:58,980
So you would think like a 10 degree change in angle the way you angle it would be the

634
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:02,340
difference between no results and consistent results.

635
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:02,640
Right.

636
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,320
Makes sense.

637
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:03,560
Yeah.

638
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:04,360
Yeah.

639
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,580
So these things are critical.

640
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:11,860
So a lot of times when I say like 50, I don't know, I don't mean 49 or 51.

641
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,660
I mean, 50.

642
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,140
Right.

643
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:17,320
If I say 108 degrees, I don't mean 107 or 109.

644
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:17,900
I mean, 108.

645
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:24,680
So once you start listening on that level, right, then you'll be more successful.

646
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:32,160
And I think that can only come through in a didactic context and climate, like a seminar

647
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:32,640
type thing.

648
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:40,720
Like I noticed when I did the Scalarator seminar, there was good participation and people were

649
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,060
attentive and what I was going over.

650
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:47,300
And I went over everything in great detail, step by step.

651
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,340
What precautions, what to expect, what could happen that you shouldn't accept.

652
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:54,580
Right.

653
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,360
Things like that.

654
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:00,740
Basically walk through all that and doing something like that on various other things.

655
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:06,060
Now, we started off talking about wrapping things tightly.

656
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,320
Now, I just wanted to bring it up.

657
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,120
What came up a while back with someone is that they mentioned I said I would address

658
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,100
it on a sonic, which I did.

659
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:17,760
They had a sore on their leg, lower leg, and they wrapped it tight was getting worse.

660
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,340
Well, that's because the sore was a natural occlusion.

661
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,600
The body wanted to get so if the body wants to exit, it's kind of like barricading the

662
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,260
exit door.

663
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:26,560
Right.

664
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,360
You don't do that.

665
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,580
You could barricade the entrance door to stop people from coming in.

666
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,600
But not right now.

667
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,540
That's not a good thing, because actually, when you when you wrap a wound tightly, it's

668
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,800
the same thing as putting a patch on a tire.

669
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:39,820
Right.

670
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:44,520
You need to prevent the vacuum loss from continuing, because if you don't wrap a wound

671
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,000
tightly.

672
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,560
The body will will clog it up and fill the hole on its own.

673
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:53,000
You get a lot of swelling, you know, long time feeling.

674
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:57,680
But if you wrap it tight, the body gets the signal that we've got the vacuum loss taken

675
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,180
care of.

676
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,620
Let's go back to normal.

677
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:00,820
Right.

678
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:01,420
OK.

679
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,900
And the body will heal itself because it's epithelial tissue.

680
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:05,340
Right.

681
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,320
So.

682
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:13,620
But when the body has a sore, that outbreak, you want to encourage that to to to to dump

683
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,240
out what it be.

684
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:14,460
Right.

685
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:15,500
You want it.

686
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,560
You don't want to wrap it tight.

687
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:21,660
And once it's done doing that, you know, it's done doing what it's supposed to be doing.

688
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,180
Then you could wrap it tight to finish off the healing.

689
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:29,260
And I think that was the whole thing of the the episode that we the sonic event we spoke

690
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,960
on in the while back.

691
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,660
And that's something I never really covered because I never really thought of mentioning

692
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:42,600
if you have a sore that is trying to expel something to to encourage it, you know, with

693
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:48,500
warm, wet compresses and things to have it flow, warm bathing and change of diet.

694
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,040
Right.

695
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:53,260
So when it's trying to go outward, when it's trying to push something outward, you want

696
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,080
to encourage it.

697
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:59,360
And when it's not doing that, what you want to do is restore the sealed vacuum as best

698
00:30:59,360 --> 00:30:59,820
you can.

699
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:04,900
And but the body when the body releases something like that, it already minds the vacuum on

700
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,300
its own.

701
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,900
It's kind of like a balcony on a on a house versus a window that you jump out of.

702
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,940
OK, it's a you could step outside, but you don't right.

703
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,700
You don't falls.

704
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:22,380
In other words, the body will make a sore and let things step out.

705
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,380
But we will not compromise the vacuum while it's doing that.

706
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,080
Right.

707
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:27,560
Essentially.

708
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,820
But there still is a compromise in the vacuum.

709
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,500
There still is a compromise.

710
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,960
There's still a break in the skin.

711
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,620
So that has to be repaired.

712
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,080
And as that's being repaired, some things are going to go out.

713
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:37,980
Some things are going to go in.

714
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,320
The vacuum loss of the body.

715
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,360
What's your first sign?

716
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,640
Mucus, mucus, mucus development.

717
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:47,180
Right.

718
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,220
Whenever you see mucus development.

719
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:54,320
And by the way, one way to really send this home, do some basic anatomy.

720
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,060
A pregnant woman holds a baby or whatever trimester.

721
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:04,780
If you go look at the anatomy of it, of a pregnant woman, the uterus, the bottom of the

722
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,700
uterus, what keeps everything from falling out?

723
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,400
It has.

724
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,200
What's it called?

725
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:08,920
Mucus plug.

726
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,940
Exactly.

727
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:11,340
Yeah.

728
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:19,580
So whenever you develop mucus, even mucus linings, things like that, it is to prevent

729
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:19,880
vacuum.

730
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,500
But by the way, your colon has a mucus line.

731
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,220
Right.

732
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:27,600
The entire colon has a mucus lining, but it's a different type of mucus.

733
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,920
So that's why people who do frequent enemas get very, very ill.

734
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,120
These strange diseases.

735
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,140
And they don't know why.

736
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:34,480
Right.

737
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,180
Because they've cleaned out all the natural.

738
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:36,440
Yeah.

739
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:38,560
So.

740
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:41,340
The.

741
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,940
The aspect of knowing the signaling.

742
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:45,440
Right.

743
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:51,280
So when people to little children get sick, they get very typical for children to get

744
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:51,600
mucus.

745
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:52,260
Right.

746
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:52,780
Right.

747
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:57,380
They even it's so typical now that when you go to the pediatric part of a drugstore

748
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,900
or whatever, they sell these little syringes that you stick in the baby's nose, suck

749
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:01,580
the mucus out.

750
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:01,840
Right.

751
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,980
That's where the phrase not knows little kid because they constantly.

752
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:06,600
Yeah.

753
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:10,540
Because they're constantly eating food that deters, you know, development from, you

754
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,700
know, the body's developing to maintain a vacuum.

755
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:13,860
Right.

756
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:18,220
They're eating things that are non-seasonal, you know, from a non-territorial,

757
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,320
non-local.

758
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:22,010
Look at baby food.

759
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:26,670
You know, they the brands that put out baby food, they put out a menu and they

760
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:29,030
serve that same menu wherever you go in the US.

761
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:29,330
Right.

762
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:29,930
Yeah.

763
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,290
Pretty much.

764
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:31,550
Yeah.

765
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:32,350
Tropical food.

766
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,910
They even have one called tropical fruit.

767
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,110
Well, every time of the year.

768
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:35,310
Yeah.

769
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:37,150
There's tropical fruit, but there's plenty of bananas.

770
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,930
Bananas is most common constant.

771
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:41,550
Doesn't matter what time of year it is or where you are.

772
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:42,310
And it doesn't matter.

773
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:42,910
You know.

774
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:43,250
No.

775
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:44,250
Yeah.

776
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,010
So they're going to get.

777
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:45,250
Yeah.

778
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:48,030
Drink the oranges so you don't get sick in the winter.

779
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:48,570
Oh, yeah.

780
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:48,810
Sure.

781
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:54,410
So, OK, all these things now breaking them down to a point where we can start from

782
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:55,050
the beginning.

783
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:56,830
A recap.

784
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:59,190
Didn't we do a recap recently on something?

785
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:00,350
What did we do?

786
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,950
Did we do a recap on or not?

787
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:02,490
We've done it.

788
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:03,230
Was it the container?

789
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:03,970
The container.

790
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:04,530
We did a recap.

791
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:04,710
Yeah.

792
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,430
I didn't really we didn't really get technical.

793
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,949
I just pretty much ranted on how bad the system is.

794
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:13,989
And by the way, speaking of bad system is I'm hearing more and more people

795
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:16,070
passing away like they're totally fine.

796
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:16,489
Right.

797
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:18,010
Totally fine.

798
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:20,810
And then they go for some procedure and they're dead in two weeks.

799
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:21,409
Yep.

800
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,790
Very common now.

801
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:26,110
I'm saying these are people that I know.

802
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:27,409
Right.

803
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:28,969
And I tell them, oh, don't go there.

804
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:29,449
They'll die.

805
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:30,350
And then it's like funny.

806
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,530
You know, it's like two weeks later.

807
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:31,870
They die.

808
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:32,590
They die.

809
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:34,929
And I'm like, I told him.

810
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:37,190
It's like, what the hell?

811
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:38,290
Yeah.

812
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:38,870
Yes.

813
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,409
So just I bring that up.

814
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:43,909
So wherever you are in your circles, watch out for that, too.
