1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:13,660
Rated Y Sonic Event 108, and here we are, Greek, how are you doing?

2
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:19,980
Hey, before we started we were talking about architecture, dumb people, academia, oh my

3
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,800
goodness, you know, I rarely, I'm usually walking around and doing stuff when we record

4
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,140
this Sonic, but now I'm sitting in the office in front of the big rectangle, and I put in

5
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,900
tornado damage, right, recently, and just look at the architecture, it's like, these

6
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:41,940
people are stupid, typically that's like stick and mud construction, or stick and siding,

7
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,000
and when I mean by stick and siding, you ever drop, you know the old style wooden matches,

8
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,480
a box of wooden matches, you know?

9
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,060
Oh yeah, I have some around the house now, but yeah, yeah.

10
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,040
You ever drop a box and it completely spills out, that's what these houses look like.

11
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,340
Yeah, it all goes in different directions.

12
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,780
Yeah, it just looks like a bunch of matchsticks falling down, why would you build like that?

13
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:08,860
And how could you be so stupid to buy into, when I say buy into, I mean literally and mentally

14
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:14,000
that you could live there, I have zero sympathy for them, as a matter of fact, they should

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,120
nuke the place and clear it out and let the stuff grow, what did I just say, never mind,

16
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,320
scratch that, we'll edit that out.

17
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:20,900
Rewilding?

18
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:27,480
Yeah, they need to just go, I don't feel any more sorry, actually I feel more sorry for

19
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:34,880
the cows that got drowned or something, endless miles of dead cows, but anyway, I just want

20
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,120
to bring this up because it's so pathetic, let's get into this real quick, because the

21
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,840
architecture part, there's no reason to talk about it, a half-wit could look at the damage,

22
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:49,480
right, which will be most of the people looking at the damage by the way, and they will not

23
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:56,840
stop and pause and say this needs to not be done this way, meaning why are you building,

24
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,180
okay.

25
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,880
Let's separate, wait, let's separate things for a moment, okay, there is architecture

26
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,060
that's planned out, and then there's stuff that just sort of happens as it's needed,

27
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:12,840
okay, now you have a swelling of a population in an area, so there's more housing needed.

28
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,920
You have livestock, yep, bipedal livestock, yep.

29
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,580
Fine, but yeah, go ahead.

30
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,560
Let's look at it this way, it's very simple, even Jack Fresco went into it, make a little

31
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,860
paper cardboard cube, you know, about six inches or 10 inches or even a foot, you can

32
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,860
pick it up with one hand, it's very easy to grab, right, especially if you have a leaf

33
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,420
blower, you'll notice they'll go off the table.

34
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:38,180
Make something dome-shaped or conical, especially hyperbolic, where it gets skinnier, you know,

35
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,400
like a hyperbolic, it's not a consistent cone, try to pick it up with your hand, it just slips

36
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,220
out of your hand, there's no way you can pick it up, right, with one hand, right, so why

37
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,580
don't you, okay, so you get it, right?

38
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:52,460
Now, here's the thing, let's just get into this really simple, by the way, I could have

39
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:56,560
prevented all of that from here in Tucson where I'm at, that happened in Midwest, I

40
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,840
could have prevented all of it, and they foreshadowed it a week ago, they said by the end of the

41
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,860
week you can have some really bad weather here, I said, well, let's see how it pans out.

42
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:10,460
I do message with someone who does frequently get devices from me, they're on the East Coast,

43
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:17,760
I'm not going to mention their name, and we're in frequent contact and doing some fine-tuning,

44
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:25,340
and one thing that I've watched this person develop in doing weather work is the hardest

45
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:32,360
thing is to figure out how simple it is, right, because you're, okay, wow, you know, I told you

46
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:38,040
I almost got in trouble, okay, let me just preface it this way, I was traveling back and forth to

47
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,660
Texas and New Mexico doing stuff, and I always brought up an old-fashioned, well, my version of

48
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:48,040
a modern cloud buster, right, and one day I was traveling with someone, I sit on the side of

49
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:53,040
the road, I said, hey, you know, we've never been to this town before, and I looked at it, and it's like,

50
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:58,240
you know, when was the last time it rained in that town, so it doesn't show, I mean, you know, a month

51
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,600
or so, I said, you know, it's summer, I'm going to go into this town, I'm going to smell their garbage

52
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,800
and all their brake dust, you know, when you walk into a city, you go into a city, it smells

53
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,900
different, right, each city smells different, oh, yeah, absolutely, yeah, yeah, and I'm going to smell

54
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,620
their whatever and their brake dust, you know, because cars, you know, every time a car goes to

55
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,060
a red light, there's a tiny amount of brake dust that's released, right, this, okay, most of the

56
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:27,120
smells in cities, by the way, is what type of brakes they're using, anyway, okay, I don't want to go

57
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,460
on a tangent, but just think about why is it that large portions of New York City smell like urine,

58
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:36,020
then that's got nothing to do with the brake dust, yeah, in New York, they can piss on their brakes, it

59
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:41,280
wouldn't matter, so there you go, okay, so anyway, I was like, you know, I don't want to go to this town

60
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,740
and smell the town, why don't we just make some rain and freshen it up, you know, we're two hours

61
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:50,260
away, we'll make the rain now, by the time we get there, it'll be over, and this is what we're doing,

62
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:56,300
it was very successful at it and very consistent at it, so we're at the side of the road, and we're

63
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:01,380
setting this stuff up, and you know, it was some of these weigh stations, you know, they have

64
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,440
bathrooms, you know, on the side of the highway, people stop, some of them are extra long, you know,

65
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,060
like you park off to the side, there's a building, there's picnic areas, right, of course, where

66
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,140
everybody used to the bathroom, no buffer zone, right, so there's family, there's these children,

67
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,900
and like a young adult, like an uncle type, what are you doing, is that a telescope, said no, it's a

68
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:24,180
weather machine, we're making weather, oh no, yeah, sure, so they go around, another couple of people

69
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:29,600
come over, how does it work, well anyway, make a long story short, there's a sheriff there, and he

70
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,660
comes over, and he's very upset that the people are talking about that I'm doing weather work,

71
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:39,840
you're making weather, yeah, making, yeah, and I said, oh no, weather, no, this is just an

72
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,900
atmospheric device, come on, the weather, only God can do the weather, right, and he's like, yeah,

73
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:49,700
that's right, these people don't know what they're talking about, right, you get it, so you have

74
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:56,260
plausible deniability, in other words, once you, the experience that I have over 20 years in this

75
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:00,800
now, I can teach within a few weeks, depending if you have sensibility and sensitivity, you have to

76
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:07,240
have sensibility and sensitivity, and make them interchangeable, you can learn how to do this

77
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:12,940
within, let's say, a few moons, okay, and even advance it, and be on level where I'm at with 20

78
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:17,300
years experience, working directly with Trevor James Constable, and Joe Blankenship, and people

79
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:23,900
like that, right, so, but you have to really decide if you're going to give up all the garbage that

80
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:28,600
you've been carrying your whole life about what these, what the weather really is, and you'll find

81
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,240
out on your own, I'll brief you, and outline you, and what's going on, and we're going to do a little

82
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,660
bit of that now, whether there's interest in weather or not, you know, I'm going to bring up

83
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:43,320
a few things that you've never heard before, so I could have completely prevented that from here,

84
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:48,380
because right now, I can do half of the world from where I'm at, right, and we're talking about

85
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:53,380
radical shit, like, we're getting at the end of spring, when summer starts, I can make it snow in

86
00:06:53,380 --> 00:07:00,420
a tropical place, right, I love when it's Christophe, yeah, I've done it twice already, snow, right, so,

87
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,680
right, because snow is not frozen water, I mean, it's not frozen rain, like they tell you, it's a

88
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,960
completely different system, just like hail is not frozen rain, it's a completely different system,

89
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,660
anyone who's been in big areas where hail comes, you can always tell the hail clouds have a greenish

90
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,740
yellowish tinge to them, right, always, and you know, it's going to be held by the color

91
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:25,560
frequency, the same with snow, hail doesn't act like regular ice anyway, oh no, no, it's,

92
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:32,400
these things are not the same, okay, you know, okay, it's like pizza and birthday cake,

93
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:37,320
right, or cupcakes, completely different, but they're made from the same stuff, right,

94
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:42,500
they diverge, and they're no longer the same, right, at a certain point of it being made,

95
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:47,120
okay, by the way, I made a great pizza, I'm learning how to operate this

96
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:53,620
pizza oven, 800 degrees, talking 42 seconds to make a pie, right, I'll send you a picture of it,

97
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:59,600
Neapolitan style, 42 seconds, man, it's great, okay, 800 degrees Fahrenheit, okay,

98
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,500
so what's going on is really reasonable, by the way,

99
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,740
because you have plausibility, let me just do a double wink, because you have plausibility on

100
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,440
your side, you can do anything, in other words, if you're feeling evil one particular morning,

101
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:21,700
you can get up and make a county or municipality 500 or 1000 miles away from you a disaster zone,

102
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:27,380
I mean, this is how, so this is not a real reality, if you can do that with just a simple

103
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:33,280
rudimentary devices, right, or you can stop a disaster from happening, if it's known, and it

104
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:38,299
has all the precedence for becoming one, well, if things are the way that they explain them to us

105
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:42,120
regarding this, then you should not be able to do with temperature, look, like they said,

106
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,540
yeah, you should not be able to do something like that with a simple device, I mean, it's just that

107
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,060
that's what it comes down to, yeah, but we'll look at the old radios, I don't know, see,

108
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:58,980
I was fortunate enough to my first teeth kit radio was one that was NOS, new old stock from

109
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:04,440
the 1930s. So I got this, I opened this thing up in the 70s and built something that was built,

110
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:11,060
made in the 30s. It was a little crystal with cords around it and some wire and ceramic parts.

111
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:17,840
And the instruction was to go to a chain link fence. And you had this little earphone, you

112
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,540
can make the right, remember the very early, there's just one never stereo. I remember the

113
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:26,820
old, old, old earphones, right? Oh, yeah, you can see the twisted wires on it. And it's made out

114
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:32,180
of that bakelite plastic that turns yellow, you know, right, right. Yeah, anyway, and so I'm making

115
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:36,800
a radio. And you can pick up all kinds of stuff. And I'm like, Oh, my gosh, this is like primitive.

116
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:43,600
This is so crude, right? So same thing. It's exactly the same thing. Right? You can elaborate

117
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,080
a little bit more and you could broadcast using the same technology, but it's called a transducer.

118
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:54,680
So what do we have here? First of all, we have an open plain, an area that was not at that

119
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,620
elevation about, let's say 1000 years ago, the Midwest where these things happen,

120
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:06,400
were mountainous ranges that were leveled. Okay, how do we know that? Because there's a tremendous,

121
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:12,720
first of all, when that area was resettled by the Westerners, there was like 11 feet of topsoil,

122
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,000
you know, anything that's got more than a foot of topsoil is a foot of topsoil is considered very

123
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,380
rich. Right? So there's a lot of weird things why that happened there, but we're not going to get

124
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:30,560
into that now. So underneath that is a tremendous amount of lodestone in the Midwest iron, right?

125
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:36,580
Let me just give you a hint. You know, the US for about 70 years was the biggest iron producer,

126
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:42,340
steel producer in the world for over almost 100 years, right? Right. Okay. So where do they get

127
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:46,680
the iron, right? It's just they go out anywhere and you get it. That's why when I talk about water

128
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:52,400
treatment or whatever, so just get some magnets, tape them to a stick and drag them on the ground,

129
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,320
then you'll find sand that looks black and sticks to the magnet. That's magnetite, right? It's

130
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:04,020
everywhere. Very pervasive. Anyway, so you have these conditions. And now we have these conditions

131
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:10,320
now, these tornadoes strike and it happens every year around the same time, right? Some years worse

132
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,660
than others. Actually, if you'll notice that when we have a 13th moon, it's much worse.

133
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:21,520
Tornado season, they often call it a tornado alley. Yeah. Okay. All right. So let's get into

134
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:27,200
the real basic part. Okay. Where else do we see that funnel shape in a bathtub, right? In order

135
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,000
to get that funnel shape happening in your bathtub, it's called a drain. Yeah. Around the drain. You

136
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,060
see it, right? Right. Now, what is a drain? A drain means, okay. A drain could be anywhere.

137
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:42,100
Actually, let me just get out of the picture for a second. You know, I can have my bathtub drain to

138
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:48,340
the ceiling if the pressure in a hole, let's say I made a hole in the ceiling. I could have my water

139
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:53,380
in my bathtub drain to that hole in the ceiling if the pressure in that hole was low enough, right?

140
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,700
Right. Because the greater pressure, the regular pressure goes to a lower pressure.

141
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:03,320
Goes to a lower pressure. Yeah. The reason why. Now, when the drain pressure starts to increase

142
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,640
and it goes to zero, it's not negative anymore. You have a clog and it doesn't drain.

143
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,680
Right. It means it's equal to the pressure of the sidewall of the bathtub. So,

144
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,320
in other words, that drain hole always has to have a lower pressure than the surrounding tub area.

145
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:23,500
Right. Give you another example of how to think of this. Your drain hole is plugged, right? Let's

146
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,700
say you live in a place where you got these fiberglass tubs. Okay. So, honey, the tub doesn't

147
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:33,560
drain. Yeah. Right. So, you go in and I'll fix that. So, you get a drill and you drill right

148
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,480
through the side of the tub. Another hole and water starts pouring out of the tub. Right.

149
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,500
You just put another drain hole. Yeah. That does work. Right. Why does it go out that hole? Because

150
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:47,320
it sees that that hole that you made has less pressure than the sidewall of the tub. Right.

151
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:53,260
Simple. Simple. Now, this sounds Greek. I know this. Yeah. But do you know it? In other words,

152
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:59,660
every time you see a system, can you break it down that simple? Right. And now this is where

153
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:04,560
you get into this is now. Hey, you ready? I'm going to quote something new. It's probably for

154
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,240
future songs. It's going to be called The Inventor's Lounge. This is how inventors and

155
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:15,400
creative people think. Right. Right. They don't think like normal people. Right. Right. So,

156
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:21,360
most normal people say, oh, it's a dream. It's clogged. It's clogged. An inventor will say, oh,

157
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,140
it's not going down because the pressure is not low enough.

158
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,880
On the other side, the pressure must be lower on the other side from where the water in order for

159
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,540
it in order for it to exit. Right. That's how inventors think. Normal people say, oh,

160
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:39,440
it's very good. There's stuff in there. Yeah. Yeah. That's not how you see. So it's the same

161
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:44,260
condition. You're describing the same conditions, but you're coming from a completely different

162
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:50,020
angle. One angle gives you one possibility. Unclog the drain. The other angle is limitless

163
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:55,720
possibilities. I can drill a hole in the ceiling and drop a vacuum, one of those industrial vacuums

164
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:02,080
and suck the water out that way. Right. Yeah. Sure. So. Yeah. OK. So the event. Welcome to

165
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:06,880
The Inventor's Lounge. All right. So what's going on is you have these funnels that are appearing.

166
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:13,240
They're usually generally appearing anywhere between 700, 900 feet in altitude. You notice

167
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:19,580
to about twenty five hundred feet. OK, that's roughly the ceiling because some are higher,

168
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:25,220
some are even lower, the smaller ones. So there's. OK, so what's going on is very simple. You have

169
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:29,040
cloud cover that forms. Not always. I've seen tornadoes form with minimal cloud cover.

170
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,580
Cause you something else. OK, so we're not going to talk about that.

171
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:38,160
So there's a low pressure that develops between the height. You know, these tornadoes,

172
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,520
when you look at images of them, they're they're easy. In other words, when you capture an image

173
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:47,320
or produce a photograph, the tornado is pretty much square in the photo. In other words,

174
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:53,460
they usually tend to be they're not high altitude phenomenon. So some are taller than others. Right.

175
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:58,440
So wherever the top of that tornado is, is where that low pressure begins. And as it goes down,

176
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:05,940
it gets lower. Now, hold on. Hold on. In natural settings, the way we use barometric pressure,

177
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,200
you notice that as we go up in altitude, what happens? The pressure goes lower, doesn't it?

178
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:16,960
Like if you open the what happens when you open, let's say you're in a jetliner using old terms

179
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,960
and you're 30,000 feet or 40,000 feet. Someone opens the door. What happens?

180
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:28,660
You get sucked out. Everything gets so low. Right. Right. OK. Now, when you go down into a hole in

181
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:33,440
the ground or Death Valley, the pressure is much higher as you go down to below sea level or sea

182
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,540
level. Pressure is the greatest. Right. It's one bar, 15 psi, roughly at sea level. If you go up

183
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:44,160
an altitude up to a mountain, it could be as low as 13 psi. Right. Well, thus, instead of things

184
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,840
being sucked out like they would be at the high altitude, they're now being pushed in. So if you

185
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:53,520
go to a place like Death Valley or the Dead Sea, the pressure is higher than 15, one bar, a little

186
00:15:53,520 --> 00:16:02,320
bit. Oh, wow. So so what's happening is a reverse of the pressure, but the pressure is dependent

187
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:13,220
on concentrations of ether. OK, so when ether concentrates, a vacuum develops. Right. And there's

188
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:17,080
a temperature drop. By the way, there's always a temperature drop when a tornado appears. So it has

189
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:21,800
nothing to do with thermal conditions. Those thermal conditions are post event. You know,

190
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:28,380
when it's already formed, when it's OK, it's kind of like I have a joke about Greek speak or banjo.

191
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:39,120
OK, he started off with banjos, banjos. Yeah. What do what does banjo music and heavy artillery

192
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:48,320
have in common? Once you hear it, it's too late. OK. Right. So once you see a tornado,

193
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:54,420
it's too late is what I'm trying to say. Right. So when you see these conditions form a low pressure

194
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:59,640
because the ether is concentrating. OK, here comes, OK, the weather work.

195
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,400
The most rudimentary weather device is a hollow metal tube. It should be magnetic,

196
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:09,319
like galvanized iron or steel, galvanized metal, sheet metal. Let's just call it that

197
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:15,480
sheet metal. Sheet metal is the stuff that you see that has that gal coating. OK, it's very common.

198
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,200
And when you when you ground that to the ground, just like you would ground something electrical

199
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:28,540
and mist water on one end that's closed and the business end is open towards the sky.

200
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:33,340
The biggest problem I have with making these things people have is all they can do is make

201
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:38,200
holes in clouds because what it does is it damps out the ether. It makes a hole in the ether,

202
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:43,520
dissolves the ether. So if you have rain coming and you swing this thing at 90 degrees, let's say

203
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:49,360
pointed at 30 or 45 degree angle up in the air, it's on a tripod or some kind of mounting mechanism.

204
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:55,360
And if you start swinging this thing, let's say from east to north to east to north and there's

205
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,600
a storm there, you're going to see a storm will wipe away, go away. So it creates drought. So

206
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:06,680
beginners that get into this early cloudbuster stuff that's grounded, a water gun, it's called

207
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,900
all they do is create droughts, right? Because they wipe away the ether.

208
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:17,580
All you got to do for these assholes out there in the Midwest is, well, let's just say they

209
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:24,580
have assholes, they're idiots, but more accurately. All you got to do is go to, you don't

210
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:29,760
even have to, I tell people, don't even go to Home Depot or supply place and buy one for 10 bucks or

211
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,100
20 bucks. Find in the garbage. You know, you see if someone do construction, you're always going

212
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:40,080
to see a piece of stovepipe laying out there, right? Lonely. Anyway, you can go and buy one

213
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,400
or whatever and make a very simple cap. There's like 3000 websites that show you how to make a

214
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:51,340
right cloudbuster rudimentary out of sheet metal for less than 50 bucks, right? And start waving

215
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:55,220
it around and you make whatever atmospheric manifestations are happening. Go away.

216
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:02,500
Go away. They just, you just dissipate them. So all you need to do, and it's got a 500 mile range.

217
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:06,100
If you, if you can make a larger one and you know how to ground and you know how to put the water

218
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:11,020
in there, not going to get into that. Now you could just swing the thing. I don't recommend

219
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:15,540
swinging it more than 90 degrees. Like don't go from North all the way to South or go three 60.

220
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:21,160
That'll create another effect. It'll work for a little while, but 90 to 45 degree, you know,

221
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:27,000
angle as the Cardinal lines go. Right. And you have a few people, 500 miles apart doing this,

222
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,900
and you'll clear all that weather away. And the weather was, well, we're supposed to have a

223
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:35,580
tornado, clear blue skies. What's going on. That's how easy and simple this is. Okay.

224
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,940
There is definitely no intelligent life forms out there. I tell you that for sure.

225
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:45,160
Right. Not a lot of things are for sure, but there are no intelligent people living in the

226
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,840
Midwest that we know for sure. Right now. We know that. Fair enough. That's been already proven.

227
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:57,400
So what you're telling me is what these devices really do is remove the concentration of the

228
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:03,500
ether. Okay. Imagine you have a fog machine, you see them, they have them in theater and

229
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:09,740
whatever. Sure. Okay. Special effects. Imagine an anti-fog machine where you go into a place.

230
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,280
You've seen a fog machine. It's like a box and it has an opening, right? And the fog comes out.

231
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,160
Well, a lot of people would think that you sort of vacuum up the fog, but no,

232
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:22,540
you vacuum up the opposite. Okay. Well, you have fog conditions and you have a machine that sucks

233
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:27,340
up the fog. Right. But in this case, the fog is invisible. You don't see it with your eyes,

234
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:32,840
the ether, the conditions that create the fog. Okay. Okay. So this is how simple. Anyway,

235
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,280
one thing we did prove is that there is no intelligent life in the Midwest right now.

236
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:43,020
So, you know, I don't know about human rights and all that other bullshit they're talking about.

237
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:49,820
No one lives there. So this is what's going on in the world. So you can't tell me I should be

238
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:55,880
taking anything seriously here at all or anyone seriously, because that's a joke. It's a joke.

239
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,780
And just to add one more thing, and don't tell me solitary confinement is a bad thing.

240
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:08,940
Oh, my gosh. There's no other option at this point. Okay. Enough with that rant. So

241
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:14,940
this is what's going on. I mean, how can you live around people that are so dumb that they cannot

242
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:21,320
apply what I just said? And by the way, there's plenty of information that's gotten out. There's

243
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,840
got to be an idiot that lives out there. Well, there isn't, obviously, because look, see?

244
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:33,640
Anyway, let's get off of it, because you know what? I think it's just content at this point,

245
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,620
right? In other words, these disasters are content for the media, isn't it?

246
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:42,340
Well, isn't it just become content for the media? It's one of the many things. Look,

247
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:47,320
what do people always want to see? They want to see what, you know, what bleeds leads, right?

248
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:53,300
What is tragic? What is painful? Other people's pain is entertainment to someone. You know,

249
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:59,360
either they feel bad. Oh, I feel so bad for that person. You know, they're either doing it that way

250
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,000
or quite honestly, there's other people that just sort of enjoy the suffering about it for a

251
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,960
specific person. You should feel bad for all of them right now. But OK, generally, yeah, I agree

252
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:13,300
with you there. I mean, yeah, it's just oh, my God. We're all here. We all deserve a little

253
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:19,960
sympathy. No. Yeah. It looks like they reorganized the landfill and it backwards. In other words,

254
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,380
if you look at the mess right now, I have it open a couple of places in Nebraska or whatever,

255
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:28,920
Iowa, and it's just piles of sticks. Right. You've seen that with the post tornado, right?

256
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:33,340
It's just sticks like dropping a box of old fashioned matches on the floor. Right. First

257
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:38,840
of all, you have to be mentally deficient to buy a house that's made made that way in that kind of

258
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,200
area. Well, you have to be mentally deficient to buy a house like that made anywhere because you're

259
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,600
being ripped off. Right. Yeah. Well, buying a house. Yeah. Well, first of all, there's a

260
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:53,000
problem with your premise. Can you actually buy the house? No, no. I mean, let's say you're going

261
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,760
to be a resident. Right. Because everything's already been you know, there's no ability to

262
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,280
purchase it. Well, there's no money. There's no money. And who actually owns anything anyway.

263
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:07,260
Right. So what are you doing? Well, what happens is when you use their money system, by the way,

264
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:12,480
to buy anything, they always retain an interest in what you're buying because you're using their

265
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:19,020
private money. Right. So it's kind of like the bastards in the legal system. All of them all the

266
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:24,280
way up. They you know how they're operating. They're operating no different than imagine a

267
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:31,160
post apocalyptic scenario where the survivors of society start piecing together a society and they

268
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:36,760
and they're looking for like, pre war technology because there were more advanced than right.

269
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,700
That's what the legal system that they don't understand what the law is at all there.

270
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:46,840
You know, they just tell you, OK, you know, they have no idea what you know what it is at all. I'm

271
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:53,320
talking about like judges and attorney generals. They don't know the average idiot with a legal

272
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:57,960
practice is really I mean, you could just be serving popcorn at the ballpark. It's he's not

273
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:03,720
any smarter than that. So or, you know, whatever work, you know, working at the gift shop at the

274
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,700
Supreme Court building, your average attorney there. No, scary, stupid. Right. Talk about stupid.

275
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,020
Yeah. The common tropes of look, you could probably train a monkey to do it and it would

276
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:16,800
about have the same. Oh, my gosh. Yeah. Yeah. They just really talk about dumb people. But

277
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:24,180
this whole system is more it's but it's not looking. See, I just gave a scenario post

278
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:29,260
apocalyptic society that sends some scouts out to find pre war technology. Right. Because it's

279
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:34,220
valuable compared to what they have now. They're not even doing that. You know, they don't they're

280
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:38,820
not even aware of stuff that was talked about in the 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s. So even right there,

281
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:45,840
not even aware. Anyway, application, it boils down to application, right?

282
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,400
I always find that interesting when I read a pre, you know, what they call pre depression,

283
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:54,400
like news articles and things where they talk about things that people are doing,

284
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:58,720
creating and stuff like that. You say to yourself, well, if they were doing that in 1920,

285
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:03,140
whatever, then that means that some progress should have been made from there. And then you

286
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:06,760
think about it and you go, well, actually, no, nobody ever picked up and took this thing.

287
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:11,560
You know what I'm saying? I mean, that's a constant in if you read old newspaper articles.

288
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:16,980
Yeah. The next thing I'm going to do, I'll put this out. Oh, I don't know. Don't hold me to it.

289
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:21,480
But I want to I haven't done in a long time. A demonstration, a weather demonstration, a big one.

290
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:26,560
So like, we'll pick a city, a state somewhere, an area locale.

291
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:32,740
OK, in the Midwest, a thousand miles, fifteen hundred miles from Tucson. Doesn't matter

292
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:40,700
anywhere in the US. OK, closer, the better. I pick a day, a place and tell me what you want

293
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:44,760
to do there. What do you want to do? You want to make rain? What do you want to do? OK,

294
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:49,240
so I want to make wind and we'll do it. When do you want it to? What kind of weather conditions

295
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:54,240
you want on what day? Tell me and I'll do it. So if I wanted to snow in Phoenix, theoretically,

296
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,380
would that be acceptable? It's a little late now. We have to wait for it, believe it or not,

297
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:02,500
for it to be change of season. Like I said, at the end of spring, when summer begins, you can do it.

298
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:07,440
OK, you can do it at change of season points. Yes. You know what I said? I made it snow in

299
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,960
the tropics. It was right at the beginning of summer, at the beginning of summer. OK,

300
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,920
yeah, the way it doesn't the weather doesn't matter as long as you catch it at a transition point.

301
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,900
That's why I'm saying it's so easy. It's so simple. It's stupid. It sounds ridiculous.

302
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,720
Right. It sounds it's not that I can't get away from temperature because they make it snow and

303
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,420
so really hard to get cold. Yeah. How are you going to do that? It's got to be 32 degrees

304
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:35,820
Fahrenheit. You have to understand the difference of potential taking place and taking advantage

305
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:42,640
of what you're doing. OK, weather work is no different than acupuncture. Right. OK,

306
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,300
what is acupuncture? Most acupuncturists can't even tell you what they're doing.

307
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:50,060
Well, I was going to say, I can't get an explanation. Yeah, I can't get an explanation

308
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:54,620
from somebody. Right. Basically, you're trying to get the energy around the body to zap down into

309
00:26:54,620 --> 00:27:00,080
or do too much energy in one part of the body to go out into the atmosphere of the body. Everyone's

310
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:05,400
got an atmosphere. It's anywhere. It's over the surface of your skin and it can go out as far as

311
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:10,020
a couple of feet, a few inches usually. By the way, you can smell when you smell someone. That's

312
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:16,500
your you're in their atmosphere. Right. Think about it. You can change the atmosphere by putting on

313
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:21,780
a cologne. I mean, I'm talking about a literal atmosphere. You know how this was discovered by

314
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:28,020
Galvani? Well, like a field around somebody. Well, hold on. Galvani talked about all metals

315
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:32,500
that conduct electricity because of their atmosphere. And we're talking about old man

316
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:39,720
Galvani. These are non-academic people that are the, you know, like Faraday. Right. Galvani.

317
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:45,680
Right. Hertz. All these people, they were not scientists. So basically there's something

318
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:52,800
called galvanic reaction. When you put a piece of metal in your mouth and there's a saying like

319
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:58,440
chewing aluminum foil. Right. OK. Right. That's serious galvanic reaction. OK. You can take a

320
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:03,260
penny and put it on your tongue. Right. But take the penny and put it as close as possibly tongue

321
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:07,360
without touching it. You'll start tasting the penny. How's that possible? Well, you're in the

322
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:12,320
penny's atmosphere. By the way, the atmosphere is very, very thin. That's where electricity travels.

323
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:17,100
It doesn't travel in the metal at all. Right. And this was already known. This is what these

324
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:21,400
quantum physics are talking about now. And they're like, don't you read Galvani from like 200,

325
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:25,060
300 years ago? It gives you a big warning. Make sure you keep your mouth closed. If you're too

326
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:29,260
close to somebody, you might taste them. Yeah, there's several. Yeah. But anyway,

327
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,860
that's the idea. So back to the weather, it's like acupuncture. You're putting out a needle,

328
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:40,260
a metal. Right. It doesn't have to be OK. There are more advanced systems, more passive systems

329
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:47,200
that you can employ that are much slower working and they do not zap all the ether up. But there's

330
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,860
nothing more than a water gun, a basic Wilhelm. Right. Not the Wilhelm multiple tubes. You just

331
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:57,700
need a standard stove by four or six inches. I have an eight inch pipe that's 12 feet long.

332
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:02,020
So much is a little overkill. But, you know, sometimes you want overkill. Right.

333
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,660
Right. OK. So much like with with the acupuncture, the weather is the same kind

334
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:13,320
of thing where it's about taking where there's concentrations of the energy and either dissipating

335
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:18,940
those concentrations of energy or attracting them and gathering them together and sort of collecting.

336
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:24,360
OK, let me just give this a mysterious thing. Most if anyone's in the inventor's lounge that

337
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:30,660
actually might qualify is going to say, well, how can you do it very much if you're just

338
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:37,360
dissipating? Well, this is what happens. Let's say you want to build up instead of dissipate.

339
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,360
Right. OK. How do you do that? If the thing all it does is dissipate, how are you going to build up?

340
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,880
Right. You said you can do that. So how does it build? Oh, no. OK, well, now this is where you

341
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:53,960
need three sharpened pencils in your pocket with a pocket protector and a slide rule. Right. Can

342
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:59,540
you figure it out? Yes. This is how engineers think. Who are the ones that used to be on this planet?

343
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:08,480
The ether itself is a living organism. It's not, I wouldn't say fully sentient, but it exhibits

344
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:14,880
sentience intelligence. The weather exhibits all living things and things that support living

345
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,280
things have somewhat of a self-preservation. All living things, whether they appear to have a

346
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:24,140
brain or a neurological system or whatever, they have some sort of intelligence, even if it's

347
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:29,520
rudimentary. That leads to that will exhibit some sort of self-preservation. OK, so what

348
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:35,280
will happen is the ether sees that this thing is being swung around and dissipates it. So it

349
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:41,820
doesn't want to get into its field, into the business end. It wants to stay behind it.

350
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:46,640
So this is how you do it. Whether you're on the southern hemisphere, if you believe such a thing,

351
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:51,880
or the northern hemisphere, if you believe such a thing, the ether goes from west to east. OK,

352
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:58,040
so if you aim downwind, if you aim with the ether, remember, the ether is going from west to east.

353
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:02,740
So you aim east. So here comes the ether. It's all the way out here in the west, and it's going

354
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:09,660
towards the east, and it sees you, and you're aiming east. And you're like, oh, we better stop

355
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:13,540
right here and slow down, because if we keep moving east, we'll go above him, and then we'll

356
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:20,280
be in his target range. We don't want to do that. So what happens is, as you're aiming east, the

357
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,740
ether sees you're aiming east, and it starts slowing down and building up, and says, oh,

358
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:29,340
we've got to go around him. We don't want to get in front of that business end, because we're

359
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:33,640
going to dissipate. So it starts building up and building up. Now there are certain techniques

360
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,920
where you can move the thing and have more than one device, where you create a real big

361
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:46,440
buildup behind you, and any time you have a buildup of anything, blue balls, it has to release somehow.

362
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:50,960
Well, whether you dam the water or you get blue balls, eventually a release must come,

363
00:31:50,960 --> 00:32:01,100
and when it does, it's going to be drastic. So what's going on here is this. When you hear about

364
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:07,080
weather events, that is the discharge part. That's the discharge. The tornado is not a weather

365
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:14,640
condition. It's a weather condition discharging. The conditions of the tornado are way before

366
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:20,380
tornado forms. You always want to be in the formative side of things. When it rains,

367
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:24,860
it's a discharge. Rain is a discharge. Tornado is a discharge. A hurricane is a discharge.

368
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:29,320
It's the end of the process. At the beginning of the process, you have a buildup, and then you're

369
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:33,360
kind of trapping it or damming it or keeping it contained for a moment, building it up.

370
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:37,940
So if it's raining and someone says, go ahead and stop the rain, well, you've got to wait for it to

371
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:44,620
stop for me to stop the rain, because it's already in discharge mode. It's in the middle of discharging.

372
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:50,580
Well, you can build up for the next time. Right. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So this is how these things

373
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:55,320
work. And one thing we do know for sure, there's no intelligent life in the Midwest.
