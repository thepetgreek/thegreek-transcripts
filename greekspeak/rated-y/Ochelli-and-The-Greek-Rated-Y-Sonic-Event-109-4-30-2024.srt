1
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,840
Rated Y, Sonic Event 109.

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,220
So here we are.

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,040
Greek, how are you?

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,980
Hey, I'm doing okay.

5
00:00:15,219 --> 00:00:22,340
I figured this might be one of the longer ones, the Sonics, because kind of interesting

6
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,240
stuff came up today and yesterday.

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,820
So I figured it's a, what do you call it, a muse over, or when you talk about things

8
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:31,880
and it brings them forward.

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,140
In other words, you know, I was out in public and, you know, I tell people I'm just visiting,

10
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,300
taking notes, right?

11
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:47,500
And before you know it, this is at a construction supply showroom type thing, and I had a small

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:47,880
crowd.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,740
And usually when the crowd like that develops, you know, I'm giving them Greek speak, right?

14
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,480
And someone in the jump on, say, you need to write a book.

15
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,400
Oh, yeah.

16
00:00:59,400 --> 00:00:59,720
Of course.

17
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:00,800
You know what I say about that?

18
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,000
Right?

19
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:01,840
No point.

20
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:03,959
Well, here's the thing.

21
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:04,940
There is a point to it.

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,960
That's what I want to bring up.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,980
And I got a few things.

24
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,160
I'm going to do them backwards because that usually comes later.

25
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,640
You know, when I'm proselytizing Greek speak, they, you know, after a few minutes, if they're

26
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,100
still there, which is they'll be there as long as I'm there doing it.

27
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,100
And then I realized, am I disturbing the business because I'm inside of a business, right?

28
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,100
You know, years ago, people didn't go to share information in school.

29
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,700
They were at the Agora, the marketplace, right?

30
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,080
And I tell people that this is a marketplace for thousands of years of information, right?

31
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,040
So the thing is, think about writing a book.

32
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:40,320
When you have important information to convey, yeah, stuff that could be technical or let's

33
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,800
just say, like a recipe or methodical or science or whatever, we have that information to convey.

34
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,700
It's very difficult to do it live or on a sonic.

35
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:55,640
If you have information that's important that can be used, let's say, as reference material,

36
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,360
let's just that encompasses a lot, right?

37
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:57,800
Okay.

38
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,380
It should be written down.

39
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,040
It really should be or should be sequestered and separate where someone can put it in their

40
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,400
pocket.

41
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,140
Now, we know we don't.

42
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:04,440
Right.

43
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,500
It would be on a thumb drive or on a file.

44
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,080
Right.

45
00:02:07,139 --> 00:02:12,620
And they can access it when they because when you do a speaking or a sonic live, especially

46
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,800
people are there for the emotional effect that you're going to give, right?

47
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,300
Because if you're if you're doing a sonic and you sound like this the whole time you're

48
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,380
speaking, no matter what the information is, you're going to lose them.

49
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,320
But if you're real emotional, like look at these preachers, right?

50
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,180
Right how they are.

51
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,840
I think the people there for the content or the emotion, right?

52
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:33,920
Right.

53
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,160
Now, part of right.

54
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,220
It's the second part.

55
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:36,660
Of course.

56
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:37,420
Yeah.

57
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,360
It's the showmanship.

58
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,940
The other part to that of doing a live is when people are done.

59
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,740
See, this is one of the one of the reasons why I did the I was insistent when we started

60
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,420
the Sonics do the chat angle right away.

61
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:49,660
Right.

62
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:50,180
Right.

63
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,480
We didn't even have one sonic.

64
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,100
Why?

65
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,400
Because even though these are recorded, these are most, you know, you'll get the emotion.

66
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,020
This is not AI speaking, right?

67
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:58,460
Right.

68
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,020
Not a bot.

69
00:02:59,100 --> 00:02:59,340
Right.

70
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,160
And either of you.

71
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,920
So, although I've taken notice, there are many, many more of those things now, even

72
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,560
YouTube videos that are apparently Yeah, the undead Internet, like one third of everything

73
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,900
on the Internet is not human.

74
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,360
Really?

75
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:10,600
Okay.

76
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:10,800
Yeah.

77
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,620
So I insisted on getting that you tango going.

78
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:13,880
Why?

79
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:19,160
Because when there's an emotional or a live presentation, like people leaving the theater,

80
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,260
they want to talk to each other about what they just heard and experienced.

81
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:22,580
Right.

82
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,820
Well, that's why I always like going out to eat after a movie, because you could sit down

83
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,780
and eat and talk.

84
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,660
And, you know.

85
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,100
Well, no, no.

86
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,800
I'm just talking about, well, if everyone well, I'm saying like when you're exiting

87
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,160
the venue, yeah, people will discuss what they just saw or heard.

88
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,100
Like, for example, like a really dramatic movie.

89
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,320
Some movies were so dramatic when everyone left, everyone was silent.

90
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:42,540
Right.

91
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,520
You hear that in the review.

92
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,360
Oh, yeah.

93
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,500
But other times people are coming out going, oh, my God, did you believe that that's the

94
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,020
way that went?

95
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:48,680
Yeah.

96
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,040
Right.

97
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,460
So that's why.

98
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:56,720
So also the comments section on the YouTube section is important for that.

99
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:57,340
Right.

100
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,140
Well, kind of.

101
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:58,660
I know.

102
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,180
I mean, this.

103
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,840
No, it's important for that reason.

104
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,140
Not.

105
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:01,900
Oh, my gosh.

106
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,400
You really want to lose, quote unquote, faith in humanity or hope in many.

107
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,340
Go read all the YouTube.

108
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,740
It doesn't matter what video the actually some of us.

109
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,420
All right.

110
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:12,280
I'm not going to say it, but a lot of the stuff that I've done online that people comment,

111
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:16,940
it was usually very positive or the people really sounded like their head was screwed

112
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,300
on.

113
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,140
Mostly.

114
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:18,519
Yeah.

115
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:22,740
You actually do get a different set of commentary, because, I mean, generally speaking, you could

116
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,520
put up a video of a cat and, you know, you'll get something racist, something political,

117
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,500
somebody arguing about Donald Trump and you're like, yeah, no, no, that's.

118
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:30,780
Yeah.

119
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,160
So.

120
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:31,760
OK.

121
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,000
So the important thing.

122
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,460
So should Greek speak be a book?

123
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:35,780
No.

124
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:41,540
No, because there's something about people getting information from a book that's not

125
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,200
for their job.

126
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,740
By the way, when you have a job or a career or whatever, you're always looking for time

127
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,100
off.

128
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:48,400
Right.

129
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,860
Where if you really like what you do, there's no time off because on your time off, you'd

130
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,620
be doing that anyway.

131
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,040
Right.

132
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:54,440
Yeah.

133
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,180
There's no difference.

134
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:55,460
Right.

135
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:02,680
So what when this this information goes out on these sonics and the way I just present

136
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:02,920
some.

137
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,180
I had this one guy.

138
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,320
I'm not going to mention names.

139
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:05,980
Bruce McDonald.

140
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,540
He's an editor or whatever.

141
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,300
This stuff for books.

142
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,800
He says, I sound like a robot.

143
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,100
You sound like Hal 9000.

144
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:12,960
You've got to be more emotional.

145
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,500
I'm like, you've got to be kidding me.

146
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,760
You've got to be kidding me.

147
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,760
But, you know, everyone's got their own critique.

148
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:19,620
That's fine.

149
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:26,100
But here there is there are certain certain poignant things that I discuss that are manual

150
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,840
type reference type material.

151
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,400
And I could get I when I used to do the sonics on Revolution Radio a long time ago.

152
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:32,840
Oh, my gosh.

153
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,540
Michael, all that that that station, by the way, I had to take a shower after calling

154
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,300
in, you know, every actually I was always asked to call in.

155
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:40,580
Right.

156
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:46,260
And I just felt that place had like an orc stench, like a spiritual stench to it.

157
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:46,560
You know.

158
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,040
But anyway, agreed.

159
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:53,720
Unlike American Freedom Radio, which was just like so mellow and cool, you know, it lacked

160
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:59,200
dimension, even though Danny tried to create more dimension, you know, he wanted more right

161
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,360
away.

162
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,300
It just lacked that.

163
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,460
It was kind of like paper thin, but it was cool because it was just us being ourselves

164
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:04,940
on there.

165
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,960
You know, but it was a cool space.

166
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,540
No, I was like, you can only be yourself.

167
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,320
Me separate from you even.

168
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,360
It was just me.

169
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,360
You can only be yourself.

170
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,460
I mean, you really enjoyed the time or not.

171
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,460
You know, I'm just going to interject something and people say, oh, I need to go find myself.

172
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,480
Well, who are you now?

173
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:20,380
No.

174
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:25,160
But what I mean by that is that I didn't feel pressured to try and do anything other than

175
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,140
what it is I was already doing.

176
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:27,900
You know what I mean?

177
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:28,740
Yeah.

178
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,440
It was a good space.

179
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:30,700
Yeah.

180
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,720
This is like in the 80s.

181
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,080
You know, the energy people.

182
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:33,900
So I was fortunate.

183
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,760
Since a young age, I was around some new age types.

184
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,280
Not holy.

185
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,420
I wasn't raised by hippies.

186
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:38,680
No.

187
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,120
Not at all.

188
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,520
Very Spartan Greek family.

189
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:40,820
Right.

190
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,200
They came over on an airplane in the early 60s.

191
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,440
And I was not raised by earthy, crunchy new age people.

192
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,320
But I was around.

193
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:50,700
They were.

194
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,640
I had their info.

195
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:56,000
I saw them in this in the 70s and 80s before it became popular.

196
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,300
Right.

197
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,960
And one thing they would say is that's a good space.

198
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,340
Right.

199
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,740
Like, even though they have a safe space, the stickers on doors for children, right.

200
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:05,740
Whatever.

201
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,720
So anyway, I just want to bring up a few of those little comments.

202
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,340
One of the things that I brought up, there was some scientific types.

203
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:19,460
And also, I'm I have a client who's a medical person, which I actually here's the thing

204
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,180
about cover yours.

205
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,740
I'm thinking of doing a band and not selling to anyone in the legal field or the medical

206
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,180
field or not offering any of my services or anything.

207
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,580
And I'm just kind of like boycotting.

208
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:29,580
Right.

209
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,140
But anyway.

210
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,520
OK, I'm covering yours now.

211
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,200
So I'm going to bring up two points.

212
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:34,620
OK.

213
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,960
One point is one of the scientific types talking about time machine.

214
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,180
I said, of course, time machines exist because it doesn't matter when you invent a time machine.

215
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,200
It's one of those things.

216
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,360
You know, it's like you ask a crowd of people, what do you want?

217
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,100
And they all say, we want a time machine.

218
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,140
And says, when do you want it?

219
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:52,820
Irrelevant.

220
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:53,960
Right.

221
00:07:53,960 --> 00:08:00,860
So if a time machine is invented a billion years in the future from now, a time machine

222
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,660
is invented a billion years in the future from now.

223
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,620
Can you come back and affect that?

224
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,380
It has the range.

225
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:05,720
Sure.

226
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,360
So it doesn't matter when it's invented.

227
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:12,620
That's literally my argument for why there is no no time machine having been invented,

228
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,440
because we would have already seen it.

229
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:14,960
You know.

230
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:15,300
Right.

231
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,660
Well, but but I'm saying the influence.

232
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:21,540
So this is the way this is like non-paradoxical language, because there really are no paradoxes.

233
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:26,240
Once you start thinking non-linearly, like thermodynamics, you know, all these people

234
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,720
say, well, science was the third demoniacs.

235
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,500
Yeah, that's fine for a linear system with chemical degeneration.

236
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:36,380
But thermodynamics has nothing to do with a rising, rarefied cold and a descending densified

237
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,059
heat.

238
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,320
Thermodynamics laws don't work there.

239
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,240
No one talks about it.

240
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:40,480
Right.

241
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:45,520
Plus, you're not accounting for the possibility that anything is completely without end,

242
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,580
like energy.

243
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,180
Well, that would be a closed system.

244
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:49,440
Yeah.

245
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,060
But here's the other thing that came up.

246
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,060
Time and space.

247
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:52,980
Yeah.

248
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,220
OK.

249
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:53,840
OK.

250
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,360
Now I say there's no time and no space.

251
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,480
Those are just simply measurements.

252
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,160
But both are relied on motion.

253
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,500
This is what I was explaining was half the people got it.

254
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,540
The other half didn't.

255
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,220
And I pointed.

256
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,340
I said, I'm going to go now.

257
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,440
And half the people that got it, I said, explain it to those guys there that didn't get it.

258
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,120
I'm leaving now.

259
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:09,380
Right.

260
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,480
So because if I stay anymore here, you know, I'm going to like leave the meter running

261
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,940
like the cab, you know, and there's no meter.

262
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,280
Right.

263
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,980
I need to walk around with a meter on my shirt.

264
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,240
You know, I mean, leave the meter running.

265
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:20,480
Right.

266
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:24,620
Remember that a lot of people didn't grow up in an urban environment, wouldn't know what

267
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,020
that means.

268
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,760
No, I get it.

269
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:30,100
But in other words, you need a punch card system where, you know, here's something just

270
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,680
a punch system maybe.

271
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,140
But anyway.

272
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,420
So what's interesting is punch clock.

273
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,900
Time is a matter.

274
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:41,780
If there is no motion, everything, the environment and any object is completely still.

275
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,160
There's no time because time is the recordation of events.

276
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,740
And space is actually.

277
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:55,600
A derivative, a byproduct of communication to explain things that are moving, like moving

278
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,380
through space.

279
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:56,660
Right.

280
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,880
If there's absolutely no motion, there is no space.

281
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,440
Right.

282
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,380
So time and space are both based on motion.

283
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:10,120
And it is somewhat of an impossibility to not have any motion somewhat.

284
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:16,100
But that's the part where once we understand what it means to die and be asleep, we don't

285
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,140
fully comprehend that yet.

286
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,740
But the thing I brought up.

287
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:26,400
Because of these because we're locked into change, like with the Dallas thing is one

288
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,940
thing for sure is change.

289
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,100
All things change.

290
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:29,340
Right.

291
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,140
Which makes sense.

292
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,320
And because of motion and everything has its own independent, slightly independent motion.

293
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,400
That's why no two things can be identical.

294
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:43,700
You can make, let's say, cut two diamonds that are exactly identical from the same one.

295
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,660
And you can if you have the equipment with the tolerance, the closer you look, you'll

296
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,600
see that they're still they're not identical.

297
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,340
There's something different about them, whether it's the workmanship or the way, quote unquote,

298
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,960
the molecules are lined up.

299
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:56,200
Right.

300
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,780
So two things will never be identical.

301
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,340
There's someone an old guru says that nature doesn't do carbon copies.

302
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:03,720
Right.

303
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:04,660
So.

304
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:10,080
The ability to understand that no two things like, you know, I don't know if you remember

305
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:15,500
saying I was at no to bread, loaves of bread or bake the like that's a saying that I it's

306
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,420
an old saying anyway.

307
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,080
Well, no.

308
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,920
So no two objects can be absolutely completely alike.

309
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,340
No two movements can be exactly completely alike because that involves objects and things

310
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:29,680
moving and therefore there is no such thing as exact copies.

311
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,260
There's always going to be some deviation.

312
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:32,800
Right.

313
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,980
Now, the static, the ether, for example, is it moving or is it static now?

314
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:43,360
It doesn't matter because it will create motion in both cases.

315
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,920
One is if it has a pressure that would create change and motion, meaning the ether static

316
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,000
to static objects pushing against each other.

317
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,280
Right.

318
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,940
We'll still create motion where they touch.

319
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:54,960
Right.

320
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:01,420
That's why when you get a package opened up from a product, you notice how it's in a box

321
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,420
with styrofoam ends and it's wrapped in plastic.

322
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,100
The plastic is there.

323
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,720
So when it's vibrating as it's moving on the truck, it doesn't scratch the surface.

324
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,000
Right.

325
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:09,440
OK.

326
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,700
That kind of thing.

327
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,560
Packaging is there for that movement.

328
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,460
But from a human perspective, they're trying.

329
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,060
We're always going to try to find something that's static as a reference.

330
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,120
And we're never going to find that.

331
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:25,660
You know, it's kind of like the one thing I like about the flat earthers, you know, do

332
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,680
you feel like you're moving at six thousand miles an hour?

333
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:28,580
Right.

334
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,700
Well, what should that feel like?

335
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:31,880
Right.

336
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:33,600
Yeah.

337
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:39,960
If you're on a well-behaved quote unquote drivers on the highway on a Sunday morning,

338
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:45,260
you can have a three lane highway with full of, you know, let's say full of cars just

339
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:45,960
cruising along.

340
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,860
And you could look inside each car, right.

341
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,840
The dash and the contents and people inside the car, especially if you have a higher car,

342
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,800
you could look inside.

343
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,900
And for a moment, you're examining the car next to you.

344
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,760
You're moving down the highway.

345
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,060
You don't feel that you forget that you're moving.

346
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,320
Right.

347
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:07,300
You see, just like to remember the express train and a local train crossing the bridge

348
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,080
in New York City.

349
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,660
They're on parallel tracks.

350
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,160
And as we're crossing the bridge, trains moving 40 miles per hour.

351
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:17,920
But you just look inside, you can almost read the paper of the train, the next train over

352
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,500
if you're moving at the same speed.

353
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,780
If you're moving at the same speed, it appears as though there is no movement.

354
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,480
But for a moment, you know, you're moving.

355
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:28,280
But for a moment, you act like there is no movement because you're trying to read the

356
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,940
newspaper from the next train over.

357
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,960
Or you're trying to see what what's in the T-shirt of the person in the car next to

358
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,520
you on the highway.

359
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,040
Well, both.

360
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:36,460
Right.

361
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:36,920
Sure.

362
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,260
Sure.

363
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:37,760
Yeah.

364
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,900
So or read a bumper sticker.

365
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:40,520
Right.

366
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,300
Or something.

367
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:46,340
So for a moment, we're able to forget and push aside that there's motion and consider

368
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,260
things to be static.

369
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:51,100
So anyway, there was a physicist in there works on a telescope.

370
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:58,280
But anyway, I gave about 45 minutes of Greek speak in public and it got me going to a

371
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:58,760
certain point.

372
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:04,300
But then I had to stop because earlier before I spoke about that, going back to someone

373
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,740
that I'm providing a device for that's in the medical profession, I know I know them

374
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,680
for two decades now.

375
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:17,760
What I said to them and not completely, I'll say completely what I wanted to say here.

376
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:21,760
But this is the I'm going to what I brought up to them was very, very soft.

377
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:26,840
I'm not going to say what I brought up to them because it'll it won't it won't be what

378
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,260
a sonic should we should say in a sonic.

379
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,760
I'm going to say what I the background than the meat and the bones.

380
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,820
You know, I basically provided a skin.

381
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,560
I'm going to give the meat, flesh and bone right now.

382
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,060
OK.

383
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:38,800
OK.

384
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,540
There's a certain level of arrogance amongst these people.

385
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,560
Very, very arrogant.

386
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:50,080
But because they're amidst a society that is so apathetic and ignorant, they get away

387
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,560
with it.

388
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,640
But it doesn't mean they're not arrogant and it doesn't mean the society is in ignorance.

389
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,940
But together, it makes a lethal mix.

390
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:03,960
And this is what I mean, 2020 and 2019, actually before the Department of Health and Human

391
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:10,300
Services was sending to hospital administrators letters that if anybody tests for covid-19,

392
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,920
they get fifteen thousand dollars.

393
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,500
If they're put on a ventilator, respirator thing, they get 50.

394
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,840
If they die from it, they get one hundred thousand.

395
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,000
So they're basically incentivizing all of that.

396
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,340
Right. Yeah.

397
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:31,240
For example, do you know there was a guy, a couple of instances, motorcycle accident,

398
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,000
unconscious. He wakes up and he's on a ventilator in the hospital.

399
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,160
He pulls the tube out, runs the fuck out of there.

400
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,600
No reason. Right. Right.

401
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:44,880
OK, so scores of thousands of people were killed this way.

402
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,000
In other words, this is the typical procedure.

403
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:51,860
They were incentivized to be put on ventilators and then starved to death and asphyxiated.

404
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:58,220
That's why the early diagnosis of people dying in the hospital was thrombosis, blood

405
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,660
clotting or asphyxiation.

406
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,780
Right. Everyone said there's nothing there's nothing wrong with them.

407
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,820
They just have the same.

408
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,880
They look like they have an autopsy.

409
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:12,080
Someone with extreme altitude sickness and thrombosis, blood clots, thickening of the

410
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,400
blood work that can't flow anymore.

411
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,620
So there's several many, many reports where they you know, there are people were

412
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:23,420
starved to death right while they were on the ventilator and asphyxiated.

413
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,320
Scores of thousands of people across the world and in the U.S.

414
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,060
scores of thousands mean it could be 50,000, 100,000.

415
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,340
They said they use the Zionist number.

416
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,960
Six million people die from covid.

417
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,080
Right. You realize that. Right.

418
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,880
OK, so anyway.

419
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:43,160
Hundreds of thousands of people, I would say, no, no.

420
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,640
Remember when they said Tesla is going to get involved into producing ventilators

421
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:52,320
because we need them when this word got out, by the way, that the hospitals were

422
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,540
killing people by putting them on ventilators and asphyxiating them, whatever.

423
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:00,740
A lot of the truckers that were doing these emergency shipments all over the

424
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,180
country found this out also.

425
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:06,220
And they would just pull over on the side of the road and dump the ventilators out

426
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,500
in the wild on the side of the highway.

427
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,579
Are you familiar with this?

428
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:09,920
I'd never heard that.

429
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:10,819
No. Wow.

430
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,020
OK, you can look that up.

431
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,780
There might be still news articles about it.

432
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,960
Quite a bit of like the smaller journalists, like, hey, look, it's talking

433
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,880
about they need ventilators, all these ventilators, you know, industrial grade,

434
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:25,359
hospital grade ventilators and boxes dumped on the side of the highway or dumped

435
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,240
near a swamp, like near a bay.

436
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,680
Right. Right, because they knew what was going on.

437
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,960
Basically, there was like sending execution.

438
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:37,760
If you go with the old let's bring up the National Socialist Party, we're going to

439
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,640
call them the Nazis.

440
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,240
Right. Those people.

441
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,900
Yeah, those people.

442
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,280
OK, well, they did what they did started really in forty four.

443
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,220
What started really in forty two, forty three.

444
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,180
They had the final solution and all that other crap.

445
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,920
Right. OK. Forty six.

446
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,240
They had the Nuremberg. So they got away less than within four years.

447
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,760
Of what they did, let's say, with death camps, by the way, half of the

448
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:05,600
half of the death camps were made by the Russians, by the way, not the right.

449
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,200
And they're attributed to be made by the Nazis and they're not.

450
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,180
This is if you can get the accurate information.

451
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:16,980
Right. And it was a political thing, not a direct religious one, because there were

452
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:22,100
over a hundred thousand, quote unquote, practicing Jews in the German war mocked

453
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,320
in the army and they were not put in camp.

454
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,480
Right. You could look this up.

455
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:30,000
This is academia, University of Kansas or whatever recently did a paper 10 years

456
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,640
ago. If they were so anti-Jewish, how come there were over a hundred thousand

457
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,120
troops fighting in the in the Vomit, you know, the Nazi army.

458
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,340
Right. Why weren't they put in camps?

459
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,520
I see. So there's a lot of technical stuff.

460
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,780
What happened there?

461
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,200
Well, I'm trying to say it was around four years time.

462
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,500
That they, let's say, committed whatever atrocities they did, quote unquote,

463
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,700
genocide and the Nuremberg trials, roughly four years.

464
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,780
Right. Forty two. Forty six.

465
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,460
Nuremberg. Forty seven. Right about there.

466
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,960
Yes. You see where I'm at.

467
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,980
Right. That four year mark right now.

468
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,020
So what I'm trying to say.

469
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,000
These doctors, they do they think they're going to get off scot free?

470
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,760
Apparently, probably.

471
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:15,420
And the people working there are so arrogant that then what did the Nazis do when

472
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,100
they figured out the people figured out what was going on?

473
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:18,880
They ran and hid.

474
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,720
How many of these medical people are still working in the hospital administration

475
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,260
office and doctors, whatever, that were culpable?

476
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,020
They actually laughed about it.

477
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:31,820
There's one nurse I talked to and she said, I'm quitting.

478
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,620
And I said, why? She goes, you know, I went to the head nurse.

479
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,220
Why are we putting people on ventilators?

480
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:38,440
Right. And the head nurse says, well, you know, you know, that's all she kept

481
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,160
saying. Well, you know, you know, you know, that's a blow up.

482
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,740
That's like, you know, well, it is what it is.

483
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:48,380
Yeah, exactly. So, OK, at this point, the people that are culpable, which is most

484
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:52,040
of the medical community, by the way, that's involved with administrative

485
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,460
hospital, this type of stuff.

486
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,820
And they're still in their jobs, cushy, cushy.

487
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,220
There's a lot of doctors that did quit.

488
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,280
But that doesn't make any kind of media, by the way.

489
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:06,600
Not a lot enough to notice it as a trend that would be reported on where

490
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,060
people go to get sort, you know, normal sources of reporting.

491
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:15,620
But they would learn and it would still be hard to find who's quit.

492
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,760
But there's quite a few.

493
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,640
There was I know I've gotten one to quit before it all started.

494
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,400
Yeah, there was like a couple of weeks there where they were reporting that

495
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,360
people were threatening to quit and were going to quit at hospitals and then

496
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,140
poop that went away. They were fired, too.

497
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,400
Yeah, they were fired, too.

498
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,700
Yeah. But that's fine.

499
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,120
That's good. But OK, so here's the thing.

500
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,200
Is there going to be any retribution for all this or is everything hunky dory?

501
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,280
Or can you say.

502
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,700
They're so distracted with everything else.

503
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:44,400
Right. So the there's a level of hypocrisy

504
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,260
here that most people that are sort of aware know the facts that I just gave.

505
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,940
Notice I called the facts.

506
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:55,060
I can't call it the truth because I I wasn't there directly to witness it.

507
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,320
Right. But I don't need to be.

508
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,680
You know, I don't need to get hit by a car to know that it's bad.

509
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,020
Right. So true enough.

510
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,680
Yeah. So that's a fact.

511
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:08,800
You don't want to get hit by a car if you want to be have a pleasant life.

512
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,940
So at least at any speed.

513
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,680
So, of course, the level of ignorance.

514
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,740
This is just going to continue.

515
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,320
So in other words, another thing that comes up often

516
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,720
when I bring up medical, so to say, oh, are you a doctor?

517
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:23,020
Then, you know, then you can't talk about that subject basically. Right.

518
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,740
And I'm like, do I need to be a criminal to be to accuse someone of a crime

519
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,800
or do I need to be an attorney to accuse someone of a crime?

520
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,540
You just got to know what's going on.

521
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,680
Yeah. But that's not the programming.

522
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,260
That's not the brainwashing they have.

523
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,180
When you start bringing up medical stuff.

524
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,660
To whatever, you know, the collective, are you a doctor?

525
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,700
Then that means that anything you say, you know, is cast to be disregard.

526
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,420
Or if you bring up legal stuff, are you an attorney?

527
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,440
Right. Yeah, exactly.

528
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,800
That's exactly the response.

529
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,620
Yeah. So they so in other words, that's part of programming brainwashing.

530
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,540
I think I bring I keep bringing this up. It's very important,

531
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,880
especially younger people, but especially older people.

532
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:00,600
Wait a second.

533
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,180
What I say, especially younger people and especially older people.

534
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,320
How about those in the middle?

535
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,180
Let's include them, especially middle people in the middle.

536
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,860
So I got everybody sounds like everybody.

537
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,060
Yeah. Sounds like everybody.

538
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:15,840
OK, so I'd say that more than half of their response is on anything,

539
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,060
whether it's private stuff they're doing in the bedroom,

540
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:23,980
the dinner table at work, on the way to work, brushing their teeth

541
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:28,280
or whatever, combing their hair, whatever, feeding their dogs and pets or whatever.

542
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,340
Their behavior and the way they think is because I mean, this is formulated

543
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,800
and and emulating and mimicking things that they saw in the media film.

544
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:43,820
Television, right, even read in a book, but fiction.

545
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,020
Isn't that interesting?

546
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,940
How many times have you if you actually you might want to recapitulate

547
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,800
and think about it when you speak to people that are, quote, unquote,

548
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,580
more of the collective and filter out

549
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:01,440
in this way, filter out, like set aside what responses

550
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,680
and behaviors they use, observe them that they have

551
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,280
that comes directly from television, let's say.

552
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,900
And you're going to see a tremendous amount of what they say, think and do

553
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,500
comes from the way they've seen it done and said and thought of on television.

554
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,220
So that's why I've always I've been bringing up, especially on Rated Y.

555
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:21,580
This is the as seen on TV people, right?

556
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,080
There's a there's a big thing about, you know, for a while,

557
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,240
not even I use it about the NPCs, right?

558
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,660
Yeah. But people are not pointing out.

559
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,840
These are more like most part of the NPC lore.

560
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,100
And and it's not more than lore.

561
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:39,400
It's a fact most common people is there as seen on TV people.

562
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,560
They really are.

563
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,480
And I think I even brought this up in a recent Sonic.

564
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:47,960
When you see a scene in the kitchen where someone, let's say, in a diner

565
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,360
or a coffee shop is breaking eggs over a griddle, how they drop them from

566
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,440
a foot high or six inches on. Right. Right.

567
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,520
You ever see how eggs are broken in the movies?

568
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,080
Right. Whatever. That's how people do it at home.

569
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,000
You shouldn't do that.

570
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,720
You should lower crack the egg and lower it to the pan.

571
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,040
And where the shell touches the pan and then open it slowly.

572
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,840
Right. That's what makes the most sense.

573
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,000
But yeah, like you said, they saw it done on TV.

574
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,400
They saw it done. OK.

575
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,680
How about lighting cigars?

576
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,700
These assholes are nice to go to these bars.

577
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:22,000
They were like the not like a seedy bar, but it was like the the what would you

578
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,440
call it was a steakhouse bar.

579
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:28,080
You know, it was kind of like the Golden Ghetto part of even when I was in New York.

580
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:32,200
I remember, you know, the the more high end lounges.

581
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,280
Right. You know where you could, you know, order a four hundred dollar bottle

582
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,700
of wine, kind of whatever, or get, you know, a fifty dollar shot of tequila or

583
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,700
something. Right. OK.

584
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,440
So there were there were the better places and the not so better places.

585
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:48,940
I mean, I see an asshole sitting there and he lights a cigar with the flame

586
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,120
right on the tobacco.

587
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,640
Right. Now, most people, sorry, if you don't know, you should always light

588
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,380
a fine tobacco, especially wrapped like that by induction.

589
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,920
In other words, you hold the cigar away from the flame

590
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:05,760
and you let the heat of the flame, like the the tobacco, never put the flame

591
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,980
on the tobacco because of the oils, fine tobaccos that are rich in oil.

592
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,280
When you put the flame to it, you ignite the oil and it makes the oil that didn't

593
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,360
ignite rancid. Right.

594
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:21,660
So you always want to light a cigar by induction where you rotate the cigar and

595
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:25,480
you have the lighter at least four inches away and you rotate it slowly, take

596
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,540
puffs until you feel a number.

597
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:31,820
Right. Never put the flame on the tobacco, even with cigarettes, if you smoke

598
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:36,540
cigarettes or enjoy cigarettes, try to light them without touching the flame to

599
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,440
the tobacco. Right.

600
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,520
The only thing that was if you're doing a bong hit, it's kind of hard because the

601
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,460
fire goes the other way.

602
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:49,380
Yeah. So I wanted to invent a bowl that that's upside down so you can light it by

603
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:53,840
induction. And it tastes completely different once you experience it.

604
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,000
Well, they have bowls like that where you actually heat the bowl instead of.

605
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,100
Yeah. Yes. It's an element.

606
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,740
Yeah. Screen screen that gets hot.

607
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,740
Right. Right. Right.

608
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,020
But you're you know, it's electric.

609
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,460
You heat the screen instead of heating instead of lighting the stuff on fire.

610
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,440
You. Right. So it'd be no flame contact.

611
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,020
So why am I talking about this?

612
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:18,440
Because this is a very stark example with where the wrong thing to do, say or

613
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:23,540
whatever, is mimic because it's been influenced by the media again.

614
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:29,700
So by the looks of it, the arrogance of the medical community where they're not

615
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:33,100
quitting or droves or, you know, the word isn't getting around that they're working

616
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,360
with murderers, basically.

617
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:38,600
This is premeditated murder, by the way, because they were sent they were

618
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,980
incentivized by the Federal Reserve, basically.

619
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,020
By the way, you know, the Federal Reserve announced the covid thing.

620
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,620
Right. And then the second announcement was by big tech.

621
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,300
And we were in Silicon Valley.

622
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,960
They told people don't come home, work from home.

623
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,320
But the the the head of the Federal Reserve and then the Treasury guy came out.

624
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,240
I forgot the day they announced the lockdowns and he said they were the ones that

625
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,860
announced it. Go go look it up.

626
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,000
Right. It was very short.

627
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,280
You probably find it on C-SPAN.

628
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,380
It was only like two. You know how they make two minute speeches because, you know.

629
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,480
Anyway. Right.

630
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:20,440
The other thing I want to bring up is the fraud of the medical establishment is this

631
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,380
is the basis of it. Then I want to get to an email.

632
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:28,100
This is the established fraud of the OK, the medical society, the medical side is

633
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,020
very powerful, pharmaceutical, all that.

634
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:35,560
So is the legal societies, the Bar Association or the the Crown, you know,

635
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,760
whatever. Then you have the industrial.

636
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,380
Everyone talks about the military industrial complex, which is just really a

637
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:46,100
distraction. The medical industry and the legal industry is way bigger than the

638
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,060
military. Right.

639
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,940
And insurance is bigger than all of them, but they're all put to wrap together.

640
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:55,500
Right. What's going on is the people that run.

641
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:58,340
There's a very small group. You want to call them a cabal or whatever, but it's

642
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,640
actually a beyond cabal.

643
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,380
And by the way, if you've ever heard of them or their name or seen them or in

644
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,100
history books or in media, that's that's not what I'm talking about.

645
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,680
These people are completely secret.

646
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,940
They view society as a bunch of idiotic assholes or moronic assholes.

647
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:20,820
And they don't think you deserve any hospitals, medical treatment, drugs, anything

648
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:26,400
at all. If they called that and they said, OK, let's just deny them of all that

649
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,740
stuff. The people would then go and try to do it on their own.

650
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,440
Right. Right.

651
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:36,120
So they figured instead of that scenario happening, because trust me, they would

652
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:43,080
not want they don't want any any cures, any proper care, proper diagnosis, proper

653
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,220
training of doctors at all, at all.

654
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:48,560
That doesn't exist anymore for a long time, almost a century.

655
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,040
Or more, it does not exist.

656
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,780
So they figured it's very smart, but it's very basic, smart, like, you know, eighth

657
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:01,780
grade. If we do that, the people then will do a grassroots thing and then it'll

658
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:06,120
take off. And because, you know, right, it's not incentivized by money or whatever.

659
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,740
Let's say credit. So what they decided to do was invest in it propaganda that it's

660
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,660
there to help you.

661
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,340
But in the meantime, they're making up all these false diagnoses.

662
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:19,280
Right. In diseases that don't exist.

663
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,860
Right. Yes.

664
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,720
People are sick, but not because of what they're telling you.

665
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,020
Right. And develop all these methods.

666
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:30,160
It's all tied in basically with the central banking.

667
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:37,220
Right. If you don't believe that when you go to a hospital, they give you this legal

668
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:41,280
form. It's it's got a white copy, a yellow copy and a pink copy, maybe even a green

669
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,260
copy. And when you write on it, it goes through all pages.

670
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:48,160
Right. Whenever you see anything like that, that's that's central bank paperwork.

671
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:53,040
If you read all of that, you should see how vague the pricing is.

672
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:57,440
It says you're at the hospital and the cost will be what's commonly accepted.

673
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,940
You know what should be the charge or whatever.

674
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:04,000
It's like never anything very vague language because it's all monetized.

675
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,940
If you go to the hospital with anyone asking insurance, definitely not.

676
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,800
Don't say no. Say definitely not.

677
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,340
And they look like, oh, what do you mean?

678
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,000
Definitely not.

679
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,540
And he said, if I'm going to fill out this registration form, I need a cash receipt for

680
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:20,180
it. And they're like, well, what cash?

681
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,240
I'm like, I just need something that says cash receipt on it and signed by an

682
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,600
administrator. For how much?

683
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,020
No. Yeah, exactly.

684
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,400
For how much? How much are you monetizing this for?

685
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,340
Right. Well, I don't know.

686
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,820
Nobody knows. But I just need evidence that I provided something with cash value.

687
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,420
Well, you know, that's paper. Yeah.

688
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,960
You know, there's proof of what you're saying here is that you take two people that

689
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,760
go to the same hospital, get for the same reason, get the same treatment.

690
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,080
And guess what? The bills never, ever or even remotely similar.

691
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,040
No. Well, not only that, the bills come from third parties.

692
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,540
Yeah. But they monetize.

693
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,320
But we're going to get to the email question.

694
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,420
We that this is going to tie into it.

695
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,540
Well, I'm just saying monetize it.

696
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:06,440
Right. So when they monetize it, though, they monetize it in such a way that it's not

697
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,780
like a doctor costs this, a pill costs that a bad cost.

698
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:13,040
None of that. There's no consistent pricing.

699
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,780
But most people are confused about the monitor.

700
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,280
OK, I got an email from a wonderful young chap.

701
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,100
He's young because he's around 30.

702
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,840
OK, I enjoy speaking with him.

703
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,240
I have spoken with him and I enjoy corresponding with him.

704
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,480
But I also want to bring up there's a level of naivete here.

705
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,640
It's a healthy level, though.

706
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,980
You know, when you say someone is naive, that doesn't sound right.

707
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,400
Right. Yeah.

708
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:41,280
Yeah. It almost sounds like you're degraded, denigrating the person, you know.

709
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,080
No, there's there's also a healthy level of innocence and naivety, right?

710
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,340
Nations, let's just say.

711
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:51,800
Right. So there's a healthy level of it that exists amongst people, especially when

712
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:56,340
they're searching. That's not even to be more forgiving, but it's more giving.

713
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:02,320
Right. Because the person is actually in terms of spiritually, they have a pretty

714
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,660
clean bill of health, let's say.

715
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,720
Right. And they'll bring up a question that some might say, some that are more

716
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,840
seasoned on the subject may say that's a stupid question, but it's not because it

717
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:17,240
shows that, again, people that are raised by the television or the media.

718
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:24,420
Right. How do you how do you show them another way and try to anchor to them that

719
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,060
the way that they know is pure fiction?

720
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,860
It's very difficult.

721
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,120
That's where that's where I have what's called the replacement theory.

722
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:36,660
Right. You offer them a substitute or an alternative and it's there they have to

723
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,460
pick. Right.

724
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,280
Right. You don't say that's wrong.

725
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,620
Stop it. Do this.

726
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,440
Right. You don't do that.

727
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,380
You just offer.

728
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:45,940
I'd make an offering.

729
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,700
And if they don't take it, then they're free to go with however they want to go.

730
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:54,280
So let's bring up there's in this question and we're going to we're going to do a

731
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,280
sonic on this is about twenty five questions and they're all very pertinent.

732
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,880
But you said about monetizing and all that.

733
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,920
Now, by the way, I did mention this about the form being monetized for a cash

734
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:10,280
receipt and the person got a harsh response from the administrators because they

735
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,400
just didn't say it right.

736
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,840
Yes, there is a wrong way to say it.

737
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,080
But you have to, for example, you know, there's this Patriots, they go into court

738
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,780
and they talk about the straw man and all that.

739
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:26,760
And the judge just destroys them because they if you go into a setting like that,

740
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:30,740
they know when you just found this out online or someone told you to say and you

741
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,280
really don't know. Right.

742
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:37,160
Just like people like when I see people say and do things that are on TV, I just

743
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,480
shake my head. I'm like, oh, you got that.

744
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,500
I don't always say you got that from television.

745
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,400
So you really don't know.

746
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,060
Right. You shouldn't.

747
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:48,900
But when you go into a legal setting or administrative setting and they see that you

748
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:53,700
just pick this up because you don't really know it, the ins and outs, you just felt

749
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:57,580
that it was a way to lash out and say that they'll they'll tear you apart.

750
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:00,500
Yeah, because you just picked up a couple of phrases, a couple of keywords.

751
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:03,060
And yeah, you're messing with their bread and butter because they're there.

752
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,940
You know, that's what they're there for to deceive.

753
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,719
And you're going to say, oh, yeah, you know that it's all deception, but you really

754
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,780
don't know how you're just trying to throw some one liner at us.

755
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,020
So fuck you. Right.

756
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,860
Is what they basically jump on you.

757
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:19,880
So each that's why there's nothing you can say in any situation.

758
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,360
Yeah, I could give advice on what to say here or what to say there or to who to

759
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:28,460
whatever. But you can't just take it and say what I'm saying, because I wouldn't

760
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:32,040
say that. You see, I don't know what to say when depends on the situation.

761
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:37,920
Right. Well, it's like people who turn around and they give you a solution that

762
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,620
they heard from somewhere, like, here's the answer to that question.

763
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:42,239
You go, oh, really? Well, how'd you come to that?

764
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,360
They have no idea how they got there.

765
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,679
Yeah, well, here's the thing. That's not even that.

766
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:50,480
But even if they do that, if it's still a one liner, it'll be picked up and you

767
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,179
really have to know the material and feel it because each situation will

768
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:56,139
be completely different.

769
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,580
But I was going to say that happens to me every time with the JFK thing where somebody

770
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,180
goes, well, I know this and I go, really?

771
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,360
OK, how do you know that? And they have no idea.

772
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:07,660
They might be the same question or the same fact, but it's a different person and you

773
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,640
have to bring it forward in a different way.

774
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,420
I can almost tell where they got the stupid thing.

775
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,480
Of course. That's what I'm talking about.

776
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,120
Oh, I hear exactly that phrase.

777
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,920
And you know what? I know very well that comes from this person's presentation that

778
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:24,320
you saw online because I know all this stuff already.

779
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:27,740
It happens all the time. It's like I know exactly where you got that nonsense.

780
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:31,700
And this is, you know, yeah, OK, you got some of it right.

781
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:34,180
But yeah, I hear you either.

782
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:37,300
Yeah, you actually know you're not invested, right?

783
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,480
Not at all. Someone who's investing in ripping in doing ripping really society

784
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,100
because that's their whole life is depending on and they like it.

785
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:51,380
And when they hear someone trying to, let's say, object to it or they see it as a

786
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,760
baby protesting. Right.

787
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:58,900
By the way, if any reject the saying like taking candy from a baby, reject that.

788
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:02,040
That's very difficult. Have you ever tried to take candy from a baby?

789
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,080
Man, they hold on to that thing.

790
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,120
You could lift the whole baby carriage and everything with the candy taking.

791
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,800
I'm serious. They got like one hell of a grip.

792
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,580
No, it's it's right. A really resistant small child is not.

793
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,680
You cannot take it from.

794
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,160
It's not that easy.

795
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,340
You're right. No, no.

796
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,760
So these things again, those are I've seen on TV again, disproved.

797
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,180
All right. So here let's just get into this.

798
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,220
I'm going to start from the bottom.

799
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,300
This is all tied in signature.

800
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,780
This is a question. The title of the question.

801
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:36,080
You mentioned when someone votes that the signature gets monetized for fifty

802
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,240
thousand dollars. Well, around fifty thousand.

803
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,200
Yes. Maybe more.

804
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,120
I still don't understand how a signature can have so much value.

805
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:49,760
Just thinking even a signed Michael Jordan rookie card may not even be worth that

806
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,860
much. What am I missing?

807
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,700
That is a very healthy, naive person.

808
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,600
OK. Right. Do you see that's a very well asked, but it's like

809
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,480
third grader. Right.

810
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:08,580
And I'm speaking on fifth grader level, but I always start on the third grader.

811
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,980
This is third grade, right?

812
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,880
Eight years old. Third grade.

813
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,460
Something like that. Something like that.

814
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,420
Yeah, that's honest. And right.

815
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,500
So how would you explain this to children?

816
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:25,160
Because the use factor with an eight year old is really minimal with money.

817
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,920
The only experience that I have is coins.

818
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:31,180
But now I think they get cards and accounts on the phone.

819
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,640
Right. Well, that's where we used to ask for change.

820
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,980
Yeah. No, see, that's the thing.

821
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,080
We used to handle getting 50, 50 cents in 1972.

822
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,780
Was not bad. It was pretty good.

823
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,780
Yeah. You got a slice of pizza and a soda for a quarter.

824
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,340
Oh, look, five bucks.

825
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,300
I could do a lot with five bucks.

826
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,720
I mean, you know what? Yeah. Yeah.

827
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,520
So so now I think they get it.

828
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,960
So electronic. I mean, whatever.

829
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,740
So, yeah. OK, so this is all right.

830
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,820
So this is very naive. OK, let's go do a very rapid history.

831
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:02,760
And what's interesting is there's whenever I repeat something,

832
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,140
it's never identical, right?

833
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,420
You might get maybe something else will come out.

834
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,380
What money basically is. OK.

835
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,100
The Greek speak money, if you want to go on a very high level,

836
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,000
not because it speaks to you, but a very high level.

837
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,240
Money is portable land

838
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,980
because you're supposed to live off the land.

839
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,620
And everything you need is.

840
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,060
And what I mean, like a society,

841
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,420
you can have 50 million people living off the land.

842
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,700
Here's the mining. This is where the mining done.

843
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,800
This is where the manufacturing.

844
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,280
This is the agriculture.

845
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,580
This is the red light district.

846
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,960
This is this. This is that.

847
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:34,340
And everybody gets along by exchanging whatever they exchange.

848
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,560
We're not talking about barter now. Right.

849
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:41,820
But once you leave that area where you have a semi closed system

850
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:45,020
and I said semi closed, because let's say you do imports and exports.

851
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,440
Right. So you're not a closed system.

852
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,440
You're not isolationist.

853
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:50,080
Once you leave, personally travel,

854
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,360
you lose the benefit of doing that exchange, that network that you're in.

855
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,940
So you have to bring something that represents your land.

856
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,560
That's why when you look at money, you notice that each geographic

857
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,640
region has its own name on it, like this is Japanese currency.

858
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,520
This is EU. This is the United States of America.

859
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,600
Notice the country name is on there because it's land based.

860
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:11,820
Right. Not bank. Not right.

861
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,240
OK, so portable land.

862
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,180
So it was decided a long time ago that

863
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,780
portable land is precious metals.

864
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,780
Why? OK, so you're going to carry land with you.

865
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:27,240
Enough topsoil to represent, you know, to do barter with.

866
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,420
How much or you can carry an ounce of gold.

867
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,560
Right now, how much topsoil will an ounce of gold get you?

868
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:38,040
A truckload, two truckloads, 10 truckloads, maybe more. Right.

869
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,540
So it's not practical to carry 10, 10 truckloads of topsoil.

870
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,020
Right. It's more practical to have a gold coin.

871
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:50,000
Ah, per portability. OK, so this is this is the way things are.

872
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,300
There's no there's no very little inflation with this, by the way.

873
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,680
So the price of things are the same.

874
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:58,960
Actually, the the the price changes, but the value of things are the same.

875
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,840
Let me just get into this.

876
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,500
A gold piece is twenty dollars.

877
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,760
Dollar is a weight measurement.

878
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:08,840
OK, so when you say a one ounce of gold is twenty dollars,

879
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:12,200
it doesn't matter if it's a thousand years ago or a thousand years from now.

880
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:15,540
It's twenty dollars because dollar is a weight.

881
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:20,100
OK, so that's what twenty is known as a score.

882
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:24,100
That's why in the old cowboy movies, where are you going after him?

883
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,620
I got a score to settle.

884
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:30,320
Right. Means the guy owes him a twenty dollar gold piece, an ounce of gold.

885
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,640
Right. OK, here you go.

886
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:32,560
A little trivia for you.

887
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,380
So remember Lincoln's speech for score and whatever.

888
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:39,100
Right. You know, 20 scores, 20. So.

889
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:46,360
What you have, what a twenty dollar gold piece got you

890
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,720
would have been, let's say, 300 years ago,

891
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,880
200 years ago, 150 years ago,

892
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,300
500 years ago, if you were a man, it got you a very nice hat,

893
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:03,520
a nice jacket with nice pants and a shirt

894
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,900
and some undergarments and a nice pair of shoes, not the best,

895
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,680
but quality stuff.

896
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:13,440
You're able to get a full outfit, a very high quality shoes, boots.

897
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,860
Right. Choose your boots.

898
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,120
You know, you don't buy shoes by the pound, right?

899
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:22,260
You can get boots that are cheaper than shoes and vice versa. Right.

900
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:26,280
Of course. OK, pants, you know, the whole outfit undergarment,

901
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:29,780
but very, very, very high quality stuff with one ounce,

902
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,780
twenty dollar gold piece for hundreds and hundreds of years.

903
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,520
Today, gold is over two thousand dollars an ounce. Right. Right.

904
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,000
It's could be in the twenty two hundred or something.

905
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:43,120
I don't I don't think it broke over twenty one. But anyway. So

906
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:48,220
with the value of one ounce of gold, which is not two thousand

907
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,280
because it's fiat currency,

908
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:55,080
you can still outfit yourself very well with a nice pair of shoes or boots,

909
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:58,200
nice pair of pants, nice shirt, nice undergarment, underwear,

910
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:01,160
nice jacket and a nice hat for two thousand bucks.

911
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,780
You'd be pressed to spend it all on nice stuff.

912
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,700
I'm not talking about going, getting Gucci, Fiorucci or whatever.

913
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,680
Talking about, you know, where normal, where

914
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,880
none were the majority of people shop for clothing,

915
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,480
go in there and buy the best stuff they have to offer.

916
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,200
I'm not talking about thirty thousand dollar handbags. Right.

917
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,620
Or twenty thousand dollar cowboy boots. No. Right.

918
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,380
So if you're in an urban suburban environment,

919
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:26,400
you go to the best department store, the best shops and say,

920
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:29,920
what's your best hat? I want it. What's your best jacket? I want it.

921
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:33,040
Your best pants. I want it. Your best things to put on my feet.

922
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,100
I want and it'll be still around two thousand dollars

923
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,920
to outfit yourself with the best stuff. Right. OK.

924
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,520
So things don't change.

925
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:43,300
But the the reason why it's two thousand dollars, by the way,

926
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:46,920
when when gold goes over two thousand dollars means that the buying power

927
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,340
of the Fiat Federal Reserve note dollar is less than a penny now

928
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,240
because at two thousand right.

929
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,240
Twenty times one hundred is two thousand.

930
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,300
So that makes it a penny. Right. Right.

931
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:00,800
So the buying power of the dollar today, the American Federal Reserve note,

932
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:05,280
a version of the dollar is what is what a penny bought you when it was gold back.

933
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,040
It's pretty scary. Right.

934
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:10,080
What I mean by this also, I haven't gotten to the question.

935
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:12,580
I'm just giving more background that I don't think I've ever discussed

936
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:16,380
in 1680 or 1750.

937
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:20,000
The years you went to buy a shovel, it was about a dollar,

938
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,220
which is a silver piece. Right.

939
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:28,700
An ounce of silver is a dollar in 1910, 150, 180, almost 200 years later.

940
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,080
You went to the hardware store.

941
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,660
Guess how much a shovel was still about a dollar.

942
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,040
No inflation or the price to stay the same because they're based on

943
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:39,920
precious metals or things that are hard goods.

944
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:42,020
Right. Hard material. Right. OK.

945
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:45,320
But there is inflation with silver.

946
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,940
When a new silver mine happens and they flood the market with silver,

947
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:53,820
the silver could lose its value, but they still use the they trade it on par.

948
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,280
It'll never it could lose its value, but it'll still be a dollar.

949
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:01,820
All right. It'll still buy what a dollar buys you or less

950
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,000
to a degree, depending on where the inflation is happening.

951
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:10,120
OK, so what happened basically when the banking system

952
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:14,620
started to grow and they got more technical with, quote, unquote,

953
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,960
merchant methods, the way that merchants deal with each other.

954
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:22,500
You know, when a ship pulls into a harbor and they have a manifest,

955
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,180
that manifest can be used as money.

956
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,420
What's on the ship, right?

957
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,400
I'm not going to get into that now because that's getting into

958
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,060
what's called the Tontine system.

959
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:34,140
T-O-N-T-I-N-E.

960
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:35,740
Look that word up.

961
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,360
It's even it's even hard to look it up.

962
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:44,080
So it's an insurance based merchant system, the law merchant.

963
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,040
By the way, when you an attorney is a law, it was a law merchant.

964
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,180
They hate that when you call them that. That's what they are.

965
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:54,260
A law merchant. In other words, it's all about merchant law.

966
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:00,700
So these bills of exchange and these paperwork, just like, for example.

967
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:04,200
OK, Chuck, I'm going to go mow your lawn.

968
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,060
Right. But you can't pay me.

969
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:08,220
I mean, use a loose term.

970
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:12,380
So you're going to give me an IOU for mowing the lawn.

971
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,760
Right. And I carry that. OK.

972
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,100
And so let's say five dollars.

973
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:17,440
You owe me that. Right. OK.

974
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,720
Now, I could go to this person over here, Billy,

975
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,080
and I owe him five dollars.

976
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,660
So I give him the IOU.

977
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,020
So instead of being paying me five dollars, you pay Billy.

978
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,060
And proof that you pay.

979
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:32,960
I don't have to be there because he has the paper and I could transfer.

980
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:36,020
I do what's called on a lawn on it, which is a transfer.

981
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:37,400
Pay, please pay.

982
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:40,340
Chuck, please pay to Billy this and I'm signing it. Right.

983
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,260
So now here comes Billy, who you've never met.

984
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:43,780
Knocks on your door because he knows the address.

985
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,320
Right. Right. And who are you?

986
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,520
He says, well, you owe me the five.

987
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,200
I get the five bucks from the Greek. Oh, really?

988
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,620
How do I know you're not frauding me?

989
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:52,260
Well, here I have in a launch.

990
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:56,500
So you see how I can get into all this, but I'm not. All right.

991
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,500
What I want to get into is what the bankers did.

992
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,800
What's called fractional reserve banking.

993
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:04,940
When people were bringing their gold to the banks for safekeeping,

994
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:07,300
just like people today put things in safe deposit box.

995
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,560
Big mistake. Don't do it. Right.

996
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:16,180
They deliberately raid FBI, FBI raids boxes to tell you stupid people.

997
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:17,360
What are you doing? Right.

998
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:20,660
Anyway, you've heard of that, right? Yeah.

999
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,160
OK. Yeah. And they just do it for no reason.

1000
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:25,600
I mean, well, they do because you never did anyway.

1001
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:27,100
Conditional endorsement.

1002
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,660
Let's get back to the subject.

1003
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:31,200
Fractional banking reserve banking is based on this.

1004
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,520
When the bankers were holding on to people's gold and giving them interest,

1005
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,660
they noticed that less than 10 percent of the people

1006
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:41,080
were frequently coming back to take their gold out.

1007
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:45,860
So they said, hmm, if for every dollar's

1008
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:49,300
worth of gold or silver we have, we can write bank notes

1009
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:53,640
that are good for for the gold at a rate of ten to one, because

1010
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:56,520
not everyone's going to come and take the gold.

1011
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:58,960
So when there's a bank run, everyone comes in, they're in trouble. Right.

1012
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,660
And what the note does is

1013
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,780
like the portable land did for having gold.

1014
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:06,900
You can't bring topsoil.

1015
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:10,060
So if you have gold coins and you want to go make a big purchase,

1016
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,580
you're going to lug along all these big gold coins.

1017
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,780
No, it's easier to have paper money. Right.

1018
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:18,500
Doesn't weigh anything. You put it in your purse, your wallet.

1019
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,680
That's what the bankers took advantage of. Right.

1020
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,980
So a thousand pieces of silver is a thousand ounces. Right. Right.

1021
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,400
That's quite a few. Right.

1022
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:29,920
What's a thousand divided by 16? Right.

1023
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:32,900
Let's say let's say it was 10 ounces.

1024
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:37,040
It would be 100 pounds of silver, roughly about 75 pounds of silver.

1025
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,480
You're going to lug that around. It's too damn hard to carry. I got it.

1026
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:40,900
Yeah. So you got paper money.

1027
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:44,980
And what the bankers did, they announced it. No, not too many people.

1028
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:46,020
There were some complaints.

1029
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:49,600
There were some problems with the fractional reserve. OK.

1030
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,740
So you get a ten to one.

1031
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:56,160
Right, so that ten to one doesn't mean if they deposit a thousand,

1032
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,780
they turn it into ten thousand becomes nine thousand. Right.

1033
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:03,000
I'm sorry. It's it's nine times, not ten times.

1034
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:04,540
And they keep the one in reserve.

1035
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,200
So it's always a multiple of nine.

1036
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:10,380
But it's easier to say ten because that's what they call it. Right. All right.

1037
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,860
So what's going on now is if you're familiar

1038
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:17,140
with the gold confiscation clause that the Federal Reserve

1039
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:21,720
16th Amendment, Federal Reserve, all this other stuff came in.

1040
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,940
Seemed like a good idea.

1041
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:27,580
They put together a reason, you know, we can expand the money supply.

1042
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:31,540
Elastic money, elastic money is where rubber check came from, by the way,

1043
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:35,880
because the law does say elastic currency, which is rubber checks.

1044
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,260
They always made fun of it.

1045
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:40,040
By the way, back in the 20s and 30s,

1046
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:43,520
if you said you were going to pay someone with a check, they laughed at you.

1047
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,040
So you're trying to pull a scam or what?

1048
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,340
Hmm. All right. This I'm serious.

1049
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:49,460
Workers were paid in cash.

1050
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:51,460
That's why if you look at any black and white movies,

1051
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:54,780
when you have a corporate boss, there's always a big safe in the corporate office

1052
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:58,860
because every week someone would go to the bank and bring cash

1053
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:01,760
and the workers would come in, they'd sign a slip and they get their pay

1054
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,100
weekly pay in cash paper.

1055
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:06,160
No checks, no bank big. Very rare to have a bank account. Right.

1056
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:08,600
It wasn't until the 1950s.

1057
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,860
So they started doing big propaganda to get people to get checking

1058
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:13,920
because before that, it was considered a fraud, which it is.

1059
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:19,130
OK, so what happened now with the gold confiscation clause

1060
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:22,790
when all the gold was sent overseas and you can find articles

1061
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:26,750
on this every month, 50 million dollars worth of gold

1062
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:30,250
was sent to Europe, Germany in the 30s.

1063
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:32,130
You could find the articles on your own. Right.

1064
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:36,070
No more gold.

1065
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:39,250
They bankrupted the country on March the 9th, 1933.

1066
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:42,070
So it's the Federal Reserve.

1067
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:43,550
What's in on reserve?

1068
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:48,690
Is your signature the government through certificates

1069
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:51,050
provided the banks with collateral?

1070
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:53,670
How can you prove

1071
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:57,510
a human being is your collateral

1072
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:01,210
by providing a birth certificate that they agree

1073
00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:04,050
that you have agency over them?

1074
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:08,270
Right. Just like the car, just like the house, whatever.

1075
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:13,010
So now, since your signature is just like gold.

1076
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:17,470
They still apply the ten to one fractional reserve banking.

1077
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:19,730
So let's say you do a credit card.

1078
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:22,170
Let's just explain for the question.

1079
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:25,470
OK, and what maybe we'll just end it here and we'll pick it up again.

1080
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:27,570
Because there's so many parallel ways

1081
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:29,950
to talk about this.

1082
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:34,030
OK, let's say the person who asked the question on the email.

1083
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:35,010
Think about it this way.

1084
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:36,710
This is exactly what's going on.

1085
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:37,870
It's probably worse.

1086
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:39,730
But exactly the principle.

1087
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:44,670
You have a discover card, master card, American Express, whatever.

1088
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:48,030
And you go to Ace Hardware or a hardware store and you get exactly.

1089
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:50,290
Let's just say it rings up exactly one hundred dollars.

1090
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:52,970
And you swipe the card.

1091
00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:55,790
Doesn't matter if it's debit, cash, credit, whatever.

1092
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:56,950
Forget it. The same.

1093
00:50:57,090 --> 00:50:59,930
Oh, it's all the same. It's just a different show. Right.

1094
00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:03,350
So a debit would be a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat.

1095
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:07,370
And credit card would be the magician pulling, you know,

1096
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:09,730
you know, something else out of his sleeve.

1097
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:13,190
It's the same form of trickery, just different part. Right.

1098
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:17,350
I think I've explained what happens when you when you're dead.

1099
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:18,910
But it's either right.

1100
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:21,870
It's all a show. The money's still there. Right. OK.

1101
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:25,150
So you go to the stove at whatever store.

1102
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:26,690
I used to use Sears as an analogy.

1103
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:28,730
And you swipe the card exactly one hundred dollars.

1104
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:30,890
What happens at that moment?

1105
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:32,710
Something pops up. It used to be paper.

1106
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:37,310
But what pops up is, is you agreed you agreed to perform

1107
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:40,290
authorize everything according to the cardholders agreement

1108
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:41,670
is what it says on the screen.

1109
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:45,370
Very vague language, just like the language

1110
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:48,290
that's that you see on the hospital registration form. Right.

1111
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:52,550
OK. Now, soon as you sign that, by the way,

1112
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,590
I sign everything void like a doctor.

1113
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:57,870
It looks like a looks like a signature.

1114
00:51:58,430 --> 00:52:00,250
Some people say, what kind of signature is that?

1115
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:02,150
So I think it's like a doctor signs, you know.

1116
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:05,790
But if I tell you if if I tell you on the side, hey, that's void.

1117
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:06,770
And you look at it. Oh, yeah.

1118
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:10,710
Now I see it because there's a little dot over where the eye would be. OK. Right.

1119
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:13,510
So you should you know, this is all fraudulent.

1120
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:15,470
Why do you want to put your name on something anyway?

1121
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:17,650
I got some money.

1122
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:19,730
This is I have a long story about that.

1123
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:22,410
I have to make it short, but not this time. OK.

1124
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:27,710
So remember, as soon as that pops up that you agree to sell, you sign

1125
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:31,670
according to the cardholders agreement. Right.

1126
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:36,150
Through the processing power of whatever

1127
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:39,210
A.I. or computers have been doing the same computers for a long time.

1128
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:41,590
I think they're so cheap, the bankers that they're still trying to use

1129
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:44,490
the same computers with DOS from 1980, really.

1130
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:47,290
You know, they are. Yeah.

1131
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:52,210
So there was no DOS in 1980.

1132
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:54,430
But anyway, Fortran, Cobalt.

1133
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:59,770
But what happens at that point, the computers pull up.

1134
00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:04,970
The transaction number and what's pre-programmed is the ten to one

1135
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:09,910
immediately on the banking side, nine hundred dollars is created

1136
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:11,790
soon as you authorize that on the terminal.

1137
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:16,190
Right, because ten to one remember for the every dollar of gold

1138
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:18,550
they had, ten dollars was in existence.

1139
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:21,930
Nine was created by the bankers. Right. Right.

1140
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:25,490
So what happens now, the hundred dollar payment that you swipe

1141
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:28,430
and you authorize right there in a millisecond, whatever long it takes,

1142
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:31,450
sometimes it takes a little longer than a millisecond.

1143
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:34,770
Nine hundred dollars is created out of that.

1144
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:36,130
Nine hundred dollars.

1145
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:38,310
A hundred dollars is sent to the merchant.

1146
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:39,790
Boom. Right there.

1147
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:43,150
Eight hundred dollars is left. And that's it.

1148
00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:45,990
Right. Eight hundred dollars is left.

1149
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:48,870
And that's divided between certain government agencies,

1150
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:51,190
the banks and the people.

1151
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:55,110
At the end of the month, though, let's say it's a credit card.

1152
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:58,710
Yeah. You still get a bill for that hundred dollars.

1153
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:00,390
And they're laughing at you.

1154
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:03,490
They're like, if you know anyone that's higher up in the debt collection,

1155
00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:05,950
they don't want to talk about what they do, because it's like

1156
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:09,850
people should know that they don't know anything, basically,

1157
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:12,570
is what you get out of a conversation with an administrator

1158
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:14,690
in the debt collection business. Right. Right.

1159
00:54:14,930 --> 00:54:16,850
It's because they don't know they don't know anything.

1160
00:54:16,990 --> 00:54:17,950
We owe them, actually.

1161
00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:20,550
So what should be going on?

1162
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:24,870
Five to 10 percent is reasonable interest when you create money. Right.

1163
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:27,590
What should be happening is when you go swipe that

1164
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:30,050
that credit card for a hundred dollars or debit card,

1165
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:33,670
they should be giving you the hundred dollar

1166
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:37,910
whatever payment, plus another hundred dollars on it for using the card.

1167
00:54:37,910 --> 00:54:39,370
And they keep now seven hundred.

1168
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:43,330
By the way, that is being done.

1169
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:46,730
But on a smaller level, how many times have you seen commercials

1170
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:51,790
for use master visa, whatever, and get what cash back cash back?

1171
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:53,190
Yeah. How much do they give you?

1172
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:54,630
Twenty bucks or something. Right.

1173
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:56,810
Two, three percent, something like that. Yeah.

1174
00:54:56,850 --> 00:54:58,290
So what I'm telling you, they're applying.

1175
00:54:58,470 --> 00:55:03,730
If you know and the Volkswagen sign and drive, all you need is to sign.

1176
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:05,950
Yeah, sign and drive. Right.

1177
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:08,250
And I can go on to give you more evidence and more evidence

1178
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:09,350
and more evidence and more evidence.

1179
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:13,470
By the way, if you look up the FTCPA federal laws,

1180
00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:17,290
the government feds at the time did put a little remedy in there

1181
00:55:17,290 --> 00:55:20,490
that if someone says that you owe them money, they have to send a letter

1182
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:24,530
of validation and it has to pass federal standards.

1183
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:26,390
In other words, has to be under penalty of perjury.

1184
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:31,390
All you need to do is cite the code FTCPA validation letter.

1185
00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:33,430
And they made it so it works for the people.

1186
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:34,950
But people don't know about it.

1187
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:37,090
Use it. There's what lies in your debt group.

1188
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:39,270
If you want to join them, they're a little convoluted,

1189
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:40,370
but they got the right idea.

1190
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:43,390
It's called what lies in your debt group,

1191
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:47,810
not endorsing them, but they do good, good work. OK.

1192
00:55:50,410 --> 00:55:53,390
Validation letter, if they don't say if the next time they contact you,

1193
00:55:53,410 --> 00:55:56,730
whether it's by phone or mail, if it's not a validation letter,

1194
00:55:56,730 --> 00:55:59,850
it's a five hundred dollar time per instance and what you can do.

1195
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:02,650
You know how they love sending letters, right?

1196
00:56:03,010 --> 00:56:07,210
Oh, yeah. Let them rack up the letters to like five or ten letters and then say,

1197
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:11,650
hey, you know, you FTCPA violation five thousand dollars or you got ten letters.

1198
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:14,150
I'm going to draft a federal lawsuit

1199
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:16,970
and I'm going to email you. What do you want to do?

1200
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:19,010
They always settle. They never go to court.

1201
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:22,430
And there's and it doesn't go on the credit report

1202
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:25,570
because there never was a debt to begin with.

1203
00:56:26,330 --> 00:56:28,770
There's people that could make a living with credit cards,

1204
00:56:28,850 --> 00:56:31,510
just rack up the credit card, do FTCPA,

1205
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:34,810
and they pay you the fines and then you write.

1206
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:38,810
You see, I'm not promoting this because that means working in a demonic system.

1207
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:42,230
But this is no, you don't have to.

1208
00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:43,850
But this is the reality of it.

1209
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:45,710
Well, if you're going to do it that way, you'd have to, though.

1210
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:46,950
That's the only way you can work with you.

1211
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:49,110
I mean, the only way to make that work for you is to work within it.

1212
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:50,090
Yeah, good. Right.

1213
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:52,210
But so let me answer that question directly.

1214
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:54,550
Michael Jordan's signature is hard to get 50,000.

1215
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:58,030
But how are they monetizing your signature is your signature?

1216
00:56:58,210 --> 00:57:02,870
Is what they did is when they if you look up how gold is fractionalized,

1217
00:57:02,870 --> 00:57:06,350
fractional reserve banking from the early 20th century.

1218
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:11,730
When the gold was obfuscated, they replaced the gold with your signature

1219
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:13,950
and they're doing exactly the same thing with your signature.
