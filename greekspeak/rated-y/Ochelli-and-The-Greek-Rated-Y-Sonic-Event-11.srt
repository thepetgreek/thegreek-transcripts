1
00:00:07,039 --> 00:00:12,860
Sonic Event 11, Ocelli in the Greek rated Y, and you probably already know that because

2
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,640
you're a subscriber and you clicked on it, so thanks for being here and hearing this,

3
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,320
wherever that is and whatever this actually is.

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,700
So the Greek is with me and we are recording after the sun has kind of gone away for the

5
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:33,540
day where I'm sitting, so what time of day is it?

6
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:40,860
Well you can check out an earlier event and hear all about that, but today I have in my

7
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,500
mind I want to talk about things, in my mind, there we go, I'm taking possession of that,

8
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:50,700
I'm owning it with my language, what about my government, what about my house, what about

9
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:57,260
my children, my wife, my family, what about my things, what do you actually own and what

10
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:01,020
are you communicating with your language when you speak Greek?

11
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:06,700
You can probably help me out with this because it's awfully confusing if you listen to the

12
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,780
inconsistent nature.

13
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:12,520
It's the possession of thought, not the possession itself, the material.

14
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,520
Now is that just sentimentality, is that just window dressing or does that have a meaning,

15
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,900
does that have a purpose?

16
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,980
Let's take some examples if you wouldn't mind, right?

17
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:33,180
Sure, in short the Nuremberg Trials was probably the best example in the most recent history

18
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:39,380
that people can reference details on, well you know what I mean by details, when you

19
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:43,500
get a history book and you go through it, it's all like Major League bullshit, right?

20
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,020
But you can't get upset because when you look at the title it doesn't say true history,

21
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:49,520
does it?

22
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,040
Well, yeah, right.

23
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,200
So you're presuming it's true, it's not, you see, it's not really true.

24
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:00,880
By the way, if you do research on old stuff, which I'm talking about physical, you will

25
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,660
have true, it will say true history of such and such or the true measurement of such and

26
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,979
such, they took that word out when the legal system came in.

27
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,420
Nuremberg Trials was about responsibility and you know, it was a sham, they used early

28
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:21,220
days of clones, people that were really low on the totem pole, you know, what do you

29
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,720
call them, scapegoats, such and such.

30
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:31,000
But what they did there is a display to the world of massive censorship coming in and

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,860
a massive change in the way people view what's right and wrong.

32
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,520
And that's another discussion, I mean I could get into that big time, but I want to get

33
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,360
into how it affects the way people think and act in a subtle way.

34
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,520
Well, even scapegoat is a weird term because when one looks at what a scapegoat actually

35
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:56,840
is supposed to be by its old definition, yeah, they're a leader, and it's actually a Judas

36
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,840
goat that kind of fits more of the descriptor that's often given for a scapegoat, right,

37
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,820
which is we assign blame onto the scapegoat.

38
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,080
I mean, that's the given current nomenclature with that.

39
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,000
That's the Judas goat.

40
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,460
The scapegoat is usually the one that's let go.

41
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:18,080
Yeah, but the strange thing is, again, when somebody says scapegoat, what is the presumption

42
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,520
by the listener usually now with...

43
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,640
Oh yeah, a patsy.

44
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,940
That's the patsy, which is not right.

45
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,880
But again, etymology, you've always got one.

46
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:33,800
You know, I'll say kids and nice just because it's a relaxed way to socially accept it,

47
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,640
but I do know what it means and I know how to use it precisely.

48
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:41,440
It's kind of like I've got an accurate, well, I wouldn't say I do this with a machinist

49
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,840
standard ruler.

50
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,660
You know how you have a ruler, a foot long, and it's got metric on one side and inches

51
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,720
on the other, 12 inches.

52
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,700
Well, there are some real...

53
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,940
I have a precision one.

54
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,420
It goes down to 64th of an inch and it tells you the expansion.

55
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,220
So the measurements are only good at 78 degrees or 75 degrees if it's hotter or colder.

56
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,660
The measurements are not really accurate because of shrinkage, right?

57
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,840
I could use that as a paint stirrer, couldn't I?

58
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:08,920
You could.

59
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:09,660
Yeah.

60
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,060
Yeah.

61
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,460
Yeah.

62
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:14,560
It's a scientific, it's a precision instrument stirrer.

63
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,800
You can get them for about 80 bucks, I think.

64
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,880
Or you could go to the dollar store or Walmart and get one for a dollar.

65
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,200
You see the difference?

66
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,960
So it's still the same.

67
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,040
It's just a stick, you know?

68
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,400
Well, you can bludgeon someone with a heavy book without ever bothering to read it.

69
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,860
I mean, it is useful as a weapon.

70
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,000
Yeah, you could.

71
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,020
That's typically how things are thought of.

72
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,540
But here's the thing.

73
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,720
Thought is this subtle energy and it's dimensionless, you know?

74
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,700
It's kind of like you can't measure it using that standard that I just mentioned, that

75
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,300
paint stick.

76
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:50,500
You see, I've often wondered that too and I don't want to keep sidetracking you here,

77
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,020
so to speak.

78
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,060
But really, honestly, thought seems to me, although we don't know how to measure it,

79
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,460
I'm almost willing to bet there is a way to measure it.

80
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,960
But I don't know.

81
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,880
I have no clue about what goes into that, what the calculation is.

82
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,500
Well, yes, you do.

83
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,180
It's very profound because you could have a general sitting at the Pentagon, he has

84
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,780
a thought, and then he pushes a button, it gives a command to drop a missile on some

85
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,840
village in Iraq, which you're still doing.

86
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,680
So the thoughts, and it goes from an inspiration to a thought to a, well, unless the general

87
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,480
is probably being told what to do, but it goes, you know, thought and it becomes action.

88
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:35,560
But what I'm trying to say, the subtleness, the subtle energy effects, it's a dimensional

89
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,500
quantity, a dimensionless quantity.

90
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:43,800
It has no dimension, no height, width, depth, or weight, right?

91
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,640
But it's the dominant, it dominates the quality of the thing, right?

92
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,100
I just want to preface, this is kind of a preface of a preface, but I want to also retrospectively

93
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:55,600
go back.

94
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:01,740
I think we spoke about, unless I was hallucinating, that we spoke about it, how when the master

95
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:08,120
or the, let's say, the owner or whatever is not present, the manufacturing or the business

96
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,040
goes down 20 or 30% in quality, starts to go down to shit, right?

97
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,520
I don't think we spoke about that, right?

98
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:13,920
Right.

99
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:14,840
Okay.

100
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:21,420
So what I'm saying is if you go get a Ferrari and Mr. Ferrari is dead, well, the best they're

101
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,720
going to do is 80%.

102
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,040
What's the other 20?

103
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,260
Shit, right?

104
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,780
So if you go, right, you see?

105
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:35,580
So what I was hinting there is a return to what if you lived in a society where things

106
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:41,380
were decentralized, and just like now, you have places that were known for doing things

107
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:46,040
really well, like Modena for balsamic vinegar, and certain regions in France for certain

108
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,460
wines that are named after it, right?

109
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,640
Certain things that are named after certain regions, right?

110
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,880
That's because they did them really well there, right?

111
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:53,820
Champagne.

112
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,480
Sure, sure.

113
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:01,900
So when you go, and in industry also, so if there is a return or an emergence of where

114
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:08,020
you have a mastership, apprentice, a master within the organization that is actually functioning,

115
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,820
you can retain near 100% of quality, right?

116
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:19,440
So when you look at something, again, like a Ford or let's look Ferrari, there's actually

117
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,720
a movie, Ford versus Ferrari or something, but anyway, Ferrari, he's dead.

118
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,580
There's no Mr. Ferrari there anymore that's worth any crap.

119
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:32,120
So if you give them a million bucks, you're really getting $800,000 worth of product, and

120
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,860
you're paying $200,000 for crap.

121
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,600
That's like an example.

122
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,240
Usually when you go and get something like from Microsoft or the consumer grade products,

123
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:40,820
it's the other way.

124
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:45,280
It's like 80% crap, 20% quality substance, right?

125
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:50,960
So this is a very simple, once it's brought up, it's very easy to see that.

126
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,220
We call it planned ups.

127
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,540
There's this, that, and the other or cheap goods.

128
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,160
No, it's not.

129
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,940
It's just crap.

130
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:02,920
It's because the reason I brought this up is I had a conversation with a small group

131
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:10,420
a few days prior to that, and the whole thing was I've had several enterprises that I was

132
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,140
involved in, and I noticed I had a good crew.

133
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,140
Everything was going well.

134
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,200
The moment I take a day off, everything falls apart, and then I said, well, maybe it was

135
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:18,820
just a fluke.

136
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:23,940
So let's just run it for another few weeks and go back, take a day off or two days off.

137
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,960
Everything falls apart again, but it didn't fall apart where it was catastrophic, but

138
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:33,020
it just went down, like really, you know, client complaints and this and that and things

139
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,960
that the quality wasn't up.

140
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:40,200
So I noticed that I played with this back and forth in various industries, and I noticed

141
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,240
that when the principle wasn't there, the quality went down, the people that were there

142
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,640
started producing crap, but enough to pass it by, but not as good as when the principle

143
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,240
was there.

144
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,900
So I started applying this and seeing it throughout the entire planet.

145
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,760
This is what's going on pretty much.

146
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,280
So unless you're getting something from a source where the mastership or principle is there,

147
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:07,120
there is a 20% to 30% crap factor built into it, and this is what we're, again, I'm repeating

148
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,380
myself here, but this, we call it planned obsolescence or cheap goods or whatever.

149
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,780
No, it's not that at all.

150
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:17,440
There's an element that's missing, and it's a subtle element, because here's the thing.

151
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:25,820
Even if you had the people working for the principle doing exactly what they did when

152
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:30,940
the principle was there, the day he takes the day off, even if they continue just doing

153
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,840
it exactly the way he did it, it still goes down 20% or 30%.

154
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,900
It's just this weird phenomenon, right?

155
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:42,140
So no matter what, even if, you know, it's not a matter of, well, okay, what is the old

156
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:42,660
phrase, right?

157
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,340
When the cat's away, the mice will play.

158
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,920
It's not just a matter of they've decided to slack off.

159
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,080
No, no.

160
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:56,500
They're trying hard, but there's something, as if an energy or a spirit comes in to replace

161
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:00,300
the position of the principle to throw in the crappy stuff.

162
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,200
It's really weird how that works.

163
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,240
I've also discussed this with other people.

164
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,560
Some people said, oh, yeah, I'm going to do another business.

165
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,500
I'm not going to be in this business anymore, but I have a good person running it.

166
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,180
I talked to them a few months later, what happened to that other business?

167
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,200
So I had to shut it down.

168
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,140
Oh, really?

169
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:15,740
Okay.

170
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,100
I didn't think you were so confident, were you?

171
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,860
So what I'm saying is don't waste your time.

172
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:27,120
In other words, if you think you're going to start a few businesses or do various, let's

173
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,220
say, enterprises and not be present, you have to build in a 20% to 30% shit factor.

174
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,140
If it's not passable to the clients or the people that are, let's say, having an exchange

175
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,700
or transactions with you, then don't do it because they're going to notice, right?

176
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,820
Or don't be there even from the beginning.

177
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,200
It's weird, too, because that goes all the way down the ladder.

178
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:52,560
I used to have situations where I was brought in to sort of right the ship in a certain

179
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,940
business and I would do it and I'd get everything running fine and inevitably, no matter what

180
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:04,200
I did, six months later, I would usually have to go back to the same place and fix it

181
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:12,660
again because unless I was there kind of maintaining that, it didn't stay consistent.

182
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:19,300
A lot of times, it wasn't just because, oh, people are lazy or it just would happen, yeah.

183
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:26,420
It's a social practice that you'll see not just in business but in society in many levels.

184
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:32,500
The reason I bring this up is because you can mechanically measure their ability and

185
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,120
their productivity.

186
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:37,800
It's almost the same but it just happens to everything just seems to tumble because it's

187
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:44,900
a very subtle energy and its dominant quality is the subtle energy, the most dominant quality

188
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,160
other than the fit and finish.

189
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,060
How does this tie in?

190
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:54,500
When you're influencing a society with industries, you know how you went from horse and carriage

191
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:59,780
to car and now then it went to everything's smart and computerized, you don't have any

192
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,580
principles involved.

193
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,860
The thing is running on its own.

194
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:08,020
So when things start to go bad, who takes the blame for it essentially is you want to

195
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:12,040
shift that blame is what they've been doing to the population, right?

196
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,200
Like how many times have you heard people say, well, you voted for him.

197
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,100
It's your fault, right?

198
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:20,140
Well, actually, the reality is your vote never mattered anyway even since George Washington

199
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:20,780
days, right?

200
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:31,280
So the way that's done is by making you the authorizing the outcome and that way that's

201
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:38,420
done is from children and on and on and on and to skip all the entire cultural development

202
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:38,740
of it.

203
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:44,240
For example, you download a new browser, let's say on a computer and it says, click here.

204
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,040
It's called my Yahoo, right?

205
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,560
Or my AOL, right?

206
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,360
Or my this, right?

207
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,020
It's not mine.

208
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,640
Wait a second.

209
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,780
It's you guys made it.

210
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:51,940
Why?

211
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,560
How does it become mine?

212
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:53,820
Right?

213
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,640
You know, this is my clip.

214
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,280
Click here to get my coupon.

215
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:04,880
I mean, you see, everything is my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my,

216
00:13:44,840 --> 00:14:12,240
my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my

217
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:42,220
my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my

218
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:47,120
I once a cop wrote me a ticket make a long story short a long time ago for

219
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,840
riding a bicycle without a driver's license and I did the proper stuff

220
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,220
returned it and all that and they wrote back says you can't return it that's

221
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:58,300
your ticket I'm like what do you mean it's mine you guys printed it you guys

222
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:02,960
are you don't argue with them about what the tickets about you guys printed it

223
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:07,020
you guys are paying someone it's all out in a uniform to hand out as many of

224
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:11,880
these as possible or it gets fired right it's yours it's your stuff right so

225
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:16,480
Obviously, it's someone really low, so what I'm trying to say is there's levels on the

226
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,940
totem pole, whether you're dealing with a state, the government, the two different things

227
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,540
by the way, the state and the government, right?

228
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:28,540
We've never really got too much depth in that, just like the gods and the religion, right?

229
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:32,140
Because the religion, when you talk about religion, by the way, it's the purveyors

230
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:36,180
of the system, the church, the temple, whatever, and the gods are totally different, right?

231
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:41,040
You know, when you read, let's say, the religious creeds, there's a religious creed for the

232
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,860
Catholic church that says, I believe in one, only one apostolic Catholic church.

233
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,180
Have you ever read the creed?

234
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,280
Something I'm paraphrasing.

235
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,880
Yeah, yeah, I've seen that, yeah.

236
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,340
I believe in one apostolic Catholic church.

237
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:56,160
Doesn't say you believe in God or a god or any gods, you see?

238
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:01,000
So you know, the state is the one that does the business for the government when the government

239
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,900
doesn't have certain abilities or certain abilities are taken away, whether it's military, financial,

240
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:06,440
or whatever.

241
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,100
Okay.

242
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,280
So this is the condition you live in.

243
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,340
You have the state, and when you get higher up within that system, they discern.

244
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:20,900
Of course, if you speak to like a retired district attorney or assistant district attorney,

245
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:25,620
they all know that, you know, but when they first come out of school and go into the job,

246
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,560
they don't know that, right?

247
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,220
Like, give another example.

248
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,560
Do you know how the CIA hires people, you know, like entry-level agents, they usually

249
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,640
get them from, usually military experience, you know, I'm not talking about the ones where

250
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:42,420
they recruit from colleges, but the ones that, even the ones from colleges, what they do

251
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:46,460
is they have like a little seminar get-together for a few days, you know, you come in, it's

252
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:50,720
a local thing, and they interview and talk about stuff and national stuff or whatever,

253
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,180
and they tell you to go out into the yard, and they're raised, because they're raising

254
00:16:54,180 --> 00:17:00,020
the flag, and as the flag is being raised, they have a camera down at knee level, and

255
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:04,460
whosoever's knees shake the most when the flag is being raised is a primary candidate.

256
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:06,780
Right.

257
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,700
Now, this I've never heard before.

258
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,660
Now, I know about, you know, how they offer, you know, look, you're special because you're

259
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:18,819
in the military, and the NSA does it, all the intelligence agencies do this, where they

260
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:21,560
give them special entry, you'll have an advantage, this and that.

261
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,420
Yeah, that's clerical, that's the administrative part, but I'm telling you what they look for,

262
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:29,740
the actual scouts, you know, the guys that, you know, you have the guys that do it by

263
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,880
the book, then you have the guys out there that make sure that the guys that are doing

264
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,880
it by the book get the right ones, right?

265
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:39,840
And that's what, they basically look, so they tell you, you know, you're doing this to support

266
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,580
the Constitution, the National, whatever, United States, and they keep that for a few

267
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:52,420
weeks, right, and then they shift it to obeying your commanding officer is supporting the

268
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:57,880
Constitution and National, blah, blah, blah, okay, and then they start speaking less about

269
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,380
the Constitution and the national security, and more about obeying the commanding officer

270
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:05,580
until they completely eliminate, the same people, eliminate the Constitution and all

271
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:10,420
the laws and morality and ethics, and now it's just about obeying the commanding officer,

272
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,680
no matter what he says, you see how they shift you over once they see, you know, you're weak-minded

273
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,840
enough to buy into the nationalism and do what's right, gung-ho, you see?

274
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,940
Right, as long as we present you with a leader, regardless of what the leader's motives are,

275
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,560
or whatever, you'll follow that because we prescribe it for you, yeah, okay.

276
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:32,120
But it didn't start off that way, they recruited you by telling you you're supporting the national

277
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,500
sovereignty and the Constitution.

278
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,100
You're protecting the country and the people and the Constitution, and defending and serving.

279
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,840
That's what gets you in, and then they start shifting it, and shifting it through mind

280
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,040
control and all, you know, through, you know, and the more you get in there, the more you

281
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,320
rely on it, right?

282
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:52,300
So this is exactly what's happening by putting the onus on everyone making everything around

283
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:56,600
them theirs, even stuff like Facebook accounts, bank accounts, my bank account, you know.

284
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,540
Here's the thing, I don't know anyone who really has a bona fide legal or lawful bank

285
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,620
account alive today, I don't know anyone who does.

286
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:09,960
But many people say they have a bank account, actually, by definition, you don't.

287
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,260
The bank doesn't have anything to put in any account, right?

288
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:13,960
It's just ledgers.

289
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,820
So but we still use that terminology, right?

290
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,340
Now, who knows about that?

291
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,820
Who knows about banking the least are the people that work in the banks, right?

292
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:29,920
They're easy to trick and fool when it comes to talking about logistics.

293
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:36,420
Speaking of which, someone talked about prepping and stuff, and I want to bring up an example

294
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:42,400
as we go on to this conversation, and it has to do with banks or anything.

295
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,520
But again, I don't know how much I could lean on the subject.

296
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:55,040
But if whoever's listening has run into something, especially online, my they try to make their

297
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,920
stuff your stuff, right?

298
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:01,740
Or it says my so be careful for that, you know, and be careful with it in your own language.

299
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,940
You know, would you bring me my slippers?

300
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,740
That's my coffee, right?

301
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,120
That's right.

302
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,920
That's my wife, you know, or, or whatever.

303
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:24,840
You see, it's, it's, this, this taps directly into a direct observation of one's place in

304
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,240
the cosmic realm, not just the physical realm.

305
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:32,920
Well, what is what is fit and proper to describe as mine, then?

306
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,560
Or what?

307
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,520
Is there nothing to describe that way?

308
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,060
No, there really isn't.

309
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,940
That's it's almost like a bad word.

310
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,440
Think about it.

311
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,720
Because ultimately, even if you believe in such a thing as a life review or the resurrection,

312
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:53,200
or not, if you were to believe in something, wouldn't you want to know more about it?

313
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:59,500
Well, at that point, you're basically standing naked in a vulnerable position amongst the

314
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,940
beings that are super powerful.

315
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,200
What's yours?

316
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:03,900
Really nothing.

317
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,040
You see, this is just the aspect of all of it.

318
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:14,260
You know, when you're passing through, you know, the effectiveness of being a sojourner

319
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:18,440
or a journeyman, that's why even in trades, a journeyman was someone who was there to

320
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,760
make something better and then move on to something else, right?

321
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,840
You know, in the trades, right?

322
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:28,000
So, all these things were viewed as a journey.

323
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,000
So when you're on a journey, how would you view it?

324
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:37,440
And what happens then is you get more acute and more perceptive, and the deception becomes

325
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,000
comical.

326
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:45,300
Because you live in the situation here where ignorance prevails.

327
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,700
Let me just say it this way.

328
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:54,380
When we brought up the discussion on the gods, think of the gods as, let's say, imagine a

329
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:58,600
gladiator-type society, and this is kind of extreme because when you think gladiator, it's

330
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,400
very powerful and dynamic and violent.

331
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,660
So let's just think of it that way, because biologically, we are.

332
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,760
Yeah, well, everybody knows how to picture that, though.

333
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,540
It's pretty simple.

334
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,020
I mean, they're familiar enough.

335
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,500
You have an arena, you have a battle that goes on, this is a mortal combat.

336
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,360
Yeah, the arena situation would be the world.

337
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,280
And you have gladiators that are not in the arena.

338
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,780
They're out, they're not in the arena, they're not in the fight.

339
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:26,260
They are the gods, right?

340
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,520
So now, big trouble happens when they come into the arena.

341
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,960
But think of it, what I'm trying to say here is, we live in a world where everyone wants

342
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,020
to, you know, the Christians say, give it up to God, right?

343
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:39,580
He'll take care of it.

344
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,660
No, he won't.

345
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,380
Think about it.

346
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:41,800
How many people pray?

347
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,320
Oh, I always find that ridiculous.

348
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:48,500
You know, that is just a, I'm just going to close my eyes and hope everything works.

349
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,600
You know, I don't get that, ever.

350
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:55,980
Yeah, well, look, if you're in the arena, and you're a gladiator with your opponent,

351
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,220
and you say, I'm just going to give it up to the guy that's back there.

352
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,700
The moment you've even finished saying that, your head gets lobbed off by your opponent,

353
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,020
right?

354
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,780
Because he's not in the arena, so you're being watched.

355
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:12,460
And that's why, ultimately, well, even if you get your head lobbed off, you know, then

356
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:16,360
the next thing you know is something, you know, you've never heard of, most likely,

357
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,620
or not familiar with, you're still fine.

358
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:26,240
There is a, by the way, for the people that are afraid of death, there is a factor of,

359
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,840
let's just say, like, with prey animals, like sheep and goats and cows, when they're

360
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,840
slaughtered, they don't experience pain the way, this has been, this was a study that

361
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:41,800
was done by Delgado in the 60s, when he attached, well, he was using mind control, he had a

362
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:45,780
little box, and he would, the descriptions are a little wooden box with electrical

363
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:49,820
circuitry, and he would make the bull, you know, retract in the arena, or kneel,

364
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,940
or charge, and he was experimenting with animals and looking at pain thresholds,

365
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,420
and he found that their pain thresholds are very different than ours, so it's as if almost

366
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:01,840
prey animals are made to be killed and not suffer, you know?

367
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,420
So what I'm trying to say here is I would reckon that when you're at the point of

368
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,320
dying, unless it's a very slow death, you won't feel it as such.

369
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,260
You know, you'll be like, oh, that's what I was afraid of,

370
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:17,560
this, I'm dead, where I died, and that wasn't

371
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:21,300
shit, it wasn't so bad, and I was told to fear that my whole life,

372
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,400
wow, you know? But watching people die, which I don't know

373
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,400
how much, have you experienced that personally? Yeah.

374
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:32,320
Twice or three times, yeah, it's very uneventful.

375
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:37,160
It's pretty uneventful at the end, and there is this

376
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,380
momentary time period where

377
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:45,040
death has not fully set in, it seems, and

378
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:49,100
quite honestly, I see people relax. Yeah, of course.

379
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:53,140
Most of the time. I mean, look, if you're in a whole lot of pain and you're very

380
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:57,300
confused, I mean, and it's a very violent and sudden issue, I mean, I'm sure that's

381
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:01,320
different, but generally speaking, there's kind of a

382
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:05,080
okay, you know, and people say, oh, that's acceptance,

383
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,700
or that's, oh, they decided to make peace with it right there,

384
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,700
they didn't make a decision, I don't think, I think that's just the experience of it.

385
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:16,480
Multiple observations, it appears to me as though, right then and there,

386
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:20,680
it's just, oh, okay, you know, there is that

387
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,980
threshold, but you look inside of a house, you know, and you're about to step into it, and you say,

388
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:28,260
okay, this isn't so bad to go in here. It is definitely a threshold moment.

389
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:32,980
I just got a, someone here sent me, the Catholics, they do have a creed,

390
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:36,780
by the way, I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, supposedly maker of heaven and earth, all things,

391
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,860
I think the one that I cited was the Eastern Orthodox Church.

392
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:44,820
I believe in one holy Catholic and apostolic church. Okay, so it's

393
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:48,780
more down towards the end there. Thank you for

394
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:52,800
sending that, and yeah, so just to make a

395
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,640
correction, it's more towards the bottom, but still it's inclusive in there. I think the way that people

396
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,840
read things might be more important than how they place it. By the way,

397
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,400
when you go to a court trial,

398
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,260
the first thing they do is tell you to state your name, because it's a reverse contract,

399
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,960
and all the rest of the offers are done after you sign it, so in other words, you know, when you read

400
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,820
a contract and then sign it, by the way, even a car dealership, they don't want you to

401
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:20,780
read all the fine print. People get annoyed all the time, and then later on,

402
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,900
when you don't like what you signed to, they said you should have read it, right? Of course.

403
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,920
But when you go to court and they say state your name, that's because you're signing

404
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,480
first, right? So that's another funky thing that goes on, but

405
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:36,980
about possessions, that's where you know that the people

406
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:41,060
have lost in general. In other words, it's like shooting fish in a barrel. You could pretty much say

407
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:44,780
anything to them, and they believe it, and they go for it. Because you're signing a blank contract,

408
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,520
which hasn't been written yet, and now they're going to write it since you signed it. Exactly.

409
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:53,020
And that's how it works. So yeah, those characters. By the way, one day we should get into the history

410
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:57,080
of the DOJ. If you put in

411
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:01,220
history of Department of Justice in a browser, the first thing

412
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:05,100
that comes up, even on a Wikipedia page, or the comments, it's a historical

413
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,720
anomaly. It means that no one knows where it came from, because it's

414
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,020
the Bar Association. I think Grant signed it in,

415
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,140
it's like 3.30 in the morning, they put a gun to his head, told him to sign it, and they were

416
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:20,680
supposed to provide attorneys to represent politicians, but now

417
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:24,600
it's gotten to the point where they're putting cases out themselves.

418
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,640
They're the ones going, it's totally illegal and unlawful.

419
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:31,760
But so is the rest of the stuff that you hear about in history.

420
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:36,980
I figure it's just a transposition of the Temple Bar Association

421
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:40,320
from the United Kingdom. The city.

422
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,580
The city of London. The city of London specifically.

423
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,800
It's known as, if you say the city anywhere in the world, especially

424
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,620
people who are legal, they know what you mean. Not London, but just like

425
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:56,340
all of the capitals, like in Moscow, you have Moscow and Russia,

426
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:00,520
but where Putin is, he's not in Moscow, he's in the DF, in the district federal.

427
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,660
Like in Mexico, you have Mexico City as the capital, but there's another

428
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:08,100
city inside of it, it's called district federal, right?

429
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,480
Washington DC is the district of Columbia. Federal district.

430
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,780
So it's very interesting how

431
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:20,460
every country shows that you're under occupation, and that's why I brought up the gladiators,

432
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,380
because it's still this model that goes back to that time.

433
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:28,460
The old adage, if it's not

434
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,140
broken, why fix it, right?

435
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:33,960
It doesn't need fixing.

436
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,020
If it's not broken, just blow it up.

437
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:44,420
One of the definitions for capitalism is when you're done using

438
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,940
something, you destroy it so no one else can use it.

439
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,560
To go back,

440
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,200
I cannot overemphasize how much this

441
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:59,000
me, mine, and whatever, in just basic language. Now we're not talking

442
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,640
about someone saying, whose car is this?

443
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:06,760
You might say, this is my car, because if you start being loose about it, it's inefficient

444
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,700
and ineffective. But just in the common little points that everyday

445
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:15,060
people use, you just watch that. In other words, how many people are using

446
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:18,960
this is mine, this is my building. My favorite is like the

447
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,360
secretary going into, or anyone walking into a big office tower

448
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:26,240
and this is my building. They point at it, right?

449
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:30,820
Well, really what it means is this is where you work, but it's not your building.

450
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,260
What do you mean it's my building? It's like a billion dollar tower. It's yours.

451
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,900
It's used all over the place, frankly.

452
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:43,260
That shows you the level of spiritual development, or where these people can operate.

453
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:47,540
Well, I mean, we'll go with something even more simple.

454
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,520
They say it's my street. Very good.

455
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:55,260
My house, my street, whatever. My kids. My kids is my favorite.

456
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,280
Even if you think you own the house, which you most likely don't.

457
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,780
You're a tenant, at best.

458
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:07,300
You could remedy that, because they like to make you believe that so they can take advantage

459
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,880
of it. There's a guy called Steve,

460
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,760
he's not on the internet anymore. He was a Steve in Florida.

461
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,900
Florida Steve. I have most of his details.

462
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:21,460
The property taxes that people pay on houses is a presumption.

463
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,760
In other words, all of the laws in all of the 50 states,

464
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:29,540
even the 48 lower, and even the Hawaii and Alaska are the same,

465
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,880
that property tax is only where you have a for-profit

466
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,120
property. I think I've discussed this before.

467
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,200
Non-profits are exempt from it.

468
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:43,520
Are you a non-profit in the house? In other words, are you making a profit where you're

469
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,340
eating, sleeping, screwing, working, or whatever?

470
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:51,760
Even if you're working, it's a private contract. No, it's not. It's none of their business.

471
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,200
Basically, you go to the county and you tell them

472
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,100
this is not for profit. They'll laugh at you.

473
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:02,040
You draw up a federal court case, because the feds like that kind of stuff.

474
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,500
You say, look, okay, you refuse me, so I'm going to

475
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:10,420
give you the case before I file it. What do you think? They're like, okay, let's go talk about it.

476
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,780
It gets real interesting when you want all the back taxes,

477
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:18,340
back treble damages, which means three times. That gets interesting.

478
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,360
That's a little harder to do. It has been done,

479
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:26,300
where someone had paid $30,000, $40,000 in taxes, and they want it all back

480
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:30,040
because once they admit that you're not part of it, then you

481
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:34,140
have a right to take the rest, because they admitted guilt, but you can go for treble damages.

482
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,700
Instead of $30,000, they're refunding you the $30,000.

483
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,040
It's $90,000 plus $30,000.

484
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:44,080
It gets kind of funky like that.

485
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:49,900
Also, you're considered a resident. A resident is temporary, like you're a resident

486
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,600
in a hospital, a prison, a hotel.

487
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:57,360
If someone says, I'm a resident here, where do you live? Where are you inhabiting?

488
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,100
Where are you from? Well, here.

489
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,440
You're a resident here, but you're also an inhabitant here. You're schizophrenic then.

490
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,880
I've seen the word tenant used.

491
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:13,700
Absolutely, because all of the other supporting presumptions lead to that.

492
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:17,220
When someone is fighting

493
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:21,060
a foreclosure, they say, well, this tenant doesn't want to pay their rent.

494
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,060
Why did I get in that situation?

495
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,500
Pretty interesting.

496
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,820
All the mortgages basically state that you own the house fee simple.

497
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:32,340
It's yours, and now you're putting it in a mortgage, dummy.

498
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:37,500
The easiest thing is, if you're the grantor, you can change the trust.

499
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,000
Fire the trustee, fire the mortgage company, and put your own people there.

500
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,580
Make your dog the trustee.

501
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,120
Anyway, it's simple.

502
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,840
All this stuff is very, very simple. In other words, the stuff that causes grief,

503
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:56,840
I used to do, it's very harsh, one day maybe we'll do it,

504
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,580
is how to fix the world in 30 days. It's not that hard to do.

505
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:05,060
You won't be allowed to do it, because it's like saying you're going to go to the gladiators

506
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:08,800
arena and turn it into a botanical garden. Everyone's going to fight you on that, right?

507
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:12,800
No pun intended, because its purpose is to be that.

508
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,960
But it can be fixed very easily in 30 days. You're going to lose

509
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,860
about a third of the population, maybe 40% of the population's got to go.

510
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:25,040
Build a hotel on the moon or whatever, put them on a big barge in the ocean,

511
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:28,440
sink it, I don't know, whatever. You get creative, but they can't stay here

512
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,700
once you do that. It's kind of like, imagine,

513
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:36,960
you remember from being back east, you had these buildings that were left for whatever

514
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,180
reason, and squatters took over. So you bought the building for a dollar on auction,

515
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,840
now you want to renovate it and improve the neighborhood, but the squatters are there.

516
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,580
What do you do? You've got to kick them out, right?

517
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,960
So it's the same with the earth. You have a whole bunch of people squatting here,

518
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:56,940
a lot of them, and they cannot handle a better society.

519
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,920
All of this is going to be done, by the way. It's going to be

520
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:04,420
done. I've discussed it in basic Greek speak.

521
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,860
We need to do a video when they start here for a beginner. I think we discussed

522
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:12,500
earlier, we don't have too many people here that are fairly new.

523
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,480
Some might be newer than others, but they do understand the premise of most of

524
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,060
the things we bring up. So what I brought up

525
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:24,699
tonight, which is important, which I have not really emphasized, is the

526
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:28,560
verbal and mental possession of something. Be careful what you

527
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,560
call yours, because the guys, even the guys at the

528
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,480
Nuremberg trials, even though the ones that were hung, they said, well,

529
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:40,699
we were just following orders, right? But they were still culpable.

530
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:43,040
They were still held responsible for it.

531
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:48,620
Well, right. Okay, so maybe it's not

532
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:52,340
about possession. See, I've always found possession to be a strange thing.

533
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:56,200
Yeah, because possession is a strange thing. What do you actually possess?

534
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:00,400
Virtually nothing. Outside of yourself.

535
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,880
It's not a strange thing. Possession is easy, but calling something

536
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,800
mine is different. Okay, here's possession. Here's how simple

537
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,560
See, it's kind of backwards. When you

538
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:16,780
you're in Walmart or you have a shopping cart pushing it around, you haven't put

539
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:20,520
anything there. Yeah, here comes somebody who wants to take it, right? What do you say?

540
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,700
Oh, this is mine. Don't you say that? Well, not really.

541
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:28,660
But what you're trying to say is I have possession of this

542
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:32,360
cart now for it to serve me during my shopping experience here.

543
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:36,800
Right, okay. And you just leave the cart when you're done. That is a really

544
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,760
good example because that's kind of like the experience that we're having here, right?

545
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:44,920
You're using everything, including the body. You're even using the spirit, by the way.

546
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,940
Which then leads to the big question

547
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:52,860
then if we're even using our mind and the spirit, which is attached to a network, what are

548
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:56,900
we really, right? Are we that individual? And I would suggest

549
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,980
we're not. I would suggest there's only a few groups. In other words

550
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:04,720
the human collective is made up of about 50 to 70, 100

551
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,500
tops, different spirit cores that break off and become

552
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:12,520
everyone else. This is another discussion

553
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:16,560
perhaps. But the shopping cart idea

554
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,540
or a rental car idea, you know, you're renting a car

555
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:24,420
for a day or two and it's parked somewhere

556
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:28,380
that it shouldn't be and whose car is this? You say it's mine. Well, it's not.

557
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:32,460
You're just renting it for the day, but at that time, because you have possession

558
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:36,340
of it, right? Right, because you have control of it. Right, but when it's

559
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:40,300
clearly someone else's stuff and they're offering it to you

560
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:44,020
as being yours, now you have a shift of liability.

561
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:48,320
Kind of like the Nuremberg trials. Well, you had a shift of liability there

562
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,380
when you rented the car though, didn't you? You did, but it's

563
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:56,140
still, no matter how much you say it's yours,

564
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:00,220
within a very brief, let's say, presentation of it being yours,

565
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:04,240
you're going to bring up that it's a rental. Yeah, of course. Where something like

566
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,480
a shopping cart, it's obvious that it's not yours.

567
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:12,220
Actually, it happened to me recently. I had it just in the aisle

568
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:16,200
and I walked away and someone went to grab it. How convenient, right? And I was like, wait,

569
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,960
wait, that's mine. I even used that terminology. Well, they know exactly.

570
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:23,860
Everything is very well known, right? I said, oh, okay.

571
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,080
You know, if you go to one of these large big box

572
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,120
stores and you want to get some sheets of plywood or something and you haven't loaded

573
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,000
it yet, you leave it alone for five minutes, someone else is going to get it, it's mine.

574
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,580
But it's a very temporary thing, but you're not living with it.

575
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:44,120
The thing is, these things that people live with, like MyBank

576
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,940
account, MyYahoo, I still see that. Where did I see that somewhere?

577
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:52,380
This is MyYahoo. They even had a branch of their browser system

578
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:55,000
called MyYahoo or MyAOL or something.

579
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,120
I think it's maybe MyGoogle Space or Workspace

580
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:03,160
or something, right? Sure. That's right. They're very interesting when they do that

581
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,900
because it's a spiritual

582
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:10,480
shifting of responsibility. So, in other words,

583
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,280
okay, so let's say some stuff goes down and

584
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:18,980
some bad things happen, ethically, morally, whatever, with Google.

585
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:23,060
But everything that is

586
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:26,940
a part of is part of something that people have taken as my whatever.

587
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,820
It makes it seem like they're part of it also and shared, you see.

588
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,500
And eventually they could lawyer their way out of it.

589
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:39,040
It's not that easy with a browser or something like that, but with a social responsibility

590
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:43,020
and a moral responsibility and in a spiritual or cosmic

591
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:46,340
level, it's very, very important and it's very closely watched.

592
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,380
It's just not common to reason that way. The same way when we say

593
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:55,120
years ago, I came here to Tucson. I went to a library.

594
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,740
The library here doesn't look anything like the ones back east. They're like new buildings.

595
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:03,220
They're in strip malls. When you go to a library back east, it's very grand

596
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,540
typically. So, anyway, I walk in

597
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:11,220
and I said, she goes, is the librarian or one of the clerks that's going to help you?

598
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,480
I said, well, this is my first time in this library. I'm new to Tucson.

599
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:19,340
She goes, oh, okay. Well, everything on this side is fiction and

600
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:23,460
everything here is fact and history. And I said, dear, it's all

601
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:27,340
fiction in here. This is a federal Marie Lebrun library, right? She goes, yeah.

602
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,820
I said, it's all fiction. And she kind of looked at me like,

603
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:35,560
what? So, it's

604
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:39,380
kind of like on that aspect. But on the cosmic aspect,

605
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,420
you know, on an earlier sonic, I spoke

606
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:47,220
on a cosmic law level.

607
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:50,440
When information is given to a group or an individual,

608
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:54,060
it doesn't matter if it's given to you as fact or fiction.

609
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,360
What's contained in that idea, whether it's a movie, a book, or a thought, an idea, an image,

610
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:03,160
is known to you. You see, that's why I say the elite

611
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,840
that run the world are the ones that created science fiction

612
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,880
in the 50s and 40s and 30s and the turn of the century.

613
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,940
Actually, who was the author of

614
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:17,880
20,000 Leagues Under the Sea? Jules Verne.

615
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,620
Well, he was kind of like fighting against the establishment

616
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:26,780
and making political commentaries because his books have been changed a lot.

617
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,900
But, yeah, things like that were funded

618
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,400
by the elite to put into mind

619
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,720
the world that these things, yes, of course,

620
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:42,480
they're fiction, ha, ha, ha, but to get these ideas into their heads, right?

621
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,320
And right now, with what people have been speaking on

622
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:49,800
retrospect since 9-11 is how much they're showing you in movies

623
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:53,540
or even The Simpsons, right? Oh, yeah, no, that's become very common.

624
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,880
This is the predictive, they call it predictive programming. Right.

625
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,880
That's cosmic law. They're using cosmic law.

626
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:04,400
The thing is, did you get the idea? Did you get the image? Did you get the script?

627
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:08,480
Did you get the idea? It doesn't matter if you call it fact or fiction.

628
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,040
You have it now, right, where it wasn't before.

629
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,440
That's how the cosmic aspect works. So when you transfer that over to calling something

630
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:20,100
like a bank account or a Facebook or something like that yours,

631
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:24,520
now you're taking whatever they're doing and sharing responsibility

632
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,180
in that cosmically.

633
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:32,280
Like when we brought up the gladiators earlier, right? I mean, as I said, automatically,

634
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,440
I said, well, look, everybody can picture that. Everybody knows what that is.

635
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,300
The majority of people have not witnessed

636
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,980
real gladiator events. You know what I'm saying?

637
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,900
You could say, okay, maybe you watched boxing or MMA or some crap,

638
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:50,080
but realistically, even though you know what that historical

639
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,260
paradigm means in one way or another. You might have a very basic understanding

640
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,920
of it, whatever. You know what a gladiator is. You know what an arena is

641
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,360
because these ideas have been imparted to you, but you never actually saw these things yourself.

642
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:06,520
Right. It doesn't matter. Well, football is very close to it, right?

643
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:10,320
Well, it's gladiatorial, but it's a team. Yeah, well, then again, the gladiatorial

644
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:14,220
They fought animals. They fought teams. Some of them, they had sea battles.

645
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,060
No, no, absolutely. They would fill water in their ranches.

646
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,020
Boats and ships.

647
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:26,500
The start here first is, what do cannibals, birthdays, and dolls have in common?

648
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:30,060
Since you're bringing up the gladiators, this is really hard to find.

649
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:33,780
If you could find it online, I've looked a long time ago on someone,

650
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,340
and I brought it up, but I couldn't find it.

651
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:42,220
The modern clown face with the very pale white skin,

652
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:46,080
distended eyebrows, distended red lips, that is a product

653
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:49,780
of when the victor gladiator, not in every fight,

654
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,820
but certain, let's say, groups of gladiators made it

655
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,860
a custom that when you would

656
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,540
remove the face of the defeated

657
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:03,540
and put it over yours. There's kind of a film

658
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:08,780
with Hannibal Lecter, was it Silence of the Lambs, where he breaks out of the jail

659
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:12,840
that way. He takes the face off of the security guard,

660
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:16,460
puts it on his face, and they think that it's the security guard all knifed up, right?

661
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,580
And he changed clothes. So the modern depiction of clown,

662
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:24,280
you see, if you were to put on someone's face, there's no bone structure. It's the bone structure

663
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:28,560
that makes you look like who you are, not the skin. When you wear the skin,

664
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:31,740
the lips flare out, and the eyes are nothing.

665
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:35,980
It's totally pale. There's no blood circulating through it. So what's interesting,

666
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,880
there's almost like a genetic memory or a detection

667
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:44,240
method in young children. Some young children, when they see a clown, they scream.

668
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,240
By detecting that, that is attached to that really

669
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,000
super morbid attachment. Now, I brought this up,

670
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,540
several people have questioned me on the source on this.

671
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,560
I got it from an old book a long time ago

672
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:02,120
when I was studying Flat Earth around 1986.

673
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:07,880
Well, see, the only thing I've seen in a book is... No image, just description.

674
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:11,660
Yeah. Well, the only thing I've seen in a book like this is

675
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:15,960
they say it's about the plague, and the way

676
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:19,780
that the faces would end up looking during the plague, right? Contorted, yeah.

677
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:23,740
The contortion would remove the shape of the face, and they would turn pale, obviously,

678
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,920
because they couldn't come around and collect the bodies quickly enough and all that.

679
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:31,060
So I've seen that in a book, but I've never seen anything about the body.

680
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:35,720
Well, this point was that the modern clown and the circus

681
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,980
acts went back and looked at what the gladiators did.

682
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:43,940
Because the modern clown face was made most popular by circuses.

683
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,980
So they were... In other words, this was speaking of how

684
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,400
running... It was a moral and ethical question

685
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:56,200
on how circuses do what they do, and they could creep in all this unethical

686
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:00,080
moral stuff, and people will enjoy it. Like the clown face, which was

687
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:04,000
a very short line. It just said, which was the victim's face

688
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,220
removed and worn in the arena by the victor. That's all it said.

689
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:11,620
It didn't get into detail. And I was like, oh my gosh, I could totally see it, right?

690
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:15,980
If you understand anatomy, right? Because your face looks like it does on a skull.

691
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:18,540
Once it's removed from the skull, it no longer looks like anything.

692
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:24,040
So I think I've also spoken basic Greek speak. Just because a line

693
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:28,020
or a verse is short doesn't mean that it's insignificant. If you were... If you fell off

694
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:31,640
of a cruise ship and you're drowning, you'll say, help, I'm perishing.

695
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:35,460
Help, I'm drowning. Well, what did he say? That was too short to be important.

696
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:40,200
No. Right, right, right. But you see what I mean? Some of the most poignant

697
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:44,080
things are in very short lines. But the gladiator,

698
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:47,540
I wanted to just harken back and just touch on what we spoke on the last time,

699
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:51,760
bringing up the most important part about the goddess religion in effect,

700
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:55,900
full effect right now. And right now, I mean, since the 1950s, which would put us

701
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:59,760
around 70 years or so. But the

702
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,760
entire milieu of the gods, there's so many, and there's so many hierarchies

703
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,280
and changing of guard in all this, that I would suggest that

704
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:12,240
the way that we are referenced, made in the image of, let's say,

705
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:16,280
it would be on what is dynamic. In other words, the loss of

706
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:20,420
dynamism of the gods is easy

707
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:23,780
to perceive if one just looks around. Like, I haven't seen anyone

708
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:28,280
that's a god walking around or anything. There's the concept of monism

709
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:32,340
which is like God is in everything, right? Yes. And I would see

710
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:35,620
that if... I've never found an ancient text that had anything that

711
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:40,020
leaned on monism. Any of the ancient texts

712
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,660
talked about God being in things. Never.

713
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:47,500
That's like a very abstract thought that I would

714
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:51,580
consider as that, just a thought. I wouldn't even bother researching it.

715
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:55,860
That's some basic eastern phrasing, you know, like the namaste

716
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:59,600
kind of thing. It's a hybrid. Actually, I found

717
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:03,780
when you study a lot of the eastern texts, they're actually more

718
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:07,260
hardcore, or just as hardcore as the western texts, let's say,

719
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:11,240
what have been adopted as the biblical texts. They're pretty hardcore.

720
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:14,920
Yeah, they are. Yeah, they're not that ethereal. So these are just hybrids

721
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:18,280
of the idea. What I wanted to

722
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:23,180
lean on was that you cannot discuss the gods without

723
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:26,920
getting into understanding the cosmic nature of how things work.

724
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,940
Just like the... what did you call it? Predictive programming?

725
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:35,160
Before there, I just wanted to throw something in because you made something occur to me

726
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:39,100
a couple of things, actually. First of all, Leatherface is another example

727
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:42,620
of that. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre deal with the expense of the victim,

728
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:47,160
which is pretty wild, and I'm very sure that a whole lot of people just remembered

729
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,320
exactly, yeah, that's right, Leatherface did that, too.

730
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:55,240
But, you know, there's another thing that happened, too, that you made me think

731
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:59,420
of, and maybe you can help me parse this out a little bit, and I'm sorry to go back over it again,

732
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:03,100
but I think all of it bears repeating. I was watching

733
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:06,960
a bit of a documentary piece on Jeffrey Dahmer,

734
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:11,080
right? And obviously, again, I'm sure everybody knows who that was.

735
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:14,840
If you don't, well, you know, quick search somewhere, you'll find it.

736
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,880
Anyway, he lived in an apartment building in Milwaukee, okay?

737
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:23,100
I'm not going to belabor this or go deep into it, I'm just... I have to lay these parts

738
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:27,140
out. He lived in an apartment building, he did horrible things, he cannibalized

739
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:30,980
people, this and that. Okay. And there's

740
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:34,880
a long story to it, you can discover it for yourself if you like,

741
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:38,740
but here's the thing. Once he was arrested and taken in and his crimes

742
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:42,880
were revealed, right? The people that also made their

743
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,960
homes in the same building. So this is back to, this is my building, this is

744
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,820
my block, this is my place. What's interesting is

745
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:55,140
even though he was gone, and the rest of his neighbors were not

746
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:58,960
you know, not nearly as evil as him, regardless of

747
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:02,760
whatever it is they were doing, none of them were eating other people. Or bad.

748
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,340
Bad, let's say, that word evil, yeah. Okay, they weren't as bad as him.

749
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:11,160
Their acts, the acts in their life probably did not compare

750
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:14,400
to the terrible nature of his. How's that?

751
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:18,300
Oh, that's fine, because evil is what happens when you do bad things.

752
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:22,980
Yeah, and he did plenty of bad things. I'm just being nitpicking, because

753
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:26,840
you know, these sonics are about, you know, threading fine needles, right?

754
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:30,660
No problem, nitpick away, because look, my language is sloppy.

755
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:34,940
I know this, so it's alright. I need to sharpen it, and I appreciate it.

756
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:38,800
But the thing is that, let me just get the point across that

757
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,760
he's gone, the events are over with, and

758
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:46,920
yet the people of that building would tell you that there was

759
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:50,880
just a terrible sort of way that people viewed that

760
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:54,140
place, that people viewed the people that lived there.

761
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:58,220
It was just a bad scene. They all had to leave.

762
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:02,060
They had to move, and eventually they had to tear the building down.

763
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:05,120
Not just because it was a morbid curiosity

764
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:10,100
you know, a tourist trap, but it was just a bad

765
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:14,100
place now, because there had been some

766
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:18,300
level, and they felt as though they were kind of attached to this

767
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:21,960
now, even though they were just the neighbors. They were just there.

768
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,560
They didn't participate in any of these terrible acts.

769
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:26,580
Sure, sure. It has a field. It's the emo.

770
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,900
So, yeah, I mean, help me out with this a little bit.

771
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:31,020
This has to do with what we just talked about, though.

772
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:34,280
Well, let's just say real simple, like, people that have

773
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:37,940
traveled through their lifetime. You ever go into a decent hotel, they give you a room,

774
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,220
and you're like, you walk into the room, it seems clean, just as clean as all the others,

775
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:46,200
and you're like, I'd like another room. And as you leave that

776
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:49,160
room that you were just offered, and you're walking down the hallway

777
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:52,520
to go to the desk and maybe ask for another room,

778
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:57,100
a couple starts walking your way, and you leave the door open, and they

779
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:00,200
walk in, and they're arguing, really like venomous argument,

780
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:04,260
and the woman says, maybe my ring is still in the room, and that was her, the room.

781
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:08,900
So that venomous, let's say, interchange or exchange

782
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,440
that they had was lingering in that room, you see.

783
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:16,220
And this is a direct example. This is something I've expressed, and now I know why

784
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,940
I didn't want that room. It has nothing to do with

785
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:24,320
By the way, I used to hang out with some people that would invite me to go up every weekend in Las Vegas

786
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:28,180
They were like high rollers and stuff, and they thought I was

787
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:32,140
good at conversation. I don't know where they ever get that idea, but I would

788
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:35,920
go with them. They'd comp me and go on a Friday night, come back Sunday afternoon.

789
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:40,040
And one of the guys, one of the brothers was a real stickler, by the way. He had one of these

790
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:43,020
UV lights, right? So we'd go into rooms like

791
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,280
the whale rooms in Bellagio

792
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,920
They're talking like $2,000 a night rooms

793
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:54,440
or on that floor. Huge beds,

794
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:59,000
big bathtubs in the place, the whole bit. Yeah, and he'd say

795
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,980
we want another room, and I'd say, why? And he brings out the UV light, and he says, he goes

796
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:07,200
the room is spotless, right? He brings out the UV light, and he goes right by the headboard

797
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,940
there's a lamp stand there, you see all that right there? I said, oh shit, yeah, what is that? He says, that's semen.

798
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:14,940
And he goes over here to the light, you see all that

799
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:18,800
right there? That's blood. You couldn't see it with the naked eye, but the UV shows it. He knew

800
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,160
the different colors. I was like, oh my gosh.

801
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:26,520
You can do that. People have gotten to know that over the years, but that was

802
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,700
something for many years. Yeah, under the

803
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:35,080
many rooms that may not carry UV light, you'll be surprised.

804
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,520
Also, there's a system, there's a light you could use to

805
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:42,560
all the rooms have cameras in them. This was admitted when they did that Vegas shooting a few

806
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:46,240
years back. When they didn't know who the guy was, they kept changing.

807
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,720
Just like recently, there was another shooting, and the person obviously changed their clothes

808
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,640
in the middle of the shooting, and all these false flags.

809
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:58,380
Anyway, what's his name? Damagard

810
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:02,540
is the guy to look for that. He's easy

811
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:06,560
to listen to. What's his first name, Damagard? He talks about all the false

812
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:10,240
shooting, false flags. Ole Damagard. Ole Damagard, yeah.

813
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:13,700
I'm not fully endorsing him. I have him as a contact on Skype.

814
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:18,320
He's too busy to get into the Greek-speak things. It's very interesting.

815
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:22,700
He does a lot of the

816
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,260
evidential stuff where he's just sifting through

817
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:30,560
all the things that they're showing the public. He doesn't have any backdoor

818
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:34,120
access to anything. He's just saying, look, they're showing right in front of you here.

819
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:37,640
It's the same traveling people that go from town to town all over the world.

820
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,280
Anyway, I don't know about what you think about his stuff

821
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:46,000
on JFK. He seems to be a little on the surface.

822
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,760
He leans very heavily on the political side.

823
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:54,260
Anyway, that's for Ocelli

824
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:57,140
effect stuff. Yeah, definitely.

825
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:02,240
I don't know all of his material, but

826
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:06,200
when it comes to evidence, if you're studying things that

827
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:10,080
are demonstrable, that's one thing. When you get into deep

828
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,500
opinions about that, it becomes something else.

829
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:18,180
Here's the thing, Joe. I never got into the JFK thing because I found it

830
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:21,300
to be very natural what they did there because

831
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:25,740
there was only one assassination that was not done by the quote-unquote

832
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:30,140
deep state. That was the one at the turn of the century that they blamed the Polish

833
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:33,940
anarchist on, but it was actually a Filipino. It's the one where they

834
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:37,420
put a gun in the cast. It looked like he had a broken arm.

835
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:41,620
That guy. The rest were all deep state type stuff.

836
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:46,160
Templar, Vatican, Jesuit, all stuff just to create

837
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,840
let people know that they're vulnerable because if we could hit your top guy

838
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:54,040
whatever. I would say also the two attempts on Ford were not

839
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:57,500
deep state. No, that's right. They were just

840
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:00,900
they were truly disturbed individuals in my mind.

841
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:05,420
Also, it could have been a toy. You know how there's a mafia and then there's toy mafia and they're more dangerous?

842
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:09,600
It could have been a toy organization and they're

843
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:13,660
really wild. It's really hard to talk about. Ford had two

844
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:17,440
attempts because he's known as the president who kept falling

845
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:21,540
down. He's two well-known attempts. By the way, he's the only one that we know of that had two

846
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:25,400
females attempt to assassinate him, which is kind of

847
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:29,800
interesting there. One of them being Squeaky Fromm and the other one being Sarah Jane Elmore.

848
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,260
That's interesting

849
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:37,160
but I don't believe for a second that that was deep state run. I think that was

850
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:38,860
actually organic.

851
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:45,380
Deep state, by the way, is the way that they're the same people that were involved behind Julius

852
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:49,340
Caesar. It's not this American thing of people. They're like

853
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:53,320
the Magi. When you read in the New Testament, the Magi came

854
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:57,280
to give tribute to the king of Israel

855
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:01,340
and they went to the king of Israel, let's say, and there's

856
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:04,400
a king born here and he's scared of them. In other words,

857
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,400
Herod's in his own palace and he's terrified of these Magi that came. Now, what kind

858
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:12,940
of power are they wielding? Imagine a king being afraid

859
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:17,420
of his guests. That means that he acknowledges that they are

860
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:20,220
more powerful than him. It goes back to that group also.

861
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:23,300
It's been around

862
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:27,820
since time immemorial. True enough, but back to this thing about the building

863
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:31,500
suddenly taking on this problem and these people now having

864
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:35,900
experiencing problems because they lived there and again had to move

865
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:39,500
away. All sorts of issues came out of that.

866
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,780
Where would you lean? What would be a reason

867
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:46,760
just so we could start on something there? What would you think the reason is?

868
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:50,780
Well, I'm thinking that when there are events that occur in a

869
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:53,700
space, okay, that there is

870
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:57,840
a sort of a residue that's left behind

871
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:02,040
from those events and when you have

872
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:06,940
traumatic events occur in a space, that space

873
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:10,460
retains that energy and

874
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:14,480
will continue to kind of vibrate with it

875
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,680
in a way. I know you don't like vibration, but it continues to have that vibe.

876
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:21,200
No, I don't like vibration. I don't like frequency. Frequency is breaking it down.

877
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:24,860
Either way, I like them both, but too much of one is not

878
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:29,420
discounting the other. I see what you're saying. Wilhelm Reich, here's an example of that.

879
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,760
When the hospital was torn down, he went there with

880
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:36,740
some very fine equipment that he manufactured

881
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:39,860
and he went where the x-ray room would have been

882
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:44,080
and he noticed there was a radiation disturbance in the area

883
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:47,960
where the x-ray room, the x-ray machine was. This is after the hospital

884
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:51,860
has been torn down and this is a mechanical thing. Right, so the x-ray machine

885
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:55,740
is long gone, the room is gone, the whole building is gone,

886
00:57:55,840 --> 00:58:00,020
but the space still. An area on the earth, a small

887
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:03,920
area on the earth. So the EMO work that I've been

888
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:07,640
speaking on, which I don't think we've ever gone into, that might require maybe a solo

889
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:11,720
because it gets really deep. I could speak fast, you could slow

890
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:15,740
it down kind of thing. I promised one on food

891
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:19,680
and one on the gods and now one on EMO, maybe solos, or maybe

892
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:23,300
we'll do them together in the near future.

893
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:27,780
They're very technical. In essence, I don't know how much

894
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:32,020
to say how important learning of what the purpose of something is.

895
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,600
You can be aware of something

896
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,960
existing, but you don't understand its purpose.

897
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,600
You have the black box in jet airliners, jet aircraft for example.

898
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:46,860
First of all, it's not a black box, it's painted orange.

899
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:51,400
It has what they consider high visibility

900
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:54,440
colors. It looks like red to me, it probably is orange.

901
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:58,260
Or high visibility, I've seen one that's yellow and black stripes.

902
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:03,460
So it has to have high visibility. Most people have heard of it, but they don't

903
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:06,860
understand the true purpose of it. It records

904
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:10,940
everything. It's basically an up-to-the-minute recording as best it can

905
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:13,180
and it's indelible, in other words, hard to damage.

906
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:18,400
Understanding the purpose sometimes

907
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:22,500
not only offers more meaning, but it adds how

908
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:27,240
you dimensionally can interact or is it something that you want to incorporate in your life

909
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:28,440
and learn how to use or not.

910
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:32,060
How would you say

911
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:36,200
the emo part is so important

912
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:40,160
because everyone understands that their emotions

913
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:44,360
or someone who's emotionless is actually just someone who is highly

914
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:47,800
controlled. Because if you're able to influence and project

915
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:52,240
thoughts or have desires, you have emotions, even if you're like

916
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:56,080
a Mr. Spock kind of person. So I would suggest that on the emo

917
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:59,400
I would call it imprinting.

918
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,160
In this case, the building had an imprint.

919
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:08,220
That makes sense, an imprint. I'm saying that a residue stays behind

920
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:11,000
but that doesn't make sense. You're right, it's more like an imprint.

921
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:15,700
Right, because the events happen from very strong

922
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:18,280
emotional projection. It wasn't an accident.

923
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:24,140
Usually when something is an accident, it was an accident, he stabbed her 36 times

924
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:28,180
it was accidental, right? Not like that, but usually when there's

925
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:31,700
an accident, places recover. But when there's a strong emotional

926
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,420
intent, you'll have an area known

927
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:38,420
to be haunted or whatever.

928
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,420
I have not experimented

929
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:47,600
most of the stuff that I discuss is either first-hand, second-hand or

930
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:52,320
through experimentation, right? I have not experimented

931
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:56,420
with ley lines, by the way. You know how you have positive and negative

932
01:00:56,420 --> 01:01:00,260
ley lines on the earth? If you sleep over two negative ley lines criss-cross

933
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:02,280
it could damage your body, right?

934
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:08,000
But what I'm suggesting is those ley lines can be created.

935
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:12,080
They're called, quote-unquote, holy spaces. These cathedrals

936
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:16,420
and temples and places were built over, they say, positive

937
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:19,680
ley lines. The information on this is very airy-fairy

938
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:23,740
and not really substantial, but how did these ley lines

939
01:01:23,740 --> 01:01:26,940
appear? I'm suggesting you can mitigate

940
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:31,200
a negative, let's say, energetic zone on the earth or

941
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:35,780
create a negative one, which you wouldn't want to do, but you want to mitigate a negative

942
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:39,460
one or make a positive one. That's what they call a sacred

943
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:43,200
space, right? Well, I know that you can, I know from

944
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:47,240
first-hand again that you can clear these things away. Yes.

945
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:51,380
And to me, it's more like you move them along. You don't really

946
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:55,460
like, oh, can you destroy this or banish? No, you don't destroy it or banish it.

947
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:59,200
You just sort of move it along so that it's not concentrated there.

948
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:00,880
It just sort of dissipates in the air.

949
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:07,140
What is the problem with poison air is when there's a concentration of a particular

950
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:11,120
thing in that air, right? If you make the

951
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:15,200
concentration next to nothing because you spread it out, it's tolerable.

952
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:19,460
It becomes tolerable. What is the acceptable level? What is the safe level?

953
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:22,720
Well, the thing about the emo work is

954
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:27,180
there's no tolerance. Well, the tolerances are that you

955
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:31,240
are going to accomplish this because once the emo is established, the emotional

956
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:35,300
level that you're looking for, that's it. It's either have it or

957
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:37,600
you don't. It's not like being a little pregnant.

958
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:43,180
It's kind of like

959
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:46,420
induction in the body, right? These things are

960
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:51,040
dimensionless. When I say dimensionless, meaning they have no width, length, or height,

961
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:55,200
or weight, or they're not measurable with the pressure

962
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:58,800
devices we have. There are ways like dowsing,

963
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:03,280
divining rods, which are an extension of the body. You can use those

964
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:07,060
for many, many aspects. That is a basic

965
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:10,980
tool. People say to you, Greek, have you ever worked with a pendulum?

966
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:14,960
I suggest not to work with a pendulum. There's many reasons why,

967
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:16,860
but I can't give one that's really solid.

968
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:22,880
Dowsing rods, the witching wands or whatever, the two sticks,

969
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:27,040
they go apart or they come together. That is an extension

970
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:31,140
of your energetic field reacting with other energetic fields.

971
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,700
For example, when I build devices

972
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:38,800
that are for water or conducting electricity,

973
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:42,960
you know when you pack battery

974
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:46,800
cells in a flashlight, you have to go a certain way, right? Positive, negative, positive, negative,

975
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:50,820
positive, negative, right? If you don't put them in the right way, you turn it on

976
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:54,560
and try to hit the switch, nothing works because the polarities are messed up.

977
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:58,660
If I'm building something that's going to conduct electricity or

978
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:02,700
run water through it and it has multiple components, I usually dows

979
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:06,800
them for which is the positive side and which is the negative side, as long as there's no

980
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:10,380
terminal that has to be, like if I have

981
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:15,020
I'm building something as a positive and a negative terminal and the two terminals

982
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:18,840
are blank or neutral right now because they haven't been installed correspondingly,

983
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:22,900
I'll ask which one should be the positive and which one should be the negative.

984
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:26,600
You know, obviously these are all positive, yeah, they're very much positive and these are very negative,

985
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:31,020
and then I mark them accordingly. So when you make things with that kind of

986
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:34,900
subtle energy taken into consideration, it takes it to the next

987
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:37,800
level and you're actually making that object a sacred object, you see.

988
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:41,900
So that's just a very rudimentary way to start off

989
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:47,180
on that. But again, I started off, we started off, I should say

990
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:51,100
very much leaning on the concept of be careful of what you

991
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:54,820
take possession of in your mind. Early on we were saying

992
01:04:54,820 --> 01:04:58,960
it's not really possession because you can have possession of a shopping cart and

993
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,100
call it yours, but there are things that linger

994
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:05,200
amongst your life that

995
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:09,000
people are taking possession of in their mind

996
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,940
before they even take possession of, like we were mentioning the MyFacebook

997
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:16,880
account, right, well how do you take possession of that? It's just as elusive

998
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:20,960
as a bank account, there's nothing there, right? It's just digital

999
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:25,100
it's just, that's really a sense of emo, it just appears on a screen and it goes

1000
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:29,300
away. So the other thing is the name. Sometimes

1001
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:33,380
instead of asking, if I ask someone, what's your name?

1002
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:36,540
And they say, huh? I say, well what sound do you answer to?

1003
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:41,120
Really what it is, right? There's a couple of people

1004
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:45,460
Batman, not Batman the comic, but there's a guy on TalkShoe

1005
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:49,340
Batman always talks about the name, everything's about the name, right?

1006
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:51,920
You're just using it, right? That's an interesting

1007
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:57,560
and again it's actually on a high spiritual level to realize

1008
01:05:57,560 --> 01:06:01,360
you're just using everything and taking possession is fine

1009
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:05,100
it's just calling it yours in a spiritual cosmic sense

1010
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:09,640
now you're sharing in the liability of the deeds of those that really

1011
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:13,260
created it. So when you look at, for example, again

1012
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:17,340
speaking on the gods, whatever doctrines you see out in the world

1013
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:20,500
religions and things to believe in and what to believe in

1014
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:25,640
you'll find are diametrically opposed to what's written in the text for example

1015
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:29,360
and I mean this wholeheartedly with everything

1016
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:33,820
whether it's medical, religious, legal or anything, it's very much opposed

1017
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:37,180
so for example if you look at Christianity

1018
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:41,320
or the legal system or Judaism or Islam and Muslims

1019
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:45,420
and Hindus or any Buddhists or whatever, if you study

1020
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:49,080
the text and you go see what the supposedly

1021
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:53,720
each corresponding religion that supposedly came from that text is saying and doing

1022
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:57,160
you'll find that they're not doing anything that's in the text

1023
01:06:57,160 --> 01:07:00,540
pretty much accurately saying it, nothing at all

1024
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:05,760
directly or even may resemble it, but resemblance is not

1025
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:09,720
actual, right? Right, it resembles, it's not

1026
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:13,400
the thing. It's not the thing. So how did it get off

1027
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:17,700
the mark? Because if you ask them, say well you're not doing or know anything

1028
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:20,000
that's in here, say well that's how the church does it

1029
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,880
that's how, so somehow the temple

1030
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:27,420
or the imam or the guru or whatever, so somehow there's a point

1031
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:31,540
where, forget about saying they're not doing anything

1032
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:35,380
that's in the text that they subscribe to, forget about that for a moment

1033
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:40,140
how did these other things develop? Someone developed them as a twisted

1034
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:43,920
corrupted whatever and as an

1035
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:47,720
excuse. Well they're not random, look they're not random as if they were

1036
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:51,200
mistakes. Created by someone. Yeah, they're not random as if they were mistakes, right?

1037
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:54,740
You could say well look, that's just a mistake, that's a misreading

1038
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:59,440
okay, but no, because what it becomes is something

1039
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:02,620
that does still have an order to it. It's not like it's

1040
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:07,740
all of a sudden we find that, oh we missed this one guy

1041
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:11,800
in the text named Ronald. No, we didn't miss a guy

1042
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,860
in the text, we've added something here.

1043
01:08:14,780 --> 01:08:18,120
You said Ronald, by the way, there was one of the art

1044
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:21,200
galleries a few years ago, I put a Ronald McDonald on a crucifix

1045
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:25,140
I thought that was great. I would have found that humorous

1046
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:30,140
Yeah, great in terms of how else can we make fun of this stuff

1047
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:33,960
but here's the take away

1048
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:38,040
is when you become a member of that group and profess your belief

1049
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:41,740
or whatever in it, you're taking liability now and sharing the culpability

1050
01:08:41,740 --> 01:08:44,260
and liability of those that created that falsehood.

1051
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:49,760
When you say something is yours and also you're selecting

1052
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:53,840
this as part of your identity, these are both parts of now

1053
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:57,380
taking liability, right? Because if you say

1054
01:08:57,380 --> 01:09:01,720
you're a Christian, okay, doesn't that mean that

1055
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:05,640
you're now saying look, I'm in with this group, I'm partially

1056
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:09,800
liable for what this group does, right? No, you're liable for

1057
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:13,700
what you do, but generally speaking, but there's a

1058
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:17,779
certain percentage of the quote-unquote judgment that will come

1059
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:19,960
upon you just by subscribing to that group.

1060
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:24,840
So in other words, let's say the group itself

1061
01:09:25,420 --> 01:09:29,520
Well, there's liability, but the thing is the group itself, everyone is viewed

1062
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:33,680
individually, but the group, those that are in a particular group

1063
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:36,960
that group is creating a deficit or

1064
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:41,000
a negative that is going to be rooted out

1065
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,340
and you're going to have to share part of that rooting out, you know?

1066
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:48,380
So here's the interesting thing is when the

1067
01:09:48,899 --> 01:09:52,899
mop-up crew is very selective, by the way, when this earth

1068
01:09:52,899 --> 01:09:56,960
is cleaned up, they're very selective. You could be amongst a crowd of people

1069
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:01,160
and they'll all be slaughtered dead and you'll be standing in the middle like what the hell just happened, right?

1070
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:04,960
It's not like a bomb that goes off, it's

1071
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:08,480
indiscriminate, which just depends on how far you are in the radius, right?

1072
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:13,000
It's not like that at all. So what you see

1073
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,300
going on in the world is the constant fear

1074
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:20,680
that they put in, ignorance in the world. They know that the

1075
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:24,680
elite know that, you know, when I say the elite, it's the religions really

1076
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:28,200
and governments and banking and all the other stuff that's going on

1077
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:32,640
They know that their time is limited. They've known it for a long time.

1078
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:36,260
And they want to suck down just because as many people as they can with them

1079
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:39,000
and that's why the mainstream is the mainstream, so crappy.

1080
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:44,820
So the idea of detaching, you know, for example

1081
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:48,680
myself as a young child, before my even teen years, I knew

1082
01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:52,340
I was also exposed to people of wisdom

1083
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:56,500
but everything that they're telling you is opposite, it's backwards or it's corrupted

1084
01:10:56,500 --> 01:11:00,580
don't trust it, but in a healthy way, right? Because we're known

1085
01:11:00,580 --> 01:11:03,620
to be very naive and very difficult to deal with, humans are.

1086
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:07,380
One commonly spoken of thing in law

1087
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:10,660
or in legal terms even, both

1088
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:15,520
seems to be correct still, which is that

1089
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:20,180
ignorance of the law doesn't remove you from liability

1090
01:11:20,180 --> 01:11:23,880
I mean, is that not true?

1091
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:28,640
Well, in biblical, let's say it's not true

1092
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:32,980
because if you don't know you did anything wrong, you're not held accountable for it

1093
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:36,500
you know, the group for keeping

1094
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:40,280
if the group knows you're doing it and you don't know it's wrong

1095
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:44,220
then the entire group gets in trouble. It's kind of like in the military

1096
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:48,520
where if PT, physical training, if one guy can't do the push-ups

1097
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:52,220
and they give him a couple of tries and if he chances to improve

1098
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:55,580
and if he doesn't, they make the PT the whole group, right? That's punishment

1099
01:11:55,580 --> 01:11:58,980
where if one guy goes off, they punish the whole rest of the group

1100
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:03,520
actually, if you read in Sefer HaYikra, which is Hebrew for the scroll

1101
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:07,580
of Leviticus, it says that if you see your brother

1102
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:11,740
transgressing the law, I'm paraphrasing here, and he doesn't know that he's

1103
01:12:11,740 --> 01:12:15,960
doing transgression, if you go to him and tell him

1104
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:18,460
that he's transgressing, now he's responsible

1105
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:20,420
you see?

1106
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:23,500
The legal

1107
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:27,140
aspect is just a rotten group of people

1108
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:32,400
I think Jordan Maxwell said this once

1109
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:35,940
he says that the criminal attorneys, they call themselves right

1110
01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:37,940
yeah, they do

1111
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:44,040
if you look at most misery

1112
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:47,620
that's put on by political government, like the genocides

1113
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:51,480
starvations, all that came out from the legal community

1114
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:54,980
every genocide was legal, it was approved by the legal

1115
01:12:54,980 --> 01:12:59,320
the attorneys, not the lawyers, lawyers are different

1116
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:00,380
there are no more lawyers

1117
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:05,880
if you ever watch any old 1930s films

1118
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:11,240
a prison scene, there's always a lawyer and a doc

1119
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:13,620
a doctor in jail, you remember that?

1120
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:17,560
because after the bankruptcy

1121
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:21,520
they put together the American Medical Association and anyone who was practicing

1122
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:25,440
medicine in an ethical way was arrested, because you can only do

1123
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:29,560
allopathic, you can only treat symptoms, so those that didn't want to

1124
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:32,960
go along with the modern, I'm not going to say, most people say FDA

1125
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:37,720
but FDA didn't come around until Nixon, but the early American Medical Associations

1126
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:40,920
in the 30s that came with the bankruptcy that were put in by the bankers

1127
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:44,840
the same with the legal system, any lawyer that found that

1128
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:48,520
what was going on was incorrect, they put them in jail

1129
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:52,740
they put the doctors in jail, as an example, they put a lot of them in jail

1130
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:57,080
the ones that wanted to just keep doing what they're doing and not buck the system

1131
01:13:57,080 --> 01:14:00,400
got the message, but you'll see that in old films, I was always wondering

1132
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:03,040
why is there always a doc in prison? hey doc, you know

1133
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,440
once you understand the bankruptcy, you start to see what was going on

1134
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:11,640
and that was a big earmark, by the way, for, you know, you can do

1135
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:16,280
an early, Ocelli in the Greek have always said, humanity's gotten to the point now

1136
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:19,720
meaning since the 50s, you can do anything to them, anything at all

1137
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:28,020
so, yeah, I think, I don't know how much more

1138
01:14:28,020 --> 01:14:32,200
to emphasize, be careful about, again, what you call

1139
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:36,040
mine, mine and yours and this and that, instead of the, just neuter it

1140
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:40,400
make it a thing, what's more important

1141
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:44,080
than that, because it's like a detox or cleaning up your language, your life

1142
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:48,740
your perspective will change, I assure you, once you start

1143
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:52,460
putting things in an objective or neuter perspective

1144
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:55,900
let's say, neutered, you will see also

1145
01:14:56,420 --> 01:15:00,460
the spiritual level that other people are operating on, when they start

1146
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:04,100
what they're calling mine, constantly, it's very, very important

1147
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:08,500
it ties in directly to the gods, also, the way they view

1148
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:12,080
because their whole thing is about objectifying
