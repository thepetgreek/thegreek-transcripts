1
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:13,480
Rated Y, Sonic Event 1.1.0, and here it is, how are you doing, Greg?

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,900
Hey, I'm doing, yeah, I figured we'd get personal or less personal.

3
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,920
Everything's working on the Sonic side now, it seems like.

4
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,380
Yeah, I just want to say I got some good feedback about speaking on the money system again,

5
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,880
and again and again and again, and did I say again?

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,460
You did.

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:37,140
I'm kind of naive thinking that I can just say things once or twice and people kind of get it,

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,000
but it doesn't really work that way, and one of the things I brought up,

9
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,540
even people that I know very well, I watch them and sometimes I say,

10
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,200
this can't really be happening, right?

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:52,640
This isn't real, and kind of puts that whole simulation thing that we're not in a real world,

12
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,840
more and more real, right, no pun intended.

13
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,240
By the way, there's a guy out there, Golan, I think his last name is,

14
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:06,680
and talks about on a good DMT trip, people with a laser, if you can diffract the laser,

15
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,280
in that diffraction pattern, you start seeing code, and it's objective.

16
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,840
In other words, multiple people see the same thing, so it's not personal, right?

17
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,280
Right.

18
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,500
And DMT is very different than LSD, by the way.

19
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:27,300
In other words, when you get high, drunk, or whatever, or even LSD,

20
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:33,040
which is most people, it's been overdone, but LSD, by the way, it's very speedy, right?

21
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:40,620
It's like drinking and getting high on pot, and speed is a very close analogy to what LSD is like,

22
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,080
but then it becomes psychotropic big time.

23
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,820
What those kinds of psychotropics do is it changes your perception.

24
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,400
What's interesting about DMT is it doesn't change your perception.

25
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,320
You're still pretty sober, but your environment changes.

26
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,340
Everything around you starts to change.

27
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,460
That's the trippy thing about DMT, which is synthesized stuff that's in mushrooms.

28
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,280
But anyway, he says that basically if you do this experiment, set this up a certain way,

29
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:09,160
you will see code like in the screens in the movie The Matrix running through the diffraction.

30
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,000
Okay, the reason I got into this just now, and actually I looked up some of his work,

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,660
I don't really trust the guy's stuff.

32
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,380
I definitely don't endorse him.

33
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:24,820
But anyway, it's because it can be objective that we're not in a real –

34
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:31,540
it's very difficult to be in a movie and say you're in a movie to those watching the movie, right?

35
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,180
They've tried it many times where cartoon characters jump out of the anime into the studio, right?

36
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,580
It's kind of cute.

37
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:46,900
I believe that the state that nothing is real is maybe a little bit of an overstatement.

38
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,340
It's a Beatles lyric after all.

39
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,220
Nothing is real, right?

40
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:58,620
Yeah, but most of the things that I see and experience through people should not be happening by any measure, by any measure.

41
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,080
Okay.

42
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,260
So that's where you have to kick back.

43
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,960
Like I said earlier, no one can make you happy.

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,900
No one can make you sad.

45
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,660
It's how you process what you see and feel and all that, right?

46
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,600
Which is what you see in different cultures, right?

47
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:17,820
So something that's acceptable in one culture will seem draconian, limited or dictatorial

48
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,540
and not accepted in another culture.

49
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,680
It's what culture you're raised in.

50
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,960
But this goes beyond culture.

51
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,300
This is more personal, personal when you're discussing things with people.

52
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:34,160
But anyway, I'm naive thinking that you do something called Greek speak and just share what you have found out as facts.

53
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,580
By the way, as I'm getting more mature, I'm starting to discern the difference between facts and the truth.

54
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,320
I would like to limit the truth to being your personal experience, right?

55
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:42,980
Okay.

56
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,740
And the fact being something that can literally be checked on.

57
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,680
Like fact checkers only came around when more truth started getting out, right?

58
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,120
You get it?

59
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,720
There's a certain level to that.

60
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,020
Here's a little term.

61
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,660
I kind of modified it.

62
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,500
Conspiracy theorists are negative.

63
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:04,260
Let me slow you down for a second because this is an important point and I want to ask a question here.

64
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:10,940
What you're saying is, though, that you could have an experience and you're certain of said experience, right?

65
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,160
But that's not a fact.

66
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,320
That would be the truth.

67
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,019
That is the truth.

68
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,040
And a fact if it's applicable to who you're communicating.

69
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:31,320
If you can view structure of good communication, if you're bringing up something new in communication, you should always preface, inform, and then discuss.

70
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:36,100
You can't go right into a discussion on something that is not – someone is not aware of.

71
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:41,080
So if I describe to you an experience which is incredible, nearly unbelievable, right?

72
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,060
But I swear to you, look, I experienced this thing that is unbelievable.

73
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,060
Okay.

74
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,600
Now hold on.

75
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,540
This is where you get into the jurisprudence of it.

76
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:49,820
Okay.

77
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:58,160
If you are the only one, then it might be considered as testimony, subjective, maybe hearsay or taken as your testimony.

78
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,380
But if you have witnesses that can collaborate the same thing, now it becomes more of a fact.

79
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,640
That's why I brought up the judicial side of it.

80
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:06,900
Okay.

81
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,240
So with corroboration, my –

82
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,460
It's a fact.

83
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,740
Incredible experience becomes more credible because I have corroboration.

84
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:16,760
Right.

85
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,580
Here's an example.

86
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,060
Someone came selling solar to me the other day and he said, you're not one of these end-of-the-worlders.

87
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,980
I said, no, no, no.

88
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,060
He talked about nukes.

89
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:26,980
I said nukes don't work.

90
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,820
Otherwise, they would have used them.

91
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,580
I brought up 9-11.

92
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,460
It was airplanes, right?

93
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,620
So I said, well, it was airplanes for those people who watched it on TV.

94
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,820
But if you were on the ground, you saw the sides of the buildings explode.

95
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,260
So is it true that there were airplanes?

96
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:43,680
No.

97
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,280
And how is that backed up?

98
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:52,000
Because a lot of times you have authorities that back up what is the truth and tell people what is the truth or not.

99
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,680
And I mentioned this and I brought up facts and truth with him.

100
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,940
This is important because this is cultural again.

101
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,140
What's the authority, right?

102
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,000
It could be religious, political, whatever, right?

103
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:01,500
Okay.

104
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,320
All right.

105
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:11,660
So I said I dare you to find any government document, official document in any agency that says there were airplanes that crashed into the buildings on 9-11.

106
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,480
You won't.

107
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:20,400
What you will see written in government documents on that day, on September, the terrorist events of September 11th, 2001.

108
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,000
You'll never say you would never.

109
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:26,440
So you'll never find anything that's memorialized in any government official paper.

110
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,940
It says there were airplanes in the buildings.

111
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:28,360
Never.

112
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,760
They will mention the terrorist events on that fateful day, blah, blah, blah, right?

113
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,760
On and on and on.

114
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,920
I'm telling you, try this out.

115
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,800
You won't find it because.

116
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:39,280
Right.

117
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,700
So now the authority holds no mention of airplanes.

118
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,440
The only place the airplanes were shown is on television.

119
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,380
The only place.

120
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,220
Right.

121
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,860
So and by the way, I have a direct witness, a guy named I'll give his name.

122
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,840
He's in the Carpenters Union.

123
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:53,980
His name is William Gonzalez.

124
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,140
And he was walking across the Brooklyn Bridge.

125
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:03,360
And when you get Brooklyn Bridges on a diagonal, when you get past the middle tower, the second tower, you get a clear shot of the World Trade Center.

126
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,900
And he saw a C-130 really low.

127
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,300
He says, wow, C-130 on the East River so low flying.

128
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,540
And suddenly he says, just I'm going to look at the buildings.

129
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,040
This is when the first one hit.

130
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,400
And he just saw the side of the building explode.

131
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:15,980
No airplane.

132
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,420
Nothing.

133
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:16,760
Right.

134
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,980
And he hung around and watched it.

135
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,200
And then he saw the other the other building explode.

136
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:22,800
No airplane.

137
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,160
Nothing.

138
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:23,480
Right.

139
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,540
So when I heard this, I kind of, you know, whatever.

140
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,920
And then I started piecing it all together.

141
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,160
OK, so here's the thing.

142
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,520
9-11 is always a good example.

143
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,340
Is it true that airplanes hit the building?

144
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:40,000
The only source we have for that is the television.

145
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:41,620
For that.

146
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:46,780
Then we have the people on the ground where their source is collaborating testimony.

147
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:50,360
Everyone says except the ones that were hired to say otherwise.

148
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:51,740
Right.

149
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:57,480
So this gets very sticky and messy so that neither one is a truth and neither one is a fact.

150
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,700
Because now we have this thing called a television.

151
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,640
Right.

152
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,800
So now the television creates a whole world.

153
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:11,520
Where you can have facts and truths that only apply to television.

154
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,700
How many times have you heard you speak recently as seen on TV people?

155
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:15,540
Right.

156
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:20,860
Now, what do you make of the two brothers who were filming the documentary on the latter company?

157
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:27,040
That, you know, we're doing the documentary and captured easy what they claim to be the first plane.

158
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,140
That's easy.

159
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,280
That wasn't OK.

160
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,720
That was not a live stream.

161
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,320
That was a film that they had in a can and then played back.

162
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,460
Well, it was it was what they said they recorded that morning.

163
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,280
But it was recorded.

164
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:38,560
Right.

165
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,580
But it wasn't live stream.

166
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,700
It was not being broadcast.

167
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,200
Right.

168
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,880
Because the broadcast live streams did not show airplanes.

169
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:51,240
There were several stations, especially one in a helicopter that has the background of New Jersey in the background.

170
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:51,760
Right.

171
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,160
Where the ones that show the airplane, there is no background in New Jersey.

172
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,080
It's been whited out.

173
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,200
That's been proven several times already.

174
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:08,200
And also there's three missing frames when they switch from the Jersey background into the New Jersey background.

175
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,640
In between that switch is three black frames, which would each be about a 16th of a second.

176
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,200
Right.

177
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,220
And then they switch to no Jersey background, white haze.

178
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,980
And then you see the airplane come in on the TV.

179
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,160
OK.

180
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,620
Are you familiar with that?

181
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,380
It's been analyzed.

182
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,660
I have not have not looked at that in that.

183
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,240
Oh, yeah.

184
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,080
That's cool.

185
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,640
And the three black frames are typical on a poor edit.

186
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,420
Not a good edit.

187
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,000
OK.

188
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,240
On a poor editing software.

189
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:33,760
You know.

190
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,440
All right.

191
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,540
I have.

192
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:35,740
Yeah.

193
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,900
So what I'm saying is, is there's another.

194
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,320
OK.

195
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,200
Let me give you an example.

196
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,960
Like if you live in the country with off the grid, let's say.

197
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:43,200
Right.

198
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,180
Just to be more specific.

199
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,320
And you live in a city.

200
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,860
Your realities are way different.

201
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,760
If you want milk, you ask the children that's raised in the city.

202
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,560
Where do you get milk?

203
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,940
Where do they say from the store?

204
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,760
That's where you get milk.

205
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:53,960
Right.

206
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,220
Of course.

207
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,300
As someone who was raised in the country.

208
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:56,880
Where do you.

209
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,120
You know, where do you get milk?

210
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:58,980
They're going to say, well, what do you mean?

211
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,360
Goat milk, sheep milk, cow milk.

212
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:00,860
Right.

213
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:01,180
Right.

214
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,360
Right.

215
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,820
From the cow animal.

216
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,120
Right.

217
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:04,480
Right.

218
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,020
So the.

219
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,360
So are they both right?

220
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,020
They are both right.

221
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:14,000
And years and years ago in the suburbs, somebody might have said the milkman brings it.

222
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:14,720
OK.

223
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,920
Now, piece this all together.

224
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,420
Tell me this is a real world.

225
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,120
It's not.

226
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,640
Just like I said earlier, no one can make you feel good or.

227
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,700
Well, that's not true.

228
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,980
I've met some chicks that made me feel real good back in the day.

229
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:30,440
But anyway, there's plenty of ways people have talents to make you feel good.

230
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,020
Yeah.

231
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:31,460
Yeah.

232
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,300
One wet lady.

233
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:41,420
But anyway, if you go back and look at things that upset you, things that made you happy,

234
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,160
it's you, not them that did that.

235
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,260
You've allowed.

236
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:50,680
Because, for example, you could look at someone standing in a drill line and in boot camp

237
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,560
and the sergeant comes right up to their face and yells at them, whatever.

238
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,000
Some pretty harsh stuff.

239
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:55,200
Right.

240
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,680
They just stand there as stoic as possible because they know that's what they have to

241
00:10:59,680 --> 00:10:59,880
do.

242
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,380
And they pass pass it over.

243
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:05,940
Now, if you go up to someone in the street that, you know, is unfamiliar and is a little

244
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,020
edgy and you do that, you probably get punched in the face.

245
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:08,780
Probably.

246
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:09,260
Yeah.

247
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,260
So it's how you process what's happening, that either you end up leaving the situation

248
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:19,000
or actively experiencing situation as a good situation or a bad situation.

249
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:19,360
Right.

250
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,520
So a good portion of this is expectation.

251
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,040
What you expect to have come at you.

252
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:24,900
Sometimes.

253
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,200
But even expectations, it's how you process it in real time as it's happening.

254
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,120
More than that.

255
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:31,580
OK.

256
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,060
Right.

257
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,620
For example, I've seen people I've been in situations where there's a trauma.

258
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,360
Someone gets injured and everyone standing around is looking.

259
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,960
And I'm like, you grab this.

260
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,800
You did that.

261
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,040
You pick up his leg.

262
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:44,780
You hold that.

263
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,160
I'm like.

264
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,840
And one time there was a trauma situation.

265
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,480
And I said, I'm going to be like everybody else.

266
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,600
And everyone just stood around and just commented.

267
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,520
I said, what a bunch of fucking assholes.

268
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,620
Well, that's why we have this phenomenon today where people are filming stuff instead of doing

269
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,100
something.

270
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:58,740
Right.

271
00:11:59,020 --> 00:11:59,380
Right.

272
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,140
But I'm talking about before they were.

273
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,920
I'm talking about the 90s and early 2000s.

274
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,020
I've been witnessing this.

275
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,880
And why is it I'm the one that has to step in and direct people?

276
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:13,480
Well, you know, because here's the thing, you know, that a lot of new agers say you chose

277
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:13,780
this.

278
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,800
You came here to have this type of experience.

279
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:16,240
Right.

280
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,800
Well, I better make a note to self.

281
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,280
Don't ever pick anything like that.

282
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,060
That was a really bad decision.

283
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:21,480
OK.

284
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,820
No, I'm like I said many times, if I meet who sent me here, they're going to get kicked

285
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,900
in the nuts or they're going to have one swollen labia.

286
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,740
No, I've said the same thing to these people where they go, well, you chose that.

287
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,740
I go, well, really?

288
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,740
Well, you know, yeah.

289
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,580
Prove it.

290
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:32,780
Right.

291
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,200
Is that the truth or is that a fact?

292
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:34,520
Yeah.

293
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:34,880
Please.

294
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:40,220
You know, that's look, I've made bad decisions before, but this is a really bad decision

295
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:40,760
to come here.

296
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,840
And note to self.

297
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,560
I'm not coming back here.

298
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:44,060
Yeah.

299
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,600
No, just absolutely not.

300
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:45,880
Yeah.

301
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,220
Yeah.

302
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,600
And if it's, you know, whatever.

303
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,540
So anyway, let's go back to the moment at hand that we started with.

304
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,520
I got some good feedback from some people who were very excited that they went back and

305
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,900
listened to what we talked about, the money system twice.

306
00:12:59,280 --> 00:12:59,380
Right.

307
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:03,960
And with that said, I'm going to have I sent you a link to YouTube.

308
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,460
It's one minute, 42 seconds.

309
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,720
And it's some guy that he's supposedly the head economic advisor for the current administration.

310
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,080
And there's an interview.

311
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,140
Or would you play that?

312
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,540
It's one minute and 42 seconds.

313
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,900
And I'll just do some brief comments and the significance of this.

314
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:19,460
You got it.

315
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,500
So you'll comment at the end.

316
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:20,740
Yeah.

317
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,300
Yeah.

318
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:21,620
Yeah.

319
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,440
The US government can't go bankrupt because we can print our own money.

320
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,740
It obviously begs the question, why exactly are we borrowing in a currency that we print

321
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,080
ourselves?

322
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:39,320
I'm waiting for someone to stand up and say, why don't we borrow our own currency in the

323
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:39,980
first place?

324
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,920
Like you said, they print the dollar.

325
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,420
So why?

326
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,520
Why does the government even borrow?

327
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:57,900
Well, the so the I mean, again, some of this stuff gets some of the language that the some

328
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,860
of the language and concepts are just confusing.

329
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,640
I mean, the government definitely prints money and it definitely lends that money, which

330
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,000
is why the government definitely prints money.

331
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:11,080
And then it lends that money by by selling bonds.

332
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,400
Is that what they do?

333
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:19,560
They they they yeah, they they they sell bonds.

334
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,720
Yeah, they sell bonds.

335
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,160
Right.

336
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,740
Since they sell bonds and people buy the bonds and lend them the money.

337
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,200
Yeah.

338
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:30,420
So a lot of times, a lot of times, at least to my ear with with MMT, the language and

339
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,100
the concepts can be kind of unnecessarily confusing.

340
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:38,700
But there is no question that the government prints money and then it uses that money to

341
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,500
So, yeah, I guess I'm just I don't I can't really talk.

342
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,680
I don't I don't get it.

343
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:54,780
I don't know what they're talking about, like because it's like the government clearly prints

344
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,100
money.

345
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,740
It does it all the time and it clearly borrows.

346
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,460
Otherwise you wouldn't be having this debt and deficit conversation.

347
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,320
So I don't think there's anything confusing there.

348
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:04,860
OK.

349
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:05,480
That's the.

350
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,380
All right.

351
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:06,960
OK.

352
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:07,240
Yeah.

353
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:07,520
Good.

354
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,320
OK.

355
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,980
That's Jared Bernstein.

356
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:19,100
Bernstein or Bernstein, however, it's J.A.R.E.D Bernstein, B.E.R.N.S.T.E.I.N.

357
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,380
Anyway, he's the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers.

358
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:28,180
Now, first of all, the woman that was there, the female voice is as dumb as can as they

359
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,800
come because she says, why can't we borrow our own money?

360
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,160
Right.

361
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,860
There's a maximum law that you cannot lend money and borrow money to yourself.

362
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,680
It's impossible.

363
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:37,940
Right.

364
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,720
So I have a dollar in my left pocket.

365
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,060
I'm going to lend it to myself by putting it in my right pocket.

366
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,680
It's not possible.

367
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,020
Right.

368
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:45,520
Right.

369
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,040
So the woman is an idiot.

370
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,120
Category certification.

371
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,380
I'll write the certification that she's a moron.

372
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,280
Now this guy is very interesting.

373
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,800
What he said.

374
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,020
Now he's an idiot as well.

375
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,760
Now, I'm not disparaging either one of them because they're the majority of the people

376
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,340
you'll ever run into or even the people that you're in the room right now with most likely

377
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:06,600
are.

378
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:07,660
Here's the interesting.

379
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,640
I'm not disparaging me.

380
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,360
It's just a technical term that I'm using.

381
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:10,940
Yeah.

382
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,320
Moronic or whatever.

383
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,300
Now, here's the interesting part.

384
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,880
There's two sides to this.

385
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,440
One thing where he says, sure, the government prints money and all this.

386
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,360
First of all, none of that is true.

387
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,380
But if you take it as truth, it's even more profound.

388
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:32,500
Because what he's telling you there, if the government prints money all the time, that

389
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,000
means that the original government, the lawful government is gone.

390
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,240
How many times have I said that has disappeared, has been completely dissolved.

391
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:45,000
And what is the current government is, in fact, the Federal Reserve System shareholders.

392
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,700
Right. So right.

393
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,320
Because they're the ones that print the money.

394
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:52,360
Now, you can say the Office of Printing and Engraving does it and all that.

395
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:59,040
But so what's interesting, someone who does a rudimentary study on how the system works,

396
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:03,500
how the government has a subcontractor, a private contractor, do the money there.

397
00:17:03,619 --> 00:17:06,119
It's a quasi relation, quasi legal relationship.

398
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,940
OK. Right.

399
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,319
And so what he's telling you is what I've said.

400
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,380
It's bullshit on the surface because the government doesn't print money.

401
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,640
It's the Federal Reserve. Right.

402
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,220
But but what he's telling you, if you're going to take it as truth, it confirms what I've

403
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,920
said, that there is no more government's completely dissolved.

404
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:27,780
And it's really run by the, you know, the legal society and the shareholders of the

405
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:31,560
Federal Reserve. Because if you go to the Federal Reserve and ask them, which I have

406
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:36,000
and ask them, you guys are running, they're like, no, how can you just say no?

407
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,220
He says, you're just not asking me the right question.

408
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,960
Well, because then I. OK, plainly, let me get to this plainly.

409
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:48,080
If you accept that the government is printing the money, then that means that this agency

410
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,500
that we are told is not part of the government is the government, is the actual

411
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,020
government, which means exactly.

412
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,360
Yeah. So what exactly?

413
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,680
Thank you. Because if you take on face value what he's saying, it's even more profound

414
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,220
than it sounds, because most patriots will listen and say he's wrong.

415
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,220
It's the Federal Reserve. So you need to go one step deeper, because I believe, yes, these

416
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,040
people are morons. I'll even write the certificates that they are.

417
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,140
Yeah, sure. And that is the declarations.

418
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,820
But but that's at the same time, if they were told to say this, the chances that they were

419
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:23,420
told to say this was scripted is very high, by the way, is to basically send a message.

420
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:30,000
Right. Because you can have Bozo the Clown or Ronald McDonald give a government issue

421
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,220
statement. Right. That's official.

422
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,560
That goes into the records.

423
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:39,400
But most people will discount it because it was said by this Bozo or Ronald McDonald,

424
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:42,620
let's say. Right. So is that listening to the message or the messenger?

425
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,260
So I believe this was interesting.

426
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,500
It was crafted to do both things.

427
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,400
One is to put out pure bullshit because that's what people are used to.

428
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,220
The other one is to get people arguing that he's wrong.

429
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:59,700
And the other one is that he's actually speaking facts and truth, meaning that what we call

430
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,080
the government, you know, is is this group.

431
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,480
Right. So I just found that to be interesting.

432
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,740
What's the name of the video? What's the title of the video?

433
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,760
So people would look it up.

434
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,000
YouTube title. Let's see.

435
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:16,680
I don't understand. In quotes, Jared Bernstein, chair of the Council of Economic Advisors.

436
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,180
What's the channel? The channel is Raw Booty.

437
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,240
B-O-O-T-Y. Yes.

438
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,580
OK, good. So anybody could look it up.

439
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,760
Maybe if it's it'll be fun.

440
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,440
Yeah. So this is the kind of stuff that's going on.

441
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,180
Like we mentioned, 9-11 planes or no planes.

442
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,680
Well, it's if you give a simple answer, it doesn't make sense.

443
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,060
Right. With most most things like who killed JFK.

444
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,120
If you give a simple answer, it doesn't make sense.

445
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,340
Right. Well, here's something I want to ask you, then.

446
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:49,200
What you're telling me is that, you know, because KRS-One used to say this and it always

447
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,600
stuck with me for multiple reasons.

448
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,960
And maybe this is why, you know, when he says you go there, you're dissatisfied with your

449
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,200
hamburger. You ask to speak to who's in charge.

450
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,680
They send you the manager.

451
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,080
The manager doesn't own anything.

452
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,440
The manager just works there.

453
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:09,580
So anybody that seems to be in charge and is making these arrangements is handling the

454
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:13,720
food, is handling the business, appears to be the manager.

455
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,200
But he doesn't own anything.

456
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,800
And that's what we're looking at here, is that when the government that they say is our

457
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,260
government right now are the managers, they're not the owners.

458
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,480
Is that right? They're actually worse than that because the manager can still push buttons

459
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,820
that will make big changes.

460
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,020
Right. Yeah.

461
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,760
The manager can turn the lights out and lock up the doors.

462
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,120
No, I think they're just puppets that are there with a message.

463
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,920
But ultimately, that manager doesn't look.

464
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,220
If the owner wants to close the store, the manager can't stop him.

465
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:47,080
If the owner wants to have the store do nothing, the manager can't stop him.

466
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:51,940
But the point the point I wanted to bring up here is if these two people in this video

467
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:56,900
are exemplary in their explanation of what they tried to explain.

468
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:01,660
Can you imagine someone that you might be in the room with you or a co-worker or an

469
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,900
associate or a family member?

470
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,240
Yeah. When you're looking at it, forget it.

471
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:11,260
Discussing how the money system works, it's it's alien, literally alien.

472
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:16,240
And I mean, is staring, stammering around and reaching for an answer and not really

473
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,800
being able to get too much. I mean, he must have spent a good 30, 40 seconds of that

474
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,780
minute, 40 something seconds stammering around.

475
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,480
Yeah, exactly. But imagine these are people set up here, the interviewer that are

476
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,260
supposed to put forward a message that have some, quote unquote, expertise on the

477
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:35,720
subject. Right. This is a chair is literally the head of the Council of Economic

478
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:41,520
Advisors. Right. So this is a guy who basically should know about how this works or

479
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,920
how to be a little more eloquent.

480
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,980
Now, here's the other thing. I've been in the presence of Federal Reserve chairman

481
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:52,260
and there's like 30 of them or there's there's 12 banks and each one has like vice

482
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,580
presidents, not chairman, vice presidents, vice presidents.

483
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:58,000
Right. Has several of them, just like when you meet someone who's vice president of

484
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,880
insurance company, they have like 50 vice presidents.

485
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,200
Right. Right. But it's it's considered a high position.

486
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:08,260
And basically the discussion I basically mentioned, yes, he did confirm the birth

487
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,160
certificate is what creates the value of the money.

488
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:13,120
In other words, a country that has a lot of babies, their money will be worth less.

489
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:19,580
China. Right. And so why the EU at the time it was the the euro came out as to the

490
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,960
euro is higher because the Europeans are having fewer babies than the Americans.

491
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,400
They're like, absolutely. That's right.

492
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,720
But the whole thing is they they they are a personal discussion.

493
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:32,880
If you do speak with them, just like the when I mentioned the Federal Reserve pretty

494
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,340
much runs everything and owns everything.

495
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,980
And he's like, no, you didn't ask it.

496
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,240
You didn't ask me the right question.

497
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,660
And basically shuffling around.

498
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,800
I said it's their shareholders.

499
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,980
And that's right. It's the shareholders.

500
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,900
So in other words, Federal Reserve is a front.

501
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,160
Right. So they put forward.

502
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,040
So it's yet another layer of management.

503
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,080
In other words, it's not the store manager.

504
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,280
Now you're telling me the Federal Reserve is the district.

505
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,860
You have the managers that manage the managers that you find out about.

506
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:01,600
Right. So that's the district manager as opposed to the store manager.

507
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,440
And we still haven't hit upon the owners is what you know.

508
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:09,360
Exactly. That's why, for example, when you go to the court system, I found that this

509
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,420
was very interesting because when I spoke to a former district attorney, assistant

510
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:19,320
district attorney who quit because she said she found out what was going on.

511
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,740
She lives here in Tucson.

512
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,440
And she didn't want to talk about it.

513
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,920
But basically, later on, I found out what was going on.

514
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:33,120
The all the judges have handlers since the early 90s and who these handlers are.

515
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,740
And to say that's fine to shake it off, whatever.

516
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:40,940
But once you find out really who they are and give specifics, it scares them because

517
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,440
I have brought this up with the specifics.

518
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,400
And this is what it is. The handlers come from the underwriting agencies where the

519
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,620
insurance companies, in other words, those courts are insured.

520
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,580
If the judge makes a bad decision or whatever, they can get sued.

521
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,460
The city can. So they have full staff, depending on how big the courthouse is.

522
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:02,460
These observers, the insurance company has observers and they tell the judges basically

523
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:07,060
what to say, what not to say, when to to get up and leave the courtrooms and end the

524
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,160
court date, you know, ended for now or whatever.

525
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:13,680
And typically, like here in Tucson, there's about one for each floor.

526
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,940
So you have a three or four floor court building.

527
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,040
You have one of these inspectors on each one.

528
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,540
And they're usually well-dressed. And the way you find out who they are is very simple.

529
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,720
You dress up a certain way and you spend the whole day at the courtroom.

530
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,540
Most courtrooms you can walk in and out of, especially the ones for traffic tickets and

531
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:32,020
stuff. Right. They're big public audience type things.

532
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,060
You can sit in the galley and you can observe.

533
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,440
I've done this. Yeah, exactly.

534
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:40,480
So have I. And I've spent days and days, maybe a hundred hours.

535
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,820
So this is the interesting part.

536
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,760
You start doing that and you just do a quick observation, facial recognition, who's in

537
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,000
there. Then you go to another courtroom and do facial recognition.

538
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:54,260
By the end of the day, if you keep switching around, you see everyone has their time in

539
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:59,420
court and leaves. But you'll find someone that is hanging around like you are all day.

540
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,780
Right. With a notepad or a mic or a recorder, dictaphone type thing, a personal

541
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,520
recorder. And those are the guys from the insurance companies.

542
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,020
And you find out where they leave.

543
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:08,980
They go through.

544
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,520
They go. This is how they exit the courtroom.

545
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:16,980
They go to an empty courtroom, let courtroom be on floor number three.

546
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,040
Yeah. And they'll go into an empty courtroom and walk all the way through the

547
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:25,140
courtroom and go out into the judge's chambers where the judge exits as a separate

548
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:29,520
door. And they go out, they exit through there, not where you would exit being.

549
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,400
If you try to exit through there, they'll show you go the other way.

550
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:40,240
Right. So these people I found out later when I brought this up to a senior person

551
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,180
who's worked there a long time, who was shamelessly fine about time.

552
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,980
He says those he says those are insurance people.

553
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,560
They're from the insurance companies.

554
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,780
So those are the handlers.

555
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:54,240
Right. Just like I've said earlier, I've met an attorney and he was from England.

556
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,600
He worked in the U.S. and said, you know, I never asked you what, you know, your

557
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,860
attorney. But what kind of what do you do?

558
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,080
What kind of work do you do? He says, oh, I edit medical books.

559
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,240
So do you have medical study?

560
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,400
No, I don't read it. Oh, my gosh.

561
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,820
So when medical textbooks are written, he goes through them and edits out what you

562
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,860
know, what it takes out.

563
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,780
And does he know anything about medicine?

564
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,800
No, he just knows when it has a certain language or whatever.

565
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,780
Right. So that was a big wake up call.

566
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,540
So in other words, like we started early, this reality is not real.

567
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,600
We do not. It cannot be real.

568
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:29,820
Right. There's got to be some kind of a guiding system, everything.

569
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:34,600
So you wake up at three in the morning and stub your toe on the kitchen chair going to

570
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,860
get some water or something.

571
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,200
And, you know, that was that planned, even though you think it's accidental.

572
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,620
I'm starting to question that.

573
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,800
And I've said before, everything is predetermined.

574
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,500
Because remember, when you're watching a fiction, a theater or a movie or something,

575
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:51,940
that's all preplanned. Very rarely, even live stuff, stuff that used to be live is

576
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,900
still scripted to a certain degree.

577
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:58,500
So how much of this because it can't be real, quote unquote, naturally.

578
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:02,720
Then, of course, I said, how can anything really be natural if it has a creator?

579
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,400
Right. So, yeah, it's very, very disturbing to one level.

580
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:12,680
But one message I'd like to give is people can consider no one can make you happy

581
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:16,120
or no one can make you sad or angry or upset unless you let them.

582
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:21,880
Right. So then it goes back to that aspect where it's

583
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,400
objectively subjective.

584
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:28,620
Well, even if things are not absolutely scripted point by point, because some people

585
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:33,140
might find that entirely impossible to believe that every single little nuance, every

586
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,000
single incident is absolutely scripted.

587
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,740
You could say that there's choreography involved, right?

588
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,800
Enough of it. There's a general idea that this is going to happen.

589
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,500
This is going to happen. Now, some other stuff might happen during this.

590
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,900
But generally speaking, you have to hit each of these marks.

591
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,620
So this must occur.

592
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,940
This must occur. I mean, whether you take five or six steps in between the two trees, it

593
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,320
doesn't matter. Almost like a twilight zone.

594
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,780
That's why years ago, before the Matrix, the twilight zone was a reference.

595
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,600
People used for strange things that happened.

596
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,060
Right. Right. Absolutely.

597
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,080
Yeah. It's like you have a book reader.

598
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,600
You find out a library burned down a hundred years ago.

599
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:11,500
You wake up, you go a hundred years back and you're the one that ends up starting the fire

600
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,840
because you accidentally kick the lamp over.

601
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,520
Right. So how much of it is absolute?

602
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,480
Well, I've also given the analogy.

603
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,960
Everyone's on a cruise ship. It's going from London to New York.

604
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,780
While you're on the cruise ship, you have certain freedoms and things you can take up your

605
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,380
time with for the trip. But for sure, everyone is going.

606
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,940
From London to New York.

607
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,840
Right now, the guy who's walking with a limp, he goes back in time, he sees himself and

608
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,460
scares himself as a small child out of the tree, falls down and breaks his leg.

609
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,680
And that's why he walks with the limp.

610
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,900
But he's the guy who scared himself out of the tree.

611
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,400
Yeah. So are we in a closed loop paradox?

612
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:49,360
By the way, the paradoxes are all paradoxes can be viewed a certain way, whether or not

613
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,540
paradoxes. Right. But yeah, is it is it a closed thing like that?

614
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:58,140
I don't I don't think that if you really have time traveled, you end up going exactly to

615
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,180
the same place.

616
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,440
Right. It's things are slightly different.

617
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:06,320
There are some interesting stories recounting that where you'd go back and instead of

618
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,020
having this color painted on your kitchen wall now, it's a different color.

619
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:13,660
But it's essentially, you know, for all intents and purposes, it's the same kitchen,

620
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,340
right? You have little minor changes, right?

621
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,860
Because I don't think anything ever duplicates exactly.

622
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:24,720
Even if it's overlaid, it cannot be exact, but it's good enough.

623
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:25,620
Right.
