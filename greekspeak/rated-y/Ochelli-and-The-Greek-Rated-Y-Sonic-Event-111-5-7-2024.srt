1
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:15,180
Rated Y, Sonic Event 111, 1-11 that is. So anyway, how are you doing, Greg?

2
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:23,020
Alright, we're doing. How about we start going over some questions that have been sent for a while now, just sitting there.

3
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:29,820
We've got some pretty long emails. Some of them are easy. Some of them require some thinking.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,740
What do you think about that?

5
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,040
Yeah, well, we were talking about the financial system from an email last time,

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:44,440
which bears going over a few times because there's a lot to it that isn't quite as advertised, right?

7
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,420
And we played that clip from that guy who was supposed to be the head of the – jeez, I forget what he was.

8
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:55,180
He's a financial advisor chairman, so yeah. But they all play that. They all play that.

9
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:03,019
OK, Frankie the Finger kind of thing. First time I did cocaine. What? What did I just say?

10
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:13,180
Anyway, we went to this guy's house. His 95-year-old mother lived on the very top floor and he lived on the ground floor in the basement.

11
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:23,220
Turns out he's a hitman and he has this drawer open. I walk in the room and it looks like he was collecting twigs, like two or three-inch long twigs.

12
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:30,860
I was speaking Brooklyn, right? And I'm looking at it closely and I'm like, that looks like a big net on that.

13
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:39,760
When I say twigs, like black pieces of wood. Well, it's not. They're not pieces of wood. They're actually finger souvenirs, right?

14
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:48,140
A drawer, several drawers. And he said, I don't like to torture people. I just want to do it when they don't know what's coming, right?

15
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,440
I'm like, oh my gosh, this is interesting. One day I might have to write a book and listen to this guy, right?

16
00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:05,920
OK, so he's bragging and talking, right? Whatever, right? And he says he likes – when he has someone with him, they use a lock cutter because when you use a knife or something,

17
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,340
when they hit bone, people flinch and they make the process much longer, right?

18
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,560
Where when you use one of those lock cutters, you have so much leverage, you don't feel anything, right?

19
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,200
He had one specially made.

20
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,180
Bolt cutter, yeah.

21
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,680
Yeah, a bolt cutter. Yeah, you don't feel – people flinch too much with other instruments.

22
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,840
So I'm listening to this. I'm like, all right, why am I here?

23
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:30,320
Well, I just mentioned I was there to do something. Someone insisted that I go over there.

24
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:38,580
All right. OK, this whole thing, including myself being there and what I just stated, if you put a camera on his face with a microphone and say,

25
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,260
can you please give us an overview of all the things you said, what do you think he's going to say?

26
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:49,200
Nothing. Get out of my face. Leave me alone. I don't know what you're talking about, right?

27
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:49,780
Yeah.

28
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,860
You see what's going on?

29
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,420
Yeah, of course.

30
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:59,340
So people wonder like – yeah, the real naive mainstreamers are like, oh no, the public couldn't be deceived.

31
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,420
Like that is what most – the more education they have is what they say.

32
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:10,440
This is – by the way, if you have any relatives, friends, whatever, that have degrees in work, the normal grind job or a professional job,

33
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,280
you bring up any Greek speak or especially with finance, they're going to say, oh no, the public outrage.

34
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,360
That's not how it works. There will be public outrage.

35
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:28,540
Trust me, I've done this with doctors and people of family that are doctors and lawyers and I give – I always give what answer they're going to say

36
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,400
and they come back and say, Greek, they said exactly what you said they were going to say.

37
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,080
I say yeah, this is not real. This is not real.

38
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:43,640
It's kind of like when you have a fictional situation or a setup or a phantom situation, there's a script usually.

39
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:49,600
If you know the script or the play or whatever, it's easy to pretty much state what they're going to say before they say it.

40
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,020
It can't be real.

41
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:58,540
I was going to ask you about that actually because I was thinking about Hollywood and how – you and I have discussed occasionally entertainment

42
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:06,140
and you don't have much use for it for one good reason and that is if you ever notice when people do something that's supposed to be based on a real story

43
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:10,680
or a real story, it's always like a big shock when they get something right.

44
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:16,320
You ever notice that? Like seriously, it's like everything is always wrong in these presentations

45
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,579
and I don't know how it is that people are surprised by this anymore.

46
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,360
It's the way it's always been. Nothing is presented.

47
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,960
No, but you said it right. It's the way it's always been.

48
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,820
Like with all of these catastrophes that – by the way, I want to bring up Archaics.

49
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:37,760
I don't endorse him but my stock in him went down quite a bit or his stock went down.

50
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:44,080
When you have a stock price – when somebody – when a company does something and the stock prices drop because they – in my book,

51
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:51,980
he talks about something called dungeon programming and he's talking about how this recent jail thing he had is going to cost him $10,000,

52
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,540
another $15,000 attorney.

53
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,080
Now, if that ain't dungeon programming, I don't know what is.

54
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,300
Going and get – OK, Jason.

55
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,240
Going and getting an attorney is a real punk-ass move.

56
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:12,760
All right. First of all, the reason why people get attorneys is number one, they're too lazy to study a little bit and number two,

57
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,980
they are motivated by penalty.

58
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,540
No one says I want to get an attorney because I want to do this legally blah, blah, blah.

59
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,540
If I don't get an attorney, I might get more fines and go to jail.

60
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:30,860
It's always – the reason people get attorneys is so – is motivated by the penalty.

61
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,460
If they don't, they think, right?

62
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:38,300
So a warrant, which would have been a maximum $120 – it's all administrative by the way.

63
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,340
He could have done it all by the phone, whatever, and he gets in it.

64
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:47,740
Jason, that's a real bitch-ass move, man, getting an attorney and saying you're going to spend $100,000 or $15,000.

65
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,000
Now that is dungeon programming if I've seen dungeon programming.

66
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,000
So anyway, like with Archaic Spring, let's go back to the theme here about all these catastrophes.

67
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,040
If you go and study a little bit of what's been written about the major calamities,

68
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,100
especially the ones that form the Mediterranean and all the floods and the really bad earthquakes

69
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:15,380
where the earth opens up and flames come out, the main thing the philosophers said is that

70
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,000
the people that survive these calamities that kill 80 or 90 percent of the population

71
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,560
are the ones that are uneducated, the ones that are living in the mountains,

72
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,760
the ones that are the most menial and most base people, right?

73
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,160
So can you imagine a society – for example, if you look at the art – go to a museum.

74
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:43,480
Look at the artwork of the Elgin marbles, any of the marbles that are sculpted by ancient Greeks, the detail, right?

75
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:50,200
And then go a thousand years later, cartoonish garbage from the Middle Ages.

76
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,320
It looks like a five-year-old with Play-Doh, right?

77
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,660
What happened? Why did it – right?

78
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:02,440
Because there's a filter that happens where the intelligent people that can put things together are killed off

79
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,860
over and over and over and over.

80
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:12,560
That's why I said current society is a product of a certain breeding and grooming program.

81
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:18,020
The difference between breeding and grooming – breeding is 100 percent biological, right?

82
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,720
Where you have physical characteristics of one and physical characteristics of the other

83
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,120
and you mate them because of the physical characteristics.

84
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,760
Sometimes behavioral as well, but it's purely biological.

85
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:35,200
Grooming is training. Grooming is the environment that's set up for someone, right?

86
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,960
Social environment, cultural environment, familiar environment, whatever.

87
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,560
It's environmental influence.

88
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:51,780
So not only have people of intelligence and of however you want to say have been bred down –

89
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,360
people have been bred down. They're killed off.

90
00:07:54,120 --> 00:08:00,320
OK, go to a trailer trash place and knock on each trailer or whatever.

91
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,260
They call it low-income housing.

92
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,820
How many children have you got?

93
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,160
Well, you mean with me right now or how many I've had, right?

94
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,800
I've had five with him and four with him and two – I got one right here.

95
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:19,040
OK, keep going. You're going to get the same story over and over.

96
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,680
You go places where people are more intelligent, whatever.

97
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,840
How many children? None.

98
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,380
You see the breeding program?

99
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,100
Now did anyone tell the poor people and the dumb people to have more children

100
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,360
and the wealthy people and the intelligent people to not?

101
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,080
No. You see?

102
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:36,679
No one is putting a gun to their heads.

103
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,679
You better have children because you're –

104
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:41,419
and you better not have children because you're intelligent.

105
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,000
Is that going on? Not at all.

106
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:45,920
That's kind of encouraged.

107
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,960
See, it's almost like we're missing two things here when you're talking about breeding and grooming.

108
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,920
I guess we're missing pruning and –

109
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,340
Pruning would be – yeah, that's a good one.

110
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,760
Abortion, car accidents, vaccines, yeah.

111
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,140
And sculpting, right?

112
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,040
Sculpting is the other part of it because whatever you can't sculpt.

113
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,340
Yeah, well Obama – here's a sculpting for you.

114
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:12,680
Obama and Biden have convinced the population they should start cutting their dicks off.

115
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,560
There you go.

116
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,960
They call it the woke agenda.

117
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,300
It's just – just break it down to what it is, right?

118
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,720
It started – all this stuff, these idiot patriots, conservatives, whatever.

119
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,660
You know how you become a Trump supporter, right?

120
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,940
You know how you actually convert?

121
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,880
I want to – this is what you do.

122
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,760
You rent a big place and you say you want to become a Trump –

123
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,060
a real good bonafide Trump supporter is what you do.

124
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,560
You come here and you pay at the door and then we turn you into a Trump supporter.

125
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,300
You know how we do it?

126
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:40,980
How do we do it?

127
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:47,100
You get about a 7 to 10-inch rotary blade and when they walk in, you cut their top of their head open.

128
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,420
You have them lean over and all the brains fall out and you put the head back together

129
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:55,600
and right now you've got a perfect Trump supporter or American patriot or whatever, right?

130
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,180
OK.

131
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:56,940
OK.

132
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:03,200
All these people are bitching about this situation now but this started way back in the 70s.

133
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,640
It was outlined to be fully – what do you call it?

134
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,520
Rolled out by Obama, right?

135
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,720
Then you get the diversion, orange face, whatever they call him.

136
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,840
But Trump was born with both organs.

137
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,380
They decided he should be a boy.

138
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,840
You're aware of that, right?

139
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,420
I never heard that before, no.

140
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,040
Oh, OK.

141
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,240
I better not talk about it then.

142
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,680
OK, because then if I keep talking about it, so what's your source?

143
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,180
No.

144
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,320
OK, anyway.

145
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,300
I didn't say that.

146
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,420
I'm not going to ask your source.

147
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,540
But that's –

148
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,120
Yeah, I'm not going to.

149
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,820
All right, forget it.

150
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,340
I thought it was well-known.

151
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:39,660
No.

152
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,780
Remember Joan Rivers?

153
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,620
Do you remember Joan Rivers?

154
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,020
Come on.

155
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,580
Everybody knows Michelle is a tranny, right?

156
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,900
She's still alive by the way.

157
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,120
She's been seen several times.

158
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,560
She doesn't wear the makeup that's why.

159
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,460
Oh, OK.

160
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,700
But the voice hasn't changed.

161
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:59,200
There's a couple of people that spotted them in New York and they were eating dinner in

162
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,620
a restaurant, a hotel type restaurant.

163
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,200
OK.

164
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,600
And they heard the voice and the laugh.

165
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,260
I'm like, that's Joan Rivers.

166
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,000
I mean you could – right?

167
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,020
Like if you heard De Niro laugh.

168
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:15,380
I mean there's certain – I sat at a table next to Danny DeVito and Jack Nicholson.

169
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:19,240
They were hanging – they're in Hollywood and we went to a restaurant and they were

170
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:19,460
there.

171
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:19,980
They hang out.

172
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,720
They're buds, right?

173
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:24,700
Well, they're both from the same area of New Jersey where I grew up actually.

174
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,840
Yeah, but they're still buddies.

175
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,080
This is 10 years ago.

176
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:27,340
Yeah.

177
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,080
But they've been friends a long time.

178
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,700
Hey, Jack.

179
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,140
Hey, Danny.

180
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,420
They said, hey, how are you doing?

181
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,160
Anyway, I didn't – it was kind of like semi-booth, semi – it was kind of dark.

182
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,360
I'm listening to the conversation.

183
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,500
I'm like, that's Danny DeVito and that's Jack Nicholson.

184
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,020
Wait a second.

185
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,680
I turn around and guess what?

186
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,440
It's them right next to me.

187
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,940
The table next to me, right?

188
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,380
But behind kind of like on a dangle there's a column halfway.

189
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,160
I'm not paying attention.

190
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,220
They sat after I did.

191
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,880
So I looked there because I was looking at the door, the power seat.

192
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,300
Anyway, they must have come from another end of the restaurant.

193
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,380
But anyway, I recognized them from the voice.

194
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:10,420
There are certain people that people get familiar with, whether it be hosts or movies or whatever.

195
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,460
You hear the voice.

196
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,720
You know who it is.

197
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,260
You don't have to just see the face, right?

198
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,580
So anyway, Joan Rivers has been coming up.

199
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,940
Just to tie it back, she's like, come on.

200
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,640
Everybody knows Michelle Michael, right?

201
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,680
So I thought everyone knew that when I just mentioned about Trump.

202
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,140
This is very common.

203
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:30,580
And I have a childhood friend who was that way, by the way.

204
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,160
He could have been a boy or a girl.

205
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,260
You know, they decided to make him a boy.

206
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,200
Anyway, what's called hermaphroditic or dual gender?

207
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,960
What is it called when you have both sex organs?

208
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:40,980
Hermaphrodite.

209
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,300
Anyway.

210
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,000
Yeah, it's very common in Colombia.

211
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,540
Catholics, when they went, they killed off most of the tribe.

212
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:52,200
But there was a tribe of people, indigenous people in the mountain area of Colombia,

213
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:58,640
that did not develop their sex until they were about nine, between nine and 13 years old.

214
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,620
They had both organs.

215
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,580
And then one would close up or fall off or whatever.

216
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:08,460
I remember reading about that a long time ago.

217
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,540
Look, when I used to go to the public libraries in the 80s,

218
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:15,980
the way I did my research is like, oh, I'm getting kind of bored researching this right now.

219
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:16,840
I need to go somewhere else.

220
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:23,900
So they had a book section, like the area of misfit books, where no one takes these books out.

221
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,740
And they're out on an aisle, like on a table.

222
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,540
But the table has a wooden side so the books don't fall off.

223
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,300
And they're like, please, you know, please, what is it?

224
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,120
Take me out.

225
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,100
What do you do?

226
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,300
Take the library book out, right?

227
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,020
Rent it or whatever.

228
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:37,740
You take it out.

229
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,320
Check it out.

230
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,200
Because they're going to be removed from the library.

231
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,680
Because no one ever reads or looks at these books.

232
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,200
One of the books I picked up, by the way, back then was The Ten Worst Popes of All Time.

233
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,080
The other one was Indigenous People of South America.

234
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,880
That's where I got that little bit of it from.

235
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:54,820
These were old books.

236
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,280
Indigenous People of South America.

237
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,960
Yeah, South America, yeah.

238
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,680
There was more of the title Thereabouts.

239
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,100
Thereabouts.

240
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,100
The other one was The Ten Worst Popes of All Time.

241
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,200
Maybe you do a search on that book.

242
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,200
Remember, these were like the misfit books in the 80s in the New York Public Library.

243
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,000
So you get little bits like that.

244
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:17,880
It's hard to forget.

245
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:22,940
You know, when you hear about Indigenous people living in Columbia that were mostly killed

246
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:27,580
off when the Catholics got there and their sex did not develop, their gender fully didn't

247
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,760
develop until they were 12 or 13.

248
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,440
You don't forget that, right?

249
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,440
That's not something you're going to forget, right?

250
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,140
I'm not able to bring up the source.

251
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,560
And when you hear about Trump, and by the way, I heard this about Trump back in 89, right?

252
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:49,320
Where, you know, he was a Democrat and he just flipped to a Republican right before.

253
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,140
You know this anyway.

254
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,660
Well, I know about that.

255
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,480
He had the exploratory committees and all that stuff, and he looked at running as a

256
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:55,760
Democrat.

257
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,920
He looked at running as an independent.

258
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,720
He was, yeah.

259
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,500
If you asked him in 89, he's a Democrat.

260
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:00,220
Right.

261
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,040
All the way through.

262
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:01,680
So, yeah.

263
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:08,620
But anyway, and also he had, there was a lunch where he was going to be there and his right-hand

264
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:12,740
man, and I refused because I knew the guy was, you know, I wouldn't want to be in the

265
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,200
room with the guy.

266
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,140
This is talking about 1989, right?

267
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:22,880
So, I was working white-collar construction, which is white-collar meaning like a GC that

268
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,380
only does government jobs, post offices, colleges, and stuff like that.

269
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,960
The smallest project was 1.6 million, right?

270
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,980
And basically, it's all subcontractors.

271
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,160
It doesn't matter what, you just, whatever, you hire everyone, you have all the insurance,

272
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,140
the big bonds, and you get 15%, you're allowed to make 15% profit, right?

273
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:45,040
And you have all these CMs, construction managers, going around.

274
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,000
They really like me there.

275
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:55,680
And that's, by the way, that's when I got hooked up with that because I was doing a

276
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,860
draftsmanship intern.

277
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:02,180
I tried for 10 days at a company called Amund & Whitney.

278
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,600
Amund & Whitney is one of the largest engineering firms in the world.

279
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:12,360
And what was going on was the Statue of Liberty was being restored.

280
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,500
Now you know how old I am, basically, you know.

281
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,640
And the scaffolding has to go up, right?

282
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,000
But they can't screw to the statue.

283
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,880
It's like you can't put, you know, the scaffolding has to be attached to the building or the

284
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,620
structure, usually.

285
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,900
But they were not allowed to at all fasten to the statue.

286
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,480
So how the hell are you going to have this huge scaffolding, you know?

287
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,080
So what they did was they designed a system.

288
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,000
There was a German company, Liebig, that came in and basically made it so when the wind

289
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,860
blows, instead of the scaffolding leaning and hitting the statue or whatever, it would

290
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,480
rotate, it would twist to take up the forces, right?

291
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,640
So each section, every 30 feet or so was able to twist in any direction.

292
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,500
It was kind of wild.

293
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,300
And it had dampers like shock absorbers, so if you're working on it, you're not flipping

294
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,440
back and forth, right?

295
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,140
Like an amusement park ride.

296
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:07,420
Every time something was changed on the scaffolding, even a bolt, the drawings had to be amended.

297
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,819
And all the time, scaffolds are being reinforced, removed, moved.

298
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,819
So I had to be there to take measurements and take the measurements from someone and

299
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:17,520
then put them in a formal drawing.

300
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:24,480
So they had people working 24-7, literally three shifts, making addendums on all the drawings

301
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,260
as built, what was going on, right?

302
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,000
So they needed a lot of...

303
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
So I'm there at night, and I'm drawing.

304
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,180
This is very simple stuff.

305
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,940
The hardest part is reading someone else's notes, right?

306
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,140
Because then the drawing gets checked against the notes.

307
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,960
Anyway, a lot of checking and stuff.

308
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,680
One of the old men, Aman's grandson or son, in a wheelchair, says,

309
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,080
So what do you do?

310
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:45,860
What are you doing here at night?

311
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,180
Young guy, good-looking guy like you.

312
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,680
I used to be young and beautiful, by the way.

313
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,120
He's like, what are you doing here?

314
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:53,860
You should be out.

315
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,940
I said, yeah, I just want to do this.

316
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,000
I want to see what it's like to be dedicated to this.

317
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:58,460
He says, great.

318
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,700
I said, well, what do you do when you're not here?

319
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,600
I said, well, recently, I got a mountain bike out of Fat Chance, one of the early ones.

320
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:09,420
Back then, it was a $1,500 mountain bike, and today's money would be $7,000, right?

321
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:15,920
And I said, I go down to the World Trade Center in the middle area there where the bronze statue is,

322
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,700
and we do trials.

323
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,340
We try to get up on a bench with a bike and do all this other stuff.

324
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,120
He says, no, you stay away from there.

325
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,620
There are nukes in there.

326
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,120
And I was like, what?

327
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,280
This guy's crazy.

328
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,880
And from all the movies, when they show a nuke, they show the nuclear core.

329
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,120
It looks like a bowling ball made out of metal, right?

330
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,880
So when you go to the World Trade Center back then, there was a sculpture in the middle.

331
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,880
It was a big bronze ball, right?

332
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,240
And it was a sculpture.

333
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,160
You know, an artist or whatever.

334
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,820
That's actually survived sort of.

335
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,460
It got smashed up in a fountain in a bench area.

336
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,660
That's where we used to hang out.

337
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,020
So when I saw that, I said, oh, my gosh.

338
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,580
I've seen it in the movies.

339
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,920
Maybe that bronze ball is a nuke.

340
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,660
I didn't know.

341
00:18:54,100 --> 00:19:02,100
I didn't get the whole story that, you know, in case of an emergency demolition scheme, we use nukes to take these buildings down.

342
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,460
He didn't.

343
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:07,540
So since 1989, Trump was born both boy and girl.

344
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,060
And there were nukes in the World Trade Center.

345
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,760
This just sat in the back of my head.

346
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:11,780
Right.

347
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,640
This is before the Internet.

348
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,340
I hope you know.

349
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:14,620
Right.

350
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,160
Yeah, of course.

351
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,120
Yeah.

352
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,600
And there were the only I don't even think Nexus magazine was out.

353
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,480
Then, you know, these alternative.

354
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:26,220
It was the most alternative thing I could read back then was the village voice.

355
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:27,460
Yeah.

356
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,280
Remember that voice?

357
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:28,560
Yeah.

358
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,900
The voice was.

359
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,800
And in those newspapers, every town has something like that is a big publisher.

360
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,440
And they no longer put them in print.

361
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,020
They were free.

362
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:37,680
Right.

363
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:38,820
And it was cool.

364
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,120
You could you could do ads in the back for like one or two dollars.

365
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,120
They go a missed connection or you can send someone a message.

366
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,420
A real cheap or free.

367
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,240
Sometimes.

368
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,320
Remember?

369
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:48,860
Yeah.

370
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:49,800
So.

371
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,040
Yeah.

372
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,420
So this is how we got to where we are.

373
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,780
Before the Internet.

374
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:56,260
OK.

375
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,560
Emails.

376
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,060
Financial system.

377
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,520
I started off giving the analogy of the hitman.

378
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:01,780
Right.

379
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:02,200
Right.

380
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:06,180
You put the microphone in their face and they deny ever anything ever.

381
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:06,940
What are you talking about?

382
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,600
I'm a manager.

383
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,320
I'm the day manager at Domino's Pizza.

384
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:10,760
What do you mean?

385
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,140
Right.

386
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,480
Or I work at whatever sanitation.

387
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:14,260
Right.

388
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:22,020
They usually work in a sanitation company or drywall company or plumbing company.

389
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:27,120
Anyway, the going rate, by the way, has gone down.

390
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:30,120
I've heard from the grapevine on doing hits.

391
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,900
It's down to like 1980s prices now.

392
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:33,260
Yeah.

393
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:33,820
I heard that.

394
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,120
Just desperate, actually.

395
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:35,700
Yeah.

396
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,640
Very desperate.

397
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:37,640
I didn't know what to.

398
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,280
It seems like there's not as much business lately.

399
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,240
No, no.

400
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:42,600
Yeah.

401
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,860
Or the ones that are doing it are willing to accept such a pay cut.

402
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,300
Yeah.

403
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,900
They're taking a hell of a pay cut.

404
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:48,980
But yeah.

405
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,040
My understanding is.

406
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:50,340
Yeah.

407
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:54,660
It's actually less than what it was in the 80s, which means it's less than one-fifth

408
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,940
of what it used to be.

409
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:56,520
Well, right.

410
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,040
Because let's just say arbitrarily it's 10 grand.

411
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:00,880
That's not.

412
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,020
Right.

413
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,220
That was the 80s.

414
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,240
But that was the 80s.

415
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:03,940
Five, 10 grand.

416
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,020
But if you put it in 10 grand now.

417
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,300
Right.

418
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,140
That means it's three grand then.

419
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:09,680
Two or three.

420
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,240
Or two grand.

421
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,200
So.

422
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,040
That's what I'm saying.

423
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:12,300
Right.

424
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:12,840
That's crazy.

425
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,740
That's actually even less.

426
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,660
It's below five.

427
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:19,960
Anyway, that's why you hear so many things, you know, like relationships.

428
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:24,320
One spouse hires one of these guys to take out the other one for whatever.

429
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:25,620
Yeah.

430
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:29,480
If you notice the recent stories that have come out where somebody tries to hire somebody,

431
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,480
they're hiring non-professionals for like fifteen hundred.

432
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:33,340
Yeah.

433
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,360
Twelve hundred dollars.

434
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:34,900
I mean.

435
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:35,180
Yeah.

436
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:35,920
Next to nothing.

437
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,040
Yeah.

438
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,900
We're not going to do any instructions on that.

439
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,180
But it's not what you think.

440
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,540
It doesn't work the way people think in the movies either.

441
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:43,980
No.

442
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:44,780
But.

443
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:45,420
Not at all.

444
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,200
The point is, though, the price has gone down no matter where you go.

445
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,200
Mm hmm.

446
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:49,480
Yeah.

447
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:49,820
So.

448
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:55,510
Let's get to it.

449
00:21:55,610 --> 00:22:00,630
Now, the whenever if someone sends me an email and it's multiple questions and it's cogent

450
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:06,370
and pertains to a lot of stuff and the person's coming with something to share and it's a well

451
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:11,670
written, I usually reply and say is all right if I do it on a sonic.

452
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:12,510
Mm hmm.

453
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,750
Reply this on a sonic.

454
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:17,210
And the answer was I keep anonymous.

455
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,650
By all means, please do.

456
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,570
Thank you for your time.

457
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:20,490
Great.

458
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,030
So anyway.

459
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:22,870
Hello, Greek.

460
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,850
I've been listening to your sonics for many years now.

461
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:28,530
I'm reaching out with some questions and some information that I've developed since I initially

462
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,510
discovered your work.

463
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,510
I will start with the questions.

464
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:35,630
As a man that grew up in southern Italian household, it was commonplace to grow fruits

465
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:39,090
and vegetables that may not be native to the location that we found ourselves.

466
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:44,350
I live in New England and have successfully grown orange and lemon trees as well as figs.

467
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:49,010
Since these fruits are grown locally, will they be good, quote unquote, to consume because

468
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,150
they're grown in my climate?

469
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:54,090
Will they need to be avoided in the winter as with tropical grown fruits?

470
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:57,750
The answer to that is no, not no need, no need to avoid them at all.

471
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:04,550
They if they grow there, then they're fully adjusted to the environment, just like you

472
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,850
are seeking to be fully adjusted to the environment.

473
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:07,670
So they have adjusted.

474
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:08,490
So it's fine.

475
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:09,490
Right.

476
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:14,130
So that's that's a good question, because we categorize things in our mind.

477
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:18,950
Think of our mind as an elephant and the conscious part of our mind is someone riding an elephant.

478
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:22,230
Well, and this goes directly to your constant refrain of eat locally.

479
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:22,630
Right.

480
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:26,030
And the thing is, it is literally about eating locally.

481
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,010
It's not about what's locally available.

482
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:30,530
If you're able to cultivate something locally.

483
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:31,210
Right.

484
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:31,670
Right.

485
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:32,250
Yeah.

486
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:38,890
Well, it's the that particular plant, those plants and trees that you mentioned had to

487
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:39,390
adapt.

488
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:42,010
And because of their their means that they are in harmony.

489
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:43,770
So it's harmonious.

490
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:51,330
By the way, kudos to you, because that's very difficult to do if it's going to bear fruit.

491
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:53,150
I've grown all kinds of stuff in Europe.

492
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,310
It never bears fruit.

493
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:55,490
Beautiful avocado plants.

494
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:56,150
No avocado.

495
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:56,530
Right.

496
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:57,030
For example.

497
00:23:58,130 --> 00:23:59,450
OK, so that's that's good.

498
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:00,190
That's a good question.

499
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:05,130
And then, for example, there's a form of transmutation, like how many times people go to even, let's

500
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:07,570
say, a fast food hamburger joint, pickle or no pickle.

501
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:11,010
They never say cucumber or no cucumber, do they know?

502
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:13,470
It's always just that it's a pickled cucumber, right?

503
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:20,090
When you pickle a cucumber that way, it's no longer resembles the energy of a real of

504
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,910
a real an unpickled cucumber.

505
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:22,910
Right.

506
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:25,050
For example, bananas, let's say are tropical.

507
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:32,330
If you live in a temperate place, non-tropical, it's OK to eat dehydrated bananas.

508
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:36,570
Right, because they don't resemble bananas whatsoever.

509
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:37,330
Banana chips?

510
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:38,250
No, not anymore.

511
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,150
They're they're now a hard, completely transmuted.

512
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:40,930
Right.

513
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,690
They're hard and they're completely different.

514
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:47,790
I'm not saying go out and Greeks had a shitty banana chips.

515
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:49,090
No, I'm not saying that.

516
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:52,950
But you when you consider it right, they're completely different.

517
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,490
And there are things that are more extreme.

518
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:55,190
Right.

519
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:58,490
That maybe then you would you would still not consider them.

520
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:58,830
Right.

521
00:24:59,090 --> 00:24:59,450
OK.

522
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:02,670
The hardest thing to break.

523
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:06,530
Well, actually, you could break it with sugar because that's very tropical.

524
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:10,390
If you write sweeteners, so you go with sugar or other things.

525
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:10,630
Right.

526
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:18,750
Another question is a healing modality such as Reiki lawful under Yahweh.

527
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:22,490
I don't think Yahweh is that strict with something like that.

528
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,230
Now, I kind of knock.

529
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:27,830
I make fun of the Reiki people because I see you guys are like worshiping this

530
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:30,470
Asian guy called your name, George or something like that.

531
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:30,690
Right.

532
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:34,490
And they're a very clandestine group.

533
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:38,930
If there's a thousand people doing Reiki or you'll only find two that know what

534
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:39,370
they're doing.

535
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:45,710
But the reason it has a good reputation is because all just about all those

536
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,970
thousand people working on it get results.

537
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:53,630
So it's one of these things that even if you use a primitive form of what they

538
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:54,870
teach, it's still going to work.

539
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:55,870
It's very effective.

540
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,070
I don't think he's that limited.

541
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:00,410
There's a whole bunch of weird stuff going on.

542
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,150
They do curse.

543
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:05,070
Anyway, I'm not going to get into it because that'll be a Reiki discussion.

544
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,370
They do curses.

545
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,170
Yes, they've been pranked.

546
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:11,390
Most of the Reiki practitioners have been pranked.

547
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:17,050
But even with the pranks, it's it works just like water for every lab that there

548
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:19,210
is to increase the quality of water.

549
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:24,430
There's 300 labs to make the water toxic intentionally to kill people.

550
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:24,910
Right.

551
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:28,670
I'm talking without adding chemicals and they could succeed.

552
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:32,090
But the minute the water spends time is on at times on its own time on.

553
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:34,410
So it goes back to being healing or nutritious.

554
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,390
So like water will hold a blessing, quote unquote, holy water.

555
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:38,790
Right.

556
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:39,830
Holy water.

557
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,390
But it won't hold a curse.

558
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:43,130
It just it just won't.

559
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:45,950
There are certain modalities and Reiki might be one of them.

560
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:49,670
You know, like one of the things they do with Reiki, I'll mention why it's good.

561
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:54,070
Some of the symbols that they use, if you turn them upside down, they become negative.

562
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:57,690
And a lot of the Reiki stuff that they put out, the symbols are upside down.

563
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:00,290
You could read your researches on your own.

564
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:03,130
And but they still they're not getting negative results.

565
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:06,410
But I think if they turned them right side up, the results would be even better.

566
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:07,330
Right.

567
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,770
OK, you see.

568
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:09,110
OK.

569
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:13,990
Is it possible to have your consciousness removed from your body in a dreamlike state

570
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,970
to speak with deities, angels, et cetera?

571
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:18,530
I can offer more information on this if required.

572
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:19,230
Yes, of course.

573
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,530
As a matter of fact, it can be done technologically.

574
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:24,150
What the device looks like.

575
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:28,270
I don't know exactly how it works, but, you know, technologically.

576
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:33,090
You know, when you go to these carnivals as a vending machine, you put a quarter in, it's

577
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:37,370
full of toys and prizes and you have this claw that you move with a joystick and you

578
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:37,990
pick up the.

579
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:38,410
Sure.

580
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,470
You get like a few.

581
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:39,910
Right.

582
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:40,990
And you drop it in a shoot.

583
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,090
And if you get it, you get it.

584
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:45,310
If you don't, you know, it's not very responsive, you know.

585
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:46,290
Right.

586
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:47,150
OK.

587
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:51,510
It's not something you it's not like throwing whatever or shooting, you know, to impress

588
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:51,750
someone.

589
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:53,430
It's one of these things you do when you're alone anyway.

590
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,670
It looks kind of like that.

591
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,430
And it has to do with cloning centers.

592
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:02,210
When they make a clone of you, there's this thing that looks like that claw goes over

593
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:07,610
the head of the clone and it's able to transfer your consciousness out of your body while

594
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:10,430
you're in REM sleep into the clone.

595
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:13,610
And you wake up and you're like, hey, guys, what's going on or where the fuck am I?

596
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,870
This is Donald Marshall testimony.

597
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:20,390
And if you're not if you don't if they don't turn on the part where you remember it, you

598
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:21,010
will never know.

599
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:24,490
But you'll have health problems and nightmares sometimes and things will leak through.

600
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:27,150
But, yeah, consciousness is nothing more.

601
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:28,810
Think of.

602
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:35,210
Your consciousness, the elephant with a rider, right, the main part of your consciousness

603
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:40,290
that you find to be what you consider being conscious is the rider of the elephant and

604
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:41,710
the elephant is the rest of it.

605
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:42,450
Right.

606
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,550
Most of it is dormant.

607
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:47,050
You know, there's in the ancient cultures that we're in the dream world where you can't be

608
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,070
dreaming unless you're asleep.

609
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,210
We're mostly asleep.

610
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:52,130
They even tell you only use 10 percent part of your brain.

611
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:53,090
Well, right.

612
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,530
Because we're very unconscious.

613
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:55,130
Right.

614
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:56,990
So, yes, of course it is.

615
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:01,950
And if you spend enough time with these deities and angels, you'll find they're advanced people

616
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,050
with advanced technology.

617
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:04,090
Right.

618
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:06,830
There's nothing mystical and magical in the universe.

619
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,150
Right.

620
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,850
Walking through walls is technology.

621
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:15,190
It doesn't matter what the deities call calls themselves.

622
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:16,470
You know what I mean?

623
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:18,330
It's technology.

624
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:24,050
If a quote unquote God can do something, you can do it, too, if you have the technology.

625
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:25,350
Right.

626
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:25,950
Period.

627
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:30,830
It's demystifying all the crazy stuff that people go through with religion.

628
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:31,990
What?

629
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:32,290
Yeah.

630
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:34,410
Can someone's toys make them special?

631
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:37,090
Ask a five year old that doesn't have the red fire truck.

632
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:38,230
Of course.

633
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:38,770
Right.

634
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:42,930
This is you know, that's why I keep saying was this juvenile thinking we have.

635
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:45,250
I'm not referring to who wrote the email.

636
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:49,950
I'm just saying if you start expanding and making more discoveries, you'll see it's all

637
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:50,350
tech.

638
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:51,130
Right.

639
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:51,750
It's all tech.

640
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:54,730
So spiritual tech.

641
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:54,990
Right.

642
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,230
Ether technology.

643
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,230
OK, here we go.

644
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,930
Well, this is more of a confirmation.

645
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:04,550
Some info that I have found verified from your sonics include the intestines.

646
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:06,430
I'm an RN at this time.

647
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:10,790
I have personally examined a cross section of the intestine, both large and small.

648
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:16,090
They are, in fact, hydrophobic layers that do not allow for the absorption of water or

649
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:16,710
anything else.

650
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:20,330
The lining of the stomach also exhibits the same qualities.

651
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:25,610
We are all told in school that the GI tract, which is gastrointestinal tract, passes through

652
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:28,450
the body and is not considered an internal organ structure.

653
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:29,270
Yeah, that's right.

654
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:29,690
It's not.

655
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:30,930
It's a it's a tunnel.

656
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:32,850
It is.

657
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:33,270
All right.

658
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:34,370
It is known.

659
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:37,690
And then we are told the exact opposite for license testing.

660
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:41,350
Then they tell you it's an organ because it's it's a critical part.

661
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:46,230
If you remove the GI, you die, basically, even with intravenous feeding.

662
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:46,610
Right.

663
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:53,910
Because it's part of the inner structure, by the way, the because the the entire you

664
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:57,130
have a tunnel, you know, like a tunnel going through a mountain for the train to go through,

665
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:00,650
like a little choo-choo train open for the choo-choo train, little children right to

666
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:00,830
eat.

667
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:01,070
Right.

668
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:02,250
Yeah.

669
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:02,490
Yeah.

670
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:03,230
Don't laugh at that.

671
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:06,730
I came because from the mouth to the anus, everything in between.

672
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:12,790
Well, there's there's complex geometries and other things going on is an open tunnel.

673
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:18,530
So the vacuum that there's a potential loss of vacuum there, right, just like with your

674
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:18,850
skin.

675
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:23,070
So that has to be maintained a certain way energetically, the lymphatics and all that

676
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:23,510
other stuff.

677
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:28,330
By the way, are you guys familiar with the mystery of the appendix like the idiots?

678
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,250
They tell you academics.

679
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:29,910
We don't know.

680
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:30,850
It's part of evolution.

681
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:39,770
It's not the purpose of the appendix is like having a sourdough or mother culture in your

682
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:40,370
fridge.

683
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:43,450
So the next time you make bread, you have the culture.

684
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:51,090
What the appendix holds is the positive intestinal flora and fauna, quote unquote, bacteria things

685
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,110
in storage.

686
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:57,970
So if you eat something or do too much colloidal silver or whatever, that flushes out the natural

687
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:04,410
bugs that and plants, you know, as I said, positive intestinal flora and fauna, bacteria

688
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:05,990
and fungi and other things like that.

689
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:06,270
Right.

690
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:10,130
Out of your system, it could be replenished from the appendix.

691
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:16,230
It's kind of like Jack London's book, The Call of the Wild, when they're running slays

692
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,650
in Alaska and it's really cold.

693
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:23,430
One guy's task was to keep the sourdough starter against his skin so it wouldn't freeze.

694
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:24,410
Right.

695
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:25,590
OK.

696
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:32,570
If you know people who bake breads and things and I've been getting into Napolitano style

697
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:35,350
pizza lately, the starter is important.

698
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:35,790
Right.

699
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:37,790
Maintaining a small piece of culture.

700
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,430
The same with cheese and yogurt.

701
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,030
You always keep a little bit on the side.

702
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:41,270
Right.

703
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:41,710
Right.

704
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,710
How do you start cheese and how do you start yogurt?

705
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:45,490
You got to get some yogurt or some cheese.

706
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:46,370
Right.

707
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:46,770
OK.

708
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:47,870
OK.

709
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:48,290
OK.

710
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:51,230
So anyway, confirmation is good.

711
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:51,510
Yeah.

712
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:59,130
I've had confirmations from several people, including neurosurgeons, which is a long story.

713
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,110
But yes, confirmations all around.

714
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:08,510
I answered many questions to people through the years that are surgery, trauma surgery,

715
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:13,750
neurosurgery, things like that, where they bring up why does this happen or they bring

716
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,250
a case.

717
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:18,150
And very often I ask questions and they're like, oh, we're going to have to meet again

718
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:19,990
because I didn't think to ask that question.

719
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:21,330
Right.

720
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:21,890
Interesting.

721
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:23,050
And then we meet.

722
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:26,310
It's like, wow, I'm asking questions that they didn't think to ask about.

723
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:26,550
Right.

724
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:31,970
And that and then you start developing rapport and you write and you get feedback.

725
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:32,570
How is it?

726
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:32,790
You know.

727
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:33,710
Right.

728
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:34,690
So, yeah.

729
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,110
OK.

730
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:41,230
I've been familiar with the works of Michio Kushi for about 30 years now.

731
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:43,890
I can recall the first book of his that I read.

732
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:48,470
There's a quote that states taking medicine when you're sick is like digging a well when

733
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:48,990
you're thirsty.

734
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:56,790
I believe it was I believe it was a book by Dirk, which book in which Dirk Benedict explained

735
00:33:56,790 --> 00:34:00,730
that he cured his cancer by living outdoors and consuming apples and oats.

736
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:01,530
OK.

737
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:03,550
Just happened to be a good combination for him then.

738
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:10,429
I'm saying that I did find the yin and yang process described within this book to be a

739
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:11,429
bit difficult to process.

740
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:16,830
I did find the yin yang process described within this book to be difficult to process.

741
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:21,070
Are you able to provide any direction to learn about this type of living?

742
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,550
Yeah, I have been.

743
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:24,770
And it's about understanding yin and yang.

744
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:27,510
And I want to go back to that further on.

745
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:28,550
This is on closing.

746
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:32,670
I also remember my younger punk rock days that Harry Christian has integrated themselves

747
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,909
in the Boston music scene.

748
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:35,170
A lot of converts.

749
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:37,670
I would go with some of my friends to their dinners on Sundays.

750
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:39,750
I found the food to be extremely energizing.

751
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:42,370
I often had difficulty sleeping after these meals.

752
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:47,409
There were actually there was actually little need for sleep as the food in a healing way.

753
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:48,870
I could not describe it this time.

754
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,870
And that's pretty much it.

755
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:51,989
Thank you.

756
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,110
So, OK.

757
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:58,850
Back to yin and yang.

758
00:34:59,310 --> 00:34:59,410
Yeah.

759
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:04,730
By the way, I got turned on to the Krishna food.

760
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,470
They would show up with their vans.

761
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,210
We keep saying this because such a good memory.

762
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:13,190
School buses kind of converted and they come out with their saffron robes and they're funky.

763
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:17,970
They shave their head and they leave a little ponytail thing, a little tail in the back sometimes or whatever.

764
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:18,430
Right.

765
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:26,290
And they were serving the most delicious food like basmati rice and things with coconut and sweet and salty.

766
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:29,090
And I was like, this is the most delicious food I've ever eaten in my life.

767
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,090
And I was asking the guy, how do you make this as well?

768
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:38,130
I don't do the cooking, but the spice profile is such that if you threw this plate down on the ground,

769
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:41,450
and you're at the beach or here in the park, no animal would want to eat it.

770
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:42,330
Right.

771
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:48,810
So a seagull, if you're at the beach, it has a food, has a spice profile that no animal wants to eat.

772
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:51,230
It's specifically only humans would eat.

773
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:51,550
Right.

774
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,550
It's a spiritual aspect.

775
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:56,030
No onions or garlic because the energy is too down.

776
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:58,850
So they use hen, which is a substitute for that.

777
00:35:59,330 --> 00:35:59,710
Anyway.

778
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:01,090
Yeah.

779
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:07,350
So I really enjoyed the and it's interesting that he brought that up because I could tell and recount the stories of the Krishna food.

780
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:13,890
The interesting thing, though, is that the new converts, the Westerners, are always told to have as many children as possible.

781
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:14,130
Right.

782
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:14,910
Just like the Pope.

783
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:15,210
Right.

784
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:16,650
Because the more children.

785
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:17,050
Right.

786
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:19,510
And there was a young guy.

787
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:22,150
He looks just like James Dean, John Maudsley.

788
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:24,470
And he looked just like James Dean.

789
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,570
He says, you join the Christians.

790
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:27,030
And he looked just like James Dean.

791
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:28,610
Did I say he looked like James Dean?

792
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:29,950
Yeah, I did.

793
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:30,790
Yeah.

794
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:32,890
But anyway, he looked just like James Dean.

795
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:35,290
And he was easy for him to get girls.

796
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:37,850
And he would just verbatim.

797
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:39,230
This is not a family show.

798
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:40,650
He says, yeah, I just went on a date.

799
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,090
I just want to pump them up with semen.

800
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,270
Like they said at the temple.

801
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:44,950
I'm like, oh, my gosh.

802
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:46,530
Did they really say that at the temple?

803
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,470
He says, no, you know what I mean to have babies.

804
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:52,370
But you said they said to you that that's what they said at the temple.

805
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:53,210
So which one is it?

806
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,770
I was like wondering, like, what the hell?

807
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:55,890
Right.

808
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:57,770
Anyway, that's just a little addendum.

809
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,350
Pump them up with semen.

810
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:01,350
There's a phrase I'm not going to forget for a while.

811
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:02,310
Yeah.

812
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:03,350
That's what he said.

813
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:06,450
And I said, is this what they said at the temple?

814
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:07,910
That's how they said it?

815
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,750
No, just make babies.

816
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:10,370
Make babies.

817
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:11,670
Yeah.

818
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:12,610
But yeah, that's it.

819
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:12,870
Right.

820
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:13,250
Yeah.

821
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:15,010
Anyway, crazy, crazy, crazy.

822
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:18,550
Not as bad as the fingers, you know, not as bad as the fingers in the drawer.

823
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:18,810
Right.

824
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:23,130
So, you know, let's go back to that.

825
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:25,690
The there's an interesting process.

826
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:26,250
OK.

827
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:28,670
Can you imagine looking at, you know, Hollywood?

828
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:33,050
Like, I think it's they put equations on blackboards when there's a

829
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,070
professor or someone.

830
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:34,510
What's that?

831
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:36,670
What's that guy with how you like them apples?

832
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:38,550
The movie The Smart.

833
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:42,970
He was the janitor in the college and goodwill hunting.

834
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:43,590
Goodwill hunting.

835
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:43,850
Yeah.

836
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:44,690
Right.

837
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:44,950
Right.

838
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:46,330
So he would go and do the formulas.

839
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:46,590
OK.

840
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:50,650
Yin and yang getting a good when you get good with the yin and yang, it

841
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:53,290
would be like looking at one of these big equations on a blackboard

842
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:55,590
instantly coming up with the solution instantly.

843
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:57,590
The whole thing, like a like a supercomputer.

844
00:37:58,490 --> 00:37:59,670
That's how your mind has to work.

845
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:03,510
And it's not because you I'm saying this to be discouraged.

846
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:06,370
But once you practice, that's how fast that's how it works.

847
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:07,610
And you do it.

848
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:08,410
How do you do it?

849
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:11,450
How do you make how do you solve one of those big equations?

850
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:13,370
One variable, one piece at a time.

851
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:14,010
Right.

852
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,530
The same way you eat a big animal.

853
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:15,810
Right.

854
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:19,850
But you do it faster and faster to where someone it looks instant.

855
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:20,570
Right.

856
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,410
OK, so let's get into it.

857
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,350
Let's we've been talking.

858
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,650
Keep bringing up nukes.

859
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:28,290
Let's bring up how a nuke works with yin and yang, because that's

860
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:28,890
very dynamic.

861
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,670
You can't get more dynamic than that.

862
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:32,950
OK, because it's a shorting out of the ether.

863
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:35,370
By the way, the atom has never been split.

864
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:38,630
When they tell you it splits the atom, that's because there's

865
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,110
transmutations going on.

866
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:40,330
Right.

867
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:44,470
And the release of gamma radiation and all that stuff from

868
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,530
neutrons and all that.

869
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,190
That's all bullshit.

870
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:48,830
No, no one has ever split an atom because there is no atom.

871
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:50,770
The way they say it doesn't work the way they say.

872
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:51,550
Right.

873
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:55,850
But you might have certain scatterings that can be picked up

874
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:58,870
with certain devices that they call split atoms after the atom

875
00:38:58,870 --> 00:38:59,370
has the effect.

876
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:00,390
Right.

877
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:04,150
What the nuclear detonation is, by the way, you know, the

878
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:06,150
difference between a nuclear device and a nuclear weapon.

879
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:09,270
They're exactly the same thing.

880
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:10,270
One is used in peacetime.

881
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,170
One is used in war.

882
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:12,570
OK, right.

883
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:13,690
Right.

884
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,810
OK, the other thing is nukes do not explode.

885
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:17,450
That's a fallacy.

886
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:18,870
They detonate.

887
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:19,910
The reaction happens.

888
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:24,710
What you call an explosion is how that detonation or that

889
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:26,810
reaction reacts with its nearby environment.

890
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:27,530
Right.

891
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,090
Got it.

892
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:32,110
Just like kind of like gasoline does not burn.

893
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,850
Liquid gasoline does not burn.

894
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,390
You only the vapor does.

895
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:40,750
If you look at a gasoline fire, you have a controlled one.

896
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:42,890
You'll see that the flames are about two or three inches

897
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:43,690
above the liquid.

898
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:44,890
Never from the liquid.

899
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:45,970
It sits on top of the liquid.

900
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:46,230
Yeah.

901
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:46,930
Yeah.

902
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:47,230
Right.

903
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:50,270
So that's why you can flood an engine.

904
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:51,750
You know, try to start.

905
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:51,950
Right.

906
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:52,690
It won't start.

907
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:53,590
It's full of gasoline.

908
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:54,530
Got to dry it out.

909
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:55,530
Vapors only.

910
00:39:56,770 --> 00:40:00,250
OK, so these things are concurrent in many things.

911
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:03,370
We have many misgivings, you know, like the black box on

912
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:04,590
aircraft is not black.

913
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:06,530
It's a bright fluorescent orange or yellow.

914
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:06,790
Right.

915
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:07,230
Right.

916
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:11,090
So we have all these terms that we all agree to use.

917
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:15,590
And we attach the term to the actually what's going on to

918
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:17,890
what the term we agree to use, which is sometimes it doesn't

919
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:18,170
fit.

920
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:19,590
It's not so OK.

921
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:23,990
So when you look at what they call reactor core material,

922
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:27,550
plutonium, uranium, polonium, all these other things

923
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:33,110
from yin and yang, that's a very yin metal.

924
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:33,990
Very yin.

925
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:35,850
It couldn't be more yin than that.

926
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:36,470
Right.

927
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:39,410
So as you go, that's a very large atomic number.

928
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:39,950
Right.

929
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:43,430
As you get smaller atomic numbers, the metals are more

930
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:43,790
yang.

931
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:44,530
OK.

932
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:48,150
So as you get bigger on the atomic numbers, the elements

933
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,410
in general are more yin.

934
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:50,370
So now you have this.

935
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:53,770
You couldn't get more yin than radioactive material.

936
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:56,730
It's the most yin state of any material.

937
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:57,170
Right.

938
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:57,670
OK.

939
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:03,510
So what happens then is the reaction is usually an

940
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:04,890
extremely yang reaction.

941
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:07,870
You have the implosion style trigger and you have the

942
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:08,990
rifle style trigger.

943
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:09,370
Right.

944
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:13,830
Implosion style is for more for the uranium one works

945
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:15,350
best with the rifle style trigger.

946
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:18,130
So what you do, you have this extremely yin material

947
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:21,730
and the trigger, whether it's implosion or rifle, is

948
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:22,770
extremely yang.

949
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:24,150
Right.

950
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:24,670
OK.

951
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:29,910
And it goes in and it super compresses or very, very

952
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:30,410
fast.

953
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:34,030
And it creates the reaction.

954
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:35,410
Right.

955
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:39,790
And because it may be it is so yang, it's accepted.

956
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:45,030
But it's so yang that the trigger has become

957
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:45,550
yin.

958
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:48,110
So now you have too much yin and the reaction.

959
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:48,610
Trigger.

960
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:51,310
And when the action is triggered, it's extremely

961
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:54,170
spread out gamma rays, X-rays.

962
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:57,670
And when the moment it hits something more yang, it

963
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:59,170
makes it even more yang.

964
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:01,470
And you get fire because fire is yang.

965
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:01,710
Right.

966
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:02,450
Cold is yin.

967
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:02,930
OK.

968
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:03,930
Right.

969
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:05,090
You see.

970
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:05,850
So one.

971
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:09,250
So when you look at yin and yang, you have one

972
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:11,730
thing in the middle of its process or what it is

973
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:12,750
being yin or yang.

974
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:15,270
And then the next thing that comes next to it is

975
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:15,950
that yin and yang.

976
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:16,870
And how do they react?

977
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:18,170
Do they react to the yin and yang?

978
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:20,770
And then there's a new thing and then over.

979
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:22,610
And when that new thing happens, where is it?

980
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:23,910
How is it?

981
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:25,250
And then there's a new thing.

982
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:27,830
So you have to constantly yin and yang.

983
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:29,590
Everything that I mentioned with that nuclear

984
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,730
reaction happens in like a thousandth of a second.

985
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:34,210
And then yin and yang flips back and forth.

986
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:34,970
Right.

987
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:37,650
From being too yin to too yang to too yin to

988
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:38,090
too yang.

989
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:41,590
You know, the lot of heat and flame and fire

990
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:43,850
and blast is very yang.

991
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:46,570
And then it flips again.

992
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:48,410
Then after that, everything's very yin because

993
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:49,850
nothing is standing now.

994
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:50,350
Right.

995
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:51,230
Nothing's standing.

996
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:51,570
Right.

997
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:52,110
OK.

998
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:54,650
But when you go look at the stuff, very yin,

999
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:56,270
everything becomes yin, the buildings, the

1000
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:57,870
bridges, the people become so yin.

1001
00:42:58,090 --> 00:42:59,930
But when you go and look at the material, what

1002
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:02,630
was standing that the yin, it's yin because it's

1003
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:03,090
knocked down.

1004
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:04,990
The material is not very yang.

1005
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:06,550
Right.

1006
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:10,350
The person that was standing there, it became

1007
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:11,870
yin because he's no longer standing.

1008
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:12,970
He's powder on the floor.

1009
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:15,630
But if you look at the person turned into

1010
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:18,350
that dry, hard powder, is it yin or yang?

1011
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:19,030
It's yang.

1012
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:22,350
So it's constantly going back and forth

1013
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:22,710
and back.

1014
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:25,450
And it's the yin and yang is flipping back

1015
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:26,030
and forth.

1016
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,170
That's what we you're ready for this.

1017
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:31,150
That is the oscillation, the frequency that

1018
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,170
they're looking for.

1019
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:35,050
You know, like the unified, you know, the

1020
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:36,430
terahertz megahertz.

1021
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:39,250
It's actually terahertz and beyond.

1022
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:40,950
Plankton.

1023
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:43,150
Plankton means unmeasurable, usually

1024
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:45,270
playing plankton like Max Plank.

1025
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:47,330
Who was he was another one like

1026
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:48,690
Einstein. What a jerk off.

1027
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:50,930
Back in the days, he promoted the

1028
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:53,450
quantum stuff.

1029
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:55,070
There was a quote he did.

1030
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:57,370
There was some kind of World's Fair or

1031
00:43:57,370 --> 00:43:59,350
something in Paris or convention.

1032
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:02,250
And the press went and asked him or

1033
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:04,530
someone asked him about how

1034
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:06,110
does this science affect nature?

1035
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:08,510
And he says, science has nothing to do

1036
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:09,030
with nature.

1037
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:10,530
And they caught it.

1038
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:11,730
They caught it in the newspaper.

1039
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:12,150
Right.

1040
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:13,530
So another idiot.

1041
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:16,010
And then they know if he's like the

1042
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:17,270
high, you know, priest.

1043
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:17,710
Right.

1044
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:20,190
So anyway.

1045
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:22,690
Anyway, the yin and yang thing,

1046
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:24,970
you don't get it until you get it.

1047
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:26,890
But here, if it's a mental

1048
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:28,430
thing to get the yin and yang.

1049
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:29,710
Right. That's a mental thing.

1050
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:30,790
Right. How many times you hear that?

1051
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:32,050
Right. You know, sex, by the way, is

1052
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:32,390
mental.

1053
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:32,850
Right.

1054
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:34,970
It's all mental.

1055
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:37,550
Right. Well, you know, there's the

1056
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:40,030
physical vibration, stuff like that,

1057
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:40,310
too.

1058
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:41,110
You know, right.

1059
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:43,570
But most of it, what would people

1060
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:44,850
consider is mental.

1061
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:47,290
So the yin and yang is mental.

1062
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:50,510
You can apply knowing that it's

1063
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:52,230
mental to get the yin and yang.

1064
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:54,090
When you're pondering, just ponder

1065
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:55,970
something that you have no

1066
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:57,090
clue and no answer to.

1067
00:44:57,410 --> 00:44:58,990
But you have the you know, the

1068
00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:00,250
subject matter, let's say.

1069
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:01,890
Let's say I bring up a new subject

1070
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:03,450
to someone or yourself.

1071
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:05,070
Let's say, Chuck, you never heard of

1072
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:05,710
the thing before.

1073
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:06,850
So when you think about it, how am I

1074
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:07,690
supposed to think about it?

1075
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:08,490
I don't know anything about it.

1076
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:10,810
Well, you know what it's called and

1077
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:12,210
you know, a general thing, what it's

1078
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:13,350
about, you know, right.

1079
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:15,490
Shipbuilding or whatever, you know,

1080
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:18,750
there's all these terms, the odd

1081
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:19,630
terms that they have.

1082
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:19,790
Right.

1083
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:21,650
You know, you haven't gotten.

1084
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:22,990
You just know this has to do with

1085
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:24,610
that. OK, ponder it.

1086
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:26,330
Think on it constantly as much as you

1087
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:27,070
can. You know what they call

1088
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:27,670
meditation.

1089
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:30,370
And you are you are actually

1090
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:32,770
a you become so yin because you know

1091
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:33,590
nothing about it.

1092
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:34,930
It's very unfocused.

1093
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:35,490
Right.

1094
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:36,610
So you're spending a lot of time

1095
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:38,130
spread out on basically nothing.

1096
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:38,870
No form.

1097
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:40,210
Right. There's no young for no

1098
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:40,650
structure.

1099
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:41,230
Right.

1100
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:42,830
If you spend a lot of time thinking

1101
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:43,750
about something, there's no

1102
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:44,130
structure.

1103
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:46,270
You are a good candidate for

1104
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:47,830
getting a new download a piece

1105
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:48,890
because what will happen, it'll

1106
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:49,710
have to be balanced.

1107
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:51,630
That yin condition where you know

1108
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:52,890
so little about a subject and

1109
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:54,450
spend so much time thinking about

1110
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:56,610
it, that a young condition

1111
00:45:56,610 --> 00:45:57,790
will come to balance it out.

1112
00:45:57,830 --> 00:45:59,130
And that young condition will be a

1113
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:00,230
sharp and new idea.

1114
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:02,470
And you'll be able to contribute to

1115
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:02,970
the community.

1116
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:04,970
This is how think tanks work with

1117
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:06,010
the cross pollination.

1118
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:07,690
And in

1119
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:09,350
Los Alamos, New Mexico, I don't

1120
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:10,190
know if they do it anymore.

1121
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:11,570
They used to open up the

1122
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:13,250
laboratory and invite people

1123
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:15,250
from the physicists that were based

1124
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:16,970
there. They would invite people

1125
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:18,850
from art community and the music

1126
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:20,330
community and unrelated

1127
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:22,910
fields to physics.

1128
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:24,990
And they would have rooms

1129
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:26,170
where they would go in and the

1130
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:27,310
problem would be posed.

1131
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:28,130
You know, the musicians.

1132
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:29,970
And even though they know nothing

1133
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:31,430
about physics and what they're

1134
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:33,010
trying to solve there, they just

1135
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:34,370
wanted them to give some kind of an

1136
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:35,670
idea or say something, you know,

1137
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:36,430
just to stimulate.

1138
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:36,790
Right.

1139
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:37,450
Right.

1140
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:38,970
And it was very successful.

1141
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:40,430
It's called like from the mouths

1142
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:41,970
of mouths of babes is what I'm

1143
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:42,650
talking about.

1144
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:44,290
That's a yin and yang thing.

1145
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:45,530
Right.

1146
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:47,750
Just like, you know, taking

1147
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:48,850
candy from a baby.

1148
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:50,610
Right. It's very difficult to do.

1149
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:51,990
So don't believe.

1150
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:53,650
Again, the just like

1151
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:55,190
splitting the atom and the black

1152
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:56,550
box and none of those things are

1153
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:57,550
like that. Right.

1154
00:46:58,270 --> 00:46:58,470
Right.

1155
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:00,230
Well, lack of limitation causes

1156
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:01,910
you to, you know, because you're

1157
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:03,670
not limited by the different rules,

1158
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:05,630
different standards, whatever you

1159
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:06,690
could reach way out with the

1160
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:07,430
think tank. Yeah.

1161
00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:09,170
But it's very, you know, because

1162
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:10,030
there's no structure.

1163
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:11,910
So if you want to know

1164
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:13,930
about yin and yang ponder,

1165
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:15,570
I want to know about yin and yang

1166
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:16,670
and kind of when

1167
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:19,550
you ponder it, put the if you don't

1168
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:20,690
know about it means you don't have

1169
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:22,650
the right structure and see you

1170
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:23,730
search for the feeling.

1171
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:25,070
And then if you do that long enough,

1172
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:27,750
the sharp, the sharp, you know, the

1173
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:29,170
the yang will come to mouth.

1174
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:30,730
See, being in a state where

1175
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:32,110
you're spending a lot of time with

1176
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:33,190
something with no structure,

1177
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:35,530
will give you the to be

1178
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:36,950
balanced will have to be something

1179
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:38,730
sharp and sharp and focus.

1180
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:40,670
It happens every time.

1181
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:41,690
OK.

1182
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:45,090
That's definitely a new way to live.

1183
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:46,590
I would have never considered it

1184
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:47,510
that way. That's interesting.

1185
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:48,890
Yeah.

1186
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:50,750
Try it.

1187
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:52,930
So did we finish the emails?

1188
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:55,150
Yeah, that email is done.

1189
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:56,590
Yeah. The other if you go to another

1190
00:47:56,590 --> 00:47:58,470
email, that's we've got 24 questions

1191
00:47:58,470 --> 00:47:59,490
left and it's pretty long.

1192
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:00,770
So I think maybe we'll wrap it up for

1193
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:01,190
this time.

1194
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:04,470
Thank you.
