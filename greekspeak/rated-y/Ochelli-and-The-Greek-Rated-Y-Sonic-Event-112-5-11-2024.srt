1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,280
The Sonic Event 112, Rated Y, and here we are once again.

2
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,240
So, Greek, how are you doing out there in outer space?

3
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,480
Yeah, the usual question.

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,440
Yeah, we were maybe going to talk a little bit about space,

5
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,080
going back to previous discussions.

6
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:32,920
If there is a substrate that's being ignored, if and when there is,

7
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,580
which there has to be, because light, magnetism, and other things

8
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,800
wouldn't work if there was no substrate, because those things are

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,620
things that are shaking something else.

10
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,680
Not a permutation, but a perturbation.

11
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,140
When you perturbate, right?

12
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,420
When you vibrate.

13
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,340
Effectively, a conduit must exist in order for something to travel.

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,340
A medium.

15
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,260
Yeah, fluid.

16
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,520
It's beyond fluid.

17
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,860
Just like gases were called ether a while back.

18
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,420
In other words, mysterious spirits, right?

19
00:01:03,459 --> 00:01:05,060
Because they weren't perceived.

20
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,840
Now, there is perception of the ether quite a bit to the point where,

21
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,760
by the way, I think I did mention there is no intelligent life in the

22
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,680
Midwest of the United States of America, right?

23
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,680
You certainly did.

24
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,660
Yeah, there was bad weather again a few days ago.

25
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:19,540
True enough.

26
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:20,660
Yeah.

27
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,760
You know, there was a storm chaser I was watching,

28
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,800
and they just sit there.

29
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,300
Oh, they were driving by a neighborhood storm chaser,

30
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,440
their window down real slow.

31
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,900
See that up ahead?

32
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,080
And the family on the side was like, I hope it doesn't come here.

33
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,680
I'm like, oh, my gosh.

34
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:37,940
Oh, my gosh.

35
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,060
All you need is go to your water heater, break off the stove pipe,

36
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,340
and you could dissolve all that.

37
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,300
Anyway, we've already established as a fact and the truth,

38
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,740
because I'm witnessing it, there is no intelligent life there.

39
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,180
But the ether is a substrate and a medium, what they call ether,

40
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,800
from the work of Wilhelm Reich and Trevor James Constable,

41
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,900
myself and others, because now those guys are dead.

42
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,820
Now it's people like me and a few others that are left to advance it.

43
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,100
And what I see on the Internet is more

44
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,300
and more people picking up on the old stuff, right,

45
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,520
what was done years ago, what I did 15, 20 years ago.

46
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,680
But they're not even close to what can be done with it.

47
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,420
Well, wouldn't part of that problem be because of a misunderstanding

48
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,640
about the order of things to begin with?

49
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,580
No, there's no misunderstanding.

50
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:26,840
It's not a misunderstanding.

51
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,020
You don't think so?

52
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,980
There's no understanding, no acknowledgment.

53
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,140
It's very easy to understand.

54
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,460
There's no acknowledgment.

55
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,740
Okay, but here's my question about this.

56
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,700
How about the fact that most people believe that things exist in this order?

57
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,840
There's space, and then you can put things in a space, right?

58
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,520
No space.

59
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,320
No, no.

60
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,580
Then they occupy that space, and that's our 3-D reality,

61
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,100
according to most people, right?

62
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,740
Isn't that the way most people think about it?

63
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,260
Well, let's just say this.

64
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,820
When there is a distance between the boundary layers of two objects,

65
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,360
regardless of what material it is, we call that space.

66
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,460
Yeah, okay.

67
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,580
But now we're thinking about weather work,

68
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,680
and that's always been addressing the ethers,

69
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,360
and it's a non-perceptible medium that everything, right?

70
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,060
So light is when this ether is perturbated, when it's vibrated.

71
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,760
Well, is it fair to say that it's imperceptible,

72
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,120
or is it fair to say that you just don't have the right lens for perception?

73
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,080
Because most people are working on the concept that displacement.

74
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:30,260
The way that science allows us to perceive stuff is perverted.

75
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,920
We have a perverted mentality, and that's a proper word.

76
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,020
It's juvenile and perverted, just like someone who was raised on junk food.

77
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,060
Well, fair enough.

78
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:47,020
If you give them good food, the spectrum of the parts of their taste buds that would actually,

79
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,680
the receptors that would be needed or required to get stimulated would not be stimulated.

80
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,840
Well, everything becomes tuned in an entirely different way

81
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,940
depending on what is fed to the organism.

82
00:03:59,220 --> 00:03:59,360
Okay.

83
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:04,140
But my point is that a lot of people think of things in terms of displacement, right?

84
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,500
Because in order for something, there's either space or there's an object

85
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,680
or there's a substance.

86
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,280
Well, that's a good one.

87
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:12,860
But hold on.

88
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,080
Let's use water.

89
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,339
Water, fluid, medium is a very easy one.

90
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,480
If you have, like last week, we had a medical person say that

91
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:27,320
they acknowledged the inside lining of the GI, gastrointestinal tract, all that is hydrophobic.

92
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,700
As a matter of fact, it rejects water, so how can any absorption take place, right?

93
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,080
Right.

94
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,000
So let's go the opposite way.

95
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,180
Let's say we live in a hydrophilic reality.

96
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,960
You know how they do animations in imaginary worlds.

97
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:46,400
Imagine you live – this is beyond fish underwater because fish have to drink water also.

98
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,540
By the way, when you poison a river, you notice all the fish don't die at once

99
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,780
unless it's an extreme poison.

100
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,180
The ones that die first are the ones that are thirstiest

101
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,720
because they're the ones that drink the water first, right?

102
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,800
So just like if you poison the air, not everyone dies at the same rate.

103
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,520
It's the ones that are taking deeper breaths and breathing more, right?

104
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,780
If you hold your breath, you won't ingest.

105
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:14,320
So let's say we live in an imaginary – OK, let's just construct an imaginary world

106
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,400
where everything is permeable to water.

107
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:23,440
So you've got sponges, cotton towels, paper, pumice stone, right?

108
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,360
It's completely absorbent.

109
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:30,020
Things that are hydrophilic that allow water to pass through them, right?

110
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,240
So you live in a world that's made of sponges, let's say, and paper and foam

111
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,780
and – oh, what else?

112
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,760
You know, flour, right?

113
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,000
I mean as in wheat flour.

114
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,100
Things that absorb and take on water very readily.

115
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,980
They don't repel water at all.

116
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,340
Imagine everything is like that in a certain universe, right?

117
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,220
Why would it have to be that way though considering that you're in a fluidic –

118
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,700
Well, because that's how – this is an analogy for the ether.

119
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:03,860
Now imagine that world and imagine the structure still holding its identity

120
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,720
but allowing water to fully permeate it, right?

121
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,200
A sponge, a cotton towel, whatever, right?

122
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,820
It doesn't have to be but it can't – let's say if it's underwater, it will be.

123
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,640
You stick a cotton towel underwater, you deep-six it or a sponge.

124
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,460
You're going to pull it out and it's going to be soaking wet.

125
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,840
Water will permeate, right?

126
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:27,660
So imagine all the materials and all the experiences and everything in the world

127
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:32,320
that we're in now is permeable to the ether, right?

128
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,160
So the ether is passing through it, filling it, right?

129
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,740
So now let's go back to the fully permeable world,

130
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,840
the world where everything is a sponge or a cotton towel.

131
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,600
The water will be held in the cotton towel different than the sponge

132
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,880
because if you look at the cotton structure, it's a little different than the sponge, right?

133
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,960
But it's still the same water.

134
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,540
Right, but it's holding it. It's not actually getting –

135
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,020
It's also permeable. In other words, if you lift the sponge out of the water,

136
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,520
you'll notice the water runs out even before you wring it out.

137
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,240
Same with a towel.

138
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,480
You drop a towel in a swimming pool and pull it out,

139
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,580
you'll notice streams of water coming off of it, right?

140
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,360
Yeah, it will pour off of it first. Yeah, right.

141
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:14,820
Yeah, and if you hang the sponge and the clothesline on a clothesline, let's say,

142
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,220
and come back a half hour later without wringing them out,

143
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,600
you'll notice the cotton towel is really heavy still

144
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,720
and loaded with water where the sponge is pretty much dried out.

145
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,860
Right, it's still holding.

146
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:29,300
Okay, so this analogy I'm giving to the ether being water and all things permeable,

147
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:33,120
the sponge, the towel, whatever, is all things that we come in contact with.

148
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,300
So it's really difficult to kind of understand that because we –

149
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,740
when we say permeable, we have to actually see a sponge or a cotton towel.

150
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,200
We don't understand that metal or diamond, let's say a hard material.

151
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,240
Everyone would say the hardest material is carbon, diamond.

152
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,220
It's still permeable to this ether. We live in this type of world.

153
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:56,420
Now, because it's so pervasive, we don't pay attention to it, right?

154
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,520
The same way like I give – the little philosophical tone that I give,

155
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:05,040
like maybe the last thing a fish thinks about right before he dies or she dies

156
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,360
is that they're in water, right?

157
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,100
Because you have this philosopher fish.

158
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,480
You have philosophers. You go to all the other fish, all the schools of fish, right?

159
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,160
They tell me, hey, guys, I think I got this theory. It's more than a theory.

160
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,600
It might be provable that we're all in water, right?

161
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,780
We're all like swimming in this thing called water.

162
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,440
They're like, oh, this guy is crazy. This guy with his crazy stuff.

163
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,300
Get out of here with that. You know what I mean?

164
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,140
So it's kind of – that's an interesting analogy.

165
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:38,419
So I would say that this permeability aspect is very difficult to get over

166
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:42,039
because we make containers to hold fluids and gases, right?

167
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,500
That shouldn't be permeable, and they're not for those things.

168
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:50,140
I can give an account from – this is a secondhand account from someone that worked with hydrogen.

169
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:57,000
You can replace gasoline vapor, gasoline in an engine with various other fuels, right?

170
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,160
So one of them is hydrogen and oxygen.

171
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,460
By the way, when you drive a gasoline car, they call that thing the gas pedal

172
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,640
and the brake and the clutch, right?

173
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,000
They call that thing the gas pedal.

174
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,520
That's not a pedal for gas. That's actually a pedal for air.

175
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,420
It's really an air pedal.

176
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,980
Whenever you use it – the only time it's for gas is –

177
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,700
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

178
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,740
We just got a ton of interference off you, like your signal just broke up.

179
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,360
I'm sorry.

180
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,980
Oh, that's fine. It must be on your end because everything sounds cool here.

181
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:40,380
Yeah, last thing I got was about the gas pedal, and then you went robotics.

182
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:40,800
Sorry.

183
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,160
Oh, okay.

184
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,680
It's really an air pedal.

185
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:44,300
Air pedal.

186
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,580
All right, let's just go back to the fuel thing.

187
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:52,540
So you have a hydrogen gas, which is like the fastest speeds per second, you know, once it's ignited.

188
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,400
You know, in high-speed chemistry, it's usually measured in meters per second,

189
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,240
feet per second expansion rate, right?

190
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,560
Or contraction if it's implosive, which is very rare.

191
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,460
What they did was they tried to take some buses.

192
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,720
This, by the way, also happens when they go high altitude.

193
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,320
I'll finish – I'll give you the details on that.

194
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,120
Make this a short story.

195
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,340
They basically took some municipal buses and said,

196
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,720
let's run them on hydrogen instead of this dirty diesel, right?

197
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:18,220
Okay.

198
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:23,300
So they filled up these tall tanks with hydrogen gas, and the engines run like crap, right?

199
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,300
One of the buses ran really, really well, right?

200
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,300
And they went over to the tanks, and the tanks were all at zero, the pressure.

201
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:36,880
The other ones were at 2,000, 2,500, 1,200 psi, right, of gas in the tank.

202
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:41,200
So the one that kept running really well, they're looking at the tank, and they're like,

203
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,200
there's no gas in here.

204
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,660
There's no hydrogen gas in here because everything is at zero.

205
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,340
The tank, the seal is broken or something, and the bus is still running.

206
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,500
It doesn't make any sense, right?

207
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:51,920
Now, okay.

208
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:56,960
So what – a couple of smart guys got together and talked to this guy, Joe Booker in Australia,

209
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,260
and this is what they came up with.

210
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:05,040
Why don't we take these tanks and cut them in a way where we can access the full diameter

211
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,340
of the tank because usually it's just a little hole for the nozzle to fit on top, right?

212
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,260
Gas tank.

213
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,520
I'm talking about compressed air, compressed gases.

214
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:11,920
Yeah.

215
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,680
So they cut the bottom of the tank off.

216
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:18,380
They made like a flange fitting, and they stuffed it with aluminum honeycomb, and they

217
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:24,200
pumped it up with 2,000 pounds of pressure of hydrogen, left it in there overnight, and

218
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:29,940
the next morning they removed all the hydrogen so there's nothing in the tank, and the

219
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,020
bus ran off of that.

220
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,820
It doesn't make any sense.

221
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,320
Not the way I understand things normally.

222
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,360
No, that makes no sense.

223
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,500
Raytheon – I read something that was put out by Raytheon a long time ago.

224
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:47,340
They tried to go out into space because space is not a vacuum, by the way, right?

225
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,580
So anyway, they opened the hatch.

226
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,600
We're talking about like high altitude, low orbit.

227
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,740
They can't really – there's no evidence that they've gone more than a few hundred

228
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,720
miles away, right?

229
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,160
From their own testimony.

230
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,700
But they go up as high as they can, and they have these pumps, and they suck in whatever

231
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,860
gases are in space.

232
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,700
They put it in the tank, and they bring it back to Earth, and there's nothing in the

233
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:10,900
tank.

234
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,100
They had pressure.

235
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:18,300
They had measurable things, but the tank did not have a leak.

236
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,420
So what happened?

237
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,080
That gas went right through the walls of the tank.

238
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,140
It's called imponderable fluid, imponderable gases.

239
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:35,160
So an imponderable fluid would be the most current situation with current science, which

240
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,200
is kind of a joke.

241
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,380
I spell science P-S-Y-I-A-E-N-C.

242
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:40,860
Yeah.

243
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,280
It's all PSIOP.

244
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:48,140
Well, how does a fluid travel through something that is not supposed to be forced?

245
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,420
There's a whole category.

246
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,920
It was very popular in the late 1700s up to mid-1800s.

247
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,120
It was called imponderable fluids.

248
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,800
An imponderable fluid in today's modern system would be liquid helium.

249
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,480
When you pour it into a glass – it's very cold, of course – it runs up the side

250
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,000
of the glass and overflows, even though you just have a small amount in it.

251
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,780
It runs outside of the glass and runs all over the table.

252
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,860
It doesn't want to be in a cup.

253
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,600
So they call that an imponderable fluid.

254
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,620
There are certain combinations of ammonia and other things like that that if you put

255
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,740
in a jar with a wax seal – I'm talking about a really well, hermetically sealed

256
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,360
jar lid.

257
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,120
Put a wax seal on it, epoxy seal, whatever.

258
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,860
You come back the next day and there's nothing in it.

259
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,000
Well, I shouldn't say nothing.

260
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,620
Half of the stuff is in the jar.

261
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,680
The other half is in the table.

262
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,460
And you look at the jar.

263
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,040
It's not cracked.

264
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,180
How did it go through the glass?

265
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,320
Those are called imponderable fluids, imponderable gases.

266
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,640
It means you can't ponder.

267
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,660
They have a set of rules.

268
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:51,280
This is what they call – they're not laws of physics or laws of nature or Newton's

269
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:51,440
laws.

270
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,420
Those are merely observations, right?

271
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,840
Because they practice exclusion.

272
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,020
When they find something that doesn't follow those laws, they don't tell you about it.

273
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,240
They exclude it, right?

274
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,380
So it's kind of like you see the legal system.

275
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,120
We can't allow that into evidence.

276
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,780
There's other stuff you could leave in, right?

277
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,780
Because if you show this thing, there's no case, right?

278
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,780
Yeah, right.

279
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,300
Yeah, that's the same thing with them.

280
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:16,480
If you show everything that can be seen, there's no case for Newton's law or laws of thermodynamics.

281
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,040
Example, when somebody asks, what law did I actually break?

282
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,620
And they go, well, we don't have to show you the law because – right.

283
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:23,420
Yeah.

284
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,140
Well, because – well, it's illegal.

285
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,540
Here's something, if you want to talk about the imponderable.

286
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:34,180
If you ever deal with those assholes legal, what you can do is also include – there's

287
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:39,680
no legislative act of any government that says that the bar association or bar agents

288
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,760
are to exclusively run the court system.

289
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,880
Who the hell put them in charge?

290
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,840
As a matter of fact, in the United States, you can still look this up.

291
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,380
The Department of Justice history.

292
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,500
Do a search online.

293
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,800
History of the Department of Justice.

294
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,480
Even Wikipedia and other websites say it's a historic anomaly.

295
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,880
We don't know where it came from.

296
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,660
It just came out in like 18-whatever and Grant signed it and didn't tell anyone,

297
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,920
President Grant or whatever.

298
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,580
So it's like who – where do these guys come from, right?

299
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,100
This is mainstream, what I'm telling you, right?

300
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,000
But the people love it that way.

301
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,020
For example, if you run through the system and are charged with a felony and you serve

302
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,400
prison time, everyone thinks you're bad because you're – they can indict a hand

303
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,360
sandwich, right?

304
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,360
Like Rod Class.

305
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,380
They can indict anything.

306
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,860
As a matter of fact, there's some old newspapers from the 1700s.

307
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,060
It's called Rare Newspapers and Magazines website.

308
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,100
They sell these things and occasionally I would do screenshots of what they were selling.

309
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:38,380
Under George Washington's regime, they would send federal agents out and they would

310
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:42,960
confiscate people doing trade and then they would – what did I do wrong for – nothing.

311
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,160
But this bag here, this bag of coffee, they actually list the items.

312
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,300
We're suing them for libel because those bags of coffee are libelous, right?

313
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:53,780
OK.

314
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,120
Yeah, this is how bizarre and this is – and the people love this stuff.

315
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:58,860
So they deserve it.

316
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,460
That's why they – like what did I say about the Midwest?

317
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,220
Right.

318
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,260
I'm looking at the Department of Justice website, right?

319
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,100
Department of –

320
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:08,980
No, not their website.

321
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,600
Not their website.

322
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,620
I've never been to their website and neither would I ever want to go.

323
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:12,960
OK.

324
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:13,980
No problem.

325
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:14,900
I was just looking at it.

326
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,980
I just typed that in.

327
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,220
That was the first thing that came up.

328
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,300
You want me to go to Wikipedia?

329
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:23,120
If you type in history of the Department of Justice, you will see the title moniker.

330
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,000
Yeah, that's what I did and it brought me to their website.

331
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,020
But you want me to go to Wikipedia instead you said, right?

332
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:29,540
No, no.

333
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,700
Just run down the websites and you know how they list a website.

334
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,000
They will give a sentence or two.

335
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,440
Yeah, sure.

336
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,180
So when I put in –

337
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:40,400
Just hear what they show now because what I'm telling you was pretty much up on the

338
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,760
internet for over a decade.

339
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,320
They're over –

340
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,680
Well, history Department of Justice, what I have is UnitedStatesDepartmentofJustice.gov.

341
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,520
That's the first thing that comes up, history.

342
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,380
Next thing is 150 years of Department of Justice.

343
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,040
That's under another .gov website.

344
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,920
Then Wikipedia is the third thing.

345
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,980
That's what I'm getting.

346
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,700
Library of Congress, the creation of the Department of Justice.

347
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:07,040
Anything, any salacious comment?

348
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,040
Well, I'll click on it.

349
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,220
It doesn't seem to have –

350
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:10,320
Really?

351
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,260
It just kind of has a general sort of description.

352
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:12,859
Let's see here.

353
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:20,000
It is a curiosity of history that while the Office of Attorney General of the United States

354
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,859
was created by the first Congress as part of the Judiciary Act of 1789, the Department

355
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:29,880
of Justice was not authorized until over 80 years later in 1870.

356
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,840
It's curious.

357
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:31,260
Yeah.

358
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:31,720
OK.

359
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:36,800
If you keep going, eventually you'll land into some details like where did it come from?

360
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,980
Who issued it?

361
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,660
Why was it signed in secret?

362
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,260
Not really in secret, but no one was told.

363
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:44,720
Yeah.

364
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:49,200
It says from 1797 the attorneys were supervised.

365
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,860
Only a few cases would arise.

366
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:56,020
1861, Congress finally agreed that the attorney general should have supervisory powers over

367
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,360
the work of the United States attorneys.

368
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:58,840
OK.

369
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,680
This is a weird sort of like –

370
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,700
It is, but the Department of Justice specifically is considered a historic anomaly.

371
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,920
I've come over, over, and over, and over on stuff online.

372
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,920
I never bothered to look at it in print because I was not that interested years ago when I

373
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:19,040
had access to more authentic, let's say, study material.

374
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:19,540
OK.

375
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:23,900
I don't consider after 9-11 stuff that's in public libraries or university libraries

376
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:28,160
that's considered up-to-date to be authentic at all.

377
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,940
You have to find the old stuff, right?

378
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:31,740
OK.

379
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,220
No, no.

380
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:32,760
I get that.

381
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,520
Yeah, because right now they reprint books, by the way, and leave the original publishing

382
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,940
date instead of including a new reprint date.

383
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:40,820
Right.

384
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,680
They can do that now.

385
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,980
They often do that.

386
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,180
Let's see.

387
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:44,780
Judiciary.

388
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,760
According to this, like the Judiciary Act of 1789 established the office –

389
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,360
No, that's different.

390
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,780
That's attached with the Treasury and all these other things.

391
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,080
Yeah, no.

392
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,820
We're talking about the Department of DOJ, which is a three-letter.

393
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:02,600
That's one of the earliest three-letter agencies, which is not part of the government,

394
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,200
but it works.

395
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,860
It's a quasi-government agency.

396
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,540
I got you.

397
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,280
No, it's just –

398
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,120
It's the –

399
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:07,640
OK.

400
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,280
Let's break it down.

401
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,120
It's the Bar Association, which –

402
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:10,640
OK.

403
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,520
Here's one thing.

404
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,100
North Korea, Iran, Axis of Evil.

405
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:14,920
Remember Baby Bush?

406
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:15,520
Oh, yeah.

407
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,920
Guess what their legal system is.

408
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,000
If you go, it's the North Korean Bar.

409
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:20,780
Yeah.

410
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,940
If you go to Iraq or Iran – I'm sorry, Iran.

411
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,640
It's the Iranian Bar.

412
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,780
Greece, the Greek Bar.

413
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,080
Russia, the Russian Bar.

414
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,160
It's the Bar Association.

415
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,720
In the UK, it's the Temple Bar Association.

416
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,520
Whatever.

417
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,220
Yeah, in Canada.

418
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,620
Yeah, also in Australia.

419
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:40,440
So this whole thing – but none of these governments have ever passed a legislative

420
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,400
act enacting that they are the only ones that can run these courts, but yet they do.

421
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,320
Yeah, yeah.

422
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,160
But you know what?

423
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,540
This is how the people like it, so fuck them, meaning the people.

424
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:54,280
This is what they want, Kardashian and all that other shit.

425
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:54,500
Yeah, I got you.

426
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:58,540
And the only thing they keep saying throughout all these websites, by the way, is that they

427
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,800
are supposed to supervise the attorneys.

428
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,040
Right.

429
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,000
Well, what they do also, they can't bring a case.

430
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:08,140
So you have to be an officer of the government to bring a case through them, and they're

431
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,280
actually bringing cases out.

432
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,360
It's just ridiculous.

433
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,320
It's a shit show.

434
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,000
It's a dumpster fire of a world.

435
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,820
The people – look.

436
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:15,740
Here's the thing.

437
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:20,100
When someone gets arrested who's popular, if just a few thousand people show up to the

438
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,000
jail, they'll let them out.

439
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,700
This is historically proven, by the way.

440
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,140
But the people are so brainwashed.

441
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,900
Let's say someone gets railroaded, right, into jail, a popular person.

442
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,880
It doesn't have to be in the show business.

443
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,980
If a few thousand people show up to the jail – I don't mean with picket signs and stuff.

444
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,200
Just say let him out, let him out.

445
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,400
They will let him out.

446
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,620
The same with the courthouse.

447
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,800
They will let him out because they're private.

448
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,040
They're not going to bring in an army.

449
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,740
They're not going to bring in whatever.

450
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,220
It's not a government thing.

451
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,120
It's just like someone being held at a frat party and they won't let him go.

452
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,940
The other dorm goes over there and says let him go.

453
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,720
They will eventually.

454
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,900
I mean in a very short period of time.

455
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:03,320
But the people have been pacified to the point where they're brainwashed and they think

456
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,120
it's a real authority.

457
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:04,680
It's not.

458
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:10,040
It's been acting like a real authority for so long that now it is.

459
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,040
Do you have any view on this?

460
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:17,060
I'm reading through some stuff while I'm listening to you, but this oddity about the

461
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,060
phrase that's on their seal, their motto?

462
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:21,800
No.

463
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,980
Yeah, I think they should print toilet paper with that stuff on it.

464
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,080
But no, I don't know.

465
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:27,800
Yeah, no problem.

466
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,600
But it's most certainly Latin, right?

467
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,400
Yeah, it's Latin.

468
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,900
But the weird thing is that people have written various times over the years to the Department

469
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,660
of Justice and asked them for the meaning of the motto that is on their seal.

470
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:46,400
And apparently every response they ever get back is they don't know what it means, is

471
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,000
what they say.

472
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:47,520
They're attorneys.

473
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,100
They don't know.

474
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,160
They're not supposed to know.

475
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,280
Which is funny to me.

476
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:56,520
But it's, yeah, it's equipro domina justia seplater.

477
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,280
Simple as that.

478
00:21:58,940 --> 00:21:59,340
Sorry.

479
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,280
It's a bunch of nonsense.

480
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,280
Anything that comes out of them is nonsense.

481
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,200
It's all presumption.

482
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,140
It's legal fiction.

483
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,580
Do I sound like I don't like them?

484
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,780
It's not that I don't like them.

485
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,140
I don't like what they do.

486
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,300
I don't care about them.

487
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:10,520
Right.

488
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,640
I just don't like what they're doing.

489
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:16,320
And what's even worse, I don't like that the people are allowing it.

490
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,780
So the people are far worse than they are.

491
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,020
Don't ever don't ever ensue that.

492
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,240
What I'm saying is I don't like any form of leadership or system anywhere because it wouldn't

493
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,220
be in place for more than a week if the people didn't allow it to.

494
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,520
So it's the people that suck.

495
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:32,580
Right.

496
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,280
Right.

497
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:33,940
OK.

498
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,560
Little.

499
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:39,600
You see this since the 1950s, the little green men in space flying saucer land and they see

500
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,720
some idiot walking the street.

501
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,380
What do they say to him since 19?

502
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,080
Take me to your leader.

503
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,820
I got to talk to you.

504
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,240
Who the hell are you?

505
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,000
What are you?

506
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:49,500
Right.

507
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,140
So.

508
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:55,320
So in other words, this system of fiefdom where you have the ignorant masses that pretty

509
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,540
much will go along with anything.

510
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,580
I've said this a long time ago since the early Greeks speak that you can pretty much do anything

511
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,820
to the people and they'll go.

512
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:02,700
They'll go along with it.

513
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:07,100
You just have to go along with the convention that they're used to accepting.

514
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:07,520
Right.

515
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,560
And they'll go along with anything.

516
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,360
It seems like this system is pervasive.

517
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:17,560
If it's shown that aliens from another world come and do this in art, in theater, it shows

518
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,040
that it's an echo outside of this system.

519
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:24,020
Also, you know, one thing Jordan Maxwell said a long time ago, as on Earth as in heaven.

520
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,220
And so in heaven, they have corrupt bankers and corrupt leaders.

521
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,320
And right.

522
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:33,380
I've always found that curious myself, where it's like, look, above as below.

523
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:33,740
Right.

524
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,360
And so they say, as in heaven, as on Earth, blah, blah, blah.

525
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,540
So it's corrupt up there.

526
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,660
And if you read the biblical texts that tell you there's war in heaven, there's great

527
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,060
violence.

528
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:41,740
Right.

529
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,260
So what do you know?

530
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,540
You're going to want to die and go to heaven?

531
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,060
No, thanks.

532
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:46,860
I never understood.

533
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,260
I think the parties will be better in hell, by the way.

534
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,260
They have to be.

535
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,520
But anyway.

536
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,960
With a rudimentary understanding of Latin, though, it's kind of funny because even the

537
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,760
way that like if you try Google Translator even on their stupid.

538
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,680
No, no, it won't.

539
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:02,900
Yeah.

540
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,120
Yeah.

541
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:07,000
Well, you know, the NSA website is Illuminati backwards.

542
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:07,400
Right.

543
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:12,520
Someone told me to write Illuminati backwards and then he gave me the link.

544
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,300
Yeah.

545
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,540
And you click on it.

546
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,400
It's NSA, National Security Agency.

547
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,580
Are you familiar with that?

548
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,940
No, I've never heard that before.

549
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:19,300
Do that.

550
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:19,820
Just do it.

551
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,360
Go right now.

552
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:20,800
Do a search.

553
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,080
NSA website is Illuminati backwards.

554
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:23,480
It is.

555
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:28,680
OK, just spell Illuminati backwards dot gov or whatever dot org.

556
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,660
And it brings you to the NSA page is the NSA.

557
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,940
Well, this page that they put up.

558
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,100
OK, let's see.

559
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,280
All right.

560
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:42,780
Let's see.

561
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,140
You know what?

562
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:47,420
I'm going to try and punch it in because I went for results on it and there's a whole

563
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,680
bunch of discussion on it.

564
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,360
But does Illuminati spell backwards?

565
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,900
But in other words, it's evidence in the discussion, isn't it?

566
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,520
Let's see.

567
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:55,820
Does Illuminati spell backwards on lead to the NSA?

568
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:00,560
And the domain Illuminati dot com spelled backwards points to the website of the U.S.

569
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,660
National Security Agency.

570
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,060
True.

571
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:07,920
Even according to Quora and all those, you know, like debunking websites, even Snopes.

572
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:08,840
Yeah.

573
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,700
So they're valid.

574
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,360
It's true.

575
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:10,780
Yeah.

576
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:11,980
Yeah.

577
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,620
So it's kind of a joke.

578
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:18,680
I haven't I've learned in my, you know, I'm going to be in my seventh decade here soon

579
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:22,060
that don't take anything seriously here.

580
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:22,580
Hey, look.

581
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,660
OK, these systems of leadership exist because the people allow them.

582
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:30,260
What are most people? What's the most popular stuff on the Internet?

583
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,620
Weather, pornography.

584
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:32,720
What else?

585
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,620
Drugs. I mean, well, you know, I don't know.

586
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,200
Whatever. Right. What's.

587
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,840
Yeah. It was a 38 percent or 30 percent.

588
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,320
All stuff is porn. Right.

589
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,800
Well, there's a lot of porn.

590
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,360
Yeah. There's always food since its inception.

591
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:50,060
Well, I think I told you the guy visited.

592
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,560
This is back in the late 90s.

593
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,060
Tibet. Tibetan monks.

594
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,840
And they fired up some kind of satellite Internet thing.

595
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,080
And they left the computer there with them for 45 minutes.

596
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,880
They came in and every computer was on porn with the monks.

597
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,200
All the monks went to porn.

598
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,040
All the monks were on porn in 45 minutes.

599
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,120
Never saw a computer before.

600
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,840
But that's all it took.

601
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,400
So maybe they're right.

602
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:18,920
You know, getting high, being on drugs, having sex, you know, getting whatever.

603
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,660
You know, that that that thing that it's easy to make fun of the people for doing.

604
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,500
I think they're right.

605
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,180
I think they're right about it.

606
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,240
It's not just not my cup of tea.

607
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,600
Let's just say. Right.

608
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:35,940
But I think there's I think there's actually, you know, it's actually admonished in ancient texts.

609
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,180
Don't be like that. Right.

610
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:37,900
Yeah, of course.

611
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:45,520
Yeah. But but for for if you're going to be like that and, you know, it's the way to fit in or it's the norm.

612
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,900
I really don't see anything wrong with it because of everything else they're allowing.

613
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:53,020
You see, it's a package deal.

614
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:57,240
Why complain about Aleister Crowley considering the condition of the rest of the world?

615
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,560
Yeah. Yeah. Right.

616
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:03,760
So it's a package deal. In other words, it's really difficult when you don't take the package deal.

617
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,860
Right. It's what they're doing is just taking everything off the sales floor, whatever is ready, you know, take it and go.

618
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:09,920
No options. Right.

619
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,560
You know, so this is how it comes.

620
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,120
That's why I mean, often it's I'm just visiting here and I'm really pissed that they sent me here.

621
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:23,020
I must be here on it on an administrative error because because I can't find anything that I'm supposed to be doing here.

622
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,280
Really? Well, you see now.

623
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:30,880
And that's another weird concept that people often say, look, you chose to be here and this and that before you got here.

624
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,960
The memory wipe covers that really well.

625
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,660
Yeah.

626
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:38,040
They do say that your memory is completely wiped and that covers the base on that.

627
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:43,620
But there's also hints and clues that there is a thing they ran on Netflix.

628
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,660
Eighteen ninety nine for one season.

629
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:49,280
And I caught that I streamed most of it.

630
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,520
And in the end is great. Just the last three minutes of the last episode.

631
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,580
Right. It pretty much says it all.

632
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,180
I think there's a little short YouTube clip on that.

633
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,660
They're basically on a spaceship going through the universe and they're running simulations.

634
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,760
Right. OK.

635
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:07,860
And while they're on the ship, the whole series is about being on a steamship going across the Atlantic in 1899.

636
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,820
And, you know, what the setting would be like on a steamship in 1899.

637
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:16,860
They open a cabinet, they run into people and things and there's anomalous things going on.

638
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,160
You're like, what the hell is this?

639
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,980
That's because there's like a little breakdown in code.

640
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,140
Right. Like kind of like the Matrix code is changed.

641
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:32,360
Yeah. There was some failed TV show like I think in the 1990s where like they set people out into space in the 1960s.

642
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:41,240
And they continued the culture exactly like that because they were like the last whatever of mankind they thought or they could be very soon somehow.

643
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,600
And they were stuck in the 60s.

644
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,680
And then you go through the whole show and it turns out, by the way, that the capsule never left Earth.

645
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:54,300
But it was the weirdest thing because they did this whole thing to maintain who you could breed with and all this.

646
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,240
So they were generationally handling it and all that.

647
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:02,180
And one wonders sometimes if that's not the point of the simulation.

648
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,180
You know, like that's what it's really about.

649
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:08,840
And at some point somebody is going to open the door and go, you know what's actually going on out here?

650
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:13,820
Well, here's the thing. One other hint that it's a simulation is you can't do anything about anything here.

651
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:19,600
Right. And when these changes happen, you see it's the same people that are doing the other stuff that are behind it.

652
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:24,480
Right. Proof of that recently, also, there's many.

653
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,840
If you look at alternative media, some places, you know, half a million people showed up to protest, whatever.

654
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,020
And it's not on the mainstream news at all. Right.

655
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,280
So it shows you that certain things and then you'll have a place where there's 400 people protesting.

656
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,340
It's all over the mainstream news. Right. So it's all control.

657
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,120
Well, 15 people show up and they make it. Yeah.

658
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:47,060
And so anyway, just to go back to the beginning of what we started, that the ether is permeable,

659
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:54,360
giving the analogy of fully hydrophilic permeable objects and how they drain out water and how they all take on water.

660
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,240
What is it now? You know, this is something we can go on.

661
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:03,760
If people here have listened to Ken Wheeler, this is like Ken Wheeler 2.0 type stuff we can get into.

662
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:06,800
And I don't think it's necessary. I like to use more basic language.

663
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:15,560
But the idea of a magnet, the idea of light, the idea of hyper what I call hyper agitations like gamma,

664
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,900
you know what they call radiation, gamma, alpha, beta, all that stuff, right.

665
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:23,580
X-rays, what they call that hyper modulation and all that stuff.

666
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:29,140
All that's in the ether, in the medium, just like you would be a towel or a sponge in the water. Right.

667
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:33,100
And it would be hyper ultrasonic bath. Right. Kind of thing in the water.

668
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:37,100
So this permeability can be worked with, but we can't.

669
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:42,520
If you spent your entire universe as a towel or a sponge, many generations in the water,

670
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:47,300
it would be really hard to make something to measure the water that you're already submerged in, isn't it?

671
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,560
You'd have to separate it. That's true.

672
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:54,300
And after all, even if you wanted to wring out the towel, if you try and do it underwater,

673
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,820
you can't do it while you're still in the water, can you?

674
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:01,320
You could. You could. Actually, in a vacuum, actually in a vortex tube,

675
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:08,760
we vortexed some clay type sand so intensely, it formed these little balls in the bottom of the vessel.

676
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:12,240
And when we removed the balls from the water, cracked them open,

677
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,740
they were totally dry, powder dry on the inside. Right.

678
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,300
Because of the intense vacuum of the vortex. And this only happened once.

679
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:22,660
We tried to repeat it. It was very difficult. We just weren't able to repeat it.

680
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:27,880
But we had it with witnesses. So, yeah, it can be, but it's also very, very obtuse.

681
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:40,100
The ether, though, is what you have to learn to respect or what modes it goes into to control the weather to a certain degree.

682
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,360
And yes, the weather is very controllable, especially when you see the bad weather.

683
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:49,420
The bad weather is completely unnecessary.

684
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:56,360
So did I ever get into, by the way, why you should not redeem the great deserts of the world?

685
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,300
I never heard that. Maybe you did it with somebody else, not with me.

686
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:06,420
Yeah, I think we might have. All right. So this is from DeMayo.

687
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,900
You know, there's camps, you know, there's cliques.

688
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,960
I'm more in the Wilhelm Reich, Trevor James Constable clique.

689
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,460
School of thought, so to speak.

690
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:19,000
Yeah, and DeMayo doesn't like Constable at all.

691
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,080
So I don't really go towards DeMayo out of respect for Constable.

692
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,660
DeMayo's work is fine. He's very conservative.

693
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,780
But anyway, OK, why you don't redeem the deserts?

694
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,920
Now, if you redeem a major desert, well, what does that mean?

695
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,620
It no longer is a desert. You have regular rain, the topsoil, animals, plants, vegetation.

696
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,780
Allegedly, yeah.

697
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,620
One of the attributes of the deserts, the large deserts, right?

698
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:47,020
We're not talking about a little patch of dune somewhere like you have up in Oregon or something, right?

699
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,840
We're talking about the big ones like Namibia, Sahara, Gobi, right?

700
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:58,840
One of the attributes in climatology of these deserts is that during certain times of year,

701
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:09,800
major, major sandstorms occur that kick up very fine silica particles into the very high atmosphere.

702
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:13,580
When I say high atmosphere, I'm talking about where the very high plains lie.

703
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:20,460
And when they get up to that very high atmosphere, they migrate across to the great oceans and deposit the quartz into the oceans.

704
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:25,480
And that's why you shouldn't mitigate the deserts.

705
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:29,520
But Greek, that doesn't make any sense. OK, let's maybe give a little more. Maybe it'll make more sense.

706
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:34,440
Go for it, because I only have a hint so far. I don't fully see it.

707
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,860
Now, you know there's something called the food chain.

708
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:41,280
You go from the little bacteria to the plankton all the way up to the whale, which is not a fish.

709
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,280
But you know what I mean, right?

710
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:47,360
Smaller things are continuously getting consumed by the larger, smarter.

711
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,960
Yeah, and the whale, which is not a fish, but it is a water animal, closes the gap.

712
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,220
Most whales eat plankton.

713
00:33:53,360 --> 00:34:01,040
They have the baleen gland, a baleen structure in their mouth that filters out all the microscopic plankton.

714
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,220
That's what they eat, the blue whale and all that.

715
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:06,020
So the biggest animal eats the smallest animal, the plankton, right?

716
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,100
What do plankton eat?

717
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,320
What do they rely on?

718
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,860
Not solely, but if you remove this from their diet, they perish.

719
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:19,860
Silica sand, silica quartz, silica compounds.

720
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,639
Where did those compounds come from?

721
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,739
The deserts.

722
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:28,320
So now if you eliminate the plankton, the big whales have nothing to eat.

723
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,560
But it's not just the big whales that eat the plankton.

724
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,440
No, but it's the small fish.

725
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,300
It's really small fish that eat the plankton, and then bigger fish eat those fish, and then bigger fish, right?

726
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:35,800
Okay.

727
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,880
It's kind of like an analogy of killing all the bees.

728
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,600
Right, okay.

729
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,320
Then you won't have any pollination, naturally.

730
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:48,480
You take out the smallest organism that's part of the food chain, and the whole rest of the chain collapses.

731
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,860
Actually, it's more critical.

732
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:58,600
A broken link in a chain is a broken link in a chain, but sometimes some links carry more weight than others.

733
00:34:59,160 --> 00:34:59,800
Well, absolutely.

734
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:05,420
I mean, I guess that some animals could adapt if there's a loss in there, and that happens from time to time, right?

735
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,400
That has happened already.

736
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,780
Demeo went and redeemed Namibia for about a year, and you could look.

737
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,460
I think it was back in the late 80s or early 90s.

738
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:20,880
There was an after-newspaper article about how all the fishermen in South America are coming back with empty nets.

739
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:22,660
Right.

740
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:23,600
Right?

741
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,000
Oh, I remember that.

742
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,520
Yeah, and that was a big, like, oh, the fish are all dying.

743
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,060
Well, yeah, there's nothing to eat.

744
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:44,180
But then when the intensity of the project wore off and the desert came back into its normal function of producing the ejecting silica compounds into the atmosphere, then the fish came back.

745
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,320
Pretty quickly, everything recovers.

746
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:49,840
But anyway, I'm just giving this analogy because it's very useful.

747
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,660
According to people in the Midwest, this analogy would not help them at all.

748
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,460
Anyway, I keep harping on them when I see the bad weather.

749
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:58,420
Can't help it.
