1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,660
Rated Y Sonic Event 113 and here we are looking back a bit on some interesting topics and a little

2
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:21,460
bit of feedback that we've gotten. Well, I guess a few people want to talk about the consumption of

3
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:27,280
pork and cannibalism. Just cannibalism, yeah. By the way, there's some videos, I don't know if

4
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:32,640
there's some old film of people, these white guys, rich white guys, trust the fairies. I used to tell

5
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,040
people what's reason what's the trust the fairy and what's somebody who lives off of a family

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,360
trust, right? Fun babies. Yeah, trust fun, baby. Yeah. So and the cannibals were telling them

7
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,540
basically through the translator, don't talk to him so much because we'll eat you. You know, it's

8
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:52,680
like, you know, look at that guy over there. So yeah, it's so they're protected in certain islands,

9
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,700
by the way, right. And you're told that if you go there, you're on your own, we're not going to

10
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:02,220
rescue you or whatever. But also, you know, Episode 13 and 31 brought that topic up about pork. Yeah,

11
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:08,180
if you eat pork, processed pork, you know, like sausages, ground pork, pork ingredient note,

12
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:14,220
or even a, what do they call it when they wrap up the loin pork loin, right? Oh, the pork loin,

13
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,000
or maybe yeah, the most likely you've about 10% of that that you've consumed is human.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,640
But how about hot dogs and bologna? Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. sausage sausages, hot dogs. Yeah.

15
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:32,640
Okay, fair enough. Jimmy Dean's is known for it's very well known. Very well known all of the

16
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:40,440
major pork processing plants, their wastewater treatment areas for their human body, human teeth

17
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,580
are usually found teeth. Well, yeah, because those are the hardest thing to grind up, right? The teeth

18
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:49,540
but most likely cheese and hair. Yeah. So they'll always find there's like a

19
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,760
what's the big one Tyson that Tyson's chicken and the other one. Well, there's Jimmy Dean. And then

20
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:03,180
there's what is that other one? They have like these runoff areas where the water from there

21
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,400
is processed and runs off to the river and certain times a year when it dries out. There's all human

22
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:12,720
teeth. Oh, Johnsonville. Yeah. Johnsonville, maybe, because they're pretty big. They're all

23
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,980
you know, by the way, you know, all these companies that are supposedly competing

24
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:21,580
are on. It's a show for the public. You know, they're all in meetings. And they're all together,

25
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,160
you know, based out of the Central Bank conglomerate. Well, I'll tell you one of the Oh,

26
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,840
by the way, one of the funniest things that doesn't involve cannibalism is that, you know,

27
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,380
a lot of times people get like the French fries, they think, you know, Oh, well, this kind of French

28
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:36,920
fries better than this one or that. They're almost all made in like the same exact three factories,

29
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,760
like whether it's a McDonald's. It doesn't matter what it is. It doesn't matter what it is. Like,

30
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:50,880
for example, well, excuse me, I'm gonna mention a very wealthy person, when they started doing

31
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,660
all the sanctions against Russia. So that hasn't changed. And just a few companies that are public

32
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,480
eye and a couple of billionaires business got disturbed. But all the major trade that happens

33
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:06,280
with Russia still going on. It's all it's all public eye bullshit. Right. So by the way,

34
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,540
I want to interject this regarding money, we've been speaking a lot about money lately,

35
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:17,560
just the system, because it's something you can actually, it can be done very methodically,

36
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:24,380
you make a checklist of how to handle it. And it's it works very nicely. But, you know,

37
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,800
I talked about when you when you get a check, a personal check or a corporate check,

38
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,960
money is never transferred from that account to your account. It's created with your signature

39
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,620
when you endorse that check. And on the other side, their own bank pulls the funds to give the

40
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:44,360
illusion that it was transferred never was right. Right. Okay, this is evidence. When you see a

41
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:50,600
financial instrument, and it says pay to the order of pay to the order of means green light to do

42
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:56,520
what I just said, when you get a postal money order, or certain bank checks, doesn't say pay

43
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:02,080
to the order of it just says pay. Right? That's where they can still do that. No, they actually

44
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,860
do have to take it out of the other account, or some account, according to the routing number,

45
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:12,520
but they can't create the funds from your signature and the other signature. So the

46
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:17,100
simple down, they still do that the order of is the big difference, because it's pay or pay to

47
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,600
the order of Yeah, when you see when you see a financial instrument that says paid to the order

48
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,980
of, that's when they're really ripping everybody off everybody, the payer, the payee, everybody,

49
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:33,380
when you see pay, go right now pull up images, a check, you'll see pay to the order of,

50
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,760
and then pull up a postal money order, it doesn't say pay to the order of

51
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,120
No, it doesn't. Let me let me look at the back says pay order. Yeah. You know,

52
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,820
the actually front of the money order. This is all in the front. Been a while since the back

53
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:49,060
is always the back. Yeah, well, the back is the it says endorse do not write below here,

54
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,740
because that's where they do all their launches or launches when you transfer. But if you look at

55
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:59,080
a cashier's check, or a postal, specifically a postal money order, it will not say pay to the

56
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:05,460
order of it just says pay. Because it's a carryover on how the stamps are monetized,

57
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:10,200
which is a whole other thing. Anyway, I just wanted to bring that note up right away,

58
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:14,000
you should probably see a postal money order. It says pay, but a regular checks is paid to the

59
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,180
order of Yeah, I'm just trying to make the image big enough for me to see. Sorry.

60
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:22,660
I'm fine. Okay. Well, anyway, the listeners got it. So back to the eating people thing.

61
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:29,120
That's a very complex subject, because here without even covering it. I talked years ago,

62
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,200
about how it's going to make a comeback in the open, just like the woke stuff is it'll

63
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:40,580
be attached to the woke stuff if that movement survives the next year or two. And but but here's

64
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:47,120
the thing. Doritos Frito, you know, the real Frito Lay and Pepsi already admit they're using male,

65
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:55,720
male fetus liver cells as a taste. Oh, yeah, that's the fetal the fetal tissue that was

66
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:01,140
discovered as part of the sweetening thing, right? Yeah, that's still enacted. So that's

67
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:05,240
there's about a dozen companies, prominent companies that do it. And there's like two

68
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,540
dozen companies that you don't know about that make profit, you know, other process stuff.

69
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:14,240
So you're already if you're eating like any Frito Lay products or Pepsi products,

70
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:21,560
you're already experienced with cannibalism is like the newer the newer postal money orders

71
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:27,360
are very complex, actually. Yeah, it's just it's a bullshit act because there's no money. It's all

72
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,900
credit still but but still, it does say pay. See, it's that's the SOS. They got your SOS is the

73
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:39,180
shiny object syndrome. Actually, now they got this thing endorsement and they want a signature

74
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:45,660
or stamp. Okay, and then they got another whole box for a stamp. It's weird. I never saw him like

75
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:50,480
this. It doesn't matter. You can create a promissory note on a piece of paper. And it's

76
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:55,800
just as good. I can write an IOU. Yeah, I can write an IOU on a piece of toilet paper. If you

77
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:02,320
accept it, you wouldn't be very durable, but any durable paper durable, right? Yeah, is what

78
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:07,300
actually there there is a few states do have paperwork codes like how you need to do paperwork,

79
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:12,100
what it should be on the size, the color of the material, right font. That's why it tells you only

80
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:17,660
fictions corporations trust. Government agencies are in all caps, right? Right, right. It's the

81
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:23,120
it's the printing and style manual. I think Ohio has it. Kansas has a few of the older states.

82
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:28,840
The busy, busy industrial states because in industry, there was the two signature and the

83
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,720
single you know, you know about the two signature instrument and a single instrument, single

84
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,500
signature instrument, right? You know, there's a whole thing, right about that. And it's leading

85
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:47,160
setting people up just for the fiat to accept it just like when 911 came, they accepted Muslims

86
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:53,580
because since the 80s, they were showing back to a few all these movies that of course, you know,

87
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:58,680
from that part of the world is where the right so it's a predictive programming, but back to the

88
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,360
cannibalism, which is basically what's going on with the money system. The cannibalism is not a

89
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:09,780
deal because I mentioned, you know, how many cells do you have to eat? It's like a little pregnant,

90
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:15,680
right? How many human cells from another? Do you have to eat to be considered to be considered

91
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,540
cannibalism? Right? Well, yeah, and there you go, because a drop of blood and that's the thing is

92
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:27,780
that even if it's just in another product, right, which well, in other words, yeah, cannibalism

93
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:33,120
doesn't mean you have to hack the meat off the bone. Is it bone in bone out to lay? Is it the

94
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:40,820
cellular tissue that they're using in Pepsi colas and products and Frito Lay products? Right? Now,

95
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:45,640
if you're straight up eating, you know, processed pork meat in hot dogs and all that stuff, you're

96
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:52,200
straight up that straight up cannibalism. It's been prepared by others. aspect of it is the

97
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,040
ritual, though. How long has that been going on, though? Because it seems to me as though always

98
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,580
food was different going on. Yeah, but there's a change in food during the course of our lifetime.

99
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,960
Wouldn't you admit that the food supply is generally sort of shifted? No, not regarding

100
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:12,060
this topic? No, not at all. No, the major change in food, we'll get I have a point to make. Okay.

101
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:18,300
But the major change in food is just the toxification. There was a in the 1700s. I

102
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,860
don't have the data. But in the 1700s, there was one of these proclamations done in secret.

103
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,880
It did get out and it was known at the time about it's like an Alam and terrorist proclamation,

104
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,220
whatever, to get rid of seeds like certain grains that were you know, you could live off of like

105
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:37,740
super grains, right? Stop growing them and grow the animal. You know, I've always said animal grade.

106
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,060
Right? I always talked about the you know, most of the food is animal grade. It's not the stuff

107
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:46,820
that humans cultivated. It's high nutrition, right? If you look at ancient culture, when you were

108
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:51,020
hungry, you just wanted some bread. Right now, if you just are hungry, you don't ask for bread,

109
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:55,400
you ask for chicken wings, right? But no, you don't ask for bread, because it's not enough,

110
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,040
right? So they were using, they were cultivating grains that were slower to grow,

111
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,660
certain seeds, and those were all gotten rid of by the 20th century. So triticales typically,

112
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,840
but that's another that's another discussion, the food stuff, you know, I could get into food,

113
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,780
you know, and that's something to think about, though, is that when you read a story about where

114
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:20,460
somebody just eats a piece of bread, and that's what they're eating, like, that's what they're

115
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:25,020
asking for when they're hungry. Yeah, you don't ask for that. Now. No, but but that's because

116
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:29,440
that piece of bread actually was adequate. Yeah, it was adequate, more than adequate,

117
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,220
more than adequate because of the stock of the grain and all that. So this is all these grains

118
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:37,980
are gone now. Well, even though they're still around, but they're not used. Yeah, well,

119
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:43,540
even the old timey concept of you give a prisoner just bread and water, right in a cell that

120
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:48,880
actually wasn't so bad if they had clean water, and that bread back. Yeah. That's why all this

121
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,160
stuff from the New Testament, you know what I say about the New Testament, right? So,

122
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:57,380
you know, the about the the focus on the, you know, the blood and the eating this,

123
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,780
I don't believe that was actually can it's been put in there. But that's something else.

124
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,660
You think that was it? You never hear me when I talk about scripture. I don't I don't really

125
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:10,740
lean on I don't really get into the New Testament at all, because it's not worth getting into if

126
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:16,040
you're going to get any kind of knowledge base. If you're going to be an airy, fairy cultist in

127
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:20,480
the human cult, then all you need is the New Testament, right? I'm not talking the New Testament,

128
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,760
or because a lot of the ritual is so corrupt. Yeah. And a lot of the rituals that they carry

129
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:30,200
on with today are all designed off of it. Right? Yeah, it is. And the only thing that was actually

130
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,740
recorded that was around for the New Testament was maybe like maybe 200 or 300 words out of

131
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,220
the Book of Matthew. That's it. So, you know, so don't say I'm knocking the New Testament

132
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:43,580
because canon is canon. In other words, if they put it all together and say that's canon,

133
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:48,760
my purpose of talking about scripture is, do you know what it says, regardless if you believe it

134
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:53,640
or not? And the answer is no. The population does not know, even though there's everyone has a copy

135
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,400
of it. Right. So why don't we start reading just like the money system? Why don't we start just

136
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:03,140
reading what it's about or anything? The human body. Right. Anything. It doesn't matter. See,

137
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:08,340
I'm not a proponent for anything. I'm just saying that if you're going to discuss something,

138
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:14,200
are you discussing it or are you discussing something else? And the issue here is always

139
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,020
discussing something else. And this is something I wanted to discuss tonight. I keep bouncing

140
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:22,300
around from the money to the cannibalism. There's not much else to talk about on the cannibalism,

141
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:29,540
but you've been warned sufficiently. If you listen to Greek speak, first of all,

142
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,380
pork, a pig does not have a cloven hoof and chew the cut of an Old Testament guy. So it's out.

143
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:40,480
Doesn't matter what it tastes. It tastes like whatever. If you eat pork, I'd say about if you

144
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,360
ate 100 pounds of pork, 10 pounds, I assure you, is human flesh, 10 to 10 percent, at least minimum.

145
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:51,660
Wow. Processed. Right. Okay. And whatever. So all this stuff. But you've been warned about this

146
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,880
stuff by me over and over and over. By the way, this is very well established, by the way,

147
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,540
what I'm telling you, that's canon. And you would say ground pork products. You've eaten

148
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:03,340
human DNA. You know, they say they find human DNA in it all the time. This is open.

149
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:08,820
But bacon. This is not. Yeah. But bacon and pork chops, those are supposed to be solid pieces

150
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:13,780
of pork. Those are most likely you can't get away with that. Yeah. It's the process part.

151
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,520
Okay. So it's not just about pork. And then of course, there's the ritualist

152
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:23,260
side from the Christian. I didn't say Judeo Christian, mostly on the Christian side,

153
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:27,660
because of what's been put and called the New Testament. They're focusing on that. It's very

154
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:33,820
easy. But here's what I wanted to discuss as a group of people that get together and organize

155
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:39,060
or whatever or have relative amount of imagination and reason. What's the purpose of humanity?

156
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,320
What what these what's the don't they stop and gather and ask themselves, count me out,

157
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:49,200
by the way, on this thought. I'm not part of it, but I'm just saying you have all these people.

158
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,180
It doesn't matter if it was just a few million or tens of millions years ago. And now it's in

159
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:57,140
the billions. And it's not eight billion, like they say, by the way. But anyway,

160
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,460
is it? Why are we here? Why are we here? What should we accomplish? I mean,

161
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:06,520
yeah. Why are the people ever getting together and saying, what's our objective here? What's

162
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:11,140
our goal? What are we? What's our goal? You know, organize. What's our mission statement?

163
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,520
What is our purpose? What is our purpose here? Yeah, our purpose. Not not questioning the purpose

164
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:24,020
past tense. But what are we going to do? None of that. There's none of that at all. It's all about

165
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:30,800
food, clothing and shelter, is it not more generally food? Yeah, well, that protection,

166
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:36,180
which eventually leads to where's the organizing principle? Okay, so that must exist. So here comes

167
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:43,380
religion, nationalism, and all that. So that's fine. Because religion, nationalism, you could

168
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:48,060
name a few other things, culture, whatever, is an organizing factor for these people.

169
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,540
So it puts the organizing principle in place so that you have a purpose.

170
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:57,180
Okay, yeah, because necessary. But then it's go look at the quality of those things. Go look at

171
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:02,540
what that resultant is. And that's not being questioned and saying, Hey, I'm not saying that

172
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:09,560
nationalism is bad. It's actually vital. In many cases. It's proof right now, when people buy

173
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:16,560
a German branded product. They say make sure it's made in Germany. That's the better one,

174
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:22,800
right? Or whatever. It depends. And the thing about it is that one one thing that's an absolute

175
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,200
truth, though, is that every one of these nations on a long enough timeline fails and disappears,

176
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:32,160
though, doesn't it? Well, yeah, that's exactly well, if you look at there's a thing with

177
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,620
corporations are all corporations, by the way, you know, like, all these things like nationalism,

178
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:40,700
religion, all that stuff, those are anything that's a state of mind, even though it's not

179
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:48,120
tangible can be sold, right? Right. So they call it IP now, intellectual, intellectual property.

180
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:56,260
Yeah. So if you go back to the aspect of corporations have a lifespan of about 20 years,

181
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,040
it's very easy to predict what's going to happen to something like Amazon or, you know, Elon Musk,

182
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:08,220
I hate, you know, when I say Tesla, I hate combine use talking about the car, or Elon Musk,

183
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:13,380
because that's like degradation of Tesla's name. You know, it's amazing that they did that, right?

184
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:18,840
They vote Nikola Tesla's name to, you know, attach it to the concept of newer technology.

185
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:25,700
It's a total corruption. It's not has nothing to do with Tesla at all. His principles, at least.

186
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:30,920
By the way, most people don't know I've been following Elon Musk's organization since the

187
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:37,660
beginning. And back in 0405060708, somewhere there, most people that are fans of him and Tesla

188
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:44,820
don't even know this. He had a set of engineers, 910 engineers, really brilliant guys. And they

189
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:49,200
went to Washington, DC for a meeting, and they flew them back on this little twin engine old

190
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:54,280
plane that crashed and killed all of them, right. And then when that happened, then it they got

191
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:59,880
Tesla became what it is now more focused. At that time, they made like just one little sports car.

192
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:04,880
And they killed all their top people. And they got reorganized into what it is now,

193
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:13,079
right? Very typical, you know, type stuff. So what is the organizing principle? If you look at the

194
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:19,060
things that I mentioned religion, it's really keeping people dumb, all of it. And if you look

195
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:25,099
at nationalism, it's one of the causes of war. And one of the causes for war, not as an aggressor,

196
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:30,420
but to also be warred on, you know, the people talk about, you know, everyone hates the Jews,

197
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:35,580
but everyone really hates the Germans and the Prussians. All the nations around them were like,

198
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,160
how do we get rid of these Germans, right? You know, about Morgenthau's, it's the pastoral

199
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,040
policy in the 1920s, which means Germany should be everyone, all the Germans should be killed,

200
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:53,040
and all of Germany turned into a big pasture. So this was in the 1920s. And this is the same thing

201
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:58,860
they talked about the Asian people. So you know, it's Yeah, the true nationalism. So anyway,

202
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:04,440
these organizing principles, set, let's set them aside, what other organizing principles do humans

203
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:10,120
have in general, and I'm telling you that none, they really don't. It goes down to the food,

204
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:15,680
clothing and shelter thing. Again, you know, it's really piss poor. It's a so here's the other part.

205
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:20,560
Well, everything else is just a fabricated fictional identity. By the way, if you guys

206
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:26,520
can hear chirping birds, I just want you to know you listening. That's some migration. It's a

207
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,520
natural soundtrack. And I don't mind it. I'm just letting people know that the chirping birds are

208
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:35,820
not being added. Yeah, it's amazing how penetrating it is. No, no, it's not. Yeah. So good. So the

209
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:43,680
other aspect of it is the we call it the I call it the typical the container, the body, we're in the

210
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:50,580
soul, the body and the spirit, the mind, right? By the way, in popular, not so popular, you know,

211
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:55,340
like Kardashian, regular TV, but in stuff you see on YouTube and other places, and in print,

212
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:01,680
they're starting to not say mind, body, soul, mind, body, spirit, they're delineating it,

213
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:08,020
it's soul, mind and body or body, spirit, mind, they're no longer, there's less mixing of the

214
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:12,540
terms now, soul and spirit, they're starting to separate it out. They're not they're not

215
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:17,140
interchanging soul and spirit. I've started to notice that. Right? I've been doing Yeah, I've

216
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:21,260
been pushing that for 20 years, just like you shouldn't call children kids. Right? So that

217
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,800
watch for that, by the way, in the near future. Oh, here's another thing.

218
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,040
That was piss poor to begin with, because kids is

219
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:33,840
well, it's all piss poor. I just brought up the point that you have no organizing principle,

220
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,980
by the way, on a trivial, these are like 15 tangents. I'm entertaining here. Sure. I was

221
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:45,080
getting some had a list of, of getting stuff like bartenders, keeper, Bon Ami, dishwasher, soap,

222
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:49,900
stuff to clean oil stains out of the driveway and the bathroom and all this stuff like that.

223
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,720
Walking down the aisle where they have dishwasher soap, and you wouldn't believe what I saw.

224
00:19:54,300 --> 00:20:01,000
They actually have dishwasher soap in a spray bottle now. Hmm. Yeah, I figured out Yes,

225
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:05,380
I'm going to figure it out. Wow. I haven't seen a Greek speak. I've been doing that for two decades.

226
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:08,820
Yeah, I haven't seen that on a shelf yet. I'm sure it'll get here eventually.

227
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:13,360
Yeah. Yes. Anyway, we you know, you just you and I, I think I talked about it.

228
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,160
On the O and G beginning. Yeah, but definitely on this one.

229
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,580
No, it's a great. It's actually a great idea. It makes perfect sense.

230
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:25,000
And well, you won't buy as much. So you're not gonna run out of just soap like you normally do.

231
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:28,300
Was it being done by a nationally recognizable brand?

232
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,880
Yeah, one of the the blue liquid? Yeah.

233
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,500
Okay. All right. Fair enough. I just was

234
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,580
Yeah, so I don't know whatever the dawn would be.

235
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,820
Dawn is one of the biggest ones. Yeah. And they have a whole thing about,

236
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,700
you know, not actually wasting their stuff.

237
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,340
You can look up dishwasher soap in a spray bottle, and it'll come up now.

238
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:44,920
Oh, I will.

239
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:48,100
Where if you did that a year or two ago or more, nothing.

240
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,620
No, what they had is this squeeze bottle that resembled a ketchup bottle

241
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,400
is what they had. No, no, we're talking about a

242
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,180
aeration sprayer. Yeah.

243
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,260
A bonafide sprayer.

244
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,160
What I'm saying is about two years ago, that was their new innovation was the

245
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,200
squeeze bottle, like a ketchup squeeze bottle that sits the other way.

246
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,360
So the spout is down, but it doesn't

247
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,520
Yeah, we should do a little handbook 101 things that people don't, you know, haven't

248
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,880
figured out yet. Right.

249
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,620
Anyway. Might be a bestseller.

250
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,880
That 101. Yeah. Dalmatians. Yeah.

251
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:19,660
That too. Back to the container, the human body,

252
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,880
the avatar or whatever. That has its own mind.

253
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:28,380
Like, for example, if you watch cat videos on YouTube, when a cat is spooked,

254
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,100
they always go through the same motion.

255
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:35,720
Right. When a dog's fish, they all have similar motions that they share

256
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,020
because they are that particular species.

257
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,960
That's the particular body.

258
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,260
Now, if you get to know the fish or you get to know the dog or the cat or the

259
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:47,100
chicken, by the way, chickens, they you can name them.

260
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,780
They'll they'll answer to their name.

261
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,720
You know, they'll call you when you call them by the name.

262
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,420
They'll come right.

263
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,440
Same with cows, by the way.

264
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,580
I wouldn't have thought of chickens as very expressive, but OK.

265
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:58,340
No, they will. They will.

266
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,020
Yeah, they're yeah.

267
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:02,020
Well, there's a chicken that plays checkers.

268
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,340
That's legendary.

269
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,840
Yeah. But that's because, yeah, training.

270
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,680
But still, OK, each animal has its own body and it does its own thing.

271
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:15,120
According to the body set up, it's in the way, let's say it's wired.

272
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:20,040
The the makeup of that body, what it's allowed to do, like a cat has got like

273
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,900
30 millisecond reaction time.

274
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:26,560
A cobra is 35 or 40 second reaction time.

275
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,980
What I mean is what I mean by that is if a cobra tries to strike a cat, the cat

276
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,320
will get out of the way.

277
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:34,940
Right. Right.

278
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,760
Where humans is not is not that fast.

279
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,100
And the cobra will strike faster than you get out of the way.

280
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,840
So in other words, cats are really downplayed.

281
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:47,880
You know, they're really extraordinary, you know, in reaction time and other

282
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,620
things like that.

283
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:52,360
And when they do get spooked, whether you know a cat or don't know a cat, you

284
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,740
could look around and you see they all have similar reactions.

285
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:59,360
The same with any other animal based on its body, separate from its spiritual

286
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,960
content. You know what?

287
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:01,880
What type of spirit?

288
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,960
Because if anyone who's had dogs or cats, let's say I'm using these as main

289
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,440
domestic animals, you'll notice that some are smarter than others.

290
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,480
Oh, always just like people.

291
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,580
Right. Yeah.

292
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:17,120
So like when my dog is I can I can always know because the ears perk up.

293
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,480
Right. Most breeds have the ability to perk up their ears.

294
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,960
They kind of stand up straighter.

295
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,340
Well, it's more than that.

296
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,400
Whether they can do math.

297
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,320
I had a dog, Butters, who could do math.

298
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,440
He's named after the South.

299
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,880
He's a gorgeous terrier.

300
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:32,180
And people thought I had trained him in the order of the formula of the math

301
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:37,140
questions that I gave him, like like, you know, two plus two, five minus three.

302
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,380
People thought that I gave them in a number of barks that he gave an order.

303
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,360
I said, you do it.

304
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,620
You do it in any order you want.

305
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,340
Here's and he would do it.

306
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,220
He knew math.

307
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,880
Any number between one and ten plus or minus.

308
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:49,840
Right. That's pretty.

309
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,700
Very, very.

310
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,460
Oh, my gosh.

311
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,160
Really smart.

312
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:59,540
And and I thought he was wonderful, but I'd never called him a smart dog until I

313
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,940
started showing him off and everyone else thought he was smart.

314
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,280
So I said, if everyone said he's smart, then I can call him smart, too.

315
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,140
No one will argue.

316
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:11,640
But what I'm trying to say here is that being in the human body, it has certain

317
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,400
tendencies, the body itself, the body has its own mind.

318
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:20,860
And I think just to recap, you got someone who's really sucky about being here and

319
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:24,800
he decides one day he's going to kill himself or herself and they're going to go

320
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,120
by drowning or whatever.

321
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,560
Jumping off the building is a little different while they're drowning.

322
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,580
Try to commit suicide, their body's like, I don't want to die.

323
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,820
My whole job here with this soul metabolism to keep this thing going as long as I

324
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,720
can, I don't want to die.

325
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,880
That's why a lot of people renege, you know, on the suicide.

326
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,100
They're so glad they were saved.

327
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,080
Many.

328
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:48,420
But if you jump off a building, it's kind of hard to change your mind unless you're in

329
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,220
the cartoons, right?

330
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,400
Yeah, well, the body.

331
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:54,420
So in other words, the body has a mind of its own and makes a decision to resist.

332
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,460
Yeah, that's right.

333
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,480
That's what cancer is.

334
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:01,720
Cancers are when you're you can eat certain things in the body's like, you've been

335
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,320
doing this for so many years, I can't adjust to it anymore.

336
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,040
So I'm going to put a block to block the energy.

337
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,380
It's called a tumor or whatever manifestation.

338
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,080
And because you're not listening to me, it's very subtle.

339
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:17,540
And it's funny how you have all these morons on YouTube or whatever, you know, subtle

340
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,800
energy healers and all that.

341
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:23,820
You bring this up to me like, oh, you know, so I don't endorse any of them.

342
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,420
But, you know, I'm not saying don't listen or whatever.

343
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,640
Yes, but I don't endorse them.

344
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,440
You know, I'm very careful about who I endorse.

345
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,020
And so far, I don't know who to endorse.

346
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,940
So, you know, you don't give us the Greek speak seal of approval or I could tell you

347
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,240
their stock prices go up and down with me.

348
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,100
That doesn't mean I endorse them either.

349
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:44,440
Right.

350
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:50,180
So and I don't buy their stock, you know, calling it a stock prices away, you know,

351
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,500
a stock falls right now and stock goes up.

352
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,760
So what I'm trying to say is there's the human body has its own attributes, just like

353
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,500
all dogs and all cats and all snakes and all that have like an attribute because they're

354
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:07,880
in that body that always tend to react very similarly because of the body.

355
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:15,600
So this body, if you go and look at, let's say, a lot of the lore, the religious lore,

356
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,580
holy rites, it's about separating from the body, right?

357
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,160
Like denying yourself things, right?

358
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,020
Like the Buddha, right?

359
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:21,600
Okay.

360
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,240
I don't have to get into examples.

361
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,480
If you're older than 13 years old, you know, you've heard it, right?

362
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:30,280
Denying yourself of worldly pleasures and all this other stuff.

363
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:30,520
Why?

364
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:35,320
Because they've realized this and they're trying to it's not create a struggle.

365
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:39,940
But if you have no need, if you see that you've separated yourself from you're not going to

366
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,080
ever engage in the struggle to get it right.

367
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:46,760
So if you say money, I don't need a wealth or anything like that.

368
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:50,040
I just need to some shelter and some basic food.

369
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:53,180
You'll never engage in that struggle, right?

370
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,340
What they call the rat race.

371
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,240
By the way, only rats could be in a rat race, right?

372
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:56,720
Sure.

373
00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:01,180
But you and just like rats, if you confine them, you know, what do they start doing?

374
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,380
They start eating each other, right?

375
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,460
So, you know, the corporate culture.

376
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,800
And this is taught doesn't have to be that way.

377
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:15,740
So when you when you look at the progression of consciously saying, well, for example,

378
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,920
I'm going to be celibate, right?

379
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,360
So I never have to engage in sex, let's say.

380
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,900
So I never have to think about being a good lover.

381
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,200
I never have to think about finding a mate, right?

382
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,940
Or going on dates or having.

383
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:29,180
Right.

384
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:32,980
No, you don't have to direct any of your energy, your thought, your resources toward

385
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,400
people have with all that is out.

386
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:35,900
You'll never.

387
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,140
Right.

388
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,040
So if you say, I just I don't want to be poor because poor is a sense of

389
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,380
extreme deprivation or deprivation.

390
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,880
I don't want to be deprived.

391
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:48,760
But I have no interest in earthly wealth or money or just go day by day.

392
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,260
Plan accordingly, whatever.

393
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:55,240
You'll never enter the struggle of, you know, how am I going to increase my fortune?

394
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:55,640
Right.

395
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,400
Well, you're not looking for it.

396
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,040
Right.

397
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,500
So that's the better that's the perspective that was trying to be shown.

398
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:07,400
It's not, let's say, in certain ancient writs, it's not to deny yourself because you're going

399
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:12,340
to be suffering some kind of discomfort, you know, to to voluntarily go into discomfort.

400
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,420
It's not that at all.

401
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:19,520
It's to avoid the struggles that are inlaid, depending on what culture and society you

402
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,800
live in, to participate in those struggles and end up being, you know, spending energy

403
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,500
on those struggles.

404
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,600
So now that you're not spending energy, whatever struggle it might be, it might be relationships.

405
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:33,640
If you decide to be celibate, if it might be increasing wealth, if you decide that you

406
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:38,040
just need, you know, your most basic sustenance and basic things, whatever it might be.

407
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:38,340
Yeah.

408
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:42,500
That allows you to focus your time and energy on other things that no one else is focusing

409
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:42,760
on.

410
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,840
And you will seem like a master's miracle.

411
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,780
You know, you'll be able to come up with stuff.

412
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:47,320
Right.

413
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:47,760
And right.

414
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,580
You'll be a sage.

415
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,260
You'll be whatever.

416
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,940
But the thing is, this is never really taught the way I just said.

417
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,540
It's always people think that they have to suffer.

418
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:59,580
Suffer means to make the choice to go through something.

419
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,780
Some kind of discomfort.

420
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,000
And that will make them.

421
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:09,760
They're actually old, older traditions and quote, unquote, religions, not rits that,

422
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:13,280
you know, to bring pain upon yourself was, you know, a virtuous thing.

423
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,000
No, it's not about that at all.

424
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:19,280
Isn't this because people have this concept that unless there's punishment connected to

425
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,020
something, unless there's a penalty that people will.

426
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:22,660
Well, that's motivation.

427
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,700
Well, that's what it's turned into.

428
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:28,480
People do things because they if they don't do that, there'll be a penalty, not because

429
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,100
they're doing it because it's the right thing to do.

430
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:31,440
Right.

431
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:31,940
Right.

432
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:36,380
Like whenever I bring up the money system and taxes, even people that are in economics

433
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,880
and like it's fiat currency.

434
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,800
Why do they they don't need taxes to pay?

435
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,000
Taxes never bought in 90 years.

436
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,860
No one's taxes is paid for anything.

437
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,000
Well, I get you ever notice to create scarcity.

438
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:49,340
Well, you ever notice when you bring up the concept of, you know, like, well, gee, you

439
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,980
know, why wouldn't you want to commit murder?

440
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:54,600
You know, out of most people's mouths, first thing is the penalty.

441
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,520
Well, I don't want to go to prison.

442
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,800
I don't want to be put to death.

443
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,420
OK, there's the plain Jane murder, which is it.

444
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,100
So you can't do it in your neighborhood or to a family member.

445
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:06,180
But if you put on a uniform and go to another country, it's OK.

446
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,360
You get a medal for that.

447
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:07,600
Right.

448
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,500
Yeah, of course.

449
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:13,340
But that's my point here, though, is that when when you say to someone, why wouldn't

450
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,920
you kill or to in the Bible?

451
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,920
You know, that's glorified.

452
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:16,260
Right.

453
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,960
Well, I just said, you know, the second part of the first part's not.

454
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,760
It shouldn't be any of it.

455
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,020
Right.

456
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:23,680
That's it.

457
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,460
But then there's capital punishment.

458
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,380
You know, your life is taken if you take a life.

459
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,020
Yeah.

460
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:33,300
But that's the thing is that people say that that's the focus, you know, not because you

461
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:38,160
just shouldn't take a life, but because there's a penalty like you ever notice that that's

462
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,140
the primary concern.

463
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,100
I don't want to go to prison.

464
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:40,720
I don't want to.

465
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,740
I don't want to be executed, you know, taking life.

466
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:50,020
Any life, even in war, nationalism or army and all that was made the norm.

467
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:53,320
They would be so it would be so rare that someone would murder someone.

468
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,080
It would be so rare unless it was an accident.

469
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:55,600
Right.

470
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,200
Right.

471
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,600
And then you'd have to go to a city of refuge.

472
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:58,880
Right.

473
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,080
An accident is not a murder.

474
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:00,480
Yeah.

475
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,800
An accident is not a murder.

476
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,960
So there's a difference.

477
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:03,960
Yeah, that's right.

478
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:09,920
So but but you've actually it would be considered murder in this case because that person's

479
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:14,280
demise came to your do from your doing, even though it was unintentional.

480
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:14,720
Okay.

481
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,140
Okay.

482
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:20,120
So what I would say there is then that's taken care of a city of refuge.

483
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:25,960
But as long as there's armies and killing that way, there's always going to be a problem

484
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,260
at home, right?

485
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,680
Where are you going to have to deal with that?

486
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:34,700
So this is a really screwed up part of again, what is the collective unifying message?

487
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,980
What is their statement of belief of humans in general?

488
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:41,060
Well, we just said earlier, it's nationalism and religion.

489
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,840
But if you look at that stuff, oh, my gosh, you'd have to be insane to follow that.

490
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,040
Any of that.

491
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:46,460
Oh, yeah.

492
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,320
It's all going to contradict each.

493
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,140
Each thing winds up contradicting itself.

494
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,200
Yeah, and it's not for your benefit.

495
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,500
It's for someone's organizing principle.

496
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,040
Right.

497
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,620
You know, to take advantage of you.
