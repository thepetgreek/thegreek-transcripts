1
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:14,700
Rated Y 114 or 114. And here we are. Greek, how are you? Where you are?

2
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,080
I'm doing you're doing? Well, there's been a few questions.

3
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:27,860
My answer to how are you is I'm on a stinking rock still. So I know how can we be doing, you know, it's just Bushido.

4
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:32,660
So you're always doing fine. You know, Bushido, Japanese culture, you could be dying of stomach cancer.

5
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,840
I want to ask how you're doing. You always say you're fine, right?

6
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,960
There's another version of that, though, isn't there?

7
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:43,720
Kind of in the English language where you're always supposed to give the banal answer regardless.

8
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,860
To me, it's a waste of time. Like everyone's always talking about the weather.

9
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,060
What one is someone going to do something about it?

10
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,920
So when someone when you ask someone how they're doing, are you prepared to do something about it?

11
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:05,460
Well, normally anyway, that conversation is well, normally that conversation goes normally, as in typically that conversation would go, well, you can't do anything about the weather.

12
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,220
However, if you're speaking at which I just want to bring a couple of things up.

13
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:16,180
That's someone kind of offered to work on a Web site for me, the water stuff.

14
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,780
And they just had it looked like crap. And they had it was like, why is it so crappy?

15
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:26,440
I give this person like a 45 minute lecture in design and they just hand me it over and I go and log on, try to work.

16
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,060
It's WordPress dot com and some other element or whatever.

17
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:34,820
And you almost have to be a coder to do it now on that particular editor.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,580
You see, when I did the Web site on on common radio seven, eight years ago, it was just like using paint program.

19
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:45,460
Very logical, very, you know, you want to move text and change the font.

20
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:53,380
It was the same way you do in paint or any any any right click Apple or whatever program that you've had for the past 20 years.

21
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,460
Basic stuff. You want to plug in a certain element. Here's the element.

22
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,760
You can either plug it in or not your choice and fill out the information.

23
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:06,240
But this stuff here is got columns and they keep changing their format and it's got a whole bunch of codes.

24
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,360
They can't use English and the icons that look like you would change font.

25
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,080
No, it doesn't. You have to go to another section.

26
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,580
OK, so this is what pissed me off, really pissed me off for the lack of communication between people.

27
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,380
This is let me just give you an idea. Yeah, because the person knows me well.

28
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,700
OK, this is what I'm talking about. All right.

29
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,380
So it's very common to order a pepperoni pizza with a Diet Coke.

30
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,640
OK, sure. So this person happens to be one of those people, let's say.

31
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,320
And then they offer it to me, a pepperoni pizza with Diet Coke.

32
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:47,740
First of all, you know me well enough that I don't eat pork and I would never do a diet drink anyway.

33
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,080
So if you didn't know me, it would be it would be forgiving.

34
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,800
It would be like, well, yeah, they don't know things, but no things.

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,540
They don't know that you're a not a cannibal, you know, because of the diet drink.

36
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,700
Just to say, yeah, they both be cannibal feeding the pepperoni and the pork on the fork.

37
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,900
So what makes it worse is a person knows me. Right.

38
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,440
Which made it even worse for me. And I expressed it. Right.

39
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,860
Because the whole thing is no communication.

40
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,500
All you had to do, say, Greek, I'm handing the site work over to you.

41
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,560
Yeah. And guess what? You got to almost be a coder.

42
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:32,000
This is total dummy load, geek shit. And the reason I couldn't do it so well is because of that reason.

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,360
But, you know, I never told you and I'm handing it over to you to edit now, but I'm not going to tell you.

44
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,140
It's like, oh, my gosh, no communication. But you didn't.

45
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,620
This happens with the wife. It's been, I mean, for, you know, right now we've been together 22 years.

46
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,500
And a lot of times it's like we just met yesterday. It's like, what?

47
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,780
I have to go over this again and again. It's like, oh, my gosh.

48
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:58,440
So all I do, no matter what your proximity or your relationship is, it seems as though communication.

49
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:05,440
So what the way I've been rolling out for a little while is as if I have only known any relationship.

50
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,600
I have the acquaintance online, offline.

51
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,060
I've just met the person and I've known them no more than two or three days.

52
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,640
It's very forgiving when you think that way.

53
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,519
Well, yeah. If everything is based on a short term memory, you can't expect them to have.

54
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,480
Yeah, they would. They know you. Right. So.

55
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:25,980
So back to your mind, they're like, this person knows me and they didn't communicate what they could have communicated.

56
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:30,100
Is that what they should have? There's no such thing as should. Right. There is. There is.

57
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,140
Well, I should have known better. I mean, should is there.

58
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:40,500
This has been going on for a long time and my tolerance for it now is at zero because, you know, as you get older.

59
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,820
So you're not developing a emotional or psychological callous to it.

60
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,240
You're telling me that it's getting worse. You're getting more sensitive to it?

61
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,800
Oh, of course it's worse. The reason why it's worse is because there's something called about looking ahead.

62
00:04:53,800 --> 00:05:01,400
So you when you want to do something new and build it up, forget it, forget it, forget it.

63
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:07,860
Don't don't bother. Don't bother. The the entire spectrum of this is for me or my my life.

64
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:13,160
The entire spectrum of development is I have to do it on my own. Right.

65
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,660
And it's fine here. Let's transition. In the chat.

66
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,960
It was talk about looking and, you know, this is totally fair and fun.

67
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,840
The dark scriptures stuff from archaics. I didn't go in. I didn't look at it.

68
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,260
I remember it from a while back and I was like, OK, the intention is good, by the way.

69
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,920
I don't endorse archaics. I think I am very appreciative of the chronology.

70
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,460
And I checked it. It's not airtight, but it's close enough.

71
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,520
Especially the Phoenix stuff and the explanation of the timing of the Book of Revelation.

72
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:53,460
I do appreciate that. But he's more interested in being rich than being right.

73
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:59,340
Like I said, he's basic Texas country boy, ex-con meets the Internet.

74
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,500
OK, basically, that's his whole character.

75
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:08,320
So if you went to someone who was a screenwriter and said, you got a Texas country boy meets the Internet.

76
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,360
Ex-con that read a lot of books without telling him anything else about archaics,

77
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,400
you come up with a character that you'd be like, oh, that's pretty much him.

78
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,900
OK. Right. OK. So he's very materialistic. He's into, you know, making money all of a sudden.

79
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,920
Today I was on YouTube. I was looking up some stuff.

80
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,980
And because it's nice to see how to, you know, on a video.

81
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,500
You know, the sidebars like archaics was some guy, Jesus, something or.

82
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:41,920
Oh, man, Jacob Israel. So you're doing YouTube University and somehow the algorithm is live.

83
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:48,160
So I go on it and I was like, oh, my gosh, this is total materialism.

84
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,480
You know, I mean, no way. And by the way.

85
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:57,240
OK, let's let's put that aside because he was this is the part where I'm saying that

86
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,700
people are using his stuff for mentioning a lot of stuff that he's come up with.

87
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:06,640
And he wants to sue them for doing that. OK. For the money. Right.

88
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:12,840
So that's fine. It's fine. You know, he's found a group of people that he could work with and develop things.

89
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:19,840
I haven't. But he's saying, but he's probably presenting it as, look, this is the principle of I put my blood and my sweat.

90
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:26,800
Yeah. It's the standard baseline corporate culture now to go back to the thing about the biblical stuff.

91
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,320
I never hear him qualify anything other than like Zeitgeist stuff.

92
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:37,040
You know, the Zeitgeist stuff is like the Christian religion comes from all these other religions, basically.

93
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,480
Oh, yeah. The plagiarism. Look, you can see it in previous incarnations.

94
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,680
But nothing. You know, he keeps harping on the burning bush. I don't see there's no burning bush.

95
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,440
That's like folklore. That's like Noah parting the Noah. Yeah.

96
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,940
Moses yellow. Right. Yeah. There's no parting of water.

97
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,180
It's it's the word parting. Does it mean what Cecil be demotion?

98
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:06,360
They walked on an ice bridge essentially because, you know, it says they walked across as if they were walking on land and not, you know,

99
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,820
and and when the morning came, Pharaoh tried to pursue and he fell to the bottom.

100
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,580
Well, if they're already walking on the bottom, how can you fall to the bottom?

101
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,860
Anyway, look, we have different here. We have two different.

102
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:25,040
I had somebody once explained, by the way, I had somebody once explained that to me as in the tides had changed.

103
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:28,780
It wasn't the freezing, but it was more that at one time.

104
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,500
Well, look, yeah, there's there's look, you could say the tides changed.

105
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:36,159
You could say froze. You could say they'd split open. It was a miracle.

106
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,539
The water went away and they walked on the bottom silt.

107
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:42,780
You could say there's maybe a few more things that doesn't matter.

108
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:46,240
But is anyone saying what's exhibited in the text?

109
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,960
And I'm and I'm the only one, my only myself and historically would be maybe Ernest L.

110
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,040
Martin on a bunch of stuff. But those guys are a little bit like archaic.

111
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,540
So I confronted Ernest L.

112
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:04,500
Martin's 20 years ago, tough people about timekeeping because they were arguing on a certain holiday.

113
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,460
Would it be on Monday or Tuesday? Right.

114
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,000
Biblical holiday. Right.

115
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,960
And I was like, no, it doesn't work that way.

116
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:16,120
And says, yeah, we've heard about what you're saying, but it divides people.

117
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:24,380
So we don't want to do it. And also, if we do what you're saying, Greek, we're not going to sell any books.

118
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,520
Well, wait a minute. What you're trying to tell me is that you tried to introduce.

119
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,360
I laid it out for them.

120
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,220
Well, I was about to put that was going to be the punchline of what I was saying.

121
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,760
But let's let's rewind.

122
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,420
What you're telling me is that you basically tried to assert.

123
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,800
Look, if you actually use proper timekeeping, then this lines up differently.

124
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,660
And also, you're lining this up to the Pope's work schedule anyway.

125
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,320
So and so you went into that sort of direction.

126
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,160
And they said, yeah, and I'm the only one that does.

127
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,500
The day starts at noon. Full moon is the new moon.

128
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:03,980
Oh, no, you're absolutely you're absolutely the only person I've ever heard say out loud.

129
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,820
And probably will stuff like this isn't popular.

130
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,160
OK. Well, I haven't said anything yet about what the comments were in the I'm just building up here.

131
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:20,660
We're speaking about completely different points of view and stuff now.

132
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,380
I want to read it. I want to revisit the tech issue.

133
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:32,240
I want to revisit the tech issue when you're done with this, because this is this is going to come back around full circle, I think, to the tech.

134
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,960
What do you mean the tech issue? What do you mean tech as a technology where you started on the Web site and everything?

135
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:42,760
Because and communication was the if people know me really well.

136
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,740
Right. It's less forgiving for them to do stuff that because they know me well.

137
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,640
You know, it's like, you know, me so long. Well, that's about communication.

138
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,500
Pepperoni pizza and a Diet Coke. Why are you offering me that?

139
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:00,960
Well, and it's just as well. And look, it's just as solid as when people say to me, well, just go ahead and jump in your car and go drive.

140
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,880
And I go, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, because I have to explain to them.

141
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,940
I don't drive because of my eyesight. Right.

142
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:12,280
If you don't know me, you could be forgiven for saying, well, just jump in your car. Do this.

143
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,940
I can't do that. OK, it's not one of the forces not thinking and all that.

144
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:21,840
But this is OK. Someone was there. I wasn't thinking. I'm sorry. No. OK.

145
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,100
You're sorry. That's fine. You're sorry. But I'm not.

146
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,920
In other words, if you're not thinking now, you weren't thinking yesterday. You won't be thinking.

147
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,020
Well, now I have to question the whole process. What the hell are you doing?

148
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,600
If you weren't thinking about the simplest, most obvious thing.

149
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:40,200
Well, it's a matter of perspective. But and yeah. So here's the other thing.

150
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:47,740
My perspective is, you know, when someone says, I love you all, whatever on the Internet, that's bullshit.

151
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,260
I'll tell you why. A friend to all is a friend to none.

152
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,400
Let's let's harp on our kicks again a little bit. How many people have you seen?

153
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,940
That's one thing. Someone was ragging on him.

154
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:04,280
The other person is like, oh, anyone who knows him personally, except where, you know, it's like this guy's an asshole.

155
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,900
Right. But online, he seems right. Different. OK.

156
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:11,780
So if you get to know me in person, I'm exactly like I am right now.

157
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:17,260
No, I'm the same thing. I mean, I just might get a little louder on the radio. That's it.

158
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:23,340
If I can just find one or two people that I can work with, that's fine.

159
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:31,320
And I mean, not just, you know, showing up and doing a sonic, you know, and the rest is whatever.

160
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:37,940
My motto is why bother? Why bother? But you got to put it out there.

161
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,020
Part of me is like, you know, there's a time of recompense in the future.

162
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,860
If you know something, you should share it. And that's why I'm doing this.

163
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:52,000
But I don't see any. All right. OK. I don't see any movement or any not a movement like an organization cult type thing.

164
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:59,680
But furtherance of my work, the stuff and my stuff that I put out, it's not my stuff, but the stuff, my presentation, I should say.

165
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:07,440
Yeah. But I've seen but I've seen results from this that I think sometimes you don't take to you know, you don't take very seriously.

166
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:13,980
No, no. I have over 150, maybe 200 serious emails over the past years.

167
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:18,160
Right. Of people that said I've changed the way I think I change the way I eat.

168
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,440
My health has changed. My family life has changed. My money life has changed all for the better because of your stuff.

169
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:29,320
And if you've changed. Well, and look, just realistically, if you've changed a hundred lives directly. Right.

170
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:33,080
More than that. Yeah. OK. Well, let's just go. We'll just go with the hundred.

171
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:40,380
The hundred. There's also a bunch of people that are connected to them that are around them that you may never hear from.

172
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,220
That's right. Someone mentioned that in the chat that they've. All right.

173
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:49,820
OK, so yeah, I have nothing really to say about the dark scriptures thing, because if you listen, it's kind of hard.

174
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,240
I haven't gotten into anything with this new project. Rated Y, it's really older stuff that's still posted somewhere.

175
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:03,880
Talk about scripture. Very, very different. Yeah, we haven't really gone into it, even though people keep requesting it, to be honest with you.

176
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,560
We haven't really got here. We could do it in five minutes because it's a point of view.

177
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:13,060
It's OK. It's not like which fish we're going to catch. It's how to fish. Right.

178
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:21,500
So the whole idea is whatever subject you tackle, any subject you want to learn about.

179
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:29,020
If there is enough or some or a lot memorialized information, meaning in writing could be digital or whatever.

180
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:36,540
And it is subdivided and it goes into detail, goes into the history of the stuff.

181
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:41,940
And categorically, it's it's it's been accepted and proven.

182
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:47,840
Right. You don't have any license to start saying stuff that's not in there.

183
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,020
In other words, you have to know that stuff first before you start discussing it.

184
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:56,860
Now, what I've found with scripture is no one is discussing it like I do at all.

185
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,480
Zero. Because of the many reasons.

186
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:07,220
One is if you're going to be a discusser, a discusser, like archaics, whatever you know the whole thing about,

187
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:12,720
you have to say things that people are going to like and people that will buy into what you're saying.

188
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:20,660
And I tell you right now, 99 percent of the time you can't be saying more than five or 10 percent of what's in scripture,

189
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:24,480
because you start going more than five or 10 percent of what's in scripture.

190
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,480
People are going to leave. It doesn't matter who they are.

191
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:30,120
It's one of these things that rubs people wrong. Same thing with the medical.

192
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:35,420
Well, yeah, actually, everything I was looking with the money, I start going the other way.

193
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,960
So I had to learn the hard lesson about politics this way.

194
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:46,520
Greek, I know you think that's silly or whatever, but I had to learn this very hard lesson that if I'm not saying some of the things

195
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:53,020
that people come to the table wanting to hear, then I'm guaranteeing that I'm slimming my audience.

196
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,420
Like there's a guarantee that I'm going to reduce.

197
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:01,080
Now, I could be telling them some brand new information that they will get nowhere else.

198
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,840
And the thing is, they'll run away. And you know why?

199
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,200
Because I didn't put the hook into them to say, look, you're right about a whole lot of things that you think to begin with.

200
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:17,500
Well, let's go back to the. If you got more than five listeners, you got to start questioning where are they coming from?

201
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:21,820
Why are they here? You know, five, it could be several hundred, even a thousand or two.

202
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,880
And you have to ask yourself, why are so many people coming?

203
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,020
Because I know what people are like and why are some of them coming?

204
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:35,240
Right. Because, you know, I must you know, I must be a big pile of poop and all the flies are coming.

205
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,700
You know, is this for the perspective that I'm saying? Right.

206
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:46,680
But if you can get the message, Freeman told me he's not over all the five interviews I've done with about a million downloads.

207
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:52,040
And there's only been a handful of people that have contacted me and reached out of a million.

208
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,300
Let's say or let's say let's say half a million or a quarter of a million if you really want to be conservative.

209
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:04,400
Because statistically, one, I don't know if it delineated where they one person could have listened to it five times.

210
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,640
But no, it doesn't. Yeah. It doesn't help you divide that out.

211
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:13,540
Like it could be that somebody's got it on their iPad and then they get it on their phone.

212
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,859
Yeah. Yeah. That's more correct. That's about right.

213
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:23,500
Because now a million people, let's say, hear you and only five or 10 or 20 are interested in what you're saying.

214
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:29,160
Now you're in good company. Now you're in good company, meaning with the good, the real philosophers.

215
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,960
Right. Back in the day. And you're really putting out real information.

216
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,700
Right. Anyway, this is a big topic.

217
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:43,060
But you notice I didn't address the video that was put up called Dark Scriptures because I don't see what he where he's going with it.

218
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,660
Right. I don't I don't see any point. And his sources are not very good.

219
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,280
And the point, you know, where there's no burning bush, by the way, in the Bible, you could read that.

220
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:57,140
I could reiterate it for you if those are people are questioning it.

221
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,340
If you'd like and you have time, sure.

222
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:08,060
I want to throw something at you, though, to see if you can relate this to what you're discussing, because I did something very unusual recently.

223
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,240
I gave a video talk. They wanted a short talk over at Apple.

224
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:19,540
OK, Apple corporate wanted to hear from different people that are handicapped.

225
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:25,000
OK, I'm going to use a whole lot of really a lot of surface dwelling language here that I don't like to use.

226
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,620
But let's go with the slave talk.

227
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:33,060
So they want to hear from handicapped people about their accessibility to technology.

228
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:44,460
If you have to work with newer technology as it emerges, we want to hear from you so that we get ideas about the perspective from somebody who is limited in their abilities.

229
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,780
OK, before I go before you go, let me just say this.

230
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:54,760
The reason why they're doing that is because someone in the company who's a friend of someone gave them a grant to do this.

231
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,140
They don't need to do this. They already know.

232
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:01,580
And they gave them an extra bunch of money so they could start a little department because they were a friend of a friend.

233
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,800
Get it. It's a hookup deal. Right. You get it.

234
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,820
Sure. It's kind of like the university hookup deals where they allocated.

235
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:15,680
This is real. Some Midwestern university 20 years ago, two million dollars to find out why water is good for plants.

236
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,900
You mean that place where there's no intelligent life?

237
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,700
Right. Yeah, that's right.

238
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,220
Because all that is, is come here, I'll give you a sweet deal.

239
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,720
You know, when you run away with it in two years, we'll split it kind of thing like that.

240
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,680
So anyway, go ahead.

241
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,460
So that's what I'm part of, apparently.

242
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:41,380
But I thought it would be interesting to give that presentation and tell them that effectively the only reason why technology has adapted is because you had an audience, an aging audience that was going to have visual problems.

243
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:49,220
So particularly for me, it became advantageous only because you guys were in search of a greater customer base.

244
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:57,160
If that customer base shrinks because the population shrinks and you don't have an agent population, I think they'll lag behind.

245
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,500
Yeah. But look, let me just say this.

246
00:19:59,600 --> 00:19:59,720
Yeah.

247
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:04,340
Apple, Microsoft, Raytheon, they have access to time manipulation.

248
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:14,120
Right. So they know every, like I said, all these things that they put out that seem benign or innocuous or whatever is just because to help out someone.

249
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,080
Right. You know, here's here.

250
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,720
OK, we're going to do a special search research thing here.

251
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,340
Here's a bunch of money.

252
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,540
Just, you know, do this.

253
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,160
We already, you know, it's all.

254
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,540
Well, I would have no problem.

255
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,440
That's from what you just mentioned is Apple politics.

256
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:28,940
Right.

257
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:29,960
Well, kind of.

258
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,620
But this is for an internal thing.

259
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,760
It's not meant for the public.

260
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,320
Like you said, it's a project.

261
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:34,640
Yeah.

262
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:47,700
But the reason why I did it is because I wanted to see if somehow I could get involved, maybe in, you know, getting a few dollars for telling a few real stories or giving some real input to these guys, maybe, you know, regardless of what they.

263
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,040
Yeah.

264
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:54,660
Well, then getting a few dollars, let's say, or credits from these guys would be the only thing, because that's the whole basis for it.

265
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,500
They really don't care.

266
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,580
They know the deal.

267
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,680
Well, I do.

268
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,480
And it's not going to be able to begin anybody else.

269
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,340
So why not?

270
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:02,700
Look.

271
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,120
Well, do you find that to be a bad thing that I'm doing?

272
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,100
No, no.

273
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:06,720
I wouldn't say.

274
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:14,260
Well, I wouldn't say I don't say it's bad, but I wouldn't say it's good if you want to do other things and it's taking you away from them.

275
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:18,220
If you don't have anything else to do, let's say it had been a priority.

276
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,360
You're going to get, you know, rewarded.

277
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,300
Do it.

278
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:22,840
If my.

279
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,200
I would look at it purely.

280
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,060
Whenever you're dealing with these things, it's monetary.

281
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:30,560
Like someone asked me if I wanted to do a study on smokers, how much they pay it right away.

282
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,440
I said, you know, because they were.

283
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,680
So what we want to know is, you know, how much you're paying first.

284
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:36,860
It's about money.

285
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,680
Well, I want to know two things.

286
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,940
What what is my level of effort that is required of me?

287
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,380
And then, yeah.

288
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,280
What is the what is the reward for said?

289
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:46,800
Exactly.

290
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,420
Well, yeah.

291
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,020
Compensation, let's say.

292
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:49,800
Compensation.

293
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:50,360
Good word.

294
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,300
Remuneration.

295
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:57,880
OK, so that's what I was after is I wanted to be put in the, you know, running for some

296
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,400
compensation.

297
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:05,380
I wouldn't think a company like these big companies, whatever they are, are just playing their

298
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:09,940
everything they do, even if it's nonpublic or is still part of their politics.

299
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,480
So think of Apple, Microsoft, GM, Tesla, Raytheon.

300
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,760
They're all political parties.

301
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,940
In addition to the Democrats, Republicans, libertarians.

302
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:18,520
Sure.

303
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,260
That's that's how prominent they are in the public eye.

304
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,280
Well, it just so happens.

305
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:23,820
It's all political.

306
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,100
Yeah.

307
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,600
It just so happens a relative of mine works for them.

308
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,420
So that's how I got considered in the first place.

309
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:29,960
Right.

310
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,100
And well, you revealed it, though.

311
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:35,000
You said the only reason why you even get into these things is for that.

312
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:35,920
So, yeah.

313
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:36,800
Yeah.

314
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:37,520
Yeah.

315
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:41,680
I'm just hoping to be offered up as a resource because if all I got to do is give a 20 minute

316
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,020
talk and then maybe somebody is going to pay me to do that.

317
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,960
Look, that's what I'm after here.

318
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,280
What I'm after overall is being able to.

319
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,580
As long as they're not coming to take bacon off your back.

320
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,780
No, nothing like that.

321
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:55,100
But I mean, if all you're asking for is a few minutes of my time to sit and talk and

322
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:59,840
I can be paid for that and do something that I view as productive during my discussion,

323
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:03,140
my speech, whatever, I see no problem with that.

324
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,320
That's kind of what my whole business is.

325
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:05,580
Right.

326
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,220
Sure.

327
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,400
But let's get back to the conversation.

328
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:12,140
Well, so my point is this is an addendum about communication.

329
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:17,340
And I was communicating an idea that I don't think they were exactly after, but I thought

330
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:21,940
it would be different enough from the, oh, let me give you my complaints and my direct

331
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,600
experiences.

332
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,740
And instead I said, you know what?

333
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,100
Overall, I think if you're serious about this, there's a way to do it.

334
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,660
And if you're not, then there's another way to go.

335
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,940
And that was my old presentation, which I did.

336
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:33,540
Oh, that's fine.

337
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,720
In a hot seven minutes actually on the video.

338
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,620
And I did very little preparation work for it.

339
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:42,480
So it was a little effort with the potential for something in the future.

340
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,220
However.

341
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,020
That's profound.

342
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,780
This is the way it should be done.

343
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,920
I should get something out of it.

344
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:47,160
Okay.

345
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,160
But this is me communicating, right?

346
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:56,760
And I communicated this to them because I had some fair instructions and we had an exchange.

347
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:02,440
The problem is that a lot of people come to you claiming they want some sort of communication.

348
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,600
And even if you follow their directions.

349
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,380
Sorry, they don't.

350
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,300
I've never had that.

351
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:06,560
No?

352
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,140
No, no.

353
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,420
They have an itching desire for something.

354
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:17,780
It's called in scripture, it makes their ears, it tingles their ears, right?

355
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,440
Something unusual, something different.

356
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,980
Your ears are itching.

357
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,240
Your ears are burning.

358
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,400
Somebody's talking about you.

359
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,780
Kind of thing.

360
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,740
Yeah, it just tickles them a little.

361
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,180
But no, no one's ever approached me about communication.

362
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:38,640
I had a big problem, both personal, social, whatever, with not being able to communicate.

363
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:44,060
And anyone I started doing any work with, personal or business or whatever, I said,

364
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:52,380
Listen, when you communicate, the way you do it is you preface what you're going to communicate.

365
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:55,480
You inform about what you're going to communicate.

366
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,500
And then you discuss.

367
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,080
Preface, inform, discuss.

368
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,780
Those are the three factors.

369
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:01,580
Right.

370
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:06,160
So and I could give you a dozen examples, but it's not necessary.

371
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,680
And then there's the physical communication that goes all the way from how you're working

372
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,520
relationship with someone all the way to, you know, a sexual partner.

373
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:13,780
Right.

374
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,080
That's also communication.

375
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:15,520
Right.

376
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,080
Right.

377
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,640
And that begins with very big.

378
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:23,620
I just got 10, around 10, 11 years ago, I threw my hands up and I said, OK, if they just

379
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:28,740
learned how to communicate the surface to earth inhabitants, that would solve that would

380
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:34,140
be a 90 percent jump in improvement in their direction that they need to go in, not to

381
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,440
fix 90 percent of their stuff.

382
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:39,340
But if they learn how to communicate and actually just put a little more effort into structure

383
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:44,100
and communication and someone will say, well, why do we have to do it that way?

384
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,260
OK, let's do it the other way.

385
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,560
What what they're really doing is they're discussing.

386
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,820
You have to play a detective.

387
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,760
What the hell are they talking about?

388
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,000
Then they give you little bits of information.

389
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,820
And then when they notice that they didn't preface it, then they give you the preface

390
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,340
in the end.

391
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:02,380
So when I listen to people speak, I'm like, don't bother pausing.

392
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,600
Say it as fast as you can, because I have to play detective when you're done to figure

393
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,060
out what the fuck you're trying to tell me.

394
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:07,280
Right.

395
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,420
So just let it all out.

396
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:08,840
Right.

397
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,480
Give me a few minutes to piece it together.

398
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:10,980
Yeah.

399
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:11,440
Right.

400
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:12,620
Right.

401
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,000
So.

402
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,240
So it's like, why?

403
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:21,080
So if they learned how to preface first, inform and then discuss, that would put them on 90

404
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,640
percent leap in the direction that they need to go to start working on everything.

405
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:26,540
Right.

406
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:32,120
It seems to me as though that's literally the solution to 90 percent of the conflict

407
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:32,940
everywhere.

408
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,920
I mean, and I'm talking about everywhere.

409
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:39,520
But it doesn't mean the solution to the conflict doesn't mean you're not going to have conflict

410
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,320
because you have to implement the solution.

411
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:41,740
Right.

412
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,240
You get it.

413
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:43,460
Right.

414
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,120
This is implement.

415
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,840
We're not talking about implementation.

416
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,480
We're just talking planning stage.

417
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,740
No, look, it's like cleaning up the yard, though.

418
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,600
That gets rid of most of your leaves.

419
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,340
Now you got to go around and fix up the edges and stuff.

420
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:54,920
You know what I mean?

421
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,580
But I'm saying it would clear up most of the eyesore.

422
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:00,440
Look, there's there's enough going on in reality.

423
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,860
Look, Mandela effect.

424
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,680
I use that term.

425
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:10,360
I drilled holes, five holes, five three 16 holes in a steel ring yesterday.

426
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,440
All right.

427
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,780
This is one of these items.

428
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,200
OK.

429
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:17,400
I approached it this morning and there were no holes drilled in it.

430
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:18,740
OK.

431
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,260
You're saying that this literally occurred.

432
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:23,480
Yes.

433
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,080
Literally occur.

434
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:24,840
How is that possible?

435
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:29,840
So you got some kind of time slam reality slam again.

436
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:30,700
Right.

437
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:34,720
And I know I didn't dream doing that because I had cutting oil.

438
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,720
It was OK.

439
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,980
Now, you can be incidental if somebody makes a change to something else, small somewhere

440
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:43,060
else, it could incidentally have a butterfly effect in there.

441
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:49,280
We got the past three days have been very odd where I had.

442
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,960
Anyways, numbers were mixed up, you know, quantities were mixed up, numbers of things

443
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,760
written down, sent, and they didn't get there the way they were sent.

444
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:04,340
So is it just the order of the numbers or were the numbers literally of the numbers

445
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,440
like a mistake?

446
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,540
And yeah, it's just really, really odd stuff going on.

447
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,420
And it's been it's been not building up.

448
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,100
But for me, it was a big one recently.

449
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,580
So how do you take that?

450
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:14,840
Right.

451
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:19,700
I mean, you know, they built a tremendous amount of insane asylums in the mid 19th

452
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,800
century, end of 19th century.

453
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,120
Right.

454
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:26,220
So enough to house about 10 percent of the world's population.

455
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:29,260
So some weird stuff was going on back then, too.

456
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:29,980
Yeah, for sure.

457
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,060
A lot of the big loonies.

458
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,020
Let's go.

459
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:32,800
Let's go back.

460
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,220
Let's go back to where we were.

461
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:38,080
So the chat has been working a lot of times.

462
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,760
I don't I'm too busy.

463
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,200
Like I have to catch up on emails for the past week.

464
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,460
So I try to look at the chat.

465
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:49,580
I know I try not to be away from the chat for more than three days.

466
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,160
Look at it.

467
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:50,940
I may not respond.

468
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:55,240
But when I see someone ask a question myself or someone else, I don't jump in

469
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,820
and answer it right away unless it's one of these smoothing questions that if you

470
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,700
just just answer it because that's it.

471
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,880
It's not a discussion type thing.

472
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,100
Right.

473
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:07,060
And I like it when other people come in and put in their points of view, what

474
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,980
they know, what they found out, what what could be.

475
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:10,260
Right.

476
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,960
And that's what happened on this recent chat thing going on.

477
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:15,900
I've been watching it.

478
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:20,480
It started with a few things, including the post with the archaic dark

479
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:20,920
scriptures.

480
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:26,080
Now, the thing is, I'm being I haven't really said anything about archaics on

481
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,560
that matter because I there's nothing to say.

482
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,100
It's a complete we're talking about two completely different subjects.

483
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,580
So just leave it at that.

484
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:32,960
OK.

485
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,900
For the people that know old Greek speak and have been on the Skype and on

486
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,780
the older stuff, you'll know that they know exactly that archaics is not

487
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,420
talking about the same thing I am.

488
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:42,940
Right.

489
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,180
Right.

490
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:48,700
As a matter of fact, anyone that gets on this starts talking about the Bible

491
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,600
and the Internet isn't talking about what I am.

492
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,320
So, yeah, I'm not that original, by the way.

493
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:57,260
There are others like that, but you but it's very unpopular because it's

494
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:57,720
unpopular.

495
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,840
You probably never heard of them.

496
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,620
The only one that I cited was Ernest L.

497
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,620
Martin, but they were a sellout also.

498
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,900
So and that was new with Ernest L.

499
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,100
Martin.

500
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,400
It was very new when I was getting into it.

501
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:15,720
But I got into where I took two years off to study it and I was very serious

502
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,100
and hardcore and they saw it.

503
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:22,240
But I scared them because on one end, they're like, oh, we got to do what's

504
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,720
in the Bible, you know, whatever.

505
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,320
And I'm like, you're not your timing thing.

506
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,920
You're arguing over Pope's work schedule.

507
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:31,340
And they freely admitted to me it's about what, you know, they won't do that

508
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,340
because of the money.

509
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:32,620
Right.

510
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,900
So I'm like, oh, OK, so we are merchants after all.

511
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,640
You are merchants after all.

512
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,740
Oh, you are worldly after all.

513
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:39,980
Right.

514
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,400
So, you know, they.

515
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:41,840
Yeah.

516
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,160
OK.

517
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:42,860
Same thing.

518
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,160
Like with archaics.

519
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:48,760
You will not go and do an interview unless someone's got more subs than he

520
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,760
does or are very popular.

521
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,260
Like if someone with 500 subs asked me, he's going to say no because he wants

522
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,460
to be rich.

523
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,420
He doesn't want to be right.

524
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,240
OK, so and his narrative is running thin.

525
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,740
I don't really bother with it anymore.

526
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,520
I got what I needed to get out of it, just like with, you know, any other deal.

527
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,440
You get what you need.

528
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,140
You don't you don't admonish them.

529
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:14,320
You don't go after and say bad things or even too many good things to me.

530
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,760
If you say too many good things about someone that it's also like something's

531
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,520
wrong because there's nothing that good, you know, or nothing is perfect.

532
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,540
Nothing is even good enough to be whatever here.

533
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,900
It's a mess, such a big mess.

534
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,860
But when I see what's going on, it's like, you know, just take it, walk away.

535
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,740
You know, it's just like in my past.

536
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:39,920
I've been I've been offered things, you know, like positions and be part of a

537
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,720
business. And I look at it and I'm like, you know, anybody else would have

538
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,180
jumped in right now because it looks so good.

539
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,440
But I kind of run the program.

540
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,380
I run it through.

541
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,640
What would it be like after a week, after a month, after a year?

542
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,880
No, it's going to get shitty at six months.

543
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:57,280
You know, and it's not like I'm being negative about it or whatever, but I

544
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,020
watch the and then I watch the organization in six months and I look at

545
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:00,920
the process. I see.

546
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,560
I'm glad I didn't jump that thing.

547
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,600
So I have a very good sense about these things.

548
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:10,700
And ever since the beginning of Greek speak, I've said if I've got more than

549
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,760
20 people listening, it's probably I got to examine what I'm saying.

550
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:15,520
Right.

551
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:20,580
It's not, you know, on the other hand, doing the subscription thing and having

552
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:24,960
input and credits coming in basically doesn't even cover coffee and cigarettes

553
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,220
for me. Not even shy of like 50 or 100 bucks a month of cigarette money.

554
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:36,400
So what I'm trying to say is if the if the Greek speak stuff took off and I've

555
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,700
always told anyone who wanted to work with don't call it Greek speak, expand

556
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,630
it into something else. And it hasn't.

557
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:46,580
But my whole thing was if this point of view with.

558
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:51,420
All right. Let's call it a point of view was to expand and grow.

559
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,560
It would be for its own sake, not for mine anyway.

560
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:58,820
Right. It would be a group of people now saying, hey, all we got to do is go

561
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,880
back to see what's already been written about this.

562
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,740
Right. That's all. That's what our cakes did.

563
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,920
You know, with the chronology.

564
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:09,960
That's why from the beginning, our kicks, I just said, I don't feel like I'm

565
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,540
talking about our kicks off for half an hour.

566
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,980
But he just said, what's what's been memorialized about it?

567
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:17,220
Great. You know, big applause for that. Right.

568
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,840
But the rest of the stuff, man, not really.

569
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,960
If he was at a bar, I wouldn't even go sit with him kind of thing.

570
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:29,120
So the point here is take what you can that you find to be useful.

571
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,800
That's not bad. It may not be good, but as long as it's not bad and use it.

572
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,740
Another thing, let's just jump around in the chat.

573
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:40,140
Total Segway jump into it about skin ailments.

574
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,720
OK. Years ago, I talked about skin and teeth are going to be vulnerable as we

575
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:48,300
go into the future because of the radiation, both natural and manmade.

576
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,480
And let me just go back to a few things.

577
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:58,080
I did post something which I did have private e-mails exchange with that person.

578
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:05,680
And I had an ailment on my left arm, which I explained what the left side is.

579
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,239
Right. It's a blocking. Right.

580
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,440
Both right and left block. But it's energy going down.

581
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:15,760
Right. And whenever I made the cabbage pot roast, pot roast cabbage.

582
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,280
Now, I just want to reiterate to people.

583
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,199
I don't know which episode we did it on.

584
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,219
Maybe a dozen or so or score ago.

585
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,980
Episodes pot roast. How to cook the cabbage.

586
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,659
It has nothing to do with cabbage that you've eaten before.

587
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,840
It's not cooking cabbage. It's cabbage pot roast.

588
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:38,139
In other words, it's made a certain way that not only does it transform.

589
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:41,480
It's actually the reason I did it is a meat substitute.

590
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:43,880
Someone asked me, is there my spouse?

591
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,620
I want to get him off of eating meat.

592
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,639
So how about pot? Does it like pot roast?

593
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,920
OK, how about we substitute the beef for cabbage?

594
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,540
I engineered that and it worked.

595
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:55,820
So if anyone's ever cooked that and actually I've gotten about a dozen e-mails

596
00:34:55,820 --> 00:35:00,800
saying it's amazing because people have eaten cooked cabbage before.

597
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,740
Even you mentioned it.

598
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,300
I stop you when you start talking about because this has nothing to do with

599
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:04,920
cooked cabbage.

600
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:10,360
The way that you cook it, the technique changes the overall finish on it.

601
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,420
And it's actually it works like a meat substitute.

602
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:17,000
I had some recently and I was like, this is like eating steak, you know.

603
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,780
So it has to be cabbage.

604
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:21,520
Yeah, it has to be different because compared to the stuff they usually,

605
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,560
you know, serve around St. Patty's Day, I think is one.

606
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,220
Oh, no. Well, the way it's made. Right.

607
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:30,040
OK, so. OK.

608
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,840
Cabbage is a wonderful it's one of the primary vegetables.

609
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,580
And not only that, it does reflect the skin and the brain.

610
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:42,900
Now, what I wanted to bring up is when I would do that twice a week,

611
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,940
I noticed any topical ailment, skin ailment I had started regressing and

612
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,120
going away into remission.

613
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:55,900
If I also put in the point of the moon phases are important here also.

614
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:01,880
I just want to jump into the cabbage, the broccoli, by the way,

615
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,000
if you're going.

616
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:06,500
Someone did send me a head of cabbage and a head of broccoli in a box.

617
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,760
Now, I appreciate things being sent.

618
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:13,000
But for the past 20 years that I've been involved in making things and

619
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,340
sending them out, people sending them back or sending me something of theirs.

620
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:21,800
When you send something in the post, it doesn't matter which carrier it is.

621
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,400
It has to have packing material in it. Right.

622
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:28,800
So whenever I get a box and I told the spouse this or the wife all the time,

623
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,420
whenever you get a box, just don't give it to me.

624
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,440
If I'm not there and you pick it up,

625
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,200
if you move the box and you feel something shaking from right to left and it's

626
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,400
rolling around in there, chances are it's damaged. Right.

627
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:44,940
In other words, whenever you get something in the post, it doesn't matter.

628
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,320
When I say post, it could be postal, post service.

629
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,820
It could be FedEx, DHL, UPS. It doesn't matter.

630
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,960
The content should not be moving around. Right.

631
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,300
Because there's something called a ball mill or a tumbler where you put

632
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,580
things with rough edges and it keeps tumbling to make them smooth,

633
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,720
like river rocks are smooth. Right. It breaks down.

634
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,380
So anyway, I got a head of cabbage and a head of broccoli in a box.

635
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:12,920
And it was basically like a five pound potato and a 10 pound box. Right.

636
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:16,360
So a lot of room in there bouncing around. It came kind of.

637
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:19,420
The cabbage survived. The broccoli didn't.

638
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:22,280
So if you have enough love to send the Greek something,

639
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:26,740
put some newspaper in there or something and take up all the airspace.

640
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:29,680
And if it's a vegetable, it's perishable.

641
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,380
You should have something, a cooling packet in there.

642
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,320
But anyway. Right. That's me.

643
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:40,800
People that when I ship stuff to people, one of the usually people that are aware,

644
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,900
get back and say, I can't believe how well it was packed.

645
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,600
Well, it didn't. That's just how it should be done.

646
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:50,360
You know, so. But anyway.

647
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,660
I do get remember no live animals,

648
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,220
but I do get vegetables and things like that in the mail.

649
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:03,360
And I still I know there's a bag of salt that I have to pick up.

650
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,460
And thank you. Who sent that as well? Celtic salt. OK, cool.

651
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,500
But all the other stuff you guys send me.

652
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:14,980
So where I want to go with this is the the cabbage aspect.

653
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:19,120
If you do it now, raw is different because of the high content.

654
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,320
Your body's not the high raw content.

655
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:26,400
It takes a long time to break down unless you're a UPS driver or a postal carrier.

656
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,240
Right. Or construction worker.

657
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,100
OK. The rule of thumb with food is this.

658
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:35,340
The more raw the food, the more active you have to be.

659
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,960
And I'm not talking about active. Go to the gym for an hour a day.

660
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,620
I'm talking all day activity like someone who delivers the mail or UPS driver, construction worker.

661
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:48,260
Who else would be active? What other fields?

662
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:53,520
An aerobics teacher. You know, you have to be moving constantly.

663
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:56,840
Yeah. OK. Yeah. In order for your body to break it down.

664
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,960
Military drill instructor kind of guy. Yeah. Yeah.

665
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,760
But constantly moving. Yeah. Not a cop. Right.

666
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:09,100
Now, the more sedentary you are, the more sedentary you are, the more cooked food you should have.

667
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,860
And that's the rule, by the way.

668
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:18,120
Now, you can there are exceptions to those rules, but that's the rule for actually balancing, structuring your life.

669
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:21,720
OK, so there's a lot of people that want to go raw and go vegan.

670
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:26,600
And I'm like, you can get really sick going vegan if you don't know what you're doing.

671
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:32,640
Right. In other words, if you eat a lot of raw nuts, which are high in oxalates, you could really damage your kidneys.

672
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,220
You could really your teeth start breaking off at the gum line.

673
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,300
Eating raw nuts and raw killer damage.

674
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:45,480
Raw nuts and raw food, if you're sedentary, can cause these problems if you're not moving around sedentary.

675
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:50,100
Or also, if you if you're if you're eating too many raw nuts, even if you're active.

676
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,380
Right. OK. You'll have muscle cramps and things like that.

677
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:56,140
So people who are vegan don't know about food, the stuff that we're getting.

678
00:39:56,140 --> 00:40:03,900
We've all I've always gotten into. OK. And and and also what we're going to get into right now regarding the skin.

679
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:08,280
OK, so the skin I mentioned years ago, skin and teeth are going to be a problem.

680
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:12,400
Let's just deal with the skin right now. The cabbage would be well cooked.

681
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,320
Now, the cabbage pot roast, by the way, is the cabbage pot roast.

682
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,120
Those of you know, there's no meat involved.

683
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:21,140
They call it a pot roast because it gives you the effect of eating a pot roast.

684
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:26,280
Right now, if you really want that effect, add some soy sauce or tamari to it.

685
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:30,120
Right. When you're cooking, it'll make a nice, dark, rich color to it.

686
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:33,620
But with purple cabbage. But but here's the point.

687
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:39,240
The soothing elements just use the terminology. It's bracing and soothing.

688
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:45,120
Bracing means you're not going to eat it and be hungry an hour later or get the shakes later.

689
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,240
Right. It'll it'll keep you for quite a while.

690
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,400
And soothing is that you will feel your body healing.

691
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:59,720
Now, when your body heals, when you sleep like, OK, you see a bodybuilder, someone who's really fit.

692
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,520
You're like, oh, he must go to the gym a lot. That's what everybody says. Right.

693
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,580
Oh, must be working out a lot. You know what I think?

694
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:09,440
He must be getting some good sleep because when you go to the gym, your muscles don't build.

695
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,780
Your muscles build when you're right. OK, sleeping.

696
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:16,320
Yeah. So when I see someone who's really fit. Right.

697
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:20,900
I never say that you go to gym a lot. They sleep really well.

698
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,560
Wow. What a point of view. Because let's see what's going on.

699
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:30,140
Could you. OK, let's just be ridiculous for a moment or maybe more than a moment.

700
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,440
Let's say you're constantly working out at the gym and you don't sleep.

701
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,520
Well, first of all, you'll die without sleep for seven days.

702
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,180
Sleep will kill you within seven to 10 days. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. OK.

703
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,620
All right. So, right. The rule that out.

704
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:46,840
So so let's say there's always in the gym and they sleep for two hours or three hours a night.

705
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:49,880
They're going to look like crap. So it's the sleep that does.

706
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:53,800
It's a combo. Is it is it just the sleep? Someone who just sleeps will not look like that.

707
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:57,480
The combinations. That's what we're speaking of here.

708
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:01,820
Now, one of the combinations I want to bring on that I didn't emphasize all along,

709
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:04,640
but on the earlier sonics I brought up is moon phases.

710
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:10,640
The state of the cosmos, as we are right now, the moon is a major, major effect on us.

711
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,840
Why do you figure that out when you look into it in your own researches?

712
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:25,200
When the moon is full, it's at its maximum expansion, its effect. Right.

713
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:29,460
You never hear about the effects of the dark when everyone's talking about the effects of the full moon. Right.

714
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:37,000
So you'll find a lot of stuff in culture also that, you know, that is actually a signal to what I'm saying, signaling a lot of these methods.

715
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:47,040
Now, when the moon starts to wane and go towards the dark moon, these contractive energies start setting in. Right.

716
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:54,800
So you go accordingly. So as the moon goes from full to dark moon, which is the middle of the month, what they call a new moon,

717
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:03,500
your diet should start contracting also less expansive. So at the full moon time, that's when you would eat the sweetest food.

718
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:08,920
You would have the more yin foods. Right. You look up what yin and yang foods are.

719
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:13,780
As you go towards the dark moon, you could use a little more salt.

720
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:20,960
You can eat some animal, eat more dried things, you know, like things that are concentrated, you know, even the grains.

721
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:30,520
You do your buckwheat and your rye, brown rice. And during the full moon, you would do more of an oats or a millet or a barley. Right.

722
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:41,240
More expansive. So you go with the moon. So as the moon is at its dark middle of the month, when it's the darkest, that's that's the time you have some meat or more salt in your food.

723
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:48,200
If you're not, you know, an animal, you're right. More salty things, you know, cured things.

724
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:56,120
And then as as the full the dark moon passes, then you go. It starts expanding and waxing towards the full moon again.

725
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:03,340
You start decreasing those young things. You start eating more, eating it more towards the more liquid, softer foods, a little sweeter.

726
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:08,500
Right. As you get more greens, more salads. Right. OK.

727
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:18,700
OK. And then the moon comes and then as it comes, go back to the dark moon, eat less salad, maybe a little more denser foods, more root vegetable.

728
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:25,380
Right. And then the meat and then you repeat that. So the reason I'm saying is listening to someone is so ridiculous, vegan.

729
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:31,160
And they've been vegan, they said, for 30 years. Something that I just mentioned would make their head explode.

730
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:34,380
And it did, by the way. It only took me about 10 seconds to have them implode.

731
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,180
So they imploded. Yeah. And about I would say 10 seconds, about 11 and a half seconds.

732
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:47,300
So so they're like, oh, I eat nuts. I eat this. I eat that.

733
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,380
But when do you eat them and you know, and how do you know I have to be wrong?

734
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:56,440
And I'm like, well, but all the time, you know, so there's only so much punishment.

735
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:00,020
So what I'm trying to say here, OK, well, people have to be very careful.

736
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:04,180
I just want to point something out. You know, some people will go to look things up after this.

737
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,520
And you're going to get very confused if you begin to look it up.

738
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,140
There's no place to look this up directly, like I'm saying. Well, there are.

739
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,160
I have to write a treatise on this. Yeah. But there are tons of ways actually to look this up.

740
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,000
They're not correct, is what the problem is. There's all kinds of things.

741
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:24,640
There's a few chapters in some of Michio Kushi's old books somewhere.

742
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,640
But here, let me bring this up again. Let me just reiterate full moon.

743
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:33,320
As we're approaching the full moon at the full moon, you start eating more salads, more of the sweeter foods that you.

744
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:39,580
I'm not talking about sugar candies. Sweeter foods would be whatever you tend to have more dessert.

745
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:44,080
Let's say whatever, you know, sweet squash is sweet.

746
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:46,580
You know, you cook carrots. They could be really sweet. Right.

747
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:53,140
So, you know, as more salads, leafy greens, expansive food like that.

748
00:45:53,880 --> 00:46:00,100
Now, as you go towards the dark moon, more contractive food, a little less sweet foods, more salty.

749
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,040
I'm not saying eat salt. The things that tend to be a salty food.

750
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,100
Like, for example, when you ask me what salty foods do you like?

751
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,160
The first thing I say is bacalao, which is salted codfish.

752
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:14,440
There are many ways to prepare. You could have it cold as a salad.

753
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,080
You could have it hot with a little tomato based soup. Right.

754
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:20,880
Whatever. I like canned mackerel, you know, things like that.

755
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:26,740
OK. So pastrami sandwich. Right. It's a little salty, but not too. Right.

756
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:31,220
OK. Example. OK. Whatever. A good, a good hot dog or something.

757
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:36,480
OK. So when I say good hot dog, let's get a good hot dog on the street in New York, by the way.

758
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:39,120
The ones with the sabrets, you know, with the skin on. Pretty much.

759
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:43,120
Yeah. The dirty water dogs. Yeah. Dirty water dogs. Yeah.

760
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:46,340
I try to make them here. I came pretty close. But anyway.

761
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:50,280
So as the dark moon comes, you have more salty foods.

762
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:56,660
Now, as the dark moon comes and it passes, you start transitioning out of that back to what?

763
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:02,860
Slightly sweeter foods, more green salads, leafy greens, softer foods to accommodate.

764
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:08,720
So you see it going towards the full moon. Expansive yin, a little sweeter green salads.

765
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:16,860
The moon passes as you go towards the dark moon. Work practically slightly saltier, not as sweet.

766
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:20,300
Maybe some animal time. OK.

767
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:25,660
One one people don't like those. What do you mean animal? You know, fish, chicken, beef, whatever.

768
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,900
Yeah. So when you start doing that. OK. Yeah.

769
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:36,200
No, just one. When you start doing that, your body starts to go into the natural order and now you can apply your healing.

770
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:39,680
All right. Take take a little break on this, because I want to.

771
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:44,340
First of all, I don't know. You moved around or something, but it broke up a little bit there for a second.

772
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:51,900
Yep. There we go. Having a little communication issue here with this guy.

773
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,320
Anyway, it'll it'll correct. Yeah, you're.

774
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:03,180
You're not you're not being heard so well. So just hang on a sec.

775
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:10,340
Maybe even hit mute for a second if you want to settle down, because here's the thing I want to provide a warning for for anybody listening.

776
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:16,920
Anyway, there is a ton of stuff out there that sort of says what the Greek is saying now.

777
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:22,080
But you cannot follow along what he's saying with what they're putting out.

778
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:27,500
There's a bunch of books. This is Dr. Sears. There's a whole bunch of people talking about these things to eat.

779
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:34,660
Do not get confused with that, with what the Greek is talking about right now, because it'll contradict it.

780
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:39,640
OK, this twenty nine point five cycle and circadian rhythm.

781
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:44,380
Well, there is no twenty nine. OK, if you OK, these idiots that talk about.

782
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,480
That's what I'm saying. There's a lot of crap out there.

783
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:53,860
You think the moon is twenty nine by five days or twenty because you're using midnight as the start of day.

784
00:48:53,860 --> 00:49:02,500
Right. Right. If you use noontime, which is scientific, astronomical, biblical, classical, traditional.

785
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:07,220
If you start, can you imagine how they wiped it out from society now?

786
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:11,080
Anyway, the moon is 30 days. Right. OK.

787
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:17,420
Or 31 in the summer as the in the summer months, you can have a slightly longer day a month.

788
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:23,200
OK, so, yeah, but I don't know. I've never heard of these guys or whatever.

789
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:30,180
But what I'm getting into, I started off with the cabbage and then you have to understand when to apply these things.

790
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:34,420
Now, here's someone who might have three pencils, sharpened pencils in their pocket.

791
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:48,340
If you want to do skin therapy, I would eat cabbage at least every other day or every day for the time period from the dark moon waxing to the full moon.

792
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:53,580
And then keep eating it, but start then eating less of it.

793
00:49:54,260 --> 00:50:03,580
To the dark moon. And then I would eat a quality salted food that is that resembles cabbage in its own whatever.

794
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:12,100
I mean, you can go what goes well with cabbage that resembles cabbage, but goes well with just keep eating the cabbage for a month.

795
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:17,240
Just to check that I understand what you're saying. It's around that time when the moon starts to get dark.

796
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:21,160
This is when you can begin to add in a little bit of like, say, animal products.

797
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,140
Is that right?

798
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:31,740
Right. Right before like three. Yes. So when you go from full moon to dark moon, you've already built up to your salads and all that.

799
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:36,000
Now you start tapering off on the salads and going towards the salty and the animal.

800
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,260
And your most animal would be eaten on the dark moon.

801
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:45,260
And then as the dark moon passes two or three days later, you start working up to the salads and the sweeter foods again.

802
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:50,300
Now, once you start getting into the swing of things, it's called a swing.

803
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:57,280
There's a lot of swings in history. I mean, in health where they call it the acid alkaline swing was one that I learned in the 80s.

804
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:05,740
If you can't beat something, eat acid food for three days and eat alkaline food for three days and acid food for three back and forth to knock it out of your body.

805
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:11,780
That's fine, I guess. You know, it's very simple, but it's not it's not holistic and a holistic means the whole thing.

806
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:16,280
So the reason I want bring up the timing is because the timing is important.

807
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:26,440
Like, for example, one early episode we did, if something you have a pain in the daytime and it only hurts when the sun is up.

808
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:31,320
Right. Other times you might have a pain only at nighttime and when the sun is down.

809
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:35,960
So that right away is a big clue. Right. Because when the sun is up, it's expensive.

810
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:42,440
You have too much. If it hurts when when the sun is down, it's a young base thing.

811
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:50,260
Right. That's why people who have a young surplus will have a hard time sleeping.

812
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:53,740
Someone's a hard time sleeping. I told this to many people through the years.

813
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:59,280
You're eating too much salt and too much meat. Cut back on the salted and the meat and you'll be able to sleep.

814
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:04,200
And like I've always gotten back with him. Yeah, it worked. Right.

815
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:11,680
And if someone has like pains and headaches during the day, but not at night, you're eating too many sweets, too many sugars, chemicals.

816
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:16,780
Are you taking pharmaceutical drugs? The answer is yes. Right.

817
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:20,800
So that's a very simple there's the day thing. There's the month thing.

818
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:25,500
And then there's the seasonal thing, which is you have to combine the day and the month.

819
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:29,020
I'm not going to get into the seasonal thing now because I'm still working it out.

820
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:36,200
But what I have worked on, I know works is the day thing, the day swing, you know, where the when the sun is up, it's expensive.

821
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:40,520
And when the sun is down, it's contractive. And I have worked out the moon thing.

822
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,780
In other words, when the moon is full, it's the most expensive time.

823
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:51,540
You know, sweet, soft lettuce. And when the moon is dark, it's the most contractive time, more salty, possibly animal.

824
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:56,540
Now, if you're not doing animal, that would be the time during the dark moon to do your buckwheat.

825
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:01,840
Right. Your and your brown rice. You just do your whole buckwheat. Right.

826
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:06,540
And things are more contractive. You would do like a fermented soy if you do tempeh.

827
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:13,520
Right. Or fish. Right. Salted fish. Things like that.

828
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:19,640
You'd have to figure out what I mean by, you know, yin and yang, you know, or yin and yang foods is plenty of charts.

829
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:26,320
But this aspect now, you know, OK, we thought we started speaking about skin and the remedy.

830
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,920
Cabbage is a very good remedy. There are other things you can do.

831
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:35,120
And I'm going to mention one other thing that's being I might develop it in the near future if I see time.

832
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:40,160
But let's say let's forget about all this and say, let's say you have a remedy or something.

833
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:44,060
You go to buy a remedy in a store. Right. Doesn't it have directions when to use, how to use?

834
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:46,780
Doesn't it doesn't actually say that on the bottle or the packaging?

835
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:51,920
Usually take take one day, take one every three hours. This many hours to put on.

836
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:59,080
Yeah. So what I'm getting into now, just eating cabbage, but when and how and why it's as directed.

837
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,700
This is where I take as directed. Right. That's what I'm talking about.

838
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:08,260
The direction during the day and during and during the moon cycle is the direction of how you should eat.

839
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:14,920
This is for a healing diet. If you want to fix something now other than the cabbage.

840
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:21,120
I don't know what else to recommend at this point for skin ailments, but eating clean. Right.

841
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:29,280
Now, the other thing about repairing the skin and having the skin come back together, avoid any oil, any oil at all fat.

842
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:34,920
It doesn't matter. Animal or olive oil. You know, they say olive oil is really good or macadamia oil or whatever.

843
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:41,420
No, no, no. All that. Why? Because when you eat those oils, oils are essential for skin development.

844
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:47,820
Your body will induce that oil into its organism and try to modify it to repair the skin.

845
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:53,360
And it's already having a hard time with the skin. If you have no oils at all.

846
00:54:54,040 --> 00:55:00,740
The only signal for oil is the only signal your your your DNA knows to produce for the skin.

847
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,020
It's very clean. It's going to produce what's encoded.

848
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:08,360
It's what's encoded in you to repair the skin, because that's what it's constantly doing anyway.

849
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:15,980
And it won't be as confused or as challenged by external oils, because it sounds like, for example, when people have dry skins, they eat more oil.

850
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:24,820
Right. But more some olive oil in your diet. That's why. No, it's actually because you're having too much oil and your oil production is screwed up because it's being influenced by external influence.

851
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:28,620
Right. That's another Greek saying external influence, all external.

852
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:36,680
So when you avoid oil completely, your body will produce it and in the right amounts and in the right type that it needs to recover.

853
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:48,140
Right. So when I mean no oil, here's an example. If you have a severe skin condition and you can put one drop of oil in your food a month and that's you just screwed it up.

854
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:52,200
That's how critical it gets when you start dealing with induction.

855
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:56,040
OK, now what can be done with the skin?

856
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:02,880
Now, don't hold me on this. What I mean by this is like I was on a conference call about 10 years ago.

857
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:08,300
I said, you know, I'm going to make a pipe that you put dirty water on one side, clean water comes out in the other or hard water comes up.

858
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:17,360
Right. OK. Comes out soft. Ten years ago. And it didn't come around to where I could produce it and consistently and talk like the scale of it or only the past year.

859
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:22,900
Right. So this would be the next project. The skin is a surface reaction.

860
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:27,860
When you notice something on the skin, it's a it's a surface covering the skin. Right. Right.

861
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:44,540
OK, so there's several phenomenon in nature and in the construction industry known as efflorescence, where you have a particular salt or white powder that forms on a brick wall and it's a salt and it's like and it eats away the brick wall and they try to put waterproofing, but it doesn't bond to it.

862
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:56,320
Right. By the way, that's where saltpeter comes from. Years ago, if you go to France, some of the old in Europe, some of the old buildings, you'll notice that near the ground level, a lot of the brick and mortar is scraped away.

863
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:03,800
Because if the military would come by and scrape this white powder off the building because it was an ingredient for gunpowder, it's called saltpeter.

864
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:09,220
Right. And if you didn't allow them to scrape the building, it was a substitute for paying tax.

865
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:13,380
Right. So if you didn't have money, you let them scrape. Anyway, that's just a little trivia.

866
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:21,160
But one thing that can be done and I was the first person to do this about 23 years ago with Eric Means at Eric Means Design.

867
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:28,700
That's some Adobe buildings that have an efflorescence. By the way, this is about skin assault building up on the outside.

868
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:39,520
They had a poly salicylate waterproof and they you can't you can't put any kind of coating or waterproofing material on a building if it has salt on it, right on the on the structure.

869
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:45,700
But the salt is always a surface reaction. So what I said, why don't we fool.

870
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:50,740
So what in other words, what they did was they try to scrub the salt with water and pressure wash it.

871
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:54,460
But the moisture just made more of it come out. So this is what we need to do.

872
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:59,080
We need to fool this salt. So what we do is we pressure wash the building.

873
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:05,240
At the same time, we put up some furring strips with some three inch cotton batting on the wall while the wall is still wet.

874
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:12,600
And when the salt is going to want to come to the surface, is it going to deposit itself on the Adobe brick or is it going to go all the way through the cotton bat?

875
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:17,840
Deposit itself on the cotton batting. Then we remove the cotton batting and all the salt is gone.

876
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:23,900
Guess what happened? That's exactly what happened is the first time they ever seen anything like that.

877
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:28,780
And it worked. And as a matter of fact, I used to go every five or 10 years and check on it.

878
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:34,500
There's still no no efflorescence buildup. So the idea is the same for the human body.

879
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:41,240
When you have a skin ailment, it is happening on the surface covering of the body on the surface layer.

880
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:46,480
All right. Why isn't it happening on the muscle right under the skin?

881
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:53,080
It's because it needs to get to the surface. A type of gauze can be developed and most likely be linen.

882
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:58,380
And it will most likely be treated linen, meaning soaked in a solution of some kind.

883
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:02,180
And that is wrapped on the body and it's undisturbed.

884
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:09,420
In other words, you don't take it off and you can't subject it. If you're going to bathe or shower, it has to be hermetically covered with plastic.

885
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:13,960
Remember the people years ago is very common. Got into a fight. Someone broke their arm.

886
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:17,160
And when you take a shower, you put a plastic bag over the cast. Right.

887
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:23,480
Kind of thing like that. So you'd have to yeah, you'd have to completely cover it.

888
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:28,620
And this would be left on for a period of anywhere a minimum of seven days to two weeks.

889
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:33,220
And then you would remove it and you'd have brand new skin no matter what the condition was.

890
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:35,140
Right.

891
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:36,060
Okay.
