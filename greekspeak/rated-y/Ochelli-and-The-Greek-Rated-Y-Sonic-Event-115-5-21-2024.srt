1
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:12,220
The sonic event 115 rated Y, here we are, how are you, Greek?

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,500
Yeah, 115, interesting, that's a Freemason number, whenever you see stuff in the news,

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:29,800
15 million is owed to hear, 5.1 million, 51 people, it's either 5-1 in any order or 1-5,

4
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:31,460
5.1.

5
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:36,060
Well, a lot of lawsuits, a lot of lawsuits right now, right? There's a whole bunch of

6
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,700
51 million dollars.

7
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,680
Yeah, it's a signal, it's a signal, very much like if you remember Men in Black, the hot

8
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,640
sheet, they were running to the star, what are they called, tabloid papers, and they

9
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,440
said, why are we getting the tabloid, that's the hot sheet.

10
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:55,740
Well, hot sheets in general are supposed to be the things that come off, the reason why

11
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:00,260
they say that is because it actually comes off of the heat-sensitive paper, and it

12
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,180
comes off a printer like that, so they used to call them the hot sheets because they were

13
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,120
literally hot, right?

14
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,400
Yeah, because, well, the fast mechanical, anytime you do a fast mechanical movement,

15
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,800
it's going to warm up the object.

16
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,700
Exactly, so that's what used to happen, and in the days of fax machines with the rolls

17
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,180
of paper, you remember those, right?

18
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:23,080
Well, I was around, we had a Telex machine, back in the 70s, you know, for doing stuff

19
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:28,480
like that, you know, the family did, but yeah, Telex was, I think, Telex was kind of

20
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:33,460
more interesting than the fax, it was more, fax looked like junk, but yeah.

21
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:38,400
Telex was like a full-on typewriter connected to your phone that literally banged up at

22
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:38,740
things, right?

23
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,200
That's right, it was very, yeah, it would be 20 grand in today's money to get one, it

24
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,520
was probably around 1,500, 2,000 bucks in the 70s.

25
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:49,140
By the way, just a quick reiteration on money, you know gasoline is cheaper now than it was

26
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,160
in the 70s, a lot of things still are cheaper because it's a 10 to 1 factor, what that means

27
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:00,580
like if you watch the price is right for 1974, and a Wishbone salad dressing bottle, you

28
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:06,700
know, not the large bottle, but the small bottle, is 79 cents, that means in today's

29
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:13,200
money, it's $7.90, so if you go even to whatever and get a salad Wishbone, I don't think it'll

30
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,540
be more than five bucks tops, four bucks, right?

31
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:21,140
Right, now the thing that warps that reality is that, you know, the pay scale, so to speak,

32
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,060
right, the minimum wage rule, that never went according to that.

33
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,560
If it went according to the scale, yeah.

34
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,960
Minimum wage should be $25 per hour.

35
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:29,740
Right.

36
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,840
Now, and the way you figure that out is you figure out what minimum wage was when they

37
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,720
first started it, it was around just under $2, right?

38
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,820
$1.80 an hour, something like that.

39
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,240
Well, at a bare minimum, I mean, I remember figuring this out.

40
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,220
You multiply that times 10.

41
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,440
Yeah, to go from, and I always like to use the year I was born, you know, 72 is a good

42
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:53,060
year to work with, because that was, you know, one of those transitional years, and if you

43
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:57,960
go and compare it, yeah, $25, $26 is what you would need to have the same purchasing

44
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,440
power.

45
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,020
Now, again, like you said, it doesn't mean that the thing isn't cheaper.

46
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:05,240
Well, a little bit more, but you would need to announce this, another way to look at what

47
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,080
a dollar should be is what the silver index is.

48
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,940
It's below 30 right now.

49
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,840
It's between 23 and 30, bounces around 25, 23, let's say.

50
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,800
I don't know what it is right now.

51
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:17,900
So, it's around that.

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,500
So, gasoline, when silver was $1 an ounce, and gasoline was $0.75 a gallon, which was

53
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:31,640
still considered expensive back then, that means it would be 75% of $25, so it would

54
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,460
be roughly $18, $19 a gallon to be in parity with 1970s prices, and it's not.

55
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,920
Even in California, it's $7 or $8 a gallon.

56
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:45,060
Here in Tucson, it's just under $4, $3.50, something like that, if you get a gas buddy.

57
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,480
So, yeah, so it's still, things are, yeah, but what they call the earnings, never call

58
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:52,820
it income.

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,500
By the way, words to watch out for.

60
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,200
Eliminate these from your vocabulary if you know what good advice is.

61
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,560
These are legal terms, which are not good.

62
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,300
Anything legal just means that it's either licensed or no license, right?

63
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,000
Everything has to do, anything legal, illegal legal, means you have license or no license

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,900
from the authorities.

65
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,880
Okay, so that's an easy definition.

66
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,440
It has to do with contracts and licensing.

67
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,920
It has nothing to do with law.

68
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:20,240
Right.

69
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,360
Never did and never will.

70
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,240
Like we talked about drug dealing, the real problem is that you don't have a license to

71
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,040
deal with the drugs.

72
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:26,280
Exactly.

73
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,140
That's what the problem is.

74
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,220
It's not the substance.

75
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:32,620
Yes, the substance is part of the definition of blah, blah, blah, but truth is, you don't

76
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,320
have the license to sell the drug.

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,560
Yeah, they rate substances, any substance, the commodity, they're rated and controlled.

78
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,440
It's called rating and controls.

79
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,320
By the way, strange.

80
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,100
Controlled substance is what they call drugs.

81
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:45,840
Strange thing.

82
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,580
I don't know if this means anything, but I just decided to look up the silver spot price

83
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,800
while you were talking and it's actually a little high today.

84
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,040
Like?

85
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,620
Today's price is at 32.35.

86
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,360
It's even worse for everyone if you're not making 32 bucks an hour.

87
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,780
By the way, if you want to hire the Greek, it's 150 an hour.

88
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,920
That's my going rate.

89
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:11,780
I do discount it a little bit for sometimes and sometimes I just do a flat rate for 1,000

90
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,680
a day, which is a discount.

91
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,320
Yeah, so anyway.

92
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,340
How many hours do they get out of that grand in a day though?

93
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,900
They get at least 10 hours out of you?

94
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:22,960
It depends.

95
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,460
I'd lump it up and it wouldn't just be one day.

96
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,500
No, no, no.

97
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,180
It's sometimes more, sometimes less.

98
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:32,600
I don't get too many calls like that to do that, fortunately, because I don't like to

99
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,860
work that way.

100
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,100
Here's the thing.

101
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,700
These are legal things if you know how to take legal advice and all that.

102
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:46,460
Eliminate from your vocabulary, if you could, if you would, words like income.

103
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:47,800
Income.

104
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:55,400
Income is technically derived from people that do, or merchants that sell stuff in commodity

105
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,020
markets.

106
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:56,680
Okay.

107
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:56,880
Right?

108
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,520
It's like money you make from percentages, like interest.

109
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,640
What is a more proper word than income?

110
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,140
Earnings.

111
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,080
Earnings.

112
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:07,400
Okay.

113
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,640
Income is legal.

114
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,840
Earning is law.

115
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,880
Another thing is, what's another?

116
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,820
I had a whole list of them before we got a little diverted on that.

117
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,400
But income is a big one.

118
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,660
Employee.

119
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:21,720
Employee.

120
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,200
Bad, bad term.

121
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,640
Bad, bad term.

122
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,760
Now, you could replace that with several other terms.

123
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:28,460
Associate.

124
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,840
Associate would be a better one, or the title of whatever you do.

125
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,480
But no, no, no.

126
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:35,980
Employee.

127
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:36,960
Employee is a bad term.

128
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:37,940
It's a legal term.

129
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,160
Some job titles have you as a sales associate in places.

130
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:42,900
Well, yeah.

131
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:48,960
Anything other than employee that you find in the commercial or whatever industrial parlance,

132
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,720
use that.

133
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,840
But don't go to work tomorrow.

134
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,320
I've had people that are so naive.

135
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:59,020
They'll go to work tomorrow, and they'll say, people go, you said don't use the word employee.

136
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,000
I went to my boss the next day.

137
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,180
I'm no longer an employee.

138
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,320
He says, good, now you're fired.

139
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,660
Greek, you got to be fired.

140
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:05,940
Right?

141
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,780
I mean, if you're that dumb, you should just not even be listening to what I'm saying.

142
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,700
What I do, basically, is handing out double-edged razor blades and loaded guns.

143
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,480
You know what I mean?

144
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,980
So be careful, right?

145
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,140
It's up to you how you use them, too.

146
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,180
Yeah, yeah.

147
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,380
So double-edged swords.

148
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,080
Employee income.

149
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,520
There's a whole bunch of others.

150
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,440
Oh, home.

151
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,340
Home, home, home.

152
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,620
That is another legal term, right?

153
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,240
Home, don't use that.

154
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:40,920
You use dwelling, inhabitants, house, building, artifice, anything other than home.

155
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,120
Don't use the word home.

156
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,260
No, that's a legal term.

157
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,520
These are all enforceable legally, by the way.

158
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,680
Yeah, not as a destination?

159
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,300
Okay, so residence is better than home.

160
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,460
No, resident is another word.

161
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,820
Oh, resident is a bad word.

162
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,060
Yeah, resident, okay.

163
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,180
Residence puts you in a vagabond category, because if you ask someone where they live,

164
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,080
and then you ask them, are you a resident there?

165
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,040
They'll say yes, which is a contradiction in terms.

166
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:12,220
By the way, what they've done to the idiots, meaning the common human, is they have them

167
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:16,340
entertain two conflicting ideas at the same time in harmony.

168
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:23,600
You cannot entertain or hold two conflicting ideas at the same time.

169
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,220
That's what most people do, by the way, and that's the definition.

170
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:31,140
One of the ways you define someone who, quote, unquote, mental health issues, right, which

171
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,179
is the majority of the people.

172
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,480
Look, if everybody's insane, where are the insane people?

173
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,799
You can't point to, because everyone's insane.

174
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,159
If you point to everyone, then, right?

175
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,500
Okay, so all of these terms that you see, insurance company.

176
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,320
By the way, why do you, insurance companies have no money.

177
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,820
They don't insure anything, right?

178
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,780
You understand how the Fed window works?

179
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,740
When you have a claim, so you don't have license to go to the Federal Reserve with a piece

180
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,560
of paper and your signature and get whatever number is on the paper.

181
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:06,240
So you have to subscribe to an insurance policy.

182
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:06,900
They do it.

183
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:11,780
When you pay an insurance premium, that has nothing to do with, you know what the right

184
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,160
term is?

185
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,180
Indemnification.

186
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:14,880
Indemnification.

187
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,040
Yeah, you don't want insurance.

188
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:23,360
First of all, it's a religious term also.

189
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,560
Insurance policies include acts of God, and they can't define that, but they're telling

190
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:28,880
you, right?

191
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:36,900
Okay, yeah, almost every type of insurance policy at some point, it has a section on

192
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,580
acts of God.

193
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,700
That's like a guarantee in the writing.

194
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,300
Well, insurance policies, insurance companies, are like the Federal.

195
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,920
It's a religious thing.

196
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:50,260
In other words, you're snubbing your nose at the will of what they call the heavens,

197
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,940
the will of God, to you're covered no matter what, right?

198
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,900
That's what they say.

199
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,700
Indemnification changes.

200
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,700
Indemnification means you basically, it came out early in the ship days.

201
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,440
Merchants, when a merchant's family invested in a ship and it sank and they were a wealthy

202
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,100
family, well, now they're not wealthy anymore.

203
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,740
So what they did was they grouped up into corporations and they said, instead of each

204
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:17,540
family has its own merchant ship, why don't we get five families to have five ships together

205
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,800
and we share everything?

206
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,900
So if one of the ships sinks, you don't have total catastrophic disaster in your family,

207
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,420
but you still get a one-fifth share of what's left, right?

208
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,120
That's how the insurance companies started.

209
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,640
By the way, the insurance companies are the ones that sent the pirates out.

210
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,520
That's where the term watermark comes from.

211
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,960
Pirates would board you and they went to the captain's chambers and they would ask for

212
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:46,560
your indemnification, your papers, and if you had one and they put a watermark on it,

213
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,920
meaning that it was authentic, they would leave you alone.

214
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,820
The pirates were sent by the same, just like the terrorists, right?

215
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,780
Terrorists these days are sent by the, right?

216
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,680
Everyone knows, right?

217
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,580
Remember the shoe bomber was let in on the airplane, no security, right?

218
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:01,280
Yeah, the supposedly non-government entities are always backed by a government entity.

219
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,340
And that's the other thing.

220
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:07,420
It almost reminds me of the weird linguistic game that Jordan Maxwell used to play, which

221
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:13,600
I think is valid, where he explains that, look, what actually guides the currency, the current,

222
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,940
like water, the banks, they actually guide the currency, right?

223
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:19,840
And all that.

224
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,480
I mean, you know that.

225
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,120
Well, the water.

226
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,340
Yeah, they use the law of the sea and land.

227
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,720
And also a captain on a ship, when he lands, he's no longer the captain.

228
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,400
When he's on land, he's now the governor.

229
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:31,820
So they're still right.

230
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,720
It's called maritime admiralty.

231
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,580
Admiralty is the ground, right?

232
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,920
It's interesting, maritime, because admiral is in the Navy, right?

233
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:41,300
Right.

234
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,920
So, but he's not on a ship.

235
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,900
So, but yeah, admiralty has to do with land.

236
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,240
Okay.

237
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,740
They don't like this kind of stuff.

238
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,560
They, meaning attorneys.

239
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,320
Attorneys are dumbasses, by the way.

240
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:56,580
They all are, because just like the medical students, and this is not a rant or event,

241
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,260
you know that.

242
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,440
You could look up a small community college like Harvard.

243
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,300
Look at law school.

244
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:08,880
They put their curriculum online and go through all four years what they teach each semester,

245
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:09,980
what they offer.

246
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,140
Is there any law being taught?

247
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:11,540
Nope.

248
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,300
No, there's what?

249
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,200
Ethics.

250
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,020
Yeah.

251
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,420
Now with medical school, you take the MCATs and all that other stuff, by the way.

252
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:18,900
Yeah.

253
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,380
They have you entertain two ideas.

254
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,120
You do biology, and you'll have a chance where you go into a lab and look at anatomy and

255
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,840
things like that.

256
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,240
Yeah.

257
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,200
And they will actually tell you what you're physically looking at is not what it is.

258
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,440
It's something else, and you have to agree to that, right?

259
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,260
That's why we had the medical person recently email me.

260
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,280
He gives one out of a hundred over the years.

261
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:45,080
Yeah, I've examined the gastrointestinal tract, small intestine, large intestine, stomach,

262
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,780
and they're hydrophobic, just like you say.

263
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,200
There's nothing.

264
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,020
There's no way anything will absorb it, of course, right?

265
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:57,860
So medical school, you have to entertain the laboratory aspect, what you see physically

266
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,240
with the bullshit they tell you that that is, right?

267
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:06,500
Now, some people that are sensible, you hear the dropout rate in the legal schools or law

268
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:11,240
schools and medical schools is high, not because it's difficult.

269
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,200
It's because they're asking you to entertain two contradicting things.

270
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:20,500
The dummies that stay through the courses and all that are able to...

271
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,860
That's why if you run into people, especially doctors or lawyers, they're a little nutty,

272
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,160
right?

273
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,900
And I've told this to people, and they're like, yeah, my sister, she was not the smartest

274
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,420
in the bunch, and she became a lawyer.

275
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,180
She's successful.

276
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,500
So yeah, it has nothing to do...

277
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,320
You're filling a position.

278
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,200
It's a machine.

279
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,900
It's a machine.

280
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,900
It's very much like when you open up a car engine.

281
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,480
Years ago, each part had the manufacturer's hallmark on it, and they don't anymore because

282
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,680
this gear might be made in China.

283
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,940
The other one might be made here.

284
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,640
The other one is sourced from there, right?

285
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,700
So that's what they're doing.

286
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,420
We need a certain amount of attorneys.

287
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,480
We need a certain amount of...

288
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,320
And here's the crime.

289
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,720
This is a real crime because it does harm to humanity.

290
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,380
There are victims.

291
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,380
Parents, a popular thing, especially when I was growing up, inspired their children to

292
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,560
be a doctor or a lawyer.

293
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,200
Have you ever heard of that?

294
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,660
Yeah, we should be a doctor or a lawyer.

295
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,160
That's criminal to say that.

296
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,240
The two highest callings, supposedly, right?

297
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:19,060
In some houses, it was doctor, lawyer, priest, which makes it even worse.

298
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,520
Especially the more Catholic.

299
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,800
Yeah, it was venerated.

300
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,800
So that is criminal.

301
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:29,100
By the way, in a real society, if you want to change society, any parent that tells

302
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:35,280
that to their children, the children should be taken away from them and put into a proper

303
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,860
institution and raised properly.

304
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,980
Yes, there is a way to do it.

305
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:38,880
It's funny.

306
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:43,840
When I used to do sonics in the past, talked about laws and that, and people would say,

307
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,260
well, yeah, who's going to tell us the law?

308
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:45,900
Who's going to make the law?

309
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,580
I said, you are.

310
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:47,560
You are.

311
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,720
It's always by consent.

312
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:52,540
Even if you read the scriptures, it's about consent.

313
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,200
It says the people with one voice all agreed, right?

314
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:55,900
Or they didn't.

315
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:56,600
Or they murmured.

316
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,520
Okay, it's all by consent.

317
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:03,740
But if you're a band of morons, you've been bred and groomed into this moronic state,

318
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,180
right?

319
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,080
Now, here's the thing.

320
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,440
I'm offering shortcuts.

321
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,120
You have to do the long work yourself.

322
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,880
I recently got off a call with someone that I've been speaking to for a long time.

323
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,200
And I basically – the crux of Greek speak, let me just reiterate.

324
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,720
It's for people that have skills.

325
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,560
Cover your ears.

326
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,680
But personally, if you just have like keyboard skills, you don't have skills.

327
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:33,600
What I mean by skills is you could cook a meal, a delicious meal or a good meal.

328
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,000
You're thrifty.

329
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,780
You're a savvy shopper.

330
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,380
You could fix a flat.

331
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,700
You could dress a wound properly.

332
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,640
You could make health recommendations to people, right?

333
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,080
You get it?

334
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,240
You could – when a door falls off, you can hang it, right?

335
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,500
When there's a leak in the – you don't call a plumber.

336
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,420
You could fix it yourself.

337
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:56,820
Now I'm getting a little more elaborate because most people – now I'm starting to – a DIY.

338
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,080
Someone who has skills.

339
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:03,720
I'm talking about physical skills, the stuff that you're going to need when this – everything is reset and redone.

340
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,040
You might be a little too old for that.

341
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,160
You may not survive it.

342
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,560
But when you get thrown back into a stone-age type society – by the way, there's no age.

343
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,680
It's a stone society where there's no – when there's no electricity – OK.

344
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,520
No electricity, no utilities, right?

345
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:23,220
That means like your gas, the car – there's still gasoline in the tanks underground at the gas station.

346
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,760
But you can't get it into your car because you need an electric pump, right?

347
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,100
To get it out, right?

348
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,320
So when there's a blackout, nobody is tanking up, right?

349
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,260
I hope people know that.

350
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:34,200
Well, you'll need to know how to create energy for your own use.

351
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,660
You'll need to know how to gather water for your own consumption.

352
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,000
You'll need to know how to make food for – yeah, OK.

353
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,060
Yeah, you don't have to be like – I remember – I don't know how many people remember Gilligan's Island.

354
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,700
Gilligan's Island had a professor and he made everything out of bamboo.

355
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,640
You don't have to be like that.

356
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,580
But yes, that's what I'm talking about.

357
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:53,840
If you fix stuff, you know how to do stuff and you can produce stuff.

358
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,340
Someone comes over to where you live and you can make lunch.

359
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,780
Yeah, you should listen to Greek-speak.

360
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:05,579
If you can't do that, you're just not wasting your time because you're going to get more out of this than anything else you listen to obviously.

361
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:11,040
Well, I'll give you an example of something that's great that nobody ever thinks of is that you might actually need a shoemaker.

362
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,900
Somebody who can create shoes that will be useful for –

363
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,400
Improvising.

364
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,260
If you can – all right.

365
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:21,839
But you're in a society now – by the way, with Gilligan's Island, TV was so –

366
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,640
there were just a lot of old-timers watching it in the 60s and 70s I guess when it came out.

367
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,520
One of the biggest requests at the TV station was, why don't you go save those people off the island?

368
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,600
These people are serious.

369
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,400
It's a naivete.

370
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:39,440
Let's not use the word stupid anymore even though they are.

371
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:49,620
But they can't figure – look, I remember I was about five or six years old and an older relative from Greece was sitting on the couch watching Cowboys and Indians

372
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:54,880
and then the Cowboys are shooting the Indians and the woman from – she was my great-grandmother.

373
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:59,760
She was crying because people were dying on TV in front of her.

374
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,000
So is she stupid?

375
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:02,940
Naive.

376
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,360
I would ask, is this real?

377
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,440
I wouldn't just be dragged into it presuming that it's real crying.

378
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,220
You see the difference?

379
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,800
You just have to add a few more words and when you're thinking, vocalize.

380
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,300
Learn how to vocalize and communicate.

381
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,940
But the Greek-speak is for people who want to do stuff.

382
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,740
I'm talking about physical stuff in the world.

383
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,180
Now let's go back to the keyboard.

384
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,480
Are you worthless in a fully functional society?

385
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,180
Absolutely.

386
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:32,580
Right?

387
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,820
But is it still necessary to do that kind of work?

388
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,820
Yeah, of course it is.

389
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,960
Are you a fully formed human in my view if all you do is keyboard stuff?

390
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,160
The answer is absolutely not at all.

391
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,940
Now I've never really vocalized this specifically but it's important that I do.

392
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:58,500
I'm like the – what I like is the junior college shop class teacher.

393
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:05,860
When you go to woodwork in class, they offer classes on home economics where you cook and sew or woodworking class.

394
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:11,680
You build a little jewelry box or something or machine class or whatever, welding class.

395
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,920
I'm the guy who teaches that.

396
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:22,820
What I'm doing is trying to – I'm just wondering how – when I give out these little unique recipes like the cabbage and all the way to rice.

397
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:30,080
For a while, I was known – I used to get sarcastic messages about, yeah, it's more than just cooking perfect rice, stuff like that.

398
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:39,440
So I'm presuming that if – you're not into cooking at all because I'm not into just cooking.

399
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,980
I can talk about cooking for 10 sonics, eight hours long each and not repeat myself.

400
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,860
The thing is am I just about cooking?

401
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,140
No.

402
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:59,920
But if someone is listening to this and they absolutely do not cook at all and have no desire to, if they're really listening, they could still get something out of it because it's not just about –

403
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:07,640
when I give the order or the recipe or the framework on how to prepare something, it's more than just about food, right?

404
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,160
You see?

405
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:19,600
So if you can take that – like if you're locked up in a room for a year and you have just books of things you're not interested in, would you still try to read them?

406
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,020
Of course.

407
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:21,920
Probably, yeah.

408
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:29,920
Because if you'd read enough variety of subjects, you'll notice that even though the subjects are very diverse, there's something in common there, right?

409
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,600
There's something in common.

410
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:37,120
But those that are doing stuff, by the way – and here's the thing.

411
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:41,520
There's people that do stuff and stop and get lazy, right?

412
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:41,920
Right.

413
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:48,300
Like for example I'm having a conversation with someone and I'll have a ranking system.

414
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,900
The guy says I've been doing carpentry for 35 years.

415
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,520
OK.

416
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:57,200
And if I'm having more than a minute and a half conversation, like have you invented anything, an improvement?

417
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,040
They say no.

418
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,360
Right away, I know where they're at.

419
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,500
They need a manager.

420
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,580
They need to have a limited scope.

421
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:11,480
So what I mean by that is people that work in any field for more than a certain amount of time should start inventing stuff.

422
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,920
You know how I've said before every field is wide open?

423
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:14,640
Yeah.

424
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,520
Every field.

425
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:21,620
Every field, especially all the stuff they're talking about, the high sciences, especially those because that's all bullshit.

426
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:26,100
I'm talking like medicine, astrophysics, nuclear physics.

427
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,160
All that stuff is bullshit.

428
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:33,420
By the way, Jonathan Butts, who passed away in February, he was a nuclear engineer on a Navy submarine, right?

429
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:37,720
All the top secret stuff we discussed, which wasn't very – I said that's really dumb.

430
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,300
Yeah, they're really dumb there.

431
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,740
They're running nuclear submarines with nuclear arsenals, right?

432
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:46,680
They don't know what they're doing and the stuff is not very advanced, right?

433
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,460
Well, it is to the common whatever.

434
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,660
So even that field is open for improvement in a major way.

435
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,880
First of all, the nuclear stuff is not what we're told.

436
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,900
It's the bankers.

437
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:01,900
They tell you it's dangerous to protect it.

438
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:09,680
If they told you it wasn't dangerous and the stuff is a million dollars a gram, now you need an incredible security apparatus.

439
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:15,060
People will be driving concrete-reinforced pickup trucks into nuclear reactors to steal the rods, right?

440
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,360
If it wasn't dangerous and it was that expensive, yeah, that's exactly right.

441
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,500
Well, they tell you it's dangerous, right?

442
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:26,160
If you look at old nuclear power plant videos and they're saying here's the heart of the nuclear –

443
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,420
you hear the old-fashioned voice in black and white.

444
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:35,000
Now we built a nuclear and this is the new nuclear age and here's the heart of the nuclear power plant coming right now.

445
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:42,300
You see a truck and they're unloading the uranium rods, look like two-inch or one-inch rods, eight feet long,

446
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,860
and two guys are holding it with just cotton gloves and a white coverall suit.

447
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,800
That's it, right?

448
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,820
But they said, oh, uranium is going to kill you.

449
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,480
It's to keep people away and it works, right?

450
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:59,720
Like imagine suddenly you go to a planet and there's no diamonds or precious stones

451
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,600
because the people are told that it's radioactive, right?

452
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,680
It could hurt them, right?

453
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:09,740
By the way, speaking of radioactivity, those really fancy granite countertops –

454
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:15,480
by the way, if you're – anyone who has a lot of cooking skill does not want granite countertops in their kitchen.

455
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:20,440
When you go to a house and you see granite countertops, those people don't cook.

456
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,360
They do more takeout.

457
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,280
They think they can cook.

458
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,580
They're really warming up food.

459
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,360
They might – if you ask them what the best thing they can do is, the grill a steak.

460
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,460
That's all they can do, right?

461
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,280
So granite countertops, by the way, is vanity.

462
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,120
A real cook has stainless steel tops or butcher block tops, not granite.

463
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:40,000
If I had granite countertops in the house that I was given, I would remove them right away

464
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,680
and put in stainless steel and wood, right?

465
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,440
Because it's workable surfaces.

466
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,080
It's all vanity.

467
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,620
But anyway, back to the granite countertops.

468
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,460
The real thick ones, the big slabs, the Brazilian granite that have the most interesting colors of deep reds

469
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:57,580
and burgundies and metallic stripes, do me a favor.

470
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:01,220
Go get a Geiger counter in your kitchen and see what happens.

471
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,620
I'm not going to say anything else.

472
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,060
You'll be surprised.

473
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:08,500
That's why a lot of people that spend time in the kitchen with these super fancy –

474
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,280
they like to spend time in the kitchen.

475
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:15,960
I've been to see these McMansions, these two $3 million houses with the $50,000 granite countertops.

476
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,980
Everybody, instead of gathering in the living room or the dining room,

477
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,780
they like to gather at the kitchen counter and have the meeting there, right?

478
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:28,320
Yeah, they put like a bar in with stools so you can like sit right at the kitchen.

479
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:28,800
Yeah, that's right.

480
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,320
Yeah, and they like to – why?

481
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,560
Because it's invigorating.

482
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,220
Okay, I'll say it.

483
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,500
The amount of radiation that these – so not all of them.

484
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:39,180
Depending on where it's sliced from, which mine, they're very radioactive.

485
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:43,840
Far more than – imagine having five or six cell phones strapped to each side of your head.

486
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,040
More than that, but a different kind of radiation, right?

487
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:47,420
Okay.

488
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,900
And it's invigorating.

489
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:53,480
If you want to take it to another level, they kind of told you in the Marvel – the Hulk,

490
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,220
you got a big dose of radiation, right?

491
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:55,600
Right.

492
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,680
It was very invigorating.

493
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:01,360
So in the right dose – by the way, in the mitochondria and all of the cells in your body,

494
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,560
there's a little bit of uranium.

495
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,500
You can look this up.

496
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,700
Yeah, it flips back and forth.

497
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,420
It's not static.

498
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:07,580
It's not static.

499
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,560
That's another conversation.

500
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:14,700
So just to bring these things up, to go back to the Greek speak, it's for people that

501
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,420
do stuff.

502
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,640
Like for example, there's someone that repairs pianos, high-end pianos.

503
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,300
When he got in touch with me, I was so happy.

504
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,880
I was so happy to hear from someone that does that, right?

505
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:30,880
You can't just go and – you don't use Elmer's glue and masking tape to fix Steinway

506
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,480
pianos, right?

507
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,140
No, you don't go get two weeks' worth of training and go do that.

508
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:38,100
This is like someone who does – it's like Rolls-Royce.

509
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,160
It's up there.

510
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,900
Please, even the guys who tune them.

511
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,940
Even the guys who tune them, it takes a while to figure out how to do that, just to tune it.

512
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:45,080
Well, yeah.

513
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,520
You have to – right.

514
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,640
Yeah, it's more – and it's like – it's an art.

515
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:53,080
But more than that, like if someone – we had someone who welds.

516
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:53,820
He's a welder.

517
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,180
I'm like, oh, I'm so happy.

518
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:01,060
Someone contacts me and said like they weld or they do this or they do that.

519
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,400
I'm like, oh, I'm so happy to hear from you, right?

520
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,920
Because you can definitely use what I'm talking about, right?

521
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:10,620
Years ago, they used to call it working with your hands, right?

522
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,940
But there's another level to it.

523
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,100
Like again, I've run into people that have been doing – I've been cutting hair.

524
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:17,860
I've been doing plumbing.

525
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,680
I've been doing electric.

526
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,920
Once it goes over 15 or 20 years, have you invented anything?

527
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,860
When they say no right away, it's like this person is just going along for the ride.

528
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,200
What do I mean by that?

529
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:32,500
Anything that you do, any field, any skill or whatever,

530
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,460
if you're like slightly awake and see what's going on,

531
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:41,320
most of the people are just – they're fitting into a social culture, climate

532
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,500
or whatever that trade or type of work is.

533
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,500
It could even be a keyboard.

534
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,660
You could go back to that because I know someone who's redesigning interface with the keyboard.

535
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:52,020
So when you're going to go type a letter, it gives you a choice of words,

536
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,260
kind of like how the phone does.

537
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,860
But it does it in a daisy chain kind of way.

538
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,580
So now you're typing words instead of typing letters.

539
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,820
But he's working in a way to rearrange it on the screen.

540
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,840
But anyway, what I'm saying is if you're – when you go into any culture,

541
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:10,040
dentistry, medicine, nursing, aircraft structures engineering,

542
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,480
carpentry, truck driving, whatever,

543
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:16,580
you will notice that you have to kind of adjust to the tools or the way things are done.

544
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,960
Then when you start working in that field, it doesn't matter what it is,

545
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,440
a service, a product manufacturer, anything.

546
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,680
When you start working, you'll start noticing that you might –

547
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:29,040
everyone is doing this slight adjustment because it works better,

548
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,200
but it hasn't been done by the industry.

549
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,420
That's what I mean about being inventive, right?

550
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,900
Have you invented anything?

551
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,640
How many times have you gone to a place and they have like a –

552
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,860
it's a place that's furnished that offers a service,

553
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,560
but they have something taped together and glued together

554
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,940
that holds something else because it works better.

555
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,180
That's an invention, right?

556
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:53,740
In other words, there's no progress in the field as much as one would expect.

557
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,040
That's why I always ask people in any specialized skill, a carpenter,

558
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,400
a plumber, a hairdresser, a doctor, a dentist, whatever, have you invented –

559
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:06,080
like one of my clients was an ER second in charge of the emergency room

560
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,440
and he filed for a patent.

561
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,640
I said, oh, that's going to be real tough.

562
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,180
They don't like that in the medical industry.

563
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:16,180
What it was for is that about half the people that come in for trauma

564
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:21,820
in emergency rooms, the femur is dislocated from the hip bone.

565
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,980
Let's just not get into the anatomy.

566
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:26,520
The thigh bone comes out of the – and the hip is out of joint.

567
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,360
So they have to get that in place.

568
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,140
It's basically a pulling.

569
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,440
You get an orderly and you have to whack it.

570
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,620
The joint comes out of its socket.

571
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,660
About half the people, like people that get hit by cars,

572
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,840
people that fall off a cliff, people that fall down the stairs.

573
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,140
It's a very, very common thing.

574
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:48,240
So he invented this rack, a thing that the person leans against

575
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,620
and the medical technician adjusts it to the person's body

576
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:57,500
and then one motion with a lever returns the bone back into its socket, the femur.

577
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,740
The feet, the thigh bone.

578
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,760
Okay, I can picture that.

579
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,060
Yeah, it's a very common injury.

580
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,560
The next one is the shoulder, the shoulder being dislocated.

581
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,060
Even here, dislocated shoulder.

582
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,200
Dislocated shoulders are constant.

583
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,000
Yeah, it doesn't matter if it's a sports injury.

584
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,680
If you have a dislocation, you probably have a fracture in the clavicle,

585
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,740
which is a collarbone.

586
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,180
But anyway, so he was in the field for less than 10 years

587
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:25,220
and he started inventing these devices to help in ER, save time.

588
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,540
Now what's interesting, when you talk to him,

589
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,020
you can have a conversation about anything,

590
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,500
where the other ER guys are like,

591
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,120
I don't have time, I'm going to go play golf.

592
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,880
What a pathetic sport, by the way.

593
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,540
Golf, the most pathetic sport.

594
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,280
Do you know that they house people that applaud?

595
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,400
I don't even know that that's a sport.

596
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,320
I don't understand how it's a sport.

597
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:47,620
It's a rich man's activity.

598
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,720
It's a signal that you're signaling that you've made it

599
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,960
in a certain level of capitalist, upper middle class,

600
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,840
and upper class, whatever.

601
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:57,880
It's a signaling thing.

602
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,900
Very few people that play golf actually like it.

603
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:04,320
They do it because it's to signal that they're part of a group.

604
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,440
A status symbol.

605
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:10,480
What I'm trying to say is don't be afraid of being inventive.

606
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,760
It doesn't mean go run and do a patent.

607
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:13,660
No, no, no.

608
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,840
What I'm saying is be inventive and share it with others

609
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,680
and many other people.

610
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,980
When I worked in the bicycle industry,

611
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,020
I'd go to bicycle shows and tell manufacturers,

612
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,160
hey, why don't you do this, this, and that?

613
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,020
At the show that lasts several days in Las Vegas or New York

614
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,100
or Philadelphia or wherever it was,

615
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,700
oh, well, let's have dinner together.

616
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,980
So I'd have a four-hour conversation.

617
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,180
They're like, oh, I don't know about that.

618
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,620
Then a year later I'd go to the bike show

619
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,360
and they've actually implemented what I suggested.

620
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,080
I'm not like, oh, that was my idea.

621
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,860
No, it's just because it helps everyone.

622
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,040
I could give you the clipless pedals.

623
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:50,680
I said, why do you have a whole body for the pedal?

624
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,420
This was back in the late 80s.

625
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,980
Why do you have a body for the pedal and a body for the cleat?

626
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,300
Why don't you build everything around the cleat

627
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:01,660
so it has more support to the shoe and just a basic spindle on the pedal?

628
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,220
Oh, no, everybody wants it.

629
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,680
Oh, if somebody looks at a bike,

630
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:09,200
just a spindle on the crank with no pedal body, it looks weird.

631
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,640
I said, well, it's going to work better.

632
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,600
It'll stiffen up the shoe.

633
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,920
You put all the mechanics.

634
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,660
Well, when I started, the Speedplay came out

635
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,100
after I made a big thing about that.

636
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,200
A whole bunch of models started.

637
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:21,360
Then I said ergonomic hood covers for brake levers.

638
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,660
Why is it just a straight brake hood?

639
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,440
When you put your hand over it, it should be ergonomic,

640
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,220
like an octagon shape instead of just circular or rectangular

641
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,120
so the hand fits in.

642
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,000
Oh, no, people are used to this.

643
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,260
I said, no.

644
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:33,960
What?

645
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,140
I go back to you.

646
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,740
I started doing ergonomics, and I went to everyone.

647
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,680
I didn't say, hey, you got an idea?

648
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,960
Let's go patent this, and then we'll have the rights,

649
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:45,600
and if they want to do it, they have to pay us, right?

650
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,380
That was one thing I was doing with the Scalarator

651
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,380
when I was with John Butts and other people,

652
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,620
people in Europe, engineers, physicists.

653
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,760
Oh, how many people have you told?

654
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,900
How many people have you told?

655
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:57,900
Oh, I tell everybody.

656
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,500
Oh, stop talking about it.

657
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,180
Stop talking about it.

658
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,420
It's like you have to make a cover for it.

659
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,760
You can't show what it is.

660
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,260
I'm like, what the hell is wrong with you people?

661
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:08,440
Wow.

662
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,260
Creating scarcity, and they don't even know that the scarcity,

663
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,280
all the scarcity that can be has already happened,

664
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,500
and it's virtual scarcity.

665
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:19,160
It has to do with scarcity of money, not ideas and all that.

666
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,200
So am I knocking patents?

667
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,160
Yeah, I know enough.

668
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,800
I was brought up like everyone else, told to be a lawyer and a doctor

669
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,480
and get a patent and all this other stuff,

670
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,000
and when I started meeting inventors,

671
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,760
I noticed that they all had something in common,

672
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,660
the ones that failed and are failures in what they thought.

673
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,160
I'm going to be rich, and I know one guy 20 years later,

674
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:43,780
he's still not doing well at all because he fell in love with his invention.

675
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,820
Just like your children, let's say there's a parent.

676
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:51,200
When an inventor falls in love with his invention,

677
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,400
it's like a parent falling in love with their child.

678
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,840
I'm not saying loving their child, falling in love with their child

679
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,600
because you're doing a big disservice.

680
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:01,260
You know how they have the favorite, mama's favorite, papa's favorite?

681
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:01,740
Oh, yeah.

682
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:02,020
Right?

683
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:02,560
Okay.

684
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:08,560
That child gets oversheltered and has more privileges and immunities

685
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,020
than the rest of the children, and when it goes into the real world,

686
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,060
now it's handicapped.

687
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,440
It's like how come I'm not getting the attention?

688
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,700
Because of what they're accustomed to.

689
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,000
Right?

690
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,620
Yeah, because of what they're accustomed to.

691
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,880
So you're not preparing the child well, and also the other children.

692
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,020
Yeah.

693
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,380
Or they get smothered, and then they want to break away.

694
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,620
So I don't really give them all the love, and, look, they left at 15.

695
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,500
I haven't heard from them in five years.

696
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:30,220
Right?

697
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,380
So you've got to treat them.

698
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:31,660
Right?

699
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,900
As a parent, you're supposed to raise them biologically,

700
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:38,880
and you're supposed to bring in others for the culture

701
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,040
and all the other things.

702
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:40,320
Right?

703
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,100
Right.

704
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:41,940
Yeah, you see?

705
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:46,320
That's why the wealthy, they had people come in for their children.

706
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,640
They had a nanny raise you to do all the dirty work.

707
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,940
They had piano lessons come in.

708
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:56,540
They had etiquette teacher, grammar school teachers come in, all these different.

709
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,540
If you grew up in a very wealthy family.

710
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:01,500
And a governess who ran it all, if you had a really wealthy situation.

711
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,980
It was not unusual to have three or four people,

712
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:07,159
different types of instructors coming in every day or every week

713
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:10,400
to show the child, to expose the child to various things.

714
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:15,520
So if you're raised in a family where the only contact is the parents or grandma,

715
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,600
you're at a big disadvantage in terms of many other things.

716
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,139
Not always.

717
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:20,040
I'm just saying generally.

718
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:20,460
Right.

719
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:27,760
So these inventors that fell in love with their inventions did not change them,

720
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,679
did not take criticism very well.

721
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,719
They felt like if they tried to do a business deal,

722
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,780
if it didn't make them wealthy, they wouldn't do the business deal.

723
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:37,120
Right?

724
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:37,880
You see what I mean?

725
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,540
They set themselves up for failure.

726
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,040
And I see this.

727
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,300
And I'm not going to mention names.

728
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,239
I was going to actually say not mention names and mention a few names, but I'm not.

729
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,760
Actually, in one of them, on one of them,

730
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:52,060
I had drawn a few things to extend his invention.

731
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,639
And he says, oh, this is great.

732
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:58,540
And he says it has to be redrawn by an attorney because the line thickness isn't

733
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,480
proper for the patent.

734
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,760
So anyway, the patent continuance came out.

735
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:05,280
And they put my drawing in just like I sent it on an e-mail scan,

736
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,800
exactly like I sent it.

737
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,920
And you can see the patent is still up there.

738
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,560
It might have the pencil drawings.

739
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:15,940
So I do have stuff that's patented, but not under the Greek's name at all.

740
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,760
I have no interest in that at all.

741
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,180
So you can reach out to people and have a working relationship with them also.

742
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,960
So if I had grandchildren, I'd say, look, I see this drawing.

743
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,420
It's up on the U.S. government patent website.

744
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:28,900
Look at that.

745
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:29,740
I did that.

746
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,080
I came up with that idea.

747
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,080
But it was under someone else's.

748
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,140
It's called a continuation.

749
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,260
Anyway, be inventive.

750
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,480
So one thing I ask.

751
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,140
Now, this is kind of a tall order.

752
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:47,160
When you run into people, let's say someone is a dentist and you say,

753
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,200
have you invented it?

754
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,240
How long have you been in dentistry?

755
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:49,900
25 years.

756
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,260
Have you invented anything?

757
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,420
It's a tall order.

758
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,900
Usually most people are going to say no.

759
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,720
But what is this guy Greek talking about?

760
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,300
What an asshole.

761
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,660
Everybody I ask who's worked in any field for a long time,

762
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,540
have they invented anything?

763
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,160
And they usually say no.

764
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,780
I say, yeah, my point well taken then.

765
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,020
My point well taken.

766
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,340
How can you not?

767
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,900
Even if it's a small thing.

768
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:10,920
Like even in the workshop.

769
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:11,460
Of course.

770
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,800
If you notice that somebody has come up with a different way to set up

771
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,020
their tools because they've come up with a different storage system.

772
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,820
Or when I was working as a glass glazier,

773
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:24,420
we had a way of wrapping around and protecting the edges of finished

774
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:28,240
pieces of glass that was utilizing certain materials.

775
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:31,360
And actually I ended up teaching that to other people because they had

776
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,200
no idea about it.

777
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,960
It was kind of invented by the guy who, not me.

778
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,560
I'm not talking about like Inventors Club where you go on TV.

779
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:43,380
I know a guy who worked as – his whole family were linemen and either

780
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:46,320
for power lines or cable lines, any kind of whatever, right?

781
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:46,620
Okay.

782
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,260
And he didn't – he wanted to be – he didn't have the singing ability

783
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,480
to play guitar well enough.

784
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,920
So being a rock star wasn't going to work for him.

785
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,920
So he went and got a job working in a linesman.

786
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,040
And after two years in working there,

787
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,840
he's the one that invented in the 90s the cutter that cuts the wire and

788
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,960
strips it at the same time, different gauges.

789
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,780
It's like a – you squeeze it and it strips.

790
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,820
It cuts the wire and strips the little piece off so you don't have to cut

791
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:15,720
the wire and then go back with a dikes or a blade and strip it, right?

792
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,760
He invented that in only two years working in the field

793
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,060
and he got a patent for it.

794
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,200
He also applied for – he was very ingenious.

795
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:30,540
He applied for a patent to shoot – for an advertising company to do like

796
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,460
ads on the moon using lasers.

797
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:36,240
So everybody on the ground would see Coca-Cola on the moon for a short time

798
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,600
and then change to Jiffy Popcorn or General Ford motorcars

799
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:45,140
and using lasers scan the surface of the moon just like they have skywriting

800
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:48,180
with planes but use lasers on the moon.

801
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:53,320
And they said, no, no, that's against national security, blah, blah, blah.

802
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,660
But anyway, that's – you see what I'm – that sounds kind of crazy

803
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,200
but it's such an obvious thing to do,

804
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:03,280
put a laser projection of a corporate name on the moon, right?

805
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,120
Wouldn't that sound great?

806
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:08,100
You only have a few days or maybe let's say a week or so to do it.

807
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:12,840
How about running – that's one hell of a public –

808
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:16,140
what is it, a public relations firm if you think about it.

809
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:19,160
I mean even if it's just for one night honestly on the moon,

810
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,740
how many people are going to look up at the moon that night?

811
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:25,180
Yeah, so people like that really get my juices flowing

812
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,680
because all these possibilities.

813
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,360
Eventually you're going to run into something

814
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,820
that's going to make your life immediately better.

815
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,680
That's why I get into a lot of the food talk that I do.

816
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,940
One thing that I was asked to get into recently that I will

817
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,600
is some of the spiritual stuff that's hard to talk about.

818
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,180
I'm just going to get – we'll just end it right after a few comments

819
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,600
because there's some talk going on in the chat and all that.

820
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,080
Also with Archaics.

821
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,660
By the way, I don't endorse Archaics.

822
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,860
I'll bring up Brashears again.

823
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,740
I don't endorse him.

824
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:55,740
I have benefited greatly from his chronology.

825
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,460
It's not watertight.

826
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,920
He talks about the Phoenix event, but there's some publication.

827
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:04,140
I might have even put it up on the chat about a year ago.

828
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:09,400
There was a lot of crazy stuff happening throughout the 1800s and the 1700s

829
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,140
that does not line up with the 138, but that's fine.

830
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,360
That's fine.

831
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,740
Also in ancient times that I was aware of.

832
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,660
You could look up, but that's fine.

833
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,740
It doesn't mean that the 138 is not valid.

834
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:25,060
But he's been making a lot of ruckus about Scripture

835
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,800
and religious stuff and all that other stuff.

836
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:32,360
Now, one thing that I've warned people about for two decades now is this.

837
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,960
When someone begins a – and I've stuck with this for 20 years

838
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,400
and I will not change from it.

839
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,260
When someone brings up the biblical subject, they must,

840
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:46,340
within a few minutes of the subject being brought up,

841
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:52,720
qualify that the Scriptures have not been translated outside of Hebrew and Greek.

842
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,820
There is no translation.

843
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,620
They're all versions.

844
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,900
If you want a translation, you're going to have to do it yourself

845
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,360
through what's called an interlinear.

846
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,820
It just gives you word for word in the original language,

847
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,800
which is not a translation because it's not pieced together right.

848
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,420
So there's no literal translation.

849
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,100
Now, there's Young's literal translation or whatever.

850
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,920
No, they don't have the – OK.

851
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,880
Because certain words, what you do in a translation that is not translatable,

852
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,060
you must carry it over.

853
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,580
Like Elohim is not translatable, so it would be Elohim.

854
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:30,020
Yahweh is not translatable, so it's Yahweh and vice versa.

855
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,820
But all languages have something like that.

856
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,420
That's why when you go to certain countries,

857
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:40,140
they'll start using English words, technical words.

858
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,680
They'll say Windows for a computer.

859
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:46,880
In France or Spain, they'll say Windows, not Ventana, right,

860
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,180
because Windows is the name of the program.

861
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:50,620
It's not translatable.

862
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,440
Names are not subject to translation, right?

863
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,960
Proper names, yeah.

864
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:55,640
Proper names.

865
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,800
Yeah, he doesn't do that.

866
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:02,300
He doesn't – also, the other thing to watch out for, big red flag to me.

867
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,640
It doesn't mean I'm discounting.

868
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,240
These are just minus points.

869
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,560
These are things that drop your stock value, right?

870
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,040
OK.

871
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:12,840
The other thing is if you're going to be accurate and transmit information,

872
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:16,420
you have, let's say, something you want to convey,

873
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,200
and there are many other things that can be discussed.

874
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,780
You could discuss them another time, but keep them valid.

875
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,760
Don't invalidate them.

876
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,820
What I mean is by this.

877
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,760
When you go to someone like Bashir and you say there is no crucifixion,

878
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,840
that's kind of harsh, but you bring it up.

879
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,460
You know what he says?

880
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,480
It doesn't matter.

881
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,400
That's the typical stuff.

882
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,520
When you hear it doesn't matter from anyone,

883
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,620
I've never said that, by the way, ever.

884
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,560
Everything matters.

885
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:46,440
I might discount something, but I'll never say I don't care or it doesn't matter.

886
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,520
That's complete apathy.

887
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,880
One thing might matter less than something else though, right?

888
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:55,360
I mean there might be a scale here, but it's not that it doesn't matter at all.

889
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,940
Well, you know, what I've seen him several times,

890
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,240
he was reading a comment, there was no crucifixion.

891
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:00,980
It doesn't matter.

892
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:01,740
OK.

893
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:06,580
The reason why this is not good at all is because that's one of the Christian,

894
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:09,340
you know how you become a Christian, you cut the top of your head off,

895
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,000
dump your brains out, put your head back on,

896
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,120
now you get the certificate you're a Christian, right?

897
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:13,480
There you go.

898
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,280
What that means is very clearly, very simply,

899
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:25,780
the typical Christian thing is you go to them and it's all doesn't matter,

900
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,160
doesn't matter, doesn't matter.

901
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,380
It's the political side.

902
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:32,360
So you go to a Christian, well, you know, it's a Bible believer, right?

903
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,240
Yeah, absolutely.

904
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,460
I say, well, that's not in the Bible.

905
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,180
It doesn't matter, right?

906
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,160
You see?

907
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:43,020
And also he quotes a lot of biblical stuff and then says it was not right.

908
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:48,560
It's written by a bunch of evil Jewish rabbis, whatever, tiny hats,

909
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:51,200
whatever he calls them, but yet they're inspired by God.

910
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:55,880
So too much of this stuff – people like that want to be rich.

911
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:56,760
They don't want to be right.

912
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,800
Now if you say, well, Greek, you want to be right?

913
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,740
Well, no, because you're going to put on the gravestone he was right.

914
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:03,620
It doesn't matter.

915
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:06,560
You're dead, right, what they put on your gravestone, right?

916
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:09,660
So, by the way, I'm supposed to be buried in a dumpster anyway,

917
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:13,480
but the problem with that is the dumpsters are locked these days.

918
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,840
They're locking dumpsters, right?

919
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:20,800
So, yeah, so anyways, the whole thing here is you take what you can,

920
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,900
use what you can, but those two qualifiers,

921
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:29,760
whenever you don't hear a preface that we don't have a translation in any other language

922
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,960
outside of Hebrew and Greek,

923
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:37,340
it doesn't matter on the aspect of what the subject matter about the Bible is going to be.

924
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:38,340
That must be made.

925
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:39,980
Let's just say it doesn't matter, right?

926
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:45,280
In other words, that is a given because most people think when they go

927
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,560
and access whatever version they have,

928
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:51,440
they're actually looking at what's been memorialized originally, right?

929
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,980
And that doesn't work ever.

930
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:59,120
The other thing is when someone starts getting wholeheartedly serious about a subject

931
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,920
and you bring up their misinterpretation,

932
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,160
it's like I've also heard him over and over, archaics,

933
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,920
talk about, well, you know, the day starts at sundown, right?

934
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,340
That's a Jewish Babylonian thing.

935
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:15,420
It's actually, it was done, it's an unusual, there's many different histories why

936
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:19,840
and it's not touched, but the day starts in the Bible, Scripture,

937
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,980
and in old culture, and in merchant culture, and legal culture, law culture,

938
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:29,740
and in scientific culture, it's noon.

939
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,320
It's very easy.

940
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:34,160
It's actually, once you know that, you could find it.

941
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:37,160
But if you don't know this, you will never find it because it's hidden.

942
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:40,120
Any Astronomy 101 spends about five minutes.

943
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:44,240
Every course in Astronomy 101 tells you the day starts at noon, right?

944
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:48,320
So when you go look at all the stuff in the biblical stuff,

945
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,680
like he, what's funny, again, I'm not knocking archaics,

946
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:56,660
but he says, look, even Genesis says it was evening and it was morning the first day.

947
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:03,280
No, that's noon because evening, right, and morning, right, where do they meet?

948
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:04,340
At noon.

949
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:04,980
They meet at noon.

950
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:05,820
Right, right.

951
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:10,180
So he's trying, it's like you're not even thinking about what you're talking about,

952
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,580
not even thinking about it because it would say it became evening

953
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:18,760
and it's the next day if it was evening, not evening and morning, right?

954
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,740
It's a moment.

955
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,860
Also, you can't keep precision records and all this.

956
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:23,520
Anyway, the full moon is the new moon.

957
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,060
It's just really tiring and you hear this.

958
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,120
Why don't you reach out to a character?

959
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,040
I said, I don't have any money to give him.

960
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:31,920
He just wants money.

961
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,940
So, you know, it's all he wants.

962
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:42,360
So anyway, so look, I am very grateful about the timeline and the chronology

963
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:47,080
set forward with the various objects, the 2040, 2046, 2052,

964
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,380
and a lot of his followers, by the way,

965
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:52,200
I don't care if people say it about Greek-speak followers who are dumb.

966
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:56,100
They're like, it's the end of the world in 2046?

967
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:57,880
And even archaics, he'll get on.

968
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:59,380
He says, I never said that.

969
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:04,020
So it's like, oh, my gosh, you need to have a good memory.

970
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:06,560
That's one thing that's very important.

971
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:09,480
You must be able to retain information in its proper way.

972
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,700
It's called memory.

973
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:12,820
You must have a good memory.

974
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:16,640
If you don't, then everything is entertainment to you, right?

975
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:21,320
It's very important to have a good memory with facts and figures.

976
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,240
Otherwise, it falls into entertainment.

977
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:27,200
And it's very excusable.

978
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:28,200
It's very excusable.

979
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:31,960
Everybody pats each other on the back for not retaining things

980
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,720
and not knowing things, right?

981
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:39,080
But if you come off retaining things and knowing things, oh, he thinks he's so smart.

982
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:40,800
He's a real nerd.

983
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:42,800
I've talked about that before.

984
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,340
So you're not welcomed here.

985
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,680
It's not welcoming, by the way.

986
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:51,220
People are very cruel if you tend to do things more properly than they do.

987
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,940
But you can't be too sloppy either, right?

988
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:57,200
Because then they'll call you a slob or dumb.

989
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,000
The worst thing is to be called dumb by a normie.

990
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,100
That would be really bad.

991
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:06,980
But the hard things to discuss, we'll start piecing something together,

992
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:14,720
because when you're talking about a non-corporeal world, the spiritual world,

993
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,660
when you are in a corporeal situation with a body,

994
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:23,800
it's kind of like trying to watch television with the television unplugged.

995
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:24,900
You know what I mean?

996
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:30,680
It's like, okay, let's talk about the things that are hard to discuss

997
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,360
about the spiritual world and spirituality.

998
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:36,820
What's on TV when there's no TV around?

999
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,000
What's on TV when it's on?

1000
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,480
Is there anything on the TV?

1001
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:44,800
Is there anything playing on the TV when the TV is not on?

1002
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,340
Or when it's on, when the TV is playing,

1003
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:50,700
is there another message in there that we could see?

1004
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,140
And there is, by the way.

1005
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,160
Almost always is.

1006
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,320
Yeah, yeah.

1007
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:59,600
So this is the mindset that you're going to require yourself to be in

1008
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:03,840
when we start getting into a couple of discussions in the next Sonic or two.

1009
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,760
We'll just preface it and leave it there.

1010
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,300
Seems like any time there's energy running through,

1011
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,160
then there's always something that can be gained from it.

1012
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,280
But without the energy, it's just an object, right?

1013
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:16,500
Can be, yeah.

1014
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:24,050
There we go.

1015
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:27,010
That was a little long.

1016
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:27,850
Yeah, okay.

1017
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:28,730
What about four?
