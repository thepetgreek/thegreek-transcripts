1
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:17,520
The Sonic Event 116 rated Y, and a little bit of a break, but did you notice?

2
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,520
Did you miss us, Greek?

3
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,280
How are you?

4
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,520
Okay, I think I could speak a little bit tonight.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,340
Excellent.

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,340
Yeah, it's interesting.

7
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,400
It's not physical, as we were saying, losing one's voice.

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,800
I think it was energetic, and mental, and a bunch of other stuff.

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,220
I've got a lot of stuff going on.

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,400
Actually, I've got the least going on that I ever have, but the stuff that I've got going

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,160
on is the most that I've ever had.

12
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:45,920
You know, a lot of the woo-woo people talk about your chakra, your throat chakra gets

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,640
blocked and whatnot, and I've got a couple of messages recently about the difference

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,580
between superstition and maybe the vagaries of the way things actually function.

15
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:03,819
How true is that kind of stuff, where your voice gets silenced because everybody with

16
00:01:03,819 --> 00:01:05,040
the whole karma play, right?

17
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,480
Oh, it's just karma coming back.

18
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,240
He's getting silenced because he said bad things.

19
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:08,680
It's mythology.

20
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:09,460
Yeah.

21
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,460
Mythology, but no, it's fine.

22
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,560
It's like a runner that has his knee, because I don't write.

23
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,420
I've discussed before why I don't write, because if you're writing and publishing, you're presuming

24
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,340
that people have comprehension, right?

25
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:27,060
It also adds to your participation in the culture, which is usually what superstition

26
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,060
is built on, right?

27
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,980
It's about culture, because you and I have talked about this, where people from different

28
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:37,240
parts of the world have similar ideas that are superstitious, right?

29
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,700
You know about the evil eye.

30
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,900
You know about the curses.

31
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,020
You're Greek.

32
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,700
I'm Sicilian.

33
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,520
We've both heard about curses at some point in our lives, right?

34
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,220
Well, here's the thing.

35
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,260
The Greek-speak stuff is just based on factual stuff.

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,360
Then there's the personal, what you do with it.

37
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,760
For example, with Greek-speak, what got you here ain't going to get you there.

38
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,480
In other words, if you listen to Greek-speak because you found out about it, you better

39
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,820
figure out what you want to do with it, because just listening to it and hearing it, whatever,

40
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,800
ain't going to get you anywhere, right?

41
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:16,160
It was like the confusion that people had years ago when you said, look, I'm not advising

42
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,760
anybody to do any of this, because here's what I guarantee you.

43
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,480
Everybody around you.

44
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:21,640
Yeah.

45
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,880
I wouldn't do what I would do.

46
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,240
I wouldn't do what I would do, especially if you value the people and things you have

47
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,220
around you right now, because if you do, you're going to lose them, most likely.

48
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,320
No, we're not losing them.

49
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:31,920
What will happen?

50
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:40,700
Well, yeah, you will, in a simple term, perhaps, but what happens is, okay, if you understand

51
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,940
what's going on, in big air quotes, and you want to be a part of it, fine.

52
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,720
But this is what I want to say.

53
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,200
Some people think it's kind of negative, angry, or whatever, but if you have a positive attitude,

54
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,240
you'll be rewarded.

55
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,400
And the best positive attitude is the giving attitude, right, just to help people for the

56
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,040
sake of helping.

57
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:03,080
I've spoken to people that did things, they went on projects, whether it was a week long

58
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:08,160
or seven years or 10 years, that they would be rewarded.

59
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,960
The universe will reward them or the gods will reward them.

60
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,000
No such thing comes about, right?

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,180
And I said, of course, it's not going to come, the chances of doing something good, right,

62
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,720
so you can have good done to you is nearly null, you have to do it in a in a sensible

63
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,000
way that that's part of your character.

64
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,180
And then your character, it's a character gets rewarded, not your actions, but your actions

65
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,280
are based on your character.

66
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,080
Again, what got you here ain't going to get you there.

67
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,060
You know, in other words, listening to Greek speaking, ain't going to do much for you unless

68
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:39,880
you know how to use it.

69
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,980
But I just got someone, I get messages, by the way, I get someone messaging me, emails

70
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,680
a long time listener, and he just did some black car wax on a black, a black shoe polish

71
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,720
on a black car.

72
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,240
No one does that.

73
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:53,440
Right.

74
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,580
And it's great, because it fills all the scratches and everything, right?

75
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,100
It's like, it's amazing.

76
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,560
Works great, you know, because you know, you've ever pulled out years ago, I don't think people

77
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,680
polish shoes anymore, maybe they do pull out some old pair of shoes, put some shoe polish

78
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,360
on and you're like, damn, they look just good.

79
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,040
Just as good as new, except for the, you know, the wear on the heel or whatever, right?

80
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,080
Yeah, on the bottom, like everything except the bottom of the shoe looks great.

81
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,740
Yeah, same with a car.

82
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,959
So you know, stuff like that.

83
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,140
By the way, here's another little tip.

84
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,660
If you have laundry facilities, and even if you don't, most people have a refrigerator

85
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,840
with a freezer section.

86
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,240
I noticed like some older clothes or while as your body chemistry changes, I get bo and

87
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,560
I can't wash it out of t shirts and things like that.

88
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,180
I once heard, you know, with real expensive jeans, because some jeans go for, you know,

89
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,760
the Dolce Gabbana is right, you can imagine, right.

90
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,000
And don't wash them, because you'll wear them out, put them in the freezer makes the smell

91
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,440
go away.

92
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,240
So let me try that.

93
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,160
So I've been doing that.

94
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,720
And it works really, really well.

95
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,080
So if you have body odor on something, especially things that would be dry cleaned, or you don't

96
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,680
want to wash, put it in the freezer.

97
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,040
They say it's the bacteria that freeze that cause the odor.

98
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,940
It's a yin and yang thing also, by the way.

99
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,480
Yeah.

100
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,360
So that's another tip.

101
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,500
I've been practicing that this week.

102
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,040
I've got half my closet in the freezer.

103
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,860
I happen to have a freezer chest.

104
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,160
But I didn't use it.

105
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,320
But in case you want to start a laundry service or you freeze people's clothes to get the

106
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:16,860
smells out.

107
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,540
Quite interesting.

108
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,720
That's interesting.

109
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,300
Bring that up.

110
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:23,700
But yeah, one thing I wanted to just tackle a little bit is there was, you know, the Trump

111
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,580
verdict thing, right?

112
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:25,680
Oh, boy.

113
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,720
Yeah, I can't.

114
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,640
I'm not going to talk about Trump, but I just want to talk about how something like that

115
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:36,480
is so obviously whatever, kangaroo court, and obviously a show, but it does pertain to

116
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,720
how what's going on.

117
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,100
It's very important that people understand this.

118
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,400
And what I'm going to say is understood by less than 1% of people working in the Department

119
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:45,940
of Justice.

120
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,840
Probably Supreme Court judges know this.

121
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,400
Some judges know this.

122
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,920
Almost no attorneys know this.

123
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:58,480
So what I'm saying now is the kind of stuff you get for like $1,500 attorney stuff, you

124
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,700
know, $1,500 an hour attorney stuff.

125
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,980
So this is what's going on.

126
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:07,640
People don't know is there, you know, they're fake courts, you know, they railroad people,

127
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,360
they charge people with all these things like something very loose, and they serve time

128
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,220
in prison and all that.

129
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:18,720
All of this is because of the minister, a series of administrative procedures acts passed

130
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,620
by legislation.

131
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:27,460
And also a landmark case in 1938 called Tompkins versus Erie Railroad.

132
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:34,180
Okay, so the administrative procedures acts for like 1887, 1946, 1966, 1982.

133
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,660
I know them all, by the way, and I could talk and lecture on them because that's what everything

134
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,160
is based on administrative law.

135
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:46,540
In administrative law, it's basically commercial, like the first one 1887 was interstate commerce

136
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,660
and all this other stuff, right?

137
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:54,160
But what happens there is in administrative law, the law gets so glorified that any proceeding,

138
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:01,100
legal or otherwise, is always putting the actual regulations codes in question.

139
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:08,600
And because you can't question them because they're a fact of legislature, right?

140
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,740
They're infallible.

141
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,420
And everyone in the courtroom is an offender.

142
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,080
And a payment has to be made and bonded.

143
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,380
This sounds like some crazy religion.

144
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:20,440
Bear with me.

145
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,280
And by the way, it is.

146
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,780
The Bar Association, Segway, is in every country in the world.

147
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,400
North Korea, Iran, all these enemy countries, they all have the same bar association with

148
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,000
their country's name in front of it, the American Bar, the Russian Bar, whatever, whatever.

149
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,100
It's a group that comes out of England.

150
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,040
It's kind of modified.

151
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,720
Nobody knows.

152
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,420
They deny what it means and all that.

153
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:45,420
And there is no legislative act that ever said the bar can take over the court system

154
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,360
of the world, of every country in the world.

155
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,100
There's no legislative government.

156
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,520
Legislative act means, you know, enacted in law.

157
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,080
True.

158
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,580
But if you want to freak out a barrister, just bring up the phrase to them, Temple Bar

159
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,680
Association, and they'll cringe.

160
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:58,600
Right.

161
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,380
But the thing is, do you know how it works, you know?

162
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,280
Right?

163
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,220
And the answer is no.

164
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:03,880
Most people don't.

165
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,380
I kind of want to break it down.

166
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:09,680
It's a private organization, just like all the money is WEF, right?

167
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,540
Right.

168
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,960
And so everything is already new world order for a long time.

169
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:19,340
But there's no tell a lawyer that, you know, there's no legislative act that enacted the

170
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:24,000
Bar Association to run the judiciary because, you know, you can't be a judge or a highland

171
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,440
lawyer or high end lawyer or attorney general without being a bar member.

172
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,760
And there's no by the way, there is no license to practice law.

173
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,480
It's fictitious.

174
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,539
They're calling a bar card, right?

175
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,659
A license to practice law in a way it is because a library card is a license to take books

176
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:40,460
from the library.

177
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:46,720
Well, it's membership or approval by the organization in order to participate, which is the bar,

178
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,320
which is not there.

179
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,420
Again, there's no understanding.

180
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:50,860
Underscore.

181
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,220
There's no legislative act.

182
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,180
OK, so back to Administrative Procedures Act.

183
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,900
The laws are infallible.

184
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,660
They're sitting there.

185
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,880
So any procedures are going on as an offense to the regulations.

186
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,860
Now, you might say, well, Greek, well, you know, here's the plaintiff.

187
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:07,780
He's been, you know, and then you have the defendant and there's an offense by the defendant

188
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,580
against the plaintiff.

189
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:09,780
Right.

190
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,380
No, that's OK.

191
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,700
That's what that's what people say in law.

192
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,520
But once you go into the administrative procedures side of things, which is everything, right,

193
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,240
the law is no longer competent.

194
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,160
The law is no longer competent.

195
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:27,800
In other words, it doesn't hold anymore, because if you the the the the logic there is that

196
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,680
if you were observing the law, you wouldn't be here.

197
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,460
OK, so this is what's going on.

198
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,040
How does someone get guilty on all 34 charges?

199
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,920
How does someone get guilty on whatever?

200
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,860
It doesn't matter.

201
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,980
You want to run the whole gamut.

202
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:44,120
There's I think worldwide there's over 20 million different things, illegal offenses

203
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,300
you can be charged with in the United States, over 14 million things you could be charged

204
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:48,580
with.

205
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:48,920
Sure.

206
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:49,260
OK.

207
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:50,500
All right.

208
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,480
So this is what's really going on.

209
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,520
And this is the intent of the administrative procedures.

210
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,460
And this is what's going on.

211
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:02,140
How are you guilty on all 34 charges, especially let's let's fast forward to oral arguments

212
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:02,780
with a jury.

213
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,100
When the jury goes into deliberation to create to bring forward the verdict, what they are

214
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,800
told specifically is the entire case.

215
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,280
This is what a plea does.

216
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,860
Also, if you put in a plea guilty, no contest or not guilty, it's the same thing.

217
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:26,060
By the way, if you don't show up for a court date, the judge puts in a not guilty plea

218
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:26,740
for you.

219
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,560
Right.

220
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,780
Because people think, oh, I'm going to plead not guilty has nothing to do with the plea.

221
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,480
By the way, putting in a plea and this is the punchline, this is where I'm going to

222
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,440
finish the thing off.

223
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,580
When you enter, when a plea is entered of anything, it means that the charges are true.

224
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:49,020
So when someone is guilty on 34 charges, when the jury goes in, what the jury is told, what

225
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:54,820
you are going to decide on are the charges true?

226
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:59,480
Not whether they don't say not whether the person committed the crimes or not, but whether

227
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:05,460
the charges were applied correctly and whether they did it or not is irrelevant because this

228
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,160
is administrative.

229
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:12,100
Right. So the only evidence that could be looked at is, let's say

230
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,340
they have several, you know, they call them star chambers, pre-trial stuff, right?

231
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,340
Indictments that are done without, you know, in secret.

232
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:26,000
OK, when that's the most important part, when you're charged, you're indicted, those things

233
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,260
are structured in a way that once they get on, once you're charged with it, you're stuck

234
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,100
with it, whether it doesn't matter if you're guilty or not guilty.

235
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,500
So what the jury is asked.

236
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:43,960
Was it was he charged with this number one all the way to 34?

237
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,280
Right. You know what I'm talking about?

238
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,140
Yes. Was he charged?

239
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,300
He was charged. OK, let's go 34 counts.

240
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,660
Right. So first count.

241
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,060
Is this charge true?

242
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,020
Obviously, yes.

243
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,240
Second charge. Is this charge true?

244
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,340
Yes. Third charge.

245
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,460
Is this charge true?

246
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,740
Yes. Not whether he's guilty or innocent of it.

247
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,640
Is the charge true?

248
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,300
And then the whole thing is the indictment.

249
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:12,300
If you read indictments and things before they arrest someone, they set up the charges in

250
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:17,460
a way that it seems like you're guilty, but it's irrelevant because does the charge fit?

251
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:22,660
Right. It's like this was the crime fit with the glove.

252
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,520
You must. Does it?

253
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,360
Yeah. If the glove don't fit, you must acquit Johnny.

254
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,600
Right. It doesn't matter.

255
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,960
So in other words here, let's go back with something.

256
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,760
Go, Jay Simpson. Is it true that you can be charged for murder?

257
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:41,040
Yes. Is it is it proper to have charged him with murder?

258
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,000
Most people would say, yeah, but he's innocent.

259
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,320
That doesn't matter that he's innocent or guilty.

260
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,500
I know this doesn't make sense to the this is this makes just as much sense to most people

261
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,820
as the money system does.

262
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:57,620
How I know what you can do when the government wants to make money, they send you a check.

263
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,960
And then when you sign it, it becomes ten times that value.

264
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:04,560
Right. Right. People don't understand that this could be looked up very readily and charged.

265
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,900
If you're charged with something, it's always pointed out.

266
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,640
Well, he was charged with that. He's not guilty.

267
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,060
All things with O.J.

268
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,240
He was found not guilty.

269
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,380
Remember, right? It doesn't matter somewhat.

270
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,760
OK, what happens administrative?

271
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,500
It's shipping. It's commerce.

272
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,380
All if you look at it, I forgot which code it was in the title.

273
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,220
All crimes are commercial crimes.

274
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,760
I think it's Title 28 or Title 18.

275
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,580
Title 18. Either one.

276
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,760
Title 18, 28 or 50.

277
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,960
But anyway, or the shades of it in there.

278
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,260
So, OK, so this is what's going on.

279
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:43,220
Once the charges are put together, bonded, they have a case number and there gets they sent over to the Chris system.

280
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,180
C.R.I.S. Are you in front of a computer?

281
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,880
Yeah, I put in Chris.

282
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,040
C.R.I.S. It's an acronym system.

283
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:52,940
Federal Reserve.

284
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,940
And it should show it's the Court Registry Investment Service.

285
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,240
It's part of the Federal Reserve Bank.

286
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,020
And it's in Dallas.

287
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,320
Do they still show that on the Internet?

288
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:01,840
I'm just curious.

289
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:02,480
Let's see.

290
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,320
Christopher C.R.I.S.

291
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,660
Christopher J. Walker, Federal Reserve.

292
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,700
So here we go. Chris.

293
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,400
No, Chris Barker.

294
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:19,100
Put in Chris Court Registry Investment Service or Chris is part of the Federal Reserve in Dallas or Chris Court C.R.I.S.

295
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,680
Court Investment Federal Reserve.

296
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,440
Anything come up?

297
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,280
OK, hold on.

298
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,360
Court Investment System, most likely.

299
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,060
Anyway, look, years ago you would find it online.

300
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,920
I mentioned this to someone about a year ago.

301
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,540
I said it's nothing.

302
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,000
There's nothing online on the search.

303
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,980
Chris Court Registry Investment System.

304
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:43,880
Oh, you found it online under the United States District Court, Middle District of North Carolina.

305
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,720
Court Registry Investment System.

306
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,860
Chris, what is the Federal Reserve?

307
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:48,780
It's out of Dallas.

308
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:55,520
They show that the course registry is, let's see, interest bearing cash management tool administrated by the administrative office of the U.S.

309
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,600
court that provides clerks with an easy, efficient court now and safe way to apply.

310
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:03,400
It's part of the Federal Reserve System out of Dallas, Texas.

311
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,800
Now there's now they're shrouding it in the state court.

312
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,420
Let's see. How does it operate?

313
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,740
How is money deposited?

314
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,760
How does money get?

315
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,780
It has nothing to do with that.

316
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,520
I'm just telling you what's listed as, you know.

317
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,420
Yeah. OK, well, it's in Dallas.

318
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,540
It's a Federal Reserve.

319
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,120
All court cases run through there and they go through the window.

320
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,280
They become monetized.

321
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,080
Well, you know, I can add Dallas to it and see if that's what it does.

322
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,840
There's a lot of long winded stuff there.

323
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:35,040
That's it. So if it's a traffic ticket in Podunk, Idaho or a big case, they all go through the Chris system, just like everything goes through the DTCC.

324
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,100
Right. It's all financial.

325
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:45,480
This now can only be found on the Internet Archive, looks like to me the original listing, which, let's see, Attribution

326
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:52,780
non-commissioned. OK, there's something about the court registry investment system now online.

327
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,380
Yes. But it doesn't go directly to Federal Reserve Dallas, Texas.

328
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,980
No. General order 24 court registry.

329
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,820
I mean, it's bad that it doesn't because that's what it is.

330
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,280
But yeah. Yeah. But this is where it mentions Dallas is in the Internet Archive.

331
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,620
OK. General order number 24, court registry investment system.

332
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,620
Dallas, also known as Chris, which stands for court registered investment system.

333
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,100
This is a system used by the judicial branch.

334
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:26,240
Read judges who often misallocate justice to the interest of continuing the transfer of wealth from the defendants that would be actual people.

335
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,640
Most of the time, nothing has to do with monetizing the court case.

336
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,080
Well, I'm just reading what it is.

337
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:37,080
You know, I could stand up and talk about the legal system, how it works and the history behind it.

338
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:43,340
As a lecturer, a professor type lecture on another planet, not this planet.

339
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:51,300
You know, I mean, they give another acronym here, by the way, which is what they give another an acronym here, which is OK.

340
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,020
The bonds are indexed under a system known as CUSC, CUSC bonds.

341
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,320
Real quick. Every case, even the bonds are short.

342
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,280
2003 was the Paperwork Reduction Act.

343
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,380
A lot of things have changed since then.

344
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:09,420
But what I'm going to talk about is before that there's something called the Miller Bond System.

345
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,200
Construction companies use it.

346
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,020
So there's no money.

347
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,800
So they want to rebuild that bridge that the boat hits.

348
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,900
Right. All right. About a month ago.

349
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,339
OK. Three billion dollars.

350
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,520
So they put out a couple of contracts.

351
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,400
They figure like everything underwater is going to be 300 million.

352
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:29,100
Everything above water is going to be, you know, about a billion.

353
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,760
And then they have to do this other stuff.

354
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,420
Half a billion. So they put it out for bid.

355
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,620
Right. And that's why, you know, people cry when there's a no bid contract.

356
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,540
It's corruption. Right.

357
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,560
So the government puts out stuff for bid.

358
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,640
So you're a construction company.

359
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,280
When you put in your bid, you have what's called a bid bond and a performance bond.

360
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,340
And it has to be signed by flesh and blood being an executive.

361
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,160
And you have to be vetted.

362
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:54,140
So when the government gets those bids, they take the bond that the construction

363
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,940
company put in. It's an executive bond, right?

364
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,480
An executive, not an executive.

365
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,180
Right. Trix is the female executor.

366
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,620
Yeah, gotcha. All right.

367
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,760
Let's say tricks. OK, so.

368
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,140
So the government says, oh, I want to get that government job.

369
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,840
I want to get the government's money. Right.

370
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,940
The government has no money.

371
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,460
What they do is when you put in the bid for the job,

372
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,820
they take the bond and they deposit in the Federal Reserve

373
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,620
and they get the money off of your own bond.

374
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,740
The construction company funds its own

375
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,920
construction fund. It's crazy.

376
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,980
And then you have to pay for it twice.

377
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,680
So then you have to put in a performance bond.

378
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,860
So give a shout out to Alberto.

379
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,240
He's a old OG here in Tucson.

380
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,540
While back, went down to court building anyway.

381
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,420
His son was going to jail for whatever.

382
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:41,740
So we go up to the court clerk and we say, got this case number in your computer?

383
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,460
She goes, yeah.

384
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,020
And OK, so we'd like to sign off on the bonds.

385
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,080
And she goes, what did you say?

386
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:53,380
Can you present the bonds to us so we could sign them off and have the case

387
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:58,060
discharged? I can't do that because if I do it for you,

388
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,620
I have to do it for everybody.

389
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,820
Now, the big bond is what's in other words, once we a second party

390
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,800
signs those bonds, they can cash it out and the boy doesn't have to go to jail.

391
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,460
Done. Everything's paid for.

392
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:14,480
OK, so the big bond is up to three proceeding up to what they calculate

393
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,700
to be three hundred thousand dollars from what I understand.

394
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,720
But, you know, there's unlimited.

395
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,220
It goes to like 60 million now because it was up to three hundred thousand

396
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,000
some years ago. I know that for sure.

397
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:24,900
That was. Yeah.

398
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:28,680
So but all you got to do is sign it and then you got to do some verbiage

399
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,180
and the money comes out of your signature.

400
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,260
But anyway, here's the thing.

401
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,920
The big bond is the court case.

402
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:37,100
OK, the performance bond is the fines that you pay or the jail time.

403
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,080
You have to perform time.

404
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,940
OK. Right. So there's always two bonds.

405
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,220
There's more bonds to it.

406
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,840
But it's called if you put in the Miller bond system,

407
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,220
does anything come up on the Internet or they kill that, too?

408
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,280
Well, I'm going to try that.

409
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,400
But you know what's funny?

410
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,420
I just entered the cussing thing that I was telling you, which was the.

411
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,640
That's different.

412
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,920
That's the Convention on Universal Security Investment Protocols.

413
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,660
Yeah. Yeah.

414
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,740
But what's funny is that that is the first time ever

415
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:07,440
that I put in something that's, you know, a letter standing for a word

416
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,640
that I have gotten absolutely zero.

417
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,420
It tells me that they're they're blocking it.

418
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,260
Yeah. OK.

419
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,100
You know, when you go to a government officer's school, they have your name

420
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,840
and these little has to be spelled out in individual boxes for each letter.

421
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,020
Many forms are like that, mostly school forms.

422
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,660
You'll see it. Yes. Right.

423
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,860
And they'll tell you that's for the computer.

424
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,900
No, that's a QCIP.

425
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,240
That's part of the QCIP convention. Right.

426
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,720
So when you go to Ace Hardware or a supermarket

427
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,960
to get one of their rewards cards, it's just like that.

428
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,240
It is. I said, my gosh, how much do I get for fillings?

429
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,560
I'm giving you guys my credit.

430
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,580
Yeah. What are you talking about?

431
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,160
People don't know they have no clue.

432
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,400
That's why this is the kind of stuff I could lecture on.

433
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,720
I could do a full semester course on how the legal money system even helps.

434
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,540
But on another planet, right?

435
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,360
Not here, because people are going to hear this.

436
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,300
They're going to say, first of all, I don't understand what you're talking about.

437
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,220
Second of all, it sounds so outrageous, even though I can look it up.

438
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,180
I still don't believe it.

439
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,720
Just like the college professor.

440
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,200
So he told him that, you know, even if all the astronauts said,

441
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:10,060
even if all the astronauts confessed that they never went to the moon,

442
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,580
I still believe they did.

443
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,880
OK, well, here's a funny thing.

444
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,500
When you put in the Miller Act payment bond claims, right?

445
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,340
All right. Well, here's the thing.

446
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:23,120
The American Bar Association is the first thing that comes up.

447
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,540
Second is the G.S.

448
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,100
When you do a search for the Miller bonds. Yeah.

449
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,960
The bars come. Oh, perfect. Perfect. Good.

450
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,440
So they're telling you. Good. Yeah.

451
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,560
So they come up.

452
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:38,000
But then the second thing is funny to me because it's under the GSA dot gov.

453
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,120
OK. Yeah, that's right.

454
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,600
Government services.

455
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:45,680
And they give you the Miller Act, which is right. Yeah.

456
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,900
So they show you the Miller Act.

457
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,120
But the Bar Association does something different.

458
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:53,480
Now, let's go take precedence over the GSA government.

459
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,680
And then they have the G.S.

460
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,340
So and then there's the there's all these they're they're all they're all corrupt.

461
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,160
Like, for example, you know, the coroner,

462
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,380
the coroner was no one messed with the coroner.

463
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,060
He really had the highest office in the county. Right now.

464
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:07,860
He's just nothing.

465
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,260
They've dragged him. They pimped him out like a crack hole.

466
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,160
Or oh, yeah. Years ago, the coroners would refuse to

467
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,360
if it was a suicide and the sheriff or the police said it was not a suicide.

468
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:23,080
If he was murdered and the police said just to say, no, I'm not going to say

469
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:23,980
it's a suicide because it's not.

470
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,780
And they would, you know, honor him and whatever.

471
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:29,300
So they got rid of all the good corners and everybody that's in there now

472
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,300
is just a puppet. Right.

473
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,580
Well, that's why they also downgraded the requirements in most places

474
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,120
in the in in this place they call America.

475
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,460
People don't know this.

476
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,640
They're not even required to be doctors anymore.

477
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:40,800
Yeah, that's right.

478
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:45,220
You're supposed to have at least a graduate or doctorate to be.

479
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,800
In other words, it was the most respected.

480
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,680
He had the highest office.

481
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,860
Like, like, for example, he's a piece of trivia.

482
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:55,300
When you go to become a paramedic, EMT or you're going to drive

483
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,840
in one of those emergency vehicles that one of them in the test,

484
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,120
they tell you who has jurisdiction and they give you like police sheriff.

485
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,560
Right. Whatever.

486
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,060
And then postal police, you know, it's the postal police

487
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:08,020
have the highest jurisdiction, the federal postal police.

488
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,640
And then it's the yeah, then they're.

489
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,520
Yeah. So anyway, yeah, the coroner had, you know, had was the most respect

490
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:18,460
had the highest position really in the land and on the county level.

491
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,580
Right. And they've gotten rid of all that.

492
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,960
So now these government agencies like the GSA and all that

493
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,880
that used to be very respectable, you know,

494
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,620
they've been also trashed completely, just like the Treasury.

495
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,780
Right. We've been completely trashed.

496
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,940
There's just trash, trash, people, trash system.

497
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,540
It's just so secondary.

498
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,920
It's just a formality now doesn't even do anything anymore.

499
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,680
Has no honor and no, no, no teeth, no bite, no bark and no bite.

500
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,340
Well, see, I want to know something, though.

501
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,340
But, you know, as you go through all this, right,

502
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,160
because there is the Trump thing and OK, there's the court system

503
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,120
and how that actually functions. And what's the truth?

504
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,460
Yeah. This has to do with traffic tickets, too.

505
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,280
Yeah, there's nothing to do. I'm not talking.

506
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,040
I just wanted to bring up the fundamentals of it.

507
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:02,900
Don't of course. Yeah.

508
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,360
So when you hear someone been railroaded, he didn't do it.

509
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:08,200
It doesn't matter. It's the charges is administrative of the charges.

510
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,360
True. Was it right that he was charged with it?

511
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,000
Whether he did it or not is irrelevant, because now there's a debt

512
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,040
that has to be run through the system and bonded.

513
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,880
Right. In other words, here's another way.

514
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,900
That bridge that fell in the Delaware hit by a boat.

515
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,720
It doesn't matter if it was, you know, set up to do that or what.

516
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,920
Is the bridge there? No. Do we need a bridge? Yeah.

517
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,900
Yeah. Why it happened and whatever and who did it where.

518
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,140
Right. That's how the courts work.

519
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:39,820
Every you know, so basically when you say guilty means you're going to pay for it.

520
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,500
When you say not guilty is the charges are true, but you don't want to pay for it.

521
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,280
That's why they do, please.

522
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,740
Well, fair enough, except in the case of where you plead no contest,

523
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:55,920
which means, you know, no contest means that whoever can pay, step in and pay for it

524
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,880
should pay. You know, I hope someone comes in and pays for it for me.

525
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,300
Otherwise, I'll get stuck with the bill.

526
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,940
I'll have to wash dishes. OK, fair enough.

527
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,480
What I find interesting, though, is that this is a two pronged purpose.

528
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,460
You have the functionality of this system,

529
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:16,360
but also this is really just for TV.

530
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,260
This is made for TV. This is made for video content.

531
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,120
No, no. But I'm saying let's say it wasn't.

532
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,320
That's why I said I kept emphasizing here.

533
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,260
Right. Even a traffic ticket works this way.

534
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,960
Right. Yeah. Yeah.

535
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,180
So I just want to bring this up because that was in there.

536
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:33,400
And it seems like nothing can be done about it other than an appeal.

537
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,460
But people don't understand.

538
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,720
They understand like back in the days, cops were good

539
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,420
because they had Barney Fife and all these cop shows. Right.

540
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,660
And then they did the the court TV.

541
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:48,760
So they have several court justice shows even now running, I think, probably.

542
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,460
Until recently. Sure, sure.

543
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,860
Actually, not until recently.

544
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,200
People think that's how it goes.

545
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,300
No, no, I get it.

546
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,860
And that's the funny part about this is that, look, my spitting on the sidewalk

547
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,220
ticket or whatever that they decide to issue me.

548
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,920
Nobody wants to watch that on TV usually.

549
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,400
But since this is this, you know what I'm saying is

550
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,780
stuff they're showing you on TV and telling you in school is completely false.

551
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,140
Right. It's just like, you know, jet fuel doesn't disintegrate steel.

552
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,800
Right. It's a powder.

553
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,560
No, definitely not the powder.

554
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,620
No. Yeah.

555
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,860
Anyway. Yeah.

556
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:24,620
No, it's just to me, it's interesting that, you know, there's the other side of this,

557
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,920
which is how it's useful as content

558
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:32,080
and how it's useful to leverage everybody's emotional reactions to something.

559
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,480
Oh, you mean the case with Trump?

560
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,700
Yeah, they completely don't understand any of it.

561
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,300
I brought that from any saw that.

562
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,200
I know what's going on.

563
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,940
And it's like, you know, 99 percent of the people, if not 99.999999 percent

564
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,480
of people watching a Trump case will say it's just a show or whatever,

565
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,920
but they don't know how it really works.

566
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,460
What they showed with the Trump case is actually factual.

567
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:53,140
In other words, because that's how the system works.

568
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:58,460
But people, if you ask 99.999999, even law professors, they'll say,

569
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,540
oh, yeah, that was because it's a liberal judge and blah blah.

570
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,760
They're trying to railroad them.

571
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,040
You'll never mention.

572
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,140
That the administrator proceed.

573
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,900
It's an administrative court.

574
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:15,140
And it's a matter of there's no competency in law there.

575
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,500
The law is not competent to be brought in there.

576
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:25,640
They don't know that it's whether the charges are true, not whether he did it or not.

577
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,000
This is what I'm trying to say.

578
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:27,860
It sounds bizarre.

579
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:33,980
So the takeaway from all this stuff is when you're being charged with a crime and you

580
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:38,600
think you have a strong evidence and a not guilty plea, it has nothing.

581
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,300
That's a show.

582
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,380
That's the real show, even if it's a traffic ticket, right?

583
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,120
Any plea.

584
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:45,740
Here's the thing.

585
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,700
You could find this in the Administrative Procedures Act.

586
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,640
I don't know about online.

587
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:54,440
Any plea entered into a case is admitting the charges are true.

588
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,740
You're screwed.

589
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,600
And this is how the system works.

590
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,660
And people, just like banks, banking, right?

591
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:08,680
If you get, I don't know if you were, we were speaking out there early on in 2019, 2020,

592
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:15,020
when they started 2021 sending checks out, I said that if you get a $1,000 check from

593
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,380
the government, you're going to pay for that.

594
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,580
It's going to cost you more than $10,000 in the next five years in inflation.

595
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,160
That's what I kept telling people.

596
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:22,700
Oh, yeah.

597
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,860
Someone in the car washed it.

598
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,780
If you, for every dollar that you get from the government for as a stimulus, it's going

599
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,140
to cost you $10 later.

600
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,140
Is it worth?

601
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:30,820
That's terrible.

602
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:31,980
It's terrible.

603
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:36,340
Even compound Warren Buffett, you know how Warren Buffett makes his money is by weighting

604
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,140
compound interest.

605
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:37,480
Right.

606
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:37,780
Right.

607
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:42,320
He makes his money by waiting 20, 30, 40 years to get a return.

608
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,740
And that's how compound interest works.

609
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:50,540
$1,000 invested, actually $10,000 invested in 40 years becomes over half a million.

610
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:51,820
Right.

611
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:57,860
So if you're investing $10,000 a year in your 20s, by the time you're 65, you'll have several

612
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,760
million dollars.

613
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:03,480
And you can afford, you know, working 50, 70, $80,000 a year job.

614
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,200
You can do that.

615
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,160
Right.

616
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:05,660
It's.

617
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,120
Yeah.

618
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:12,360
So, boy, putting $200 a week away in your 20s would make you a millionaire when you when

619
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:16,080
you're in your 60s, multimillionaire, just simply by compounding.

620
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:16,760
Right.

621
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,160
You have to know how to do it.

622
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,460
I'm using the index and all that.

623
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:27,580
But OK, so what I'm trying to say here is that whenever there is a case about law, that's

624
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,140
how it works.

625
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,020
And also, just like the money, people don't understand.

626
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,080
It sounds bizarre.

627
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:37,180
If I went in public and started telling people we're under credit based and right.

628
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,960
And if the government wants to create a lot of money, they send you a check.

629
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:44,200
And when you sign the check, it becomes 10 times or nine times face value.

630
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,060
They give you whatever's on the check and they split the rest with the bank.

631
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,300
And that's how they create money.

632
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,180
That sounds absolutely bizarre.

633
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,220
And what I'm telling you is exact.

634
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,760
It's already printed in the Federal Reserve manual.

635
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,020
You could look it up yourself.

636
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:55,680
Right.

637
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:56,640
No, it's so.

638
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,080
Yeah.

639
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:00,640
The whole concept that it does appear out of thin air is true.

640
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:04,040
It's just that the way it's created is not.

641
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:04,280
Yeah.

642
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,420
But there has to be.

643
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,440
They have their own internal auditing.

644
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:11,800
So they try to stick to accountability.

645
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,300
And most of it is accountable.

646
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,000
That's why they have the IRS and big again, Warren Buffett's company as a you know, the

647
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,700
IRS is a money laundering operation.

648
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:24,220
I don't think you most people know it is that they just see it as the tax man.

649
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,800
It has nothing to do with that.

650
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:31,220
It's when they want to move funds to create, let's say, overthrow a government.

651
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,240
They move it through the IRS.

652
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:32,720
Right.

653
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:35,280
No one's going to say, hey, look, they moved this money through the IRS.

654
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:35,640
Right.

655
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:36,560
Anyway.

656
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:42,000
So this is it's bizarre, but it's true.

657
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:42,500
That's what I'm saying.

658
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,900
This the Greek speak stuff is super effective.

659
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:49,400
If I can get on a flying saucer and get to another end of the solar system or another

660
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,540
galaxy, maybe people eat it up.

661
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:55,560
Don't be like, holy shit, we were really waiting for a simple explanation on how this

662
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:55,820
works.

663
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:01,480
But if you try to do this here where it's happening, crickets, it doesn't really work.

664
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,460
It doesn't have much impact.

665
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,780
But the whole thing is whoever's listening can understand it.

666
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,340
I think I dropped a lot of detail on this one.

667
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,900
So it might be worth listening to again, if you're interested in jotting down some notes

668
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,060
and looking up a bunch of stuff like that.

669
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,980
You know, by the way, when we're on a sonic and I say, Chuck, punch that into the Internet,

670
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:18,580
what do you get?

671
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:23,180
That's a that's a hint that see what's online because it's just not that it makes it more

672
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,700
real because the Internet is alive.

673
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:28,980
Right. You know that digitizing a book is no longer that book that was digitized.

674
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:33,820
It's the digital version, which means whatever can anything can be put in and taken out.

675
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,560
Well, it's what I call the digital book burning.

676
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,940
And you can either do it a sentence at a time or you can eliminate the whole thing either

677
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,940
way or just alter it so that it's still under the same label.

678
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:45,120
People go looking for something that they think was there and they find out, guess

679
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,680
what? Oh, Mandela effect.

680
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,800
It must be. No, they changed it.

681
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:53,460
Well, it's the end of the cosmic editing of the Mandela effect is real.

682
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:56,320
Yes. But when you start over applying it.

683
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,280
Right. Right.

684
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,620
Well, it's just like anything else.

685
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:02,080
Look. And the funny thing is, a lot of people think this might be exclusive to the American

686
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,140
system. This is not.

687
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:07,880
This is a global system, even since the 30s and especially after the 50s.

688
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:11,880
Oh, yeah. And look, it took them a little while to figure it out in the communist world

689
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:16,480
there for a moment. But, you know, when Vladimir Putin, Putin took over Russia, what did he

690
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,220
do with the oligarch that complained?

691
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,860
He charged him with tax evasion and stuck him in prison.

692
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,000
I mean, and it was it was for a penny.

693
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,520
It was for nothing.

694
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,420
And what was he complaining about?

695
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:31,620
You have to show something, a penny, a stamp or a stamp is even worse.

696
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,020
Oh, yeah. Because Russia stamps are very important.

697
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:37,460
Yeah. Like if you stole a stamp, it's like 30 years in prison, you know, in Russia.

698
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:41,360
Yeah. I mean, you know, that's almost like getting your hand cut off in some other places.

699
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,400
But yeah, people don't know that years ago stamps were very important.

700
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,500
Not anymore. But anyway.

701
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,920
So, yeah, I agree.

702
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,160
This is a yeah.

703
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,240
This is what's going on on this planet.

704
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,260
And no one's going to change it, but you can weaken it and you can affect the change.

705
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,320
OK, so if everybody stopped using the banking system, right?

706
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:01,900
Yeah.

707
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,440
For just three days, just which is palatable.

708
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,260
You can do that because people stop doing things on a three day weekend.

709
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,600
Don't they want to that they normally do?

710
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:14,400
Right. They go on their three day weekends that are like a big deal.

711
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:20,280
Yeah. Look, you could literally get away with not doing anything except breathing for three

712
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,300
days. Almost anything in your life.

713
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:22,540
Whatever.

714
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,160
That's right. Especially if eating and drinking.

715
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:24,700
That's right.

716
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,400
If you don't want to eat, you don't want to drink.

717
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,160
You could do anything except breathing.

718
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,660
Breathing is the only thing that's true.

719
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,300
If you were locked up in a box.

720
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,600
Yeah. What do they call it?

721
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,680
The box in the southern prisons where they put you in the hole.

722
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:35,940
Yeah.

723
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:36,900
Whatever. Yeah.

724
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,280
OK, so you can live there for.

725
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:38,900
Yeah, definitely.

726
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:39,800
Three days.

727
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:42,440
Anybody can do three days without anything.

728
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:48,400
Yeah. Right now the system is set up to do be able to handle billions of transactions per hour.

729
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:53,980
And just like anything, there's but you look computers buffer in the handle and they stream

730
00:33:53,980 --> 00:34:00,180
and do that. If that's if that goes down to near zero instead of billions of transactions per hour,

731
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:05,000
the thing will not the analog, the the what do you call it?

732
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:13,320
The when a computer has a metric, what do we not the analog, the algorithm will shut itself down

733
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,620
because it'll think that something's disconnected and it'll say I'm broken.

734
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,320
You get it?

735
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:20,580
Exactly.

736
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,780
The algorithm will be because the algorithm with a is just networking with algorithms.

737
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:29,219
Right. And the algorithms that people call it is going to shut the thing down.

738
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,580
Now, can anyone shut it down?

739
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:36,900
No. But if you get the thing to passively shut down on its own, what's better than that?

740
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,480
That's like amazing.

741
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,600
Right. That's like beyond Neo and the Matrix.

742
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,080
Right.

743
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:41,760
Exactly.

744
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,920
So, yeah, and it's so simple to do.
