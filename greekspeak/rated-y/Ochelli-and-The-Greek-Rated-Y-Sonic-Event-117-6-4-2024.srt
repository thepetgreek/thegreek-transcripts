1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:12,960
The sonic event 117, 117, yep, that's where we're at.

2
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,960
Greek, how are you feeling this evening?

3
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,640
Okay, I got about 20 minutes or so.

4
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,640
Let's see if the voice holds up.

5
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:21,240
Excellent.

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,640
Well, I sure hope it does.

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,560
Look, a lot of things need to be repeated, okay, because we're in a world of repetition,

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,700
which by the way, I want to ask you about that.

9
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:37,060
Anybody will tell you that, you know, in order to retrain people, in order to educate somebody,

10
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,880
in order to teach somebody something, there's always a certain amount of repetition.

11
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:46,360
I've noted that there are people who do see things, hear things once and can retain them

12
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,740
perfectly, but that's not the majority.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,020
What are your thoughts on that?

14
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,860
I have a lot of thoughts on that, but not just that.

15
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,640
It's not just that.

16
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,460
It ties into a lot of other things, like, you know, we've gone through previous discussions,

17
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:04,660
not everyone that looks human is human in a standard way, right?

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,240
Humans are very non-standard.

19
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,720
There is no human type.

20
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,060
You can say this is human.

21
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,880
There's a lot of downgrading, major downgrading.

22
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:20,500
It's been going on, let's say, for the past 1,500 years, and then you have the genetic

23
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:20,940
pools.

24
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,900
Recently, I saw a woman that looks, Asian woman.

25
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,140
She has some very old genetics that you won't see.

26
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:31,040
You'll only see on 300-year-old wood print blocks from Japan.

27
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:32,880
Very stark, right?

28
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,940
So you'll see these genetics.

29
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:43,660
I've been around Illuminati-type parties, I know a wealthy, very wealthy guy, a trustafarian.

30
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,380
For three generations of living off the same industrial money, and he introduced me to

31
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,020
some people on the Upper East Side.

32
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:58,760
These were very unusual, and he was very scared if anybody, don't talk to them, you know, or

33
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:04,080
if I did start a conversation, or they had a conversation with me, the person who introduced

34
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,820
me, I was very nervous.

35
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,480
What did he say?

36
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,760
Did he say anything, you know, whatever?

37
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:13,100
And they had, like, perfect genetics, perfectly symmetrical faces, perfect skin, they had

38
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,160
a mannerism about them.

39
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:19,520
So what I'm trying to say is when you, by the way, I'm not young and beautiful anymore,

40
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,260
but back then, I think her name was Angelica or something, she was a daughter of a baroness.

41
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:31,680
These are the kind of people that, anyway, she says, we like you because you're smart

42
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,600
and good-looking.

43
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,920
It turns out, like, you know, they invite people that are good-looking to entertain

44
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,920
the party, and these models, you know, I don't know if you ever talk to any models, not too

45
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,560
much upstairs, not because, you know, models, it's like blonde jokes, right?

46
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,500
Then you got the smart, geeky types that don't look good.

47
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:53,260
So when you have a combination of looks and smarts, you're very entertaining to them,

48
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:57,400
like a good circus pet, a well-groomed circus bear, I always give the circus bear analogy,

49
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:57,740
right?

50
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,860
Yeah, I got you.

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,620
Okay, so when you ask about memory, who has memory, and you can't just say some people

52
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:08,340
do and others don't, because I've been around superior human, you know, in other words,

53
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:13,320
where their gene pools are maintained at a superior level, you know, like, what do you

54
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:19,180
call it when you have, when you don't just breed with anybody, you control the breed,

55
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,260
the stock, right?

56
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,600
You come from this stock and you breed, you know, it's like racehorses or whatever, right?

57
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,260
Well, it's animal husbandry, I think they call that, don't they?

58
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,540
Yeah, yeah, they practice that, and, you know, if you've heard of the problems before where

59
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,480
they intermarry a little too much, they get really bad feet, and they sometimes are born

60
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,940
with Down syndrome and things like that.

61
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:42,240
Down syndrome is more of a chemical thing, alcohol, but, you know, they get severe foot

62
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,160
problems and other things.

63
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,140
But you start twisting the branches of the family tree a little too closely together,

64
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,880
and sometimes you got some bad results.

65
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:50,880
No, that's true.

66
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,500
And I gotta say, there is a difference in beauty, right?

67
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,160
Back when I was, you know, there was a time, Greek, believe it or not, I was younger, and

68
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,380
mine wasn't maybe beautiful, but I was a lot better looking.

69
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:08,160
And I dated one of the cheerleaders for one of the professional football teams, now that's

70
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,080
a grade level above the average local beauty, right?

71
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,700
Usually, yeah.

72
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,320
Yeah, usually.

73
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,579
But it's not necessarily the professional.

74
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:18,839
But now it could be a guy, who knows, right?

75
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,380
Yeah, now you don't know what the hell you're getting.

76
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:21,880
They gotta let guys on there, don't they?

77
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,360
Okay, or, wait a minute, excuse me, let's be correct.

78
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,560
We have to let people or humans on there, and we don't get to ask about what their gender

79
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:29,760
is.

80
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,100
Oh, no fags and no lesbians, oh my gosh.

81
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,760
No dykes and no fags, oh shit.

82
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,860
Remember those days?

83
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,140
Well, at least dykes and fags.

84
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:42,360
If someone looked at you the wrong way, he's a fag, right, or whatever, or she's a dyke.

85
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:51,120
But anyway, yeah, no, this is all, look, the same people that make the conservative movement

86
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,360
make this stuff too, right?

87
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,360
It's a pig farm.

88
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,020
Let me just interject.

89
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:55,760
Sure.

90
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:01,640
When I say, I call people little piggies when I'm out in public, and I say, is this what

91
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,040
all the little piggies are into now?

92
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,280
You're like from out of store and something's fashionable, you know?

93
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:05,740
Right.

94
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:11,100
Now, the thing is, if you're listening, most likely you're not one of these little piggies.

95
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,660
But to presume that you're not on a pig farm is a big mistake.

96
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,760
You are on a pig farm.

97
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,200
But you could be a wild pig, right?

98
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,060
You could be a more feral sort of, you know, a pig in more of its natural environment.

99
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:28,060
Right, and they, by the way, pigs have their reputation in captivity, and I think I've

100
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:28,880
mentioned this before.

101
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,320
They're fairly clean.

102
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,780
Actually, they're pretty clean when they're in the wild because they're constantly moving,

103
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,420
just like sharks, you know, and tuna.

104
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:35,900
Right.

105
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,940
They're constantly moving.

106
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:37,360
Right.

107
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,760
So they piss and shit on the go, and that's why they're always pretty clean.

108
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,660
They get a reputation of being as they are when they're in captivity.

109
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,600
So humans in captivity probably suffer similar traits.

110
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,060
Well, that's what I was just about to bring up, is that, you know, if you realize that,

111
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:59,400
you know, maybe we are all little piggies in one way or another, those of us-

112
00:05:59,400 --> 00:05:59,720
Speak for yourself.

113
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,940
I like to avoid this swine category.

114
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:06,000
Well, but those of- I know you do, because you're not what you eat, or maybe you are,

115
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,020
but you know, and therefore there's no fork on your fork, so you couldn't be pork.

116
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,120
Well, you'd be what you ate, yeah.

117
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,140
You'd be what you ate.

118
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,000
But the thing is, it-

119
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,460
Oh, speaking of which, you sent me a thing about the category of calories in food recently,

120
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,060
a link, right?

121
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,740
Was it-

122
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,700
I wanted to give you-

123
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,800
Ooh, Smith Peters or whatever?

124
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:26,380
Yeah, I wanted to give you a laugh as we hear from- Is that Ivan in the background, by the

125
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:26,480
way?

126
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,460
No, no, it's another one.

127
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,040
Oh, okay.

128
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:29,660
Callie.

129
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,060
She's a calico.

130
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,720
Calico.

131
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:32,220
Callie.

132
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:32,880
She's casual.

133
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,340
Callie.

134
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,920
We have a colony of- It's called Colony 9.

135
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,020
We have 10 cats.

136
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:37,960
But they're not indoor.

137
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:42,780
We tell people, you know, it's like the crazy person starter kit, crazy cat person starter

138
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,020
kit.

139
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,440
That's the professional kit, right?

140
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:44,800
The 10?

141
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:45,400
Yeah.

142
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,260
But they're outdoor, you know?

143
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,860
But they're free to come in and out.

144
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:54,780
We have a doggy door that they use, and when the weather is pleasant, you don't see them

145
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,260
around at all, just for feeding.

146
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,780
Even feeding times, they come in one by one.

147
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:05,860
But yeah, cats are people, too, and I tell people, be wary of cats, because I've noticed

148
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:10,080
several things about them on a mental level that there's a good chance that they're here

149
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,600
to monitor us, by the way.

150
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,840
Anyway, that's another discussion.

151
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,720
Well, I wondered that about dogs, but then again, I'm more of a dog person, so I didn't

152
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,640
No, dogs are too pathetic.

153
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,940
Dogs can be very pathetic at times.

154
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,640
But I love them.

155
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,320
No, no, no, but cats never are pathetic.

156
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:33,800
But dogs get pathetic, and I mean, I love dogs as well, but no, it's on a different

157
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,180
level.

158
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,640
So I'd say, yeah, back just to sum up things, yeah, let's not even get into the calories.

159
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,560
We've talked about that.

160
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:45,720
My answer to you was, yeah, it's all the Greek-speak stuff pans out somewhere, right?

161
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,200
You'll find what I'm saying is, this time.

162
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:54,040
I sent that to you to hope that you would get a lap out of it, actually, because I wanted

163
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,340
to show you where they were giving this big credit to somebody creating the idea of calories

164
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:03,760
and making it so much better for everyone's health back in 1918.

165
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,780
No, it's invalid, because unless you're pooping charcoal.

166
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,240
Yeah, no, absolutely, and we've gone over this.

167
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:09,440
It's invalid.

168
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,600
It doesn't even approximate what's going on with health.

169
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,780
I just thought it was comical, that Smithsonian, that institution.

170
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,400
It's all quackery.

171
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:22,200
You know, I think I've mentioned, I have a plot of all the doctor's offices and hospitals,

172
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,860
and I have earplugs, because if I don't put the earplugs in while I'm driving by, the

173
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,360
quacking is so loud, my ears ring for about a week.

174
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:34,059
Well, I used to love when you told me, you'd ask doctors, can I purchase one of these machines

175
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:34,480
somewhere?

176
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm going to start a museum.

177
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,320
Oh, one of the pharmacies, yeah.

178
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,600
I'd ask them, where do I get one of these blood pressure machines?

179
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,720
You know, like, I don't know where you rent them, and I said, why?

180
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:46,320
They always ask me why I want one, because I'm opening a museum of medical fakery and

181
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,980
quackery, and this is going to be one of the prime exhibits.

182
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:49,640
Right.

183
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,720
And none of them says, yeah, get out of here, you're crazy.

184
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,580
They're all like, wow.

185
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,400
Sometimes when you get them at the end of their shift, if you're at the top of the hour,

186
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,580
sometimes they change shifts, and they followed me, and they're like, why did you say that?

187
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:04,520
I'm like, oh my gosh, I'll tell you the whole thing right now if you've got time.

188
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,060
Well, you've got to do that and display drills where they would drill holes in people's heads.

189
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,700
By the way, have you ever read the contract?

190
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,080
You know, people get chemotherapy, they put you on a schedule, you go every two weeks

191
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,500
or whatever.

192
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,480
Yeah, I've seen that.

193
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:15,660
Right?

194
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:20,340
You know, it's like every time you go, you have to sign this thing, it's like 15 pages

195
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:20,660
long.

196
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,320
You ever read that?

197
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,500
No, I haven't personally, no.

198
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,760
Oh my gosh.

199
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:32,120
It tells you basically that it's all experimental, we could inject you with toilet water from

200
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,780
Chernobyl, and you're doing this all on your own behest, even though there's no proof that

201
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,440
it works.

202
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:39,860
You remember?

203
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,040
Yeah, yeah.

204
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:41,920
Oh my gosh.

205
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:45,560
So it's similar to the forms they made me sign when they were experimenting on my eyes

206
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,180
when I was a kid then, because that did happen.

207
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,520
Yeah, it's all quackery.

208
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,160
Because there's a whole thing about, look, we don't know if this will work, if it does.

209
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:57,940
We agree to give you this stuff even, if you like, I mean, because I was a test subject.

210
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,940
Okay, look, it's not like the people I was talking about before, they completely despise

211
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,360
the public.

212
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:02,880
And you know what?

213
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,960
I do too in many ways.

214
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:10,900
And they would love to just eliminate any medical care, but what would happen if they

215
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,700
made any medical care illegal, well, it would sound too unreasonable because other places

216
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,220
would not.

217
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,940
And it would sound too unreasonable, and also it would foster a black market or people doing

218
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:20,680
it on their own.

219
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,540
That's true.

220
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,280
Yeah, and that would not make it inferior.

221
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,860
That would actually make it far superior.

222
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,900
And they don't want that.

223
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,200
So I said, let's maintain control of the medical.

224
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,780
Which is, by the way, the same reasoning by which big pharma exists in order to supply

225
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,880
people with drugs, because here's the problem.

226
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,620
If we did not have a drug industry to do that, guess what?

227
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,620
We'd have pharmaceuticals that really work.

228
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:42,880
Yeah.

229
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,340
People would figure out the real way and get the good drugs.

230
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,140
That's right.

231
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,240
So it's all a distraction.

232
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:53,700
And, you know, and but they do have, you know, they still have procedures like micro surgeries.

233
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,120
Right.

234
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:58,780
You know, years ago, I remember when I was young, that technology was just coming around

235
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:03,740
that if your finger was lopped off or you lost an appendage, you put it in a brown paper

236
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,920
bagging it to the hospital.

237
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,780
Chances are they could sew it back on.

238
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,800
That was going on when I was a child.

239
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,100
Right.

240
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:09,600
Yes.

241
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,280
Where before the people older than me, when I was a child, they didn't have such a recommendation

242
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,320
or a possibility.

243
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,540
Well, when I was four years old, I severed my pinky down to just about the skin being

244
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,000
the only thing it was hanging from.

245
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,000
And in the past, before the 70s, that would have just been a dead, dead finger.

246
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:28,580
They would have just.

247
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,840
Well, sorry, that's gone.

248
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,480
But they say.

249
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,480
So they do offer.

250
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,700
So it's a mixed bag.

251
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:40,100
It's a really mixed bag of offering some things that are fairly valuable, more in the trauma

252
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:40,680
situation.

253
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,140
But even then, I've been in several trauma situations and they just have people sit there

254
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:50,540
where if they just applied an immediate within the first 15 minutes, something they would

255
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,400
recover much quicker.

256
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,160
I've gone into ICU intensive care unit and did therapy.

257
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,260
They let me do therapy on someone and they went home the next day.

258
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,660
They went home from ICU, which is unheard of.

259
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,320
And the head of the medical there was like, I need you here.

260
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,280
And I said, are you kidding?

261
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,640
And he's a famous here in Tucson.

262
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:08,960
Easy.

263
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:15,220
Remember when the congresswoman and the judge got shot and oh, yeah, Obama came to Tucson

264
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:15,960
and did the speech.

265
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,400
Well, the surgeon, the chief surgeon also did a speech.

266
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,600
He was hanging out with Obama.

267
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,320
That guy says, I need you here in the trauma center.

268
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,580
And I said, I'm not a doctor.

269
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,900
He says, oh, don't worry about that.

270
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,420
So, you know, you could take it two ways.

271
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:35,260
One is the guy would pull strings and have me, you know, give me a fake degree, but they're

272
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,740
all in a way or he'd get a little deeper and says, let's get rid of this guy because we

273
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,740
got one of these guys.

274
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,040
Right.

275
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,200
So the whole thing, I want nothing to do.

276
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:47,580
You know, I've said before, if everybody wants together and make paradise on earth to let

277
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,200
them have it, I want nothing to do with it.

278
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,100
If they want to get together and start killing each other, let them have it.

279
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,360
I want nothing to do with it either.

280
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,980
So you just got to do.

281
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,640
That's why I said the last time on Greek speak, you know, what got you here to Greek speak

282
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,640
ain't going to get you there.

283
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:04,540
In other words, if you're hearing stuff, whatever, you got to do it.

284
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:11,040
This is a very, how do you say, pragmatic DIY is you got to do it.

285
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:16,080
You know, just like the fellow recently, I think I mentioned he asked for pictures.

286
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,200
You know, he said, you know, I find I heard you a while back talk about use black shoe

287
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,360
polish on the car.

288
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,600
And he sent me pictures.

289
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,720
I was like, God damn, that car is bright.

290
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,320
I mean, it was black, but like deep black.

291
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,160
I was like, yeah, that's that's shoe polish.

292
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,740
You should get that.

293
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,180
Well, only with shoe polish sounds ghetto.

294
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,200
But yeah.

295
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,900
So yeah, what got you here ain't going to get you there with Greek speak.

296
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,100
In other words, you got to do it.

297
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:44,400
That's why if I had my druthers, if you're not like a tinkerer or an inventor or, you

298
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,040
know, into doing and making stuff, you don't really don't belong in a Greek speak thing.

299
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:52,600
You know, you got to get unless, hey, unless I'm a good circus bear and entertain you,

300
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,260
because I've got so much stuff that you can make your life better with.

301
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,200
But you got to do it.

302
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,020
Like, you know, 99 percent of the stuff I talk about, you can't go down to the store

303
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:01,860
and get it.

304
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,080
Right.

305
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,720
But you can go down to the store and buy the stuff to make it.

306
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:05,980
Right.

307
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,520
Well, very much like, you know, the the the silver.

308
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,000
Right.

309
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,180
Oh, my goodness.

310
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:11,720
What is that?

311
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,660
Aqueous Argentum.

312
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,220
I believe.

313
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,920
Because it's not colloidal silver.

314
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,120
You know, there's no silver in the solution.

315
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,700
And it works better than when you do have silver because of the reasons we've discussed.

316
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,120
So because of water, because of the water.

317
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,440
So which, by the way, that was one of the most innovative things about when they saved

318
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,300
my finger that I remember again.

319
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,320
I was four years old.

320
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:30,720
Right.

321
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,340
That is.

322
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,540
Well, no, not the silver.

323
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:32,780
I see.

324
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:38,360
I don't I didn't get that detail, but their use of fluids and very minimal.

325
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,360
But people would think, oh, there must have been all sorts of extensive stitching.

326
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,440
And no, that's exactly how you just pull something together.

327
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,320
That's not a medical story.

328
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,700
It is a very recent thing.

329
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,100
Yeah.

330
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:52,560
So but no, they're going away from that, by the way, more and more.

331
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:52,880
Yeah.

332
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:57,140
And matter of fact, if you take a look, it's more like people are using glue and indeed

333
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:01,480
you're better off sometimes using crazy glue than you are going through the issue of stitching.

334
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,140
Yeah.

335
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:02,780
Yeah.

336
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,060
The acryl cyanide stuff.

337
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:05,460
Yeah.

338
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,220
There's a variety.

339
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,620
There's an organic acryl cyanide that you can get.

340
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,900
Oh, no, there's better things.

341
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,400
But what I'm saying, what's easily readily available in a pinch is definitely, you know,

342
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,480
your various varieties.

343
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,040
Yeah.

344
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:21,100
One of the things about Greek speak is, you know, it's about the biological vacuum, right?

345
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,060
Yeah.

346
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:26,960
So when you get a cut, the body knows it's the body and the brain.

347
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,520
It's like, oh, I'm cut.

348
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,420
It says we're losing vacuum full.

349
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,000
Right.

350
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,000
So you've got to create the environment.

351
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:33,380
Right.

352
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:37,080
And prevent the things that usually happen when you don't.

353
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:43,880
But again, we got a message a while back where someone had a sore and that, you know,

354
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,380
sore that developed for the body to expel something.

355
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:46,860
Yeah.

356
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:51,800
By the way, I want to bring this up because I do recommend using ginger compresses when

357
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,400
the body wants to expel something.

358
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:54,080
Ginger.

359
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,320
Yeah.

360
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,180
Warm ginger.

361
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,240
What you do is you slice or grate the ginger and put it in very hot water or in a pot.

362
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:06,360
But don't let it even just barely come to a simmer or bring the water to a simmer slight

363
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,280
and then turn it off and then put the ginger in.

364
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,180
So in other words, 140 degree water.

365
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:10,760
OK.

366
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,920
And you wrap a cloth like you do a compress.

367
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,180
Or you could put the slight ginger slices over the area.

368
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,840
Now, it'll pull something to the surf.

369
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,320
Something wants to come to the surface.

370
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,880
It'll make it come to the surface 10 times faster.

371
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:27,380
Now, if you put ginger, it could also be dangerous.

372
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,680
If you put ginger.

373
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,700
Let's say you've got a sore on your arm or a sore on your leg.

374
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,640
Left arm, left leg, whichever.

375
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,380
And you think that something wants to come out of your body.

376
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,100
An abscess, a boil, something.

377
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:41,700
Yeah.

378
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:42,980
A rash.

379
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:43,900
Yeah.

380
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,900
If you apply the ginger compress or the thin ginger slices and wrap it.

381
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:54,060
And within 15 minutes, you see the location of where the sore is or the area that you're addressing.

382
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,620
Towards your heart.

383
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,200
That area will start swelling and hurting.

384
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,420
Remove the ginger and apply cold water.

385
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,360
Don't do it again.

386
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:10,160
OK, let's say you have a sore on your on your shin, on your left leg, midpoint from your ankle to your knee.

387
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,140
Give a visual.

388
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:22,420
And if you put ginger on it and you start seeing the part of the skin, the shin between the sore and your knee swell up and going higher because it's towards your heart.

389
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:22,719
Right.

390
00:17:22,719 --> 00:17:23,599
It's going toward your heart.

391
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:23,819
Yeah.

392
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:24,460
Yeah.

393
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,520
That means that your body's rejecting it.

394
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:29,120
And it's like, no fool, that's that's not what we need.

395
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:35,520
But we're not sensitive enough to understand when or what you know, when to apply the ginger or not.

396
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,780
The only thing I would say is, you know, it will draw things to the surface.

397
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:47,840
But if you do see that swelling within the first five, 10, 15 minutes, that means that ginger is not a viable remedy for that condition.

398
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:57,960
Now, if you do have a sore, a boil, whatever, and you want to draw it to the surface and you apply it and that condition does not happen, a very dark, you know, very red swelling area.

399
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,620
And it's funny how it always moves towards the heart.

400
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,160
Right.

401
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:01,580
Right.

402
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,540
It is a viable solution if you don't get that swelling.

403
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:12,360
Now, the reason I'm saying this, there are people that read about ginger compresses and things and they do get that red swelling and whatever.

404
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,180
And they're like, oh, that's just detoxing.

405
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:14,380
Right.

406
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:21,420
They keep doing it and they end up with a pretty bad infection, which is not the body just trying to release something.

407
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:25,500
But now it's creating an infection, which means, you know, more systems are breaking down.

408
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,740
So I just want to give that warning also because there's a whole you know, here's the thing.

409
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:38,620
If I get myself together enough, I could sit down and do eight hours worth of sonics on remedies and applications.

410
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,280
But we'd have to go categorically.

411
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,460
This is what you do for liver.

412
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,540
This is what you do for eyes.

413
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,320
This is what you do for skin.

414
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,680
This is what you do for this condition.

415
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:56,140
You know, it's really hard to bring up, you know, what I've discovered since the early 80s and been working on in just casual sonics that we do, unless we do one specifically on remedies.

416
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:56,480
Right.

417
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,180
Which kind of talked about it before, but it's such a broad topic.

418
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,040
It's like Greek do a sonic on remedies.

419
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:02,960
Remedies for what?

420
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,300
So many parts of the body and so many conditions to address.

421
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,420
I mean, it's like eight hours just to outline.

422
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,180
Well, right.

423
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:19,120
But aside from that eight hours, I was trying to think if there was a way that you could condense it into like, you know, here is a Greek speak first aid kit, real first aid kit of sorts.

424
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,880
You know, yeah, we've done it in little pieces.

425
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,600
But the thing we have done down is really, you know, like you said, you are what you eat.

426
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,700
You are what you ate.

427
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,260
Yes.

428
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:30,640
I did give the natural approach, which is whole grains and greens.

429
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:35,400
And the greens would be the cabbage, lettuce, broccoli variety.

430
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,960
Those are all cabbage, by the way.

431
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,740
Broccoli is a variety of cabbage.

432
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,360
And then you have the chards and other things.

433
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:47,140
When you get to spinach and mustard, those get kind of intense and they could actually throw you off balance.

434
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,240
Whole grains would be any whole grain.

435
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:49,880
You pick it.

436
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:50,860
It's fine.

437
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,520
But each one has a different quality, like barley as a wet quality.

438
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,860
Oats have a wet quality.

439
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,860
And buckwheat and millet are drying and rice is in the middle.

440
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:05,560
Well, and at all times, you should try to get stuff that is grown locally to you because.

441
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,560
Yeah, you could.

442
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,840
But let me just say this.

443
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,240
When I say, let's say barley and oats have a wet quality.

444
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,260
What do I mean by that?

445
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,080
Well, yeah, they actually when you cook them, they require quite a bit of water.

446
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,120
They hold quite a bit of water.

447
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,760
You ever heard of people get a condition called bloating when they eat certain things?

448
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,400
They look fat.

449
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,180
Oh, yeah.

450
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:21,980
Yeah.

451
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:28,340
OK, so if you have a bloat, if your tendency to bloat, put on weight real fast, you eat oats and barley.

452
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,060
Boy, oh, boy, are you going to blow up?

453
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:37,080
Now, let's say you're of a tendency to bloat and you want to slim down, do buckwheat or brown rice or millet.

454
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,980
And that will contract you.

455
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:39,420
Right.

456
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,460
So they're very drying.

457
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:41,660
You see.

458
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,260
So you have that aspect as well.

459
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,540
But you have to understand the category also.

460
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,840
Let's say you run into a grain that you've never that's not categorized something new that you have to know how to.

461
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,540
See what kind of a grain it is.

462
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,900
You know, so if you look at buckwheat and millet, it's very small.

463
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,620
Where oats and barley is very large, more yin.

464
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:58,880
Right.

465
00:20:59,060 --> 00:20:59,220
Right.

466
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,840
You see, for me, I'm not familiar with millet, to be honest with you.

467
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,700
Very, very small.

468
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,240
Oh, by the way, here's something that worked.

469
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,440
People have decided someone just had a baby.

470
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:10,200
You know, when someone tells me they're going to have a baby, I'm like, what do you think?

471
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,320
You're breeding the next Messiah.

472
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,540
How dare you make more children?

473
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,480
That's you know, here's the thing.

474
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,080
The way you change the system is everybody gets.

475
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,420
We're not having any more babies.

476
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:22,080
It's like the pigs on the pig farm saying we're not going to breed anymore.

477
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:22,460
What do you think?

478
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,180
Pig farmers get really nervous.

479
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,180
Right.

480
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,800
So because you're being commoditized, you are the commodity.

481
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:33,240
So if you say publicly we're doing a baby boycott, they'll say, what do you want?

482
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,620
What do you want?

483
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,720
You know, I'm serious.

484
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,700
This is very simple.

485
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:45,380
But basically with the babies and all that, they get earaches because most parents don't know how to feed their children.

486
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:45,680
Right.

487
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,500
They give them a variety of what they're eating.

488
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:48,540
Right.

489
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,340
So they get these terrible earaches, ear infections.

490
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:51,720
Right.

491
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:59,240
A really good remedy for an ear infection in most cases, which typically happens when the weather is getting cold.

492
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,720
Figure that is you roast some millet in a pan.

493
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:12,400
And while while you're roasting it, it gets hot to the point where you could smell the millet oil, that grainy, you know, like the fresh popcorn popping.

494
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:12,740
Right.

495
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,220
Yeah.

496
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:18,640
Smell and immediately you funnel it into a cotton sock or blend.

497
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:32,360
It's really hard to get cotton socks and to tie it off and put that hot millet roasted millet that's in a sock or a towel over the ear, you know, and lay down at least 20 minutes or so and repeat that a few times.

498
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,640
And then your infection goes away.

499
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:41,940
Something about the millet, the hot roasted millet oil, that seems to be a fantastic remedy for those kind of sinus canal.

500
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,240
When I said ear infection, you know, that's all sinus, right?

501
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,200
Well, this would also work for a sinus type situation.

502
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:56,560
Absolutely true. But, you know, I want to caution people about something, and that is that too often it became so commonplace to say ear infection.

503
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,840
There's an earache with babies because they couldn't speak exactly.

504
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,580
They could communicate, but they are not speaking.

505
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,280
It's misdiagnosed, you're saying.

506
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,700
Yeah, it's quite often misdiagnosed.

507
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,080
I discovered that.

508
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,240
Yeah, sinuses most likely. It's because the body's losing vacuum again due to the intake.

509
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:11,700
Yeah.

510
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:12,460
Or conditions.

511
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:16,760
You just balance a few things out. Now, I don't know about millet. I never knew about that.

512
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:20,540
Yeah, I think we talked about it a few years back with, what's the little guy?

513
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,920
You got there, you had something like that. I suggested the millet.

514
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,520
Yeah, well, the thing is.

515
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,820
Frankie, right. I got a hold of a couple of things.

516
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:34,080
But the thing is, again, you must first evaluate the situation properly, okay?

517
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,460
And with babies.

518
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,660
Well, here's the thing.

519
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:37,980
Yeah.

520
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,820
You don't just evaluate the victim or the patient. You have to evaluate the entire environment.

521
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:48,360
So that's what I never liked about child's not feeling well, and they take the child to the doctor, right?

522
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,860
Because there's a doctor at the office.

523
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,180
Yeah.

524
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,900
You have to look at the environment also.

525
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,920
Which, by the way, you know you're dealing with a quack right away if they don't ask what the kid has been eating,

526
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,600
where the kid is staying, what the condition of the room is.

527
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,860
He's a state license.

528
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,100
He's a state license.

529
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,560
Thank you. You represent the best education government has to offer, right?

530
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,280
Yep. You're wonderful, and you're all great, and bye.

531
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,080
Speaking of which, I still interact with medical people.

532
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,560
Recently, I spoke to someone. She wants a scalerator.

533
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,360
I'm not shy about it.

534
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:23,340
I'm not offering any of my services to people in the legal field or medical field just as a personal boycott.

535
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,640
But that'll hurt me not then.

536
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,420
But if I get a million people to do it, then we get something to do.

537
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:32,520
But what I was talking about quackery, and she had no bones about that it is quackery,

538
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,440
and we talked about blood tests are quackery.

539
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:39,300
She goes, oh, yeah, blood tests are absolute quackery, and they require that, by the way.

540
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,020
Now, you go, we're going to do a blood test.

541
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,860
And I said, yeah, there's so many ways that it's quackery.

542
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,120
She just says, you know, when they go in in the morning at the lab,

543
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,180
they have to calibrate those blood test machines.

544
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,100
You know how they do it?

545
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,760
I'm like, no, I never heard of that.

546
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,900
She goes that the technicians use their own blood to calibrate each machine.

547
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:04,220
Okay, so here you got this, like, you know, fat, pimply, 23-year-old girl on birth control pills.

548
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,340
Her blood.

549
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,360
And then you got this other guy.

550
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,640
He's 42 years old, smokes a pack a day.

551
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,380
They use his blood on that machine.

552
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:12,500
Right?

553
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,600
I'm talking about, you know, I gave these discrepancies.

554
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,720
They don't sound very good.

555
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,040
Just to show you, there's a huge discrepancy in blood quality.

556
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,160
And they could be in the same medical park, by the way.

557
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,580
And they calibrate the machines randomly around.

558
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,720
It's such a fraud.

559
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,100
And it's amazing.

560
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,640
I like bringing this up.

561
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,940
You know, some people, oh, bring it, there might be a friend they work with.

562
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,640
I'm doing it to actually get them to confess.

563
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,800
And no one has been.

564
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:39,340
Once or twice, I run into someone that defends the system,

565
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:42,580
like a Freemason would defend the Brotherhood or whatever, the fraternity.

566
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,780
Not often, but they usually give up quite a bunch of stuff

567
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,700
that you would only know that if you were there.

568
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,180
And I appreciate that.

569
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,360
And of course, you know,

570
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,100
if we're doing Sonics,

571
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,140
I'm going to jump on here and mention it.

572
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:00,170
Absolutely.
