1
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:13,820
I think it's Sonic 117, but here we are, Greek. How are you? There you are.

2
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:20,380
Yeah, I'm here. Yeah, I just want to say I got really impressed by a fellow who sent me a PayPal,

3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,960
which I don't have by the way, it's just sitting there, and a message about what he's been up to.

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,820
And it's very rare that I get impressed.

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,140
And I say, well, I get impressed by a lot of stuff. By the way, have you noticed that people that you know,

6
00:00:31,159 --> 00:00:35,040
and don't know are getting dumber, by the way, and worse and worse?

7
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:39,960
Yeah, it's a little, you know, it's like they're a little worse today than they were yesterday,

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,740
but not as bad as they're going to be tomorrow, right?

9
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,940
Anyway, and I'm talking people you know, not strangers. Yeah, something going on.

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,740
And I want to talk about a few more things, but this fellow was not in that category at all.

11
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,840
He made a list of all the things I've discussed.

12
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,900
Many things that I've discussed that he's working on.

13
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,000
Quite impressive. Kudos to you.

14
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,080
And I reached, I just gave him my personal phone number if he needs anything.

15
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,140
This week is over. Super busy.

16
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,440
Sent me a PayPal for an hour's worth of my time.

17
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,840
And I don't have a PayPal account.

18
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:14,160
So this is what I want to, it's very simple. It's basically an email thing.

19
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:20,200
Someone, I brought this up about a year ago, and someone dropped a video about how to get into code.

20
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:26,240
I didn't get that video. I didn't get what, there's a thing on how to set up a PayPal account, right?

21
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:34,320
Okay, what I'm trying to do is a conditional endorsement where somewhere it's evidenced,

22
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,000
like if you were to open a bank account, they have a bank card that you sign.

23
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,660
Now it's done digitally, right?

24
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,460
You ask it for on paper for tax purposes.

25
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,320
They like it when it's for tax purposes, just to print it out.

26
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,440
And he says, well, we don't have it. Just go to the computer, press control P, right?

27
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,400
That's getting a little sarcastic.

28
00:01:51,680 --> 00:02:00,820
But what you do there is you want it on paper so you can give it back to them with your signature on paper with a conditional endorsement.

29
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,440
By the way, banks do blank contracts.

30
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,860
You know, whenever you sign anything on a bank, they take your signature and put it on things that you're not aware of.

31
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,120
They're allowed to do that, right?

32
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:16,000
Wells Fargo was busted a few years ago for opening a quarter of a million credit card accounts that were, you know.

33
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,080
Yeah, it seems like fraud to me, but yeah.

34
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,020
Yeah, well, it's unlawful. They're not lawful.

35
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,860
So fraud is something in law.

36
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,880
That's why if you go to any attorney regarding fraud, it's very hard to prove.

37
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:32,500
No, it's actually easy, but in the legal it's hard to prove because fraud has nothing to do with anything legal.

38
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,540
Everything legal is a presumption.

39
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,400
Fraud is where the law is competent, right?

40
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,480
And the law is not competent in the legal, right?

41
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,420
And the legal is not competent in law.

42
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,540
There's a problem, yeah.

43
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,060
Yeah, anyway, I was very impressed by this fellow.

44
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,000
Again, I don't know how many times I can say it.

45
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,960
I could just be here for another 20 minutes saying I'm impressed by this fellow.

46
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,060
And AM are his initials.

47
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:02,180
And what I'm asking for publicly, if anyone knows how I could pretty much, when you initially sign up for PayPal,

48
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,420
they want address or whatever information they want.

49
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:11,660
I need to stick in the verbiage lawful money only or demand for lawful money, 12 USC.

50
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,340
You got to put the 12 USC, 411.

51
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,720
This is so important.

52
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,660
A lot of people, I once talked to someone and I said, oh, you want to do that because you're afraid of the IRS, right?

53
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,700
I'm like, what?

54
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,660
That's so stupid, right?

55
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,800
You know, that's like someone that shouldn't be listening to Greek speak.

56
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:32,940
Well, can't you just put that out on the button so that when people enter or go to actually offer something?

57
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,120
No, stop.

58
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:34,680
You're not listening.

59
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,220
You're not listening.

60
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:35,560
Sorry.

61
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,820
Because the button is way after signing up to them.

62
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,780
You put the button, you put a bumper sticker on your car.

63
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,540
It's not going to help you with your bank account.

64
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,660
You have to do it at the initial signing point.

65
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,520
You have to show it at the beginning.

66
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,660
This is just a matter of being impeccable, right?

67
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,540
So most people will never get this, by the way.

68
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:04,600
So if anyone knows how to do that, because usually the easiest way to stick it in is the address columns,

69
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,020
the address areas where they ask you to put an address.

70
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,500
There's usually several fields.

71
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,400
Yeah, there's definitely a lot of fields you've got to fill out.

72
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,880
So maybe in one of the – is there a possibility that –

73
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,380
Yeah, but the AI checks it out in an algorithm that says that's not a legitimate address the moment you put lawful money,

74
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,820
only 12 U.S.C. 411.

75
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:25,580
Not because you wrote lawful money on it, it's just because it checks it against all the addresses.

76
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:31,160
Do you ever go to the post office and drop something off and you just put down the most rudimentary amount of information

77
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,540
that gives you all the other data that supports it?

78
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,300
There's networks that pull the data.

79
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,860
So if anyone knows how to manipulate – if there's a video personally wants to –

80
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,620
UncommonSenseRadio1 at gmail.com.

81
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,600
That's the number one, UncommonSenseRadio1 at gmail.com.

82
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,340
I need some help with it just – because once you do it, you can't undo it.

83
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,040
So yeah, I need some help to just start – I'm totally still – OK, totally against all this stuff.

84
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:05,580
One thing I wanted to go into is – did I mention I was very impressed by someone who sent me an email on the PayPal?

85
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,640
You certainly did.

86
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:14,780
So what I want to mention is what GreekSpeak does is it shows you very often –

87
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,860
by the way, did you want to add anything else to that, Chuck?

88
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,300
No, I'm just thinking about the problem and saying to myself, well, why not –

89
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,920
No, it's not a problem. It's a condition.

90
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,620
OK, the condition that you want to apply here.

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,580
That's right.

92
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:33,040
And I'm thinking to myself, why not just create a secondary situation where it comes out of this PayPal,

93
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,440
which it gets delivered there, whatever it is it is,

94
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:43,540
and then it gets delivered to something else that does take it in as a lawful transaction somewhere else,

95
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,140
and that way at the end of the transaction, it's clean. No?

96
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,400
Middleman, you can do that.

97
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,940
In New York, we knew a guy that ran – whose brother ran a bank.

98
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,520
They'll take any check.

99
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,840
He took 5 percent cash, any check for anyone, which was important if people were in the country.

100
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:02,360
Or you could actually get a check for selling someone a kilo of something.

101
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,580
You could actually pay you in a check because you don't care who they write it out to, right?

102
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,900
And the banks don't care anyway.

103
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,060
That's all Dog and Pony shows.

104
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,920
So anyway –

105
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,760
Even though they've ended –

106
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,820
The conditions –

107
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,800
Yeah, they've ended that –

108
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,380
That's a middleman.

109
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,460
What are you talking about is a middleman?

110
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,980
I already have several people that would do that, but this is direct to this email.

111
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,500
This is an email that I have control over, which is UncommonSenseRadio1 at Gmail.com.

112
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,240
Yeah, which means there's a way to set up a PayPal.

113
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,280
You can set up a PayPal with any email address,

114
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,820
but you're looking for a way to set it up so that automatically as soon as it enters into that –

115
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,520
It shows that there's a conditional endorsement.

116
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,740
This is very powerful, by the way.

117
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,220
I've seen a letter where someone was arguing with an ex-wife.

118
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,820
When there's a divorce, she should always file a divorce because if you file a divorce, you've got alimony, right?

119
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,860
So when she files it, then you kind of freeze up from them scrutinizing that.

120
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,120
OK, anyway, and it's different with children, but he had children.

121
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,960
She was a lot wealthier than him, still demanded the $1,200 a month or whatever.

122
00:06:59,340 --> 00:06:59,660
Oh, boy.

123
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:06,700
He opened a bank account with a 12-USC411, and he got a letter because the state came into the bank account

124
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:13,000
and wanted to pull money out, but the bank sent a letter back to the state saying,

125
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,660
well, you can't do that because he already created conditions where that cannot be done.

126
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,460
Sorry, and he sent a copy.

127
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:26,180
If the bank does an interaction with an agency and they interact back and forth, they send you a copy of what happened, right?

128
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:26,940
They're supposed to.

129
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,280
Yeah, they're supposed to, and he got a letter like that, and it was like, wow, that's so powerful.

130
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,480
But then they closed his bank account because he was doing like $10,000, $15,000.

131
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,960
He was selling Harley-Davidson.

132
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,820
To make a long story short, I just want to say that it is very effective.

133
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,720
Also, I have a letter from someone that does the 12-USC411,

134
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,800
and the IRS basically did a tax return.

135
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,500
They took out like $30,000 in income taxes, and he wrote his income was zero, which it is because he showed it.

136
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:04,240
He got the full amount back plus 5%, and a letter that said basically your account is at zero with us,

137
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,320
meaning when your account is at zero, it means you don't owe the IRS anything.

138
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,600
No one owes them anything, but this is very powerful.

139
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,920
Instead of complaining and doing all this stuff, they're giving you the remedy.

140
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,060
Like poison ivy, the remedy is the white oak that grows next to it.

141
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,820
There are other things too.

142
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:24,200
So when they did the Federal Reserve Act, by the way, it's in the 16th Amendment.

143
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,880
It says demand for lawful money.

144
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,580
It's in the 16th Amendment, right?

145
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,919
They took out – they've been changing digitally some of the wordage.

146
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,539
If you have one in print, you'll notice the verbiage is slightly different but still just as effective.

147
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:39,799
OK.

148
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:48,540
The thing I wanted to get into is the Greek speak is a simple approach on how you could fix any problem by listening to the stuff we discuss here, right?

149
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,720
Any problem.

150
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,380
But what happens is you might expect drastic changes.

151
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,900
I want to give – since we're on the money subject, a real quick one.

152
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,620
If people demanded lawful money, there would be less fractionalization and all that.

153
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,800
But then you go to the next level and say why are you doing fractional banking?

154
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:10,340
And there are starving people here and people with families with children being thrown out on the street because they don't have your fiat currency.

155
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:16,600
Why don't you have them come over, sign their name, and they have enough currency for everyone and there's no more poverty?

156
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:28,200
Well, then the people that have stored billions and millions in personal wealth, that's not worth anymore because anyone that doesn't have it can go write a number on a piece of paper and they give them that amount.

157
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:28,560
You see?

158
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,600
Ferrari would go out of business, right?

159
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,000
Right.

160
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,600
So if a Ferrari – what is – we used to say like a Ford in the 70s, Ford Pinto or a Yugo.

161
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,060
I don't know what you would say now is a real basic car.

162
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:39,660
What would it be?

163
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:40,560
I don't know.

164
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:41,900
What's a real basic?

165
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,600
There aren't anymore.

166
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,080
They're all about the same level now.

167
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,280
It seems like that.

168
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,220
Yeah.

169
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,380
Still some Toyotas and Dodge vehicles out there, I believe.

170
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,140
Yeah.

171
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,600
But what – it's too specific.

172
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,340
If you said a Ford Pinto or a Yugo, you know exactly.

173
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,280
It was like the most basic.

174
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,540
Yeah, a Toyota Yaris or something.

175
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,180
So a Ferrari next to a Ferrari Yaris.

176
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:10,060
It's no longer the money that separates them because if you can afford one, you can afford the other because it's just – OK.

177
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:20,320
So now we end up going into more of a Star Trek environment where – remember in one of the Star Trek episodes, more than one, the movies especially when they brought someone in from the past.

178
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,040
What do you do for money?

179
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,100
We don't need money anymore.

180
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,960
Everybody just does what they're interested in.

181
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,460
You have replicators.

182
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,060
So all of your basic needs are met.

183
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,860
There is available everything.

184
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,320
Well, there's a whole string of stuff, medical stuff.

185
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,280
Yeah, but I mean the issue of money.

186
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,200
There's no more money.

187
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:42,200
So now it's kind of like – I was listening to Warren Buffett recently, who I don't like by the way because he's just a total con man.

188
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,260
But how can he be a con man?

189
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,520
Well, anyway, it's a long story.

190
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:53,540
Yeah, and Jacque Fresco was reaching for that with that idea about designing the self-contained cities that grow things and you don't have to – and therefore you can just pursue your art or whatever.

191
00:10:53,900 --> 00:11:02,280
Yeah, but let me just say Warren Buffett is a con man not within his own group, which he tries to keep integrity, but within the public air.

192
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:08,660
He never talks about fiat currency and he talks about taxes and things that must be done.

193
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,820
But yes, they must be done if fiat currency is the entire universe.

194
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:18,280
But the people who created the fiat currency said you have a choice and the choice is clear.

195
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,320
People want to go for the fake stuff and suffer what they have.

196
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,040
But anyway, go back to the Star Trek.

197
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:28,120
Even in Star Wars, they had money in Star Trek where they built a federation.

198
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:33,240
What's interesting is doing what you're interested in doing, not a job.

199
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,660
Find what you're interested in.

200
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:42,300
One of the things that Warren Buffett said, he got picked up by a Harvard student to take him to a lecture and the Harvard student was asking for advice.

201
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,540
I want to work here. I want to work there. I work there.

202
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,920
So I have a good resume after a few years.

203
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,440
He's like, well, are you doing what you're interested in?

204
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,780
He says, no, I'm not. I just want a good resume.

205
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,120
He says, well, what are you waiting for?

206
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,040
Waiting to do what you're interested in is like waiting until you're an old man to have sex, right?

207
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,540
You don't do that.

208
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,140
You have it while you're young, right?

209
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,000
You want to start what you're interested in.

210
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,740
You'll always succeed if you do what you're interested in, right?

211
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,840
That's why so many people are unhappy.

212
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,760
They hate what they – let's not use the word job.

213
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,640
It's a vocation, what they apply themselves to every day to get fiat currency.

214
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,180
Hardly anybody enjoys what they do to do that.

215
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,960
There's very few people that do.

216
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:30,400
I mean we've all heard that you never work a day in your life if you enjoy what you do, which by the way, the Star Trek thing, I got to tell you, one day you and I need to talk about just that.

217
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,040
Because you're oversimplifying it a little bit and I'll tell you why.

218
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,900
No, it does – hold on.

219
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:44,480
Once the fiat currency notion is applied with ethics and morality, it will become – everything will become oversimplified.

220
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:44,860
Yes.

221
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,600
That's what I'm trying to say.

222
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:46,860
Yes.

223
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,420
And we can do the same thing with health.

224
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:48,720
Go ahead.

225
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:54,440
Well, but the fun thing about the Federation deal is that once you go outside of the Federation, there is money in that universe.

226
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,000
Right, right.

227
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,920
Especially later on in the series, there's some extremely greedy races that try to – will do anything for a coin, right?

228
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,180
Right.

229
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,480
You got your Ferengis, right?

230
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,180
Yeah, that's what I'm referring to.

231
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,820
Yeah, which it was hard for me to watch that.

232
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,840
But yeah, I understood that they were like the –

233
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,060
The hyper-capitalist.

234
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,600
The Ashkenazi businessmen, a garment district.

235
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,280
Yeah.

236
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,780
They're building a garment district on Glancy Street.

237
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,540
They're sort of hyper-capitalist.

238
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:23,440
They live by literally something they call religiously the rules of acquisition.

239
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:36,500
And they believe in the great continuum of the material world that is out there in the universe that there's sort of a flowing river of goods and wealth out there that you get involved in.

240
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,560
That's literally how the universe works to them.

241
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,520
Well, it's like gamblers.

242
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,140
It's not the actual wealth and material itself.

243
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,660
It's the act of getting it, right?

244
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:44,880
It's the thrill.

245
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:45,540
Right, right.

246
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:51,060
Yeah, like sex is more exciting thinking about before you get to the point, right?

247
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:58,560
Well, what's more exciting, the girl that's the girl of your dreams that you never quite get to or the ones that you can get that are low-hanging fruit all the time, right?

248
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,960
But if it's the girl that's in your dream and she's in your dreams, you can get to her.

249
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,720
But anyway, let's talk about the health.

250
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,040
The same thing happens here.

251
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:06,780
Yes.

252
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:12,760
If people were taught that the body is a biological vacuum, which is easy to prove.

253
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,660
The heart does not pump, right?

254
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,040
Eat seasonally.

255
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,240
It doesn't have to be seasonally if you can control your environment even more.

256
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:27,040
By the way, if you oversimplify your diet, seasonality goes away because you only have three things that you can eat, right?

257
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:32,920
Let's say you could just eat brown rice, plums, and kale, which kale could be toxic to some people.

258
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,220
I've known people that—

259
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,660
It causes stones, kidney stones.

260
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,360
But anyway—

261
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:42,080
But that's the trouble is I've known people that do that and they break it down to about like three, four component foods and that's it.

262
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,820
I mean their entire diet is based on those things.

263
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,860
And almost inevitably what happens to them is something goes wrong.

264
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,680
Because you need variety.

265
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,800
We could have another discussion on how to create variety there.

266
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:59,900
But what happens now, once you understand like if there's a wound, you squeeze it tight.

267
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:06,600
By the way, you can actually do a surgery operation, a pretty big one, and not use any stitching at all or anything.

268
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,520
Actually do the compression deal again and it will heal very quickly.

269
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:11,200
Absolutely.

270
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:18,540
And other things like that and understanding the energy of foods and the left side, the movement of the energy on the right side.

271
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,160
What will happen—

272
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,500
And you can limit incisions or cuts.

273
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,560
An incision and a cut is two different things.

274
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,540
But you can limit incisions—

275
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,980
You mean surgeries or injuries?

276
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,300
No, actual incisions during surgeries.

277
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,700
Well, an incision is a precise type of cut and a cut could be—

278
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:35,980
So a surgery.

279
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:41,540
Yeah, but the thing is you can eliminate the need for a lot of those cuts by utilizing—

280
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,000
Yeah, just like hernias.

281
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,540
They used to cut open the whole front of the abdomen.

282
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,320
Now they just go underneath with two probes through the Canadian method.

283
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,180
Well, there's the arthroscopic thing and that's great and all, but there's also the use of pressure.

284
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,700
A lot of people don't realize just the simple use of pressure.

285
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:02,360
You can eliminate a lot of stuff even when you have to extract foreign objects that have somehow gotten buried into the body.

286
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:02,560
That's right.

287
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,680
Yeah, of course.

288
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,500
Like I've extracted—

289
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,120
I mean the technology is there.

290
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:13,360
Like I've extracted a bullet before pretty deep in somebody's body without cutting them at all, okay?

291
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,480
Isn't that funny when you try to do that?

292
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,540
It seems like it's moving.

293
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,620
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

294
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,620
You're like right there.

295
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,080
I got it.

296
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:19,460
I got it.

297
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,660
And then you go back and it's gone.

298
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,580
You let it go.

299
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:28,340
But that's the thing is if you direct the pressure properly, you can generally remove almost any foreign object from the body without cutting it.

300
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:32,120
Do you know what the biggest complaint of people who've been shot—I've been around several—is?

301
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,480
You tell me what you observe.

302
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:34,800
Go ahead.

303
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,220
It burns.

304
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,680
Yeah, it does.

305
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,020
But that's usually when you're shot close up.

306
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,160
Yeah, definitely.

307
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:46,100
And that's the chemical reaction of the deposit of the gas on the skin.

308
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,980
That is usually what goes on, and that's usually the thing that hurts the most.

309
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:56,400
But you've got to extract things out of there because leaving lead and antimony and things like that are not positive things in the body.

310
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,760
So you've got to—

311
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,000
Your body will actually deal with that, believe it or not, very quickly.

312
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,840
Let's get back to the point.

313
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,300
Yeah, go ahead.

314
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:09,160
The point is, let's say the stuff we discuss on how the body works, which we can elaborate, I think, on the last Sonic.

315
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,400
I said we can get into several eight-hour Sonics.

316
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:16,780
But the thing is it has to be more focused than just general, quote-unquote, medicine.

317
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:22,260
Once the people understood that, obviously the current system of medicine goes away completely.

318
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:28,360
The idiots they call doctors and whatever and lawyers, whatever, go away.

319
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,240
They're actually put into more useful positions.

320
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:42,840
But what will happen is the individuals will be so empowered because not only that they have better health and not susceptible to the malady of an injury or whatever, but guess what?

321
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:48,760
Now they have the mental understanding that the body creates things like the replicator you kept mentioning earlier on Star Trek, right?

322
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,120
Right.

323
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:56,760
And now if children are taught that your body can replicate anything that it appears to need, why don't we do that on the outside?

324
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:00,760
And voila, we have again the Star Trek universal replicators, right?

325
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,400
Well, yeah.

326
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:07,380
We'll have that in a very short time just like we went from horse and carriage to airplane very quickly.

327
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,780
So I'm not talking about hot air.

328
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:14,140
Hot air balloons have always been around and airplanes were around a long time ago, but I mean in recent history.

329
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,220
So we all have that technology.

330
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:20,340
And then what will happen is people will become generally more intelligent.

331
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,320
And what happens when people become generally more intelligent?

332
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:29,180
What happens to the birth rate, especially when having a good time is promoted?

333
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,260
What happens to the birth rate?

334
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,240
Goes down, can go to zero, right?

335
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,260
The more intelligent the people, the fewer or no children they have.

336
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,320
This is proven throughout history.

337
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:43,940
So what happens then is you have a population decrease, but people are living longer, right?

338
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,700
So having a child is going to be a big deal.

339
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:52,540
And everything changes now because do you think when people have a child in a world like that,

340
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:57,220
they're going to go to defunct toys or a toy store and buy them little kids toys?

341
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:57,900
No.

342
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,180
Ain't going to happen.

343
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,480
There's no need for that, right?

344
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:05,760
So the entire society will change and it will become extremely simple.

345
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,100
And then people will actually be looking for things to do.

346
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,580
And I mean beyond what we've ever been looking to do, right?

347
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,340
So that's how it will change.

348
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:20,100
And this is very simple to do, but it cannot be done within – you need three generations to do it.

349
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:20,780
Kind of biblical.

350
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,420
You have to bring the notion with – not revolution.

351
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,240
You have to bring it in forcibly in the current situation.

352
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,240
Imprison or eliminate those that resist it.

353
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:39,200
And then the new generation that is born, they are isolated from those who resist it.

354
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,920
Completely isolation.

355
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,240
Even censored, like those people don't even exist, right?

356
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,760
They're mythological, any resistance to it.

357
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,700
And when they are raised, completely isolated from the resistance to what we're talking about.

358
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:03,500
Their children are similar protected, but the people that are resisting it are much older and have died off almost to the point where they've died off.

359
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:10,760
And then the people will be intelligent enough that you can actually give them the real history and why this was done

360
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,240
instead of just hiding it from them like what's being done now.

361
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,920
You see the difference?

362
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,560
And it's very brutal to do this.

363
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:31,260
I don't really want to be around – actually it would make me – it would give me a pretty good shit-eating grin if I saw a lot of these whatever being rounded up into camps and stuff like –

364
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,940
the ones that are promoting what's being promoted now, you know what I mean?

365
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,700
Yeah, but at the ages that you and I are at, we're not likely to see it.

366
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:38,980
No.

367
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:43,760
I mean like here in Tucson, it's very well known.

368
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:51,440
The administrators know that one of the hospitals, they killed over 2,500 people by putting them on certain treatments and ventilators.

369
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,180
They know it openly and they don't mind.

370
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,960
No one's rounding them up, right?

371
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:01,220
And the cops and the FBI and the judicial is totally behind them, right?

372
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:01,840
It's all money.

373
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,920
Now would you feel bad if those administrators were rounded up and put into a camp?

374
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,100
Not at all.

375
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:12,080
Given just bread and water and one bowl where they have to – the same bowl they eat in is the same bowl they shit and piss in.

376
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,360
I got no problem with that.

377
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,940
Yeah, that's – this is beyond forgiveness, right?

378
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,000
They were talking about some evil scum.

379
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,460
It's just like Cuomo there.

380
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:20,980
You know what?

381
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,680
He disappeared.

382
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,160
I mean what was it, 100,000 old people or whatever?

383
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:24,760
It's OK.

384
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,000
And then what do you have to do?

385
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,200
He resigned from being governor.

386
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:27,620
Goodbye.

387
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,380
Oh, yeah, because supposedly he was sexually touching people but whatever.

388
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,980
Yeah, talk about equality.

389
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,780
They went real hard on the Nazis and they're not doing anything to the people now.

390
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,880
Wow, it's even worse.

391
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,080
So, yeah.

392
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,020
So, yeah, this is how Greeks speak.

393
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,600
It's very simple, very simple.

394
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,400
But it will flip everything over.

395
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:46,700
It won't work.

396
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,420
We could go on and on and on and on.

397
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,300
Imagine just getting rid of the Catholic Church.

398
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,740
How many ales would go away from society just there?

399
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,760
Turn it into a museum.

400
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,880
Turn it into a nightclub.

401
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:57,860
A lot less people.

402
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,620
Whatever, the Vatican.

403
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,700
A lot less pedophiles right out of the gate.

404
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,340
Well, they talk about Peter Blake in Thailand.

405
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,380
They talk about Westerners go there and have sex with little girls.

406
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,720
Well, the age of consent, I think, is 14.

407
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,680
And the Vatican, they say, well, they had sex with an altar boy who was 14.

408
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,400
Well, the age of consent in the Vatican, someone could check, is 12.

409
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:24,620
So, having sex with a 13-year-old is past the age of consent.

410
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,680
Yeah, it's actually not a problem.

411
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,360
These little things are left out.

412
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,740
And I don't agree with that.

413
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,700
I don't agree with that at all.

414
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,900
For me, the age of majority is 20.

415
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,980
So, when you become 19, you're in your 20th year, right?

416
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,500
It's 20.

417
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,280
It's old school.

418
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,620
So, you know, some states, it's 18.

419
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,620
Some states, it's 21.

420
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:42,620
Right.

421
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,560
It's funny how it's kind of.

422
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:47,920
But when you become on the Western side, you know, on your 19th birthday, you're in your

423
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,540
20th year, age of consent.

424
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,520
Simple for both men and women.

425
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,240
And that's very, very simple to do.

426
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,600
And that's what I believe would be optimum.

427
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,840
Well, taking a look at neurological structure, I would almost argue that 25 should be the

428
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,320
proper age of majority.

429
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,700
You know, that is the age at which you have.

430
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,700
Are you trying to say that it destroys my chances of ever hooking up with a 21-year-old

431
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:12,880
now?

432
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,840
Oh, did I just say that?

433
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,240
I would say that.

434
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:15,540
Okay.

435
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,020
Okay.

436
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,140
I can't even look at a 20-year-old.

437
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,480
No, they look like children.

438
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,700
They look like children to me.

439
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,120
Exactly.

440
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,960
Now, you know, look, when I was 20, they did not.

441
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,860
You know, a woman looked like a woman to me.

442
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,940
I mean, when I was 15, a 20-year-old looked great.

443
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,900
And by the way, I said a 21-year-old should be in her 22nd year, right?

444
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:36,620
Sure, sure.

445
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,680
And look, you know, a 40-year-old didn't look great to me when I was 15.

446
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,680
I'm saying they all looked good when I was 15.

447
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,040
No, I wouldn't say that.

448
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,780
Actually, sometimes when I go down to the university, I'd stop at a light and all the

449
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,820
children are crossing the 20-year-olds.

450
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,840
And I say to them, I say, look how unhealthy they look.

451
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:52,420
Oh, yeah.

452
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,640
Most of them, they look really unhealthy.

453
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,520
Nowadays, yeah.

454
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,880
Small ears.

455
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,700
By the way, just maybe one day right around after this.

456
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,080
Sure.

457
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,700
Constitution of the body is developed around the ear.

458
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,940
So do me a favor.

459
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,360
Go look at people on the Internet or TV or whatever that live to their 90s.

460
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,720
Look at the size of their ears.

461
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,840
They're huge, like Dumbo.

462
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,740
But they're in proportion.

463
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:15,220
So, you know, you don't look and say, hey, there's Dumbo, you know, with the big ears,

464
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,260
flaps him and he takes off.

465
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,620
But they're in proportion.

466
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:23,160
There's a strange proportion that happens with the size of the head, the size of the

467
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:23,480
cranium.

468
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,260
But they have huge ears.

469
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,600
People with small ears don't live very long.

470
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:34,280
So when you see people that have well-formed, large ears and their ears keep growing as

471
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,980
they grow in proportion, but they're typically larger than normal.

472
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,680
That's what you call a strong constitution.

473
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,560
They'll probably live a long life.

474
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:46,460
Biblically, living a long life is, you know, treating your parents, being in a good relationship

475
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,300
with your parents.

476
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,700
But physically and constitutionally, I always point this out.

477
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:57,400
If you go to watch black and white movies from the 20s and 30s, the general public,

478
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:03,040
they typically had larger ears than if you go look at what's in Hollywood, you know,

479
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,440
people they put on TV now.

480
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,240
The proportion of the ears are much larger.

481
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:09,420
And those people had a longer lifespan and more robust.

482
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:15,360
What I mean also by stronger constitution is that if they get hit with, let's say,

483
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,480
an incident, an injury, they'll recover fast.

484
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,260
If they get hit with an illness, they recover faster.

485
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,720
That's what I mean by strong constitution.

486
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:29,960
And it's the chemicals introduced in society and this lifestyle, and just the chemicals

487
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:34,080
in the water itself, you'll notice children and younger people.

488
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,140
We're talking about people born after 1960 predominantly, especially after 1970.

489
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:43,740
You will not see people with larger ears unless you go to countries that have not been

490
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:47,920
westernized like on the continent of Africa and Asia.

491
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,900
But yeah, let's leave it off with that.

492
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,040
I think the big ear syndrome, we'll talk about it again sometime.

493
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:53,620
Right.

494
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:58,060
And you know, in the future, one thing I do, you just struck on something that curiously

495
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:02,960
I was thinking about this week that you have never addressed actually on the Greek speak

496
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,900
that I've done with you.

497
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:07,020
And that is the treatment of one's parents.

498
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,280
What is fit and proper in that case?

499
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,860
You and I have never had that discussion because I have no...

500
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,300
Yeah, we could do that real quick.

501
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:13,900
It's real simple.

502
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:17,440
When you read all these things you have to do, and let's say if you're an Old Testament

503
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,880
guy like me, right?

504
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:24,800
And actually, the underwriting element to remember in that is that that's when you're

505
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,180
all living under the same law or rules, right?

506
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,840
So let's just use a very simple whether you believe it or not.

507
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:35,720
Abraham left his parents home because he didn't want to practice their religion.

508
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:36,040
Right.

509
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,680
And he abandoned, he just got away from them.

510
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,900
And others have done that too.

511
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:40,260
Right.

512
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,520
That's why he went out on his own, tried to establish himself with these other people.

513
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,400
Look, I'll work for you.

514
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,200
I'll marry your daughter.

515
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:45,820
This and that.

516
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,360
Beyond that.

517
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:53,260
In other words, it's better to like personally have a terrible, when they were alive, relationship

518
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,360
with the parents.

519
00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:00,180
And instead of fostering a terrible relationship, I just avoided them.

520
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:06,860
So if I spent on the phone more than 30 minutes a year with them, that was a lot.

521
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,040
And it was just cordial, polite.

522
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:09,360
Hello.

523
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:09,780
Goodbye.

524
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:13,600
Because if you spend more time with them, you're going to be disrespectful.

525
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:14,620
Very easy to.

526
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,760
So it's the same thing.

527
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:20,440
Like if you run into someone you don't like, what do you do?

528
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,000
You go have a drink together and go have dinner.

529
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:23,900
No, you just hello.

530
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:24,240
Goodbye.

531
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,480
And anything more than this may get ugly.

532
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:30,820
So let's avoid, you know, avoid them is the best thing.

533
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,120
Right.

534
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:31,500
Exactly.

535
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:31,940
Avoidance.

536
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,960
So if you cannot have a good relationship with your parents, avoid them.

537
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,620
Don't go back and argue and do this.

538
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,040
And the other is my recommendation on that.

539
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:43,860
If you do have a good relationship with your parents, then, of course, and then you go

540
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:47,260
into what's one of those 1950s TV shows where I have to go.

541
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,640
Look, everybody was just fine.

542
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,080
Leave it.

543
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:49,580
No matter.

544
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,980
Leave it to beaver.

545
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:51,420
Yeah.

546
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:55,040
Then you could live that life, whatever, and you'll be fine.

547
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:55,900
It's very simple.

548
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:56,400
Maybe.

549
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:00,240
But a lot of the things you read about in the Old Testament in terms of the law has to do

550
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,880
with people living under the same covenant.

551
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:02,380
Right.

552
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,800
It's the same in every situation.

553
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:05,760
What covenant?

554
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,260
Remember, in early Greek speak, I used to say, when you want to get to know, ask them,

555
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,420
what covenant do you live by?

556
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,580
What set of rules do you live by?

557
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,260
It really shocks people because they don't know.

558
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,980
So if they say they don't know and they don't have one body of rules that you can go and

559
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,460
look up and see, it tells you a lot about them.

560
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,700
Tells you like, well, they're at large.

561
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:25,460
Right.

562
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:28,160
They can do anything at any moment, depending on what's on TV.

563
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:28,820
Right.

564
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:34,240
So you can pigeonhole that person very safely and make them very predictable that they're

565
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:34,560
unpredictable.

566
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,260
By the way, when someone is very unpredictable, that actually makes them predictable.

567
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,460
It's predictable that they will be unpredictable.

568
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:40,920
Right.

569
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,360
So you want to avoid them, you know, when you see them like running with the scissors

570
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,220
or anything.

571
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:45,540
Right.

572
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,000
So unless you live the same way.
