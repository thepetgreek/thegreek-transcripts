1
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:15,880
A sonic event rated Y, the number is 118, and here we go, Greek, the Middle East, and

2
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,740
God knows what else we could talk about, or the gods might know what else we could talk

3
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:19,920
about.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,860
Maybe they do know.

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,220
By the way, is time even relevant to the gods?

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:24,860
I'm curious.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,240
Of course.

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:26,920
Of course.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,160
They run everything backwards.

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,420
When they tell you the future, it's their history.

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,439
There you go.

12
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,620
There's an interesting scope with all that.

13
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,720
If you want to travel to another galaxy, you do it when you're here without moving.

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,540
There's a movie called, with Jodie Foster, Carl Sagan wrote a book, Contact.

15
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,780
She falls through the device, and to the perceivers on the ground, it looks like she didn't go

16
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,960
anywhere, but she went on a 13-hour journey, right?

17
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,180
That's how you go outside of here.

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,560
That's why when you read all the ancient texts about spirituality, they don't make any sense

19
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,920
from a linear perspective or a physical perspective.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,840
That's why it's so important what you do.

21
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,920
Give you an example, I've been looking at Warren Buffet a lot lately, what I can get

22
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,860
old stuff 20, 30, 40 years ago.

23
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:21,940
Very interesting how he went the way of the fiat, he embraced the fiat currency system,

24
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:26,760
is proud to file taxes, proud to work with the Federal Reserve and all that, right?

25
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:31,020
Is there anything special about Warren Buffet, or is it just-

26
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:31,640
No, actually there isn't.

27
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,420
He's a good example.

28
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:41,540
No one ever talks about him in the, people, everyone knows he's famously rich, trillion

29
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,240
dollar company, Berkshire Hathaway, which was an old loom that was not a very good loom,

30
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:49,660
but he kept the name because it sounds authoritative, but he still lives in a house, a very modest

31
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:53,000
house, drives his own Buick, 1994 Buick, right?

32
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,720
So that's how I would be, by the way, and that's how I am.

33
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:05,140
I don't care about it at all, so he views it as a game, but what I think he does a big

34
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:11,820
disservice with is when he's asked about the overall picture, he stays away from it, right?

35
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,020
Which is fine.

36
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,360
That's what I do, I talk about the overall picture.

37
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,520
So he is worth like $700 billion or $400 billion personally, and his partner recently died

38
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,200
and all that, whatever.

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,120
He talks about the system as he works it, but everyone thinks that if they do what he

40
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,200
does and think like he does, they'll be like him.

41
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,220
It doesn't work that way.

42
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:37,980
The system is not made the way that everyone is talking about it, and I mean the majority

43
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:38,560
of the people.

44
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,120
It's kind of like, you got a busy bathroom where people take number two, you make sure

45
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,400
you have a lot of air freshener in there, right, to balance it out, but it doesn't really

46
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,900
balance it out because you know what's going on in there, right?

47
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,480
That's just the air freshener, let's get out of here because it really smells like shit.

48
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,600
And besides that, you get flowery smelling shitty things in the air.

49
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,260
Yeah, and that's exactly what the earth is and he doesn't talk about it.

50
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:06,900
I'll give you an example.

51
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,740
There was something he did in 1995, an interview, and he's pretty candid.

52
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,800
He knows what's going on, he just won't discuss it.

53
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,680
Someone said, you know, it's fiat currency, blah, blah, blah, went on that, let's say

54
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,200
point of view, and he says, yeah, it's basically the dollar is stock.

55
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:29,380
It's like holding a piece of stock coupon from a company, right, and if it's stock

56
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,560
is worth more, the dollar is worth more, and if you make too many dollars, it's like make

57
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,340
too many stocks for a company and dilute it, right?

58
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,380
So he does know.

59
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:42,240
Now, I'm against that because the system has prevailed now for over 100 years this way

60
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,340
and there's more poverty than there ever was.

61
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,220
People pay to the system the natural power.

62
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:53,780
Have you seen, I think it was Network, where they told basically he's too old, he's

63
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:58,080
washed up and he said a film and he goes on, he says, I'm mad, I'm not going to take it

64
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,020
anymore. Very famous.

65
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,060
Oh, yeah, that's yeah.

66
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,280
Yeah. And they basically told him, you know, what you did there on TV is going against

67
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,320
the powers, the natural powers that be, meaning people control the world.

68
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,720
Right. And he tells them there are no countries, there are no this and that.

69
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,340
There are just corporations and that's all there is to it.

70
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,440
It's all about things that are bought and sold.

71
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,279
So, yeah, ideas and all that.

72
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:24,040
Yeah. So Buffett can never get into that, but he doesn't he doesn't know how it works.

73
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:28,320
Now, personally, I am against the way the system is set up.

74
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,760
I think I briefly went over yesterday where the money they're actually literally the

75
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,640
money people are playing God because they create the money based on what collateral

76
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:42,220
they hold. Well, and they demand people to work for, you know, a banker and the banker

77
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,140
will make more money on a house than anyone else.

78
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,360
And they're dictating the behaviors of everybody on the planet, basically, by

79
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,320
controlling. Now they are now more than ever.

80
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,120
Give me an example. Like Kennedy could have been taken out in his sleep and said he

81
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,620
died of a heart attack. And it would have been very plausible because he took quite a

82
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,740
few. He was very famously known in many circles to be experimenting with drugs of all

83
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,540
kinds. He was also getting shot up with a lot of drugs by a doctor.

84
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,560
It could have been very easily.

85
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,760
Yeah. Too many famous doctor, Dr.

86
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,460
Feelgood. Yeah. The guy they call Dr.

87
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,360
Feelgood. Right. Right.

88
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,300
True. Him and Jackie, by the way.

89
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,200
But but good. Yeah.

90
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,400
Yeah. And all and all our friends.

91
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,620
Yeah. So so he would have been very plausible that he died.

92
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,760
But why did they do a public assassination?

93
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:27,460
Because they just want to tell you that the things you think of are not so right.

94
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,420
And they have to make it loud, just like 4th of July.

95
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,560
Ask people what's 4th of July.

96
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,480
Oh, it's fireworks, hot dogs, hamburgers, barbecue.

97
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,280
Because that's the loudest thing.

98
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,360
Right. They don't understand.

99
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:41,660
It's all set up. So basically, on the last Sonic, I mentioned that if we went to the

100
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:47,920
bankers and demanded that they from the collateral that, OK, when a poor person in

101
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,940
America or any Western country is born, their credit, their birth certificate is worth

102
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,780
just as much as the wealthiest person.

103
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,700
Right. It's all equal.

104
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,480
So Warren Buffett, it's around six million dollars.

105
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,020
Yeah. Warren Buffett is allegedly an American businessman.

106
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,800
So therefore, his birth certificate is worth the same amount as mine is.

107
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:13,840
If, say, at the time of his birth certificate, he would have been the son of like a

108
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,300
radio person who was an editor of a magazine and a homekeeper.

109
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,500
Yeah. So it doesn't matter if Bill Gates has a baby right now or someone like that or

110
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,720
the prince of whatever their child is worth six million to the state.

111
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,840
Actually, the Social Security Act between 1935 and 1942 amended, you'll find what I'm

112
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,380
saying. It talks about the birth certificate being goes from six hundred fifty

113
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,180
thousand to five million to six million.

114
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,940
Right. For the state collateral.

115
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,520
So if you go to the banks and say we have a birth certificate file, this guy needs

116
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,920
credit. So he's not poor anymore.

117
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,660
You know, they talked a little bit about universal income, right?

118
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,260
And all that stuff. But they're using their words.

119
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,620
Yeah. You have a universal basic income and it's supposed to be.

120
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,440
Look, you have a certain allowance basically each month.

121
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,620
And that's just to it.

122
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,120
Yeah. Yeah. That would be horrible when it's done by them.

123
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,680
Because if you say something that they don't like, they prevent you from getting food

124
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,180
the next month. It'll be worse.

125
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,780
Yeah. It's always worse.

126
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,620
Right. You're cut off. And now there's no way to even turn around and hustle around

127
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,540
that because either you got it or you don't.

128
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,560
Yeah, it's the social credit system.

129
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,720
So it'll get worse and worse and worse, no matter who says it's a benefit.

130
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,160
So there's this idiot.

131
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,940
What's his name? I was looking some stuff at marketing.

132
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:30,020
Godin, he's a bald headed Jewish guy with funny colored glasses.

133
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,720
What's his name? But he's Jewish.

134
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,480
I mean, he's super Jewish, whatever that is.

135
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,360
The multi hedge fund guy or the.

136
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,740
No, no, no. So Godin, he talks about marketing.

137
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,960
OK, this is this is a segue.

138
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,340
But just give us a stupid these people that everyone looks up anyway.

139
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:54,080
Godin, he's a marketing guy, talks about, you know, integrity and all this other stuff.

140
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:02,800
Anyway. OK, he gets he's doing this thing, the most important thing in his life is the

141
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,160
carbon thing because we're destroying the world.

142
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,780
And he says, well, whenever he hears a leaf blower, Seth Godin, whenever he hears a

143
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,860
leaf blower, his is his blood boils.

144
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,080
Right. Because of the carbon.

145
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,060
Right. This is what the idiot doesn't know.

146
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,480
Oh, God. He's vegetarian.

147
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,120
So when he goes to a Chinese restaurant locally, because one of the things he mentions, he

148
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,420
likes it's vegetarian fried rice when they prepare a medium to large size order of fried

149
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:33,659
rice from him. When that walk is blasting at 300000 BTUs, 200000 BTUs

150
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:41,460
to prepare that meal for him uses more carbon fuel than a medium

151
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:45,160
sized leaf blower going for eight hours constantly.

152
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,940
I mean, that's how efficient that little engine is.

153
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,920
Right. OK, so so here he is giving a public

154
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,300
anti virtue of using, you know, in his office, in his office, writing the carbon

155
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,920
newsletter. He hears in the neighborhood, you know, someone using a leaf blower, his

156
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,940
blood boils because it's destroying the environment.

157
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:09,940
He doesn't know that when he goes orders his vegetarian meal, that one meal is used

158
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,840
more energy than that leaf blower going for eight hours straight.

159
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,800
Oh, yeah. What am I what what's my point here?

160
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,420
Right. It's sort of like the people that say cryptocurrency will be a great thing for the

161
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,260
environment because now you don't have to print paper and all this other stuff.

162
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,740
And now it's not even on paper.

163
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,540
It's caught. Yeah, well, it's recycled.

164
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,640
Caught. It's made in North Korea, by the way.

165
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,600
But the worst thing is, is that this crypto stuff, they go, oh, no, it's on the

166
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,620
blockchain and therefore it'll save the environment.

167
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,980
OK, if you take a look at the farms that they have to use in order to mine that crap, it

168
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,720
actually puts way more wasted energy out there than anything.

169
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,160
Well, you could print a billion dollars.

170
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,640
You could print one. Hold on.

171
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,940
But let's let's I want to add to what you're saying.

172
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,380
Forget about just crypto.

173
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,300
Anything that has a thousand, two thousand, ten thousand percent profit is intelligence

174
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,440
agency operations.

175
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:59,740
Absolutely. Drugs were not that profitable until the intelligence agencies got involved.

176
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,120
When were they not involved?

177
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,600
Well, you know, let's say after the 50s and 60s.

178
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:11,880
Do you know, like you can make enough LSD to get the entire world tripping for less than

179
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,760
a hundred dollars. Oh, back then.

180
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,860
Yeah, easily. I don't know about now or even now.

181
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,100
I mean, yeah, you know, the you know, the entire world.

182
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,880
That's that's how cheap it is.

183
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,760
Right. In reality, the same with.

184
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,260
OK, there's a bunch of.

185
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,880
OK, so the same thing with Warren Buffett.

186
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,700
He talks about these things that sound great.

187
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,160
But if you look at what he's saying from a scientific point of view, they don't make

188
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,580
any sense. Right.

189
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,980
So but if you did equalize and got rid of poverty and misery that can be remedied by

190
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:43,220
money, which is mostly thing, everything tie into the medical, how that has to be

191
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:47,800
done and why then having money won't be that valuable.

192
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,100
Right. So Ferrari and all the luxury, all the items in neighborhoods go away.

193
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,920
So you have to restructure society, which is going to happen anyway.

194
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:00,080
Now, the medical system, a lot of people say, oh, we don't need to give millions and

195
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,980
billions because the NIH already spending a million billions on research.

196
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,700
This is how medical research is done.

197
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,160
Guys, don't be fooled by it.

198
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,200
If you go work in medical research, you're encouraged to play video games and watch

199
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,200
porn on the job because they don't want you doing medical research.

200
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:20,200
Right. The way that it works is you're given a list that go back to who's the guy that

201
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,200
decided how medical research is going to go.

202
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,860
He's got a funky name, 1902, 1912.

203
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,860
Anyway, you could.

204
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,900
Yeah, he's the guy who decided that there will be no new practices used in medicine.

205
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,380
He said this in 1912, only existing practices.

206
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,900
Right. So that means there's no research and there isn't.

207
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:41,160
Because what you're when you do medical research, this is the standard practice.

208
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,660
And can this be applied to this standard practice?

209
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,100
Right. So, for example, if you listen to Greek speak, we can go out with no money and

210
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,660
topple the entire medical industry for every disease that the first of all, 75 percent

211
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,660
of what they call diseases do not exist.

212
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,060
They're created by being diagnosed with such a thing and taking the treatment.

213
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:03,340
Right. So we only have to deal with 25 percent of what people think makes them sick and

214
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:09,820
with no cost at all, including sewing arms and limbs and doing transplants, effectively

215
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,300
no money at all. Research.

216
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:16,080
I mean, we could we could get a bunch of people that are well versed in Greek speak and

217
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,300
go around and do a tour in six months and the whole world won't be sick anymore except

218
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,700
for, you know, a minor amount. Right.

219
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,460
And trauma. Very simple.

220
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,880
So, again, the same with the money.

221
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,200
It's not about that.

222
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:31,100
And the money and the medical are tied in together because of the insurance business.

223
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:36,440
OK, now to go back to what you're saying about the crypto and then the carbon and all

224
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,320
the things in the Middle East, this all ties in.

225
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:42,200
Do you remember burning down of the rainforest?

226
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,780
That was a big deal, right?

227
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,020
Yes. In the 80s.

228
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,720
OK, that was all propaganda.

229
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,560
First of all, give you a little history.

230
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,580
Brasilia, when they wanted to they wanted to expand Brazil.

231
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,640
Brazil is totally developed on the coast.

232
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,860
The rest of its forest, river and whatever.

233
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,960
There's some desert, too.

234
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,340
But they wanted to expand the country.

235
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,440
So if they put the capital, Brasilia, the new capital in the middle of the rainforest

236
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,960
area, everyone will go there.

237
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,000
That didn't work. Right.

238
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,160
First of all, they hired Western architects.

239
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,300
They built these apartment complexes like you would see a modern apartment complex, small

240
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,220
little kitchen, living room, dining room, bedrooms.

241
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,320
Right. Got you. Didn't didn't work.

242
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,080
The people's culture doesn't work that way.

243
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,080
What they did is they went to the apartments and they said, well, we all gather around

244
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,680
where we eat. So they bought these portable burners and put them in the middle of the

245
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,120
living room, did all their cooking in the living room.

246
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,180
The narrow kitchen became a storage closet for clothing.

247
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,800
Right. They could they like to.

248
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,840
Right. You see what I mean? It didn't work at all.

249
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,020
OK, just an example.

250
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,260
Now, the reason you've heard of the 2030 environmental stuff, right.

251
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,080
They want to put smart cities, get people.

252
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,800
OK, well, that started with the burning of the rainforest.

253
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,640
No one needed to burn in you.

254
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,580
And rainforest does not burn like they said.

255
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:59,560
The same people who did covid 9-11, JFK, whatever, says, look, let's implement this.

256
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,720
Actually, I'm not going to mention any names, Jim Carton.

257
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:07,140
But anyway, his dad was one of the guys I know personally.

258
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:14,340
His dad was one of the guys that after World War Two, Marcos in the Philippines was very

259
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:18,880
instrumental in knowing where certain things were hidden, technologies, gold and all that.

260
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,840
But from the Japanese and all this other stuff.

261
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,560
Right. Underworld people he protected.

262
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,720
He wouldn't cooperate with the CIA.

263
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,600
So what they did was they, Jim Carton's dad, not to mention his name, went into the

264
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,540
Philippines with about 50 other CIA, 100 CIA and over a period of three months told

265
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,800
people, if you show up on this day, you get ten dollars.

266
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,780
Just all you have to do is show up at the Capitol.

267
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,780
So they got over 30,000 or actually 10 or 15,000 people.

268
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,700
Very much. And each got 10 bucks each, which is a lot of money back then.

269
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,940
And remember, money's printed.

270
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,140
Right. And they got them to protest in front of the Capitol like they wanted Marcos

271
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:59,320
ousted. So the CIA comes in with a helicopter and saves Marcos.

272
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,740
Right. You see what I mean?

273
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,380
So protests staged.

274
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,720
Yeah, I gotcha. Yeah.

275
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,260
Publicly, it looked like the U.S.

276
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,340
saved him. Right. You know.

277
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:12,160
Right. But actually, they're the ones that created the protests because he didn't want to

278
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,420
deal with them at all. And you know what happened after that.

279
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,040
So and the famous shoe incident and all that.

280
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,420
It's all distraction. Right.

281
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,440
What they did, these people, they went in and started burning the rainforest.

282
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:27,880
Like if you watch like a movie where, you know, it's supposed to be a theater full

283
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,460
of people and they only show like 10 or 15 seats because that's all the extras they want

284
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,580
to afford. And you supposed to in your imagination, imagine the theater is full because

285
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,960
they show you a stock photo of a full theater.

286
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,060
Right. And they play a little noise that makes it sound like there's a lot of people in

287
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:46,020
there. Yeah. So they started burning some areas of the forest down, saying trying to

288
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:51,800
create that national international outrage that, look, we need to pass laws to preserve

289
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,300
nature. It had nothing to do with the rainforest.

290
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,860
They were not burning down the rainforest.

291
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,480
They yes, they did make fires just like you can.

292
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,140
You know, they shot Kennedy in the World Trade Center was demolished.

293
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,500
Same people over and over.

294
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:08,920
No, same group, not same people because of the age differences in the locale.

295
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,240
Well, eventually people died.

296
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,900
But yeah. So what they want, which they got is international interest to protest.

297
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:20,080
That's so each country now can have laws that you can't cut.

298
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,480
You can't cut down a tree.

299
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,200
You can't burn wood.

300
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,480
You can't write. Sure.

301
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,360
It failed, though it failed because there was benefactors and people inside the group

302
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:38,780
that said, you know, if we use the sentiment that we've garnered by enraging the

303
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:43,920
international community, international audience about this and they notice that we doing

304
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,880
all these laws now in their own places and there was no rainforest fires really were the

305
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,520
ones that set them. It's not time yet.

306
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,340
It's not necessary.

307
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:58,400
So the 2030 agenda about the environment, the carbon tax is attached to the burning of

308
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,560
the rainforest. That's the history.

309
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,180
The same people, same agenda.

310
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,060
I just want to put this out. You can follow this.

311
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,020
Also, it was the birth of something called Greenpeace.

312
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,920
They would block whaling ships and all that.

313
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,040
Right. And they were actually, I think, recently, maybe 20 years ago or recently, they

314
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,780
would declare it a terrorist organization.

315
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,540
And that's right. So environmental terrorism, whatever.

316
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:23,280
So there's like none of these plans seem to work and they won't because we're in the

317
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,880
credits part of the society.

318
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,560
Right. But the reason I'm bringing this up is because all these things are tied

319
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,860
together. I grew up in the 70s.

320
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,620
I remember watching was that Leonard Nimoy in search of right.

321
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,380
Yeah. Planet of the Apes, Laverne and Shirley, Happy Days.

322
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,500
And there was something called Connections on PBS.

323
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,620
British guy. And he would start off talking about how does this thing lead to that?

324
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,400
And he would spend a whole hour showing you how one thing ties to the next.

325
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:52,720
Remember that? Yeah. OK, that's kind of like my own version of Connections, the

326
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,820
rainforest, cryptocurrency, what's happening in Gaza, all this stuff.

327
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,940
OK, there's a lot of credence, by the way, to bounce over to what Jason Breshears has

328
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:05,400
been putting out because I pointed, you know, given him ample time here on this

329
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,540
platform to say, hey, go look, people are listening.

330
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:10,300
Let me go listen to what he's saying, because it's a lot of it's very worthwhile.

331
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,640
You've stressed his chronology is good.

332
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,740
Right. Yeah, it's pretty good.

333
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,860
Yeah. It's not airtight, but no one's is really is.

334
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,500
But, you know, I see mine is more tight than his, but it's one or the other.

335
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:26,760
They're both good. So go look at what he talked about happening this year with all

336
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:31,280
this stuff going on in the Middle East to bring in this other seal, which would be

337
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,440
basically what you will be seeing.

338
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,320
And I brought this up, but not as direct.

339
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,860
The next thing you'll be seeing other than the covid is knife, small arms attacks, knife

340
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,980
attacks at churches, small venues.

341
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:48,780
And they'll be caught and it'll always be Middle Eastern men enraged about what

342
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,060
Israel's doing and the Western support.

343
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,180
Right. So American churches, radio stations, little, little venues, schools will be

344
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,100
attacked by these men.

345
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,700
Well, that's the next agenda.

346
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,840
Yeah, it happened a couple of days ago in what they call England.

347
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,720
You know, there was a couple of England is a big one.

348
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:09,360
Yeah. Like all of these people that are being sent what they call refugees or

349
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,140
whatever and migrants, they're all soldiers, they're all soldiers.

350
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,300
In other words, when you leave, you don't leave your wife and children behind, you

351
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,720
know, right. And they're also given big pockets of money by this by these.

352
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:26,920
OK, with Libya and other people like the people that supported the Obama and the

353
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:32,500
Western stuff, Afghanistan, when you the it's not really a lottery, but the American

354
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,820
State Department, when they find people that supported the Americans in Afghanistan,

355
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,660
Libya, Somalia, whatever, they said you can immigrate.

356
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,380
We'll give you a visa and a green card and your citizenship.

357
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,720
Come to the U.S.

358
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,900
What they that's very well known.

359
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,680
Right. The open businesses of what's not well known is that a good amount of them get

360
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,680
four hundred thousand dollar debit cards, just like they were giving ten thousand

361
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,380
dollar debit cards to the migrants in New York.

362
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,580
That's normal. That's like pittance.

363
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,420
That's why when you live in a medium sized city like I'm in Tucson, you'll see all

364
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:09,700
the used car dealerships now are Afghanis that have been here for less than 10 years.

365
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,460
You need at least a quarter of a million dollars to open a used car dealership.

366
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,540
The bond alone is one hundred thousand dollars.

367
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,660
Right. Right. They opened the 7-Elevens and all that.

368
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:22,820
And you can I know someone who opened a convenience store back in the 80s and it was

369
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,140
50 grand minimum.

370
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,260
Yeah. So now it's got to be one hundred and fifty two hundred.

371
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:31,000
Right. A few years ago, a Dunkin Donuts was precisely one million dollars.

372
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,380
That's what you needed. All in everything.

373
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,960
You had your Dunkin Donuts.

374
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,140
Million dollars. Yeah.

375
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:40,560
Well, McDonald's now is six hundred thousand and you have to have not borrowed and all

376
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:44,420
that. So OK, but either way, Dunkin Donuts is terrible now, by the way, they don't make

377
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,140
their donuts anymore. They're brought in from then.

378
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,280
They're made of they have silicone.

379
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,980
I got some recently and I like to warm up a donut.

380
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,960
It tastes better and it would not warm up and change.

381
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,860
It's it's it's nasty chemical stuff.

382
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:58,280
So anyway, speaking, let's just do a little segue.

383
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,500
I want to go to the chat.

384
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,540
Coffee still tastes good, though, I got to tell you.

385
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,380
But go ahead. George asked about the pan cake recipe.

386
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,140
Now, the difference between pancakes and pan cakes.

387
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,320
Now, pancake is a pancake.

388
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,520
The pancake. Yeah, whatever.

389
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,740
You need a lot of syrup and butter.

390
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,220
Hopefully using real syrup and real butter.

391
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,480
But we know what that is.

392
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,240
But then there's pancake, which is like a wonderful sponge cake.

393
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,260
It's literally like, you know, when you buy a cake like a strawberry shortcake or

394
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:30,360
something like that, or a vanilla cake, a three layer, a multilayer cake, it's the

395
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,440
cake is very different than a pancake.

396
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,420
Right. Yes.

397
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,300
And that's what you know, that's what the pancake pan cake recipe is asking for.

398
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:42,400
Now, what you do with that to start off, depending on your skills, I'll give the three

399
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,800
points that you need. You need a freezer.

400
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,860
You need and not for the reason why one would sound like you need a freezer.

401
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,000
You need some almond flour or almond flour.

402
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,980
Depends if you say aunt or aunt.

403
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:59,560
Right. And you're going to need some high altitude wheat or whole wheat flour.

404
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,180
OK, so what you do is if you already using a premix pancake mix like a Trader Joe's

405
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,960
one is pretty good. Multigrain or whatever.

406
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,440
You may not need the whole wheat, but I would still have it a little bit.

407
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,300
And you definitely need the almond flour.

408
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:17,660
So whatever pancake mix you use and even like the shittiest kind, it still works.

409
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:24,900
OK, when the mix is dry, add your almond flour and whole wheat to at a rate of 30

410
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,260
percent for both.

411
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,520
So you'd have two thirds of whatever pancake mix you use.

412
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,400
And the other third is a mixture of the whole wheat and almond flour.

413
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:39,000
And when you add your liquid, pre dilute your liquid with some yogurt, at least a

414
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,480
teaspoon or tablespoon of yogurt, more yogurt than you'd think you'd normally use.

415
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,880
And you mix it up.

416
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,840
Now, here's the point.

417
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,780
Don't over mix it.

418
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,820
You just stir it until some lumps are OK.

419
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:53,940
They go away. Now, what you do is you put it in the freezer for about two minutes.

420
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,920
The reason why has nothing to do with temperature.

421
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:02,080
If I said you need a vacuum chamber instead of a freezer, most people would say, well,

422
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,380
they don't have a vacuum chamber.

423
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,300
Right. For most people, if you have a fridge, you have a freezer.

424
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,540
Right. Right. Ninety nine percent of the time nowadays.

425
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,920
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

426
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,400
So what you do, the reason why you put it in the freezer is to really air it out and

427
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,180
creates a tremendous amount of leavening effect or airiness.

428
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,260
Why have you ever been locked by hopefully by accident?

429
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:27,680
Have you ever walked into a walk in freezer box and the door closes and you can't get

430
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,500
out? Yes.

431
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,960
OK, what's the first thing you notice after about 30 seconds?

432
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,720
You can't breathe or it's hard to breathe.

433
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,480
OK. You remember that?

434
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,740
Maybe it wasn't more than 30 seconds for you.

435
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,980
Yeah, no, it was.

436
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:45,260
I remember feeling really weird about it because I felt the air kind of you couldn't

437
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,500
breathe. Yeah. Yeah. They're sucked out of there.

438
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,880
What happens is as the temperature drops, you creates a vacuum.

439
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,260
Yeah. Air contracts.

440
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,220
OK. Yeah.

441
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:59,080
So that vacuum on the on the pancake mix for about one or two or three minutes will

442
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,360
create a tremendous fluffy.

443
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,220
You don't want to stir it after that, by the way.

444
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:07,920
So that it will. In other words, the CO2 gas that you get from the baking soda that

445
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,400
makes things light and airy will expand.

446
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,720
No, you cannot, by the way.

447
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,540
No matter what kind of leaven you use, how fluffy and moist the pancakes are, if you

448
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,800
do not put it in a vacuum chamber or a freezer for two minutes, you cannot get that

449
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:25,700
type of bubble, that type of bubble in the cake can only come by mechanical vacuum.

450
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,720
I see. And that's the secret.

451
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,280
That's literally that's right there.

452
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,600
That's like, OK, that's a secret.

453
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,860
You could open a pancake house with what I just told you and sell pancakes for

454
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:38,680
where I've had some people come over and eat whatever.

455
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,020
Yeah. And you know what they when they taste it.

456
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:44,680
You know what they say to me? I mean, people that know business, you can you can

457
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:49,080
make a lot of money selling this after one bite.

458
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,600
Nice. Right.

459
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:55,600
OK. I mean, it doesn't matter what you know, like that's if you taste my chicken.

460
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,100
First thing someone from San Francisco said, you're going to make you could make a

461
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,820
lot of money selling this chicken or same with the pancakes.

462
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,760
You can make a lot of money selling because there's nothing like it.

463
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,420
Nothing like it. So that's the secret.

464
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
How do you get the let you see the quality of the sponge?

465
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,460
It's called sponge, by the way. Right.

466
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:18,140
The cake. Yeah. When you're baking, it's the cake itself is called the sponge.

467
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:24,520
Right. So the quality, you know, it's like the space between the bars defines the

468
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:29,660
cage. It's the bubbles and the cavity in the sponge that defines the sponge.

469
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,860
Right. Otherwise, it's just the start to compacted.

470
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,260
Right. Yeah. Then it's just so.

471
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:40,000
Yeah. Yeah. So the way it's created with the vacuum or putting it in the freezer for

472
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,180
two or three minutes is so unique and you will never experience anything like it.

473
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:47,460
Also, the almond flour with heat releases moisture.

474
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,780
So as you're cooking, you know, if you overcook something that's bread like where it

475
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,980
gets dry. Oh, absolutely.

476
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,540
And not just on the outside and crispy.

477
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:57,080
I'm talking about just tastes dry, just dry all the way through.

478
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:01,740
Yeah. Yeah. But when you do when you use the almond flour, which is a flour, it

479
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,980
actually the more you heat it, guess what happens?

480
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,240
The more moisture it releases.

481
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:10,780
So by the time it gets to your plate and whoever is going to eat it, it's still hot.

482
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,220
You know, if something is still hot on your plate, guess what?

483
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,940
It's still cooking. Right.

484
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:21,880
Right. So actually, your last bite will be moisture, more moist than your first bite.

485
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,980
And you're scratching your head.

486
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:27,600
Why? Because when things sit on a plate, they don't taste as good as when they were

487
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,400
freshly served. These are like magic cakes.

488
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,500
And I'm not exaggerating.

489
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,000
Anyone who does this will find it.

490
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,540
Now, you don't even have to be proficient and highly skilled to experience what I'm

491
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:43,320
saying. OK, the yogurt is also part of the leavening because something about the

492
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,660
culture in the yogurt reacts with the leavening.

493
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,680
But I say leavening is the existing baking soda or baking powder mix in the premixed

494
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:54,080
pancake mix. Notice I didn't get into making a pancake mix at all.

495
00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:00,200
Use a premade one. Don't go get the aluminized entremime or by the way, Wal-Mart

496
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,620
used to have a good one that had everything in it.

497
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:06,920
You could actually live while they had powdered eggs, powdered milk, powdered egg

498
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,240
whites, powdered yolks.

499
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:12,360
Never heard of that. It was loaded with protein, like 11 grams of protein.

500
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,360
And they stopped making it's the kind of pancake mix you take with you when you go

501
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,100
camping. All you need is some water and you got like a whole, you know, it's loaded

502
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,940
with protein. It was in a bottle of cream, powdered milk, powdered yolk, powdered

503
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:28,580
white. I've never seen that so much protein loaded in a cake mix.

504
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,320
It looked like a small, it looked like a small detergent bottle, if I remember right.

505
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,940
Right. No, it was a box.

506
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:39,020
Oh, because I remember there's some more wholesome ones.

507
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,820
You could even do this with the cheap Bisquick one.

508
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:45,080
There's a whole, you know, Bisquick one has a very metallic flavor to it.

509
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,460
They use a really cheap aluminized baking soda.

510
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,680
I don't like Bisquick.

511
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,540
Yeah, I don't either. Yeah. But it'll still work.

512
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,540
I've experimented with the crappiest.

513
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,780
Yeah. And I'm not going to get into making a pancake mix from scratch because you need a

514
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:01,820
sifter. If you don't sift your leavening, you're going to, it's not going to taste very

515
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:05,380
good. You need a sifter. So I'm not going to get, I'm actually giving the easy route.

516
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:10,700
Any pancake mix that you already use that, you know, the kind that just says, and by

517
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,860
the way, if you have a pancake mix, it's like the trader just says, add an egg.

518
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:17,060
Do not add an egg. Do not add, never add eggs to pancake mixes.

519
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:22,040
Well, you could. It makes it rubbery because when you overcook an egg, it turns

520
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:25,360
rubbery. I don't care what style of cooking on the egg you do.

521
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,400
Sunnyside up, I'm aware, I guess, rubbery.

522
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,020
Right. Right.

523
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,900
So the amount of time that it takes to properly cook a pancake is way beyond the amount

524
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,340
of time to properly cook an egg.

525
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,680
So you're going to have rubbery pancakes.

526
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:40,260
Never add eggs to pancakes unless it's already in there in powdered form.

527
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:44,420
Just want to state that. Have you guessed that I'm a food aficionado?

528
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,620
Yeah. Anyway.

529
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:51,420
Yeah. You won't hear this. I mean, that's why what really got me on communicating how

530
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:56,140
to prepare delicious food was in the 90s when I started seeing there was a boom of

531
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,740
chefs on TV. And I said, sir, I feel great.

532
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:02,680
Finally, I could because when I go and eat at other people's homes, it was terrible.

533
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,800
When I first started dating my wife, she wanted to introduce me to people and I'd show

534
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,920
up late. Come pick me up at six.

535
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,260
We're going to dinner. I'd be here at six.

536
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,120
Fifty because you're late. I said, why are you late?

537
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,820
I said, because I ate dinner. She goes, why are you dinner?

538
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,120
We're going for dinner. You'll see.

539
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,400
Yeah, you'll see.

540
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,160
I don't eat. These are white people.

541
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,760
I ain't going to eat. You know, I say white people.

542
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:24,080
OK. Yeah. It's not the color of your skin.

543
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,660
It's the food. What they buy.

544
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:31,060
What's what they consider to be food is so processed, so denatured that I can't eat it.

545
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,120
I won't. Right.

546
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,800
I'd rather go without. So anyway.

547
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:40,260
So the reason I got into this is because after I was watching in the 90s and early 2000,

548
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,500
all these cooking shows, I said, oh, my gosh, no one is going to learn how to cook.

549
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:48,380
Watch. There's no one communicating fine points and what needs to be done.

550
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:54,300
So, again, the secret on the pan cake, it's not pancake, it's pan cake,

551
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,140
because it's just like a wonderful sponge cake.

552
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,000
Like it's like wedding cake.

553
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,980
It's like eating wedding cake pancakes.

554
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,220
Right. You know, the reason I stress the wedding cake part is how many times do people buy

555
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,000
wedding cakes? You're supposed to once.

556
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,180
Right. Usually, you know, some wedding cakes cost five grand.

557
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,420
Right. Maybe more.

558
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,320
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, I didn't go that.

559
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,120
Yeah. And I'm not just talking because they're fancy when they make a wedding cake.

560
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,540
They really stress the sponge.

561
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,840
Got to be really high quality.

562
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,240
So everything will be of that quality.

563
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,760
Yeah. You make sure that that thing is presented.

564
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:25,780
Well, it's late.

565
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:34,100
You know, it's swarmed the quality and the flavor, the texture, everything on that has

566
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,240
to be right, you know, with a wedding cake.

567
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,920
So that's what you got.

568
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,240
So anyway, that's the secret.

569
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,920
The secret is the yogurt, the almond flour, some wheat flour.

570
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,920
The wheat flour gives it structure and nuttiness.

571
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,540
And it must after you do a mild stir.

572
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:56,080
And when you stir pancake mix, always stir from bottom to top, not just left to right.

573
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:00,680
Because if you have a strata in there where things are leveled, you know, things in

574
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,960
different stress, some things are at the top and things at the bottom.

575
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,920
If you start left to right, you're not going to get the stuff on the top to mix with the

576
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:11,300
stuff on the bottom. But if you start top to bottom, drop it, lift and then drop and

577
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:15,480
lift. You're going to not only get your left and right going, but you're going to get

578
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,920
everything on the top mixed evenly.

579
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,740
Right. Yeah, that makes sense.

580
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,580
Yeah. Always start top to bottom.

581
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:24,000
When you have a thick, starchy mixture, never stir it like you see on TV.

582
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,060
Don't stir it like you stir sugar and coffee.

583
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,480
Perfect. If the mixture is thick, you always stir top to bottom.

584
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,380
Right. So I learned that from an artist who worked with ink Pantone's and when they

585
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:38,920
would mix the paints, it wouldn't be.

586
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:39,980
You know how paints are mixed.

587
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,920
They drop a drill. You know, it's got the paint mixer spins, you know, left to right.

588
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:47,100
Right. Everything was always mixed top to bottom, you know, bottom to top, you know,

589
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,640
that way to get because it was a much thicker mixture, a gouache kind of stuff anyway.

590
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,440
And I said, well, that's how I'm going to do my pancake mixer.

591
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,220
Like what? I'm like, never mind.

592
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,580
I got it. You know, this is perfect.

593
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:04,780
In other words, mixing top to bottom is the least amount of energy you have to put into

594
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,400
the mixture to get the most amount of mix.

595
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,500
It's the most efficient way.

596
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:13,180
The other more efficient way, if you is, is you just pour it from one container to the

597
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,300
next and let gravity do it for you.

598
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,480
That's another way. And then you have a spatula, you know, like a squeegee spatula, you

599
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,460
know, what do they call those silicone spatulas, rubber spatulas that bakers use a lot.

600
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,840
Yeah. Use a spatula. I call it the squeegee.

601
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,840
And you get one container to the cleaning.

602
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,360
We don't want to be wasteful at all.

603
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:34,380
You could pour it from one to the experiment with your but if you have a tendency to whip

604
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:40,080
things into a frenzy, just pour the mixture left and right to two equal sized

605
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,340
containers and spatula and it goes into the freezer for a minimum of two or three

606
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:50,340
minutes. If you start going for more than two or three minutes, the freezing aspect of

607
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:53,360
the freezer takes over because you can't fight the cold in a freezer.

608
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,020
Right. It's just minus 20 and better.

609
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:01,960
What will happen is you'll start changing the chemistry and you you'll end up you'll get

610
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,160
a clear liquid on top.

611
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,100
That means you've failed.

612
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,320
Right. If you go, let's say you leave it in there for 10 minutes.

613
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,440
OK. Right. Because you got to answer the door.

614
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,640
You'll come back and you'll see is a clear liquid on top.

615
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,540
If you do get that because you left it in the freezer, just sprinkle some powder, some of

616
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:18,620
the pancake mix with the leavening on it and do another quick stir.

617
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,100
Take it out. You're ready to go.

618
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,780
So I just gave you the trouble to fix if you run into that.

619
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:30,260
There you go. So there's the secret of the pan cake and the troubleshooting fix in case

620
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,720
you happen to screw it up a little bit.

621
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,980
You can always you can always get it back.
