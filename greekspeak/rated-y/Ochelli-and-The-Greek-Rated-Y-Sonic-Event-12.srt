1
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:11,440
Sonic Event 12, Ocelli in the Greek, and welcome to it.

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,760
Anyway, glad to have you along, and Greek, how are you this, well, let's see, it is the

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:22,400
evening, it is, it is dark outside, yeah, 29th of the first month, 29th of the first

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,500
month, right, now that's not what the Pope's work schedule says, but, no, they do line up,

5
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,940
that's, I mean, you can't get away from the moon, or the, you know, the moon function,

6
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:38,080
which is the month a lot of people think it's a lunar calendar, it's not, it's not a sun

7
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,700
calendar, it's a, it's, you use, it's kind of like, you know, with the clock, you know,

8
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:47,960
you have the long arm and the short arm, right, and the long arm moves more than the short

9
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,980
arm on the clock, right, so the short arm, let's say, would be the moon, and the long

10
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:57,920
arm would be the sun, so it's a combination of workings, but I would suggest it's, we're

11
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,460
going into the second month in a few days, today would be what you consider a Sabbath,

12
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:09,700
let's say, the seventh day of the week, which is on the 8th, 15th, 22nd, 29th, so that's

13
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,580
just a recap of a recap of a recap.

14
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,920
Right, and, of course, if you've listened to previous Sonics, actually gave a really

15
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,760
great piece of advice about where to mark a day, after all the day, when does it begin

16
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:28,680
at solar noon, and that is more sensible, I gotta thank you, actually, for that little

17
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,340
adjustment in my mind, it is, it's been very helpful, it's, I don't know how to explain

18
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,260
even how it's been helpful, but it's been more helpful, I've been better off with that

19
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:38,520
in my mind.

20
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,320
If someone complains about sleeping until noon, you say, I slept until the day started,

21
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:43,620
right?

22
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,080
Well, there's that.

23
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,080
It's a good thing for the ghetto, you know?

24
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,420
I understand that.

25
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,560
But I'm not trying to get anybody's approval, I'm just saying that in general, I felt less

26
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,920
resistance in my day handling it that way, beginning my day, or my work, or whatever,

27
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,520
at solar noon makes more sense to me.

28
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,400
Right, and it's for this world, when the world changes, it'll be different again.

29
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,800
Well, look, if you're in a different place, what did they used to say, when in Rome, right?

30
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,820
Do as the Romans do.

31
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,520
Well, this world will change, also.

32
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,020
We won't have day and night, as we do now, in the future.

33
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:24,200
That's another discussion, and I can't give it as surely as I give other Greeks speak,

34
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,320
but we could presume, based on what we've been told about it.

35
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,820
Speaking of which, what we've been told about, we were probably talking about hashing over

36
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,440
a few things, and where should we start?

37
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,840
Maybe the thing that got you going just a minute ago was the difference between the

38
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,600
state and the government.

39
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:49,440
Well, yes, and the reason is that, I've heard you mention this, and certainly it makes sense

40
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:56,340
to me, but I have no idea how to explain it, and I don't have a reference for precisely,

41
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,260
you know what I'm saying?

42
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,040
Easy.

43
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:06,640
Okay, a government is the function, a centralized place, usually for people to meet and greet

44
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,940
or distribute things, right?

45
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:13,260
Like, if everyone needs a road, instead of giving it to someone here, all the money to,

46
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:17,820
or whatever, to build the road, you form a council or a place where the money goes there,

47
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:22,820
and it's public, and everyone knows what's going on, and then when it's time to build

48
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:29,160
the road, someone from there, meaning the government, or the public, has everything

49
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,780
above board.

50
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,760
That's basically how it works, however it's set up, and a government can be also a monarchy.

51
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:39,100
It could be with council.

52
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:45,060
Usually all governments are pretty similar, it's just that they decapitated, like in the

53
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:51,300
middle 18th century, 1700s, they began removing monarchies, because the monarchy represented

54
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,280
like the divine family, right?

55
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,560
I always felt a discomfort with that, because what was it?

56
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,400
You're anointed leader, and here we go, right?

57
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,800
So, these people claim to have been anointed, now that only means to have oil placed on

58
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:14,680
your head, as far as I could reason, but it implies that you are, what, touched by God,

59
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,120
right?

60
00:04:15,399 --> 00:04:17,079
Well, yeah, and it's more than that.

61
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:20,839
It's a lineage thing, unless it's established, and then there's a lineage from that, but

62
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:29,480
one thing I would suggest is the entire universe runs on an imperial rule, where you have ...

63
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:29,720
Hierarchy?

64
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,260
Hierarchy?

65
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:35,880
Yeah, let's say you have a king, and you have other people below the king, if they're so

66
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:41,460
spread apart, because of their distance, they could also be called kings, but they're really

67
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,420
not, because they answer to a central figure themselves, right?

68
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:50,720
So this is the imperial overall overarching, you see it in Star Wars, you see it in other

69
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,640
places like that.

70
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:59,240
The model of the imperial model is the most respected and top individual, it doesn't necessarily

71
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,260
have to be anointing, as we see in, let's say, older religious texts, or things like

72
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:11,340
that, it's just a domination, it could be the first one, meaning the universe, and on

73
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:11,920
and on, right?

74
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,740
A creator being appointed by agency, let's say.

75
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,480
So in essence, the decapitation ...

76
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:25,720
Wait a second, because appointed by agency, let me dig into that a sec, because I think

77
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,860
of it in some cases where fiefdoms are sort of established, right?

78
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:38,340
And you have somebody who, by force, or ... let me think here ... like Alexander the Great,

79
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,340
for instance, right?

80
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:44,520
He would conquer places, and you had to change names, and you had to change certain things,

81
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:50,140
but he didn't change all their customs, and yet he would be considered the overall ruler,

82
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:58,020
but in some cases he would leave, say, the previous rulers in place, but they were subjugated

83
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:58,680
under him.

84
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,180
What about that?

85
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:09,700
They did not, let's say, advertise the subjugation as much as their handing over authority.

86
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,500
And they were still the kings as such, but he just was above them.

87
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,060
Not always.

88
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:23,520
In other words, the way we brought up Alexander, what's interesting, it's not like the Americans

89
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,160
are doing now, going all over the world as a police enforcer for the UN and the monetary

90
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,300
central bankers.

91
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,300
Well, and then they just leave behind an outpost and then comes in the banks.

92
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:39,400
Yeah, they came in and they offered culture first, and if you took the culture, you're

93
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:39,660
okay.

94
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:44,660
And then if you didn't take the culture, they offered you military help, ha, ha, ha.

95
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,040
Get it?

96
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,120
Military help was taking out your military.

97
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,000
So it was indirect.

98
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,920
The history that we're getting is not very good.

99
00:06:52,660 --> 00:07:00,920
Most of the famous battles that you hear were when you had these clashes, let's say, between

100
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:06,220
the Persians and the Greeks, and the various movements back and forth.

101
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,780
Those are like, that's not how things start.

102
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:16,580
There's a lot of, how would you say, ambassadorship and dealings and negotiations, and when they

103
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,280
fail, they would fight.

104
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,580
But also the fight was considered a rite of passage.

105
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,360
Like sometimes they would have their heroes go and fight, right?

106
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,480
Instead of the entire army.

107
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:35,600
Well, yeah, like, look, what do you call it, Achilles, right, famously would be offered

108
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,380
up as the hero, and then they would put him up against their best soldier.

109
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,140
And the battle could be decided that way, in an honorable way, and that was that, right?

110
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,140
Right, and that was based on culture, again, not necessarily just pure might.

111
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,520
So pure might never works, because eventually it's shown for what it is, and people just

112
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,080
eventually will not comply with it.

113
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,660
Well, it's also difficult to maintain a stranglehold.

114
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,900
I mean, look, even if you attempt to maintain a stranglehold, but you don't want to kill

115
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,340
the thing you're strangling, kind of hard to do, right?

116
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,360
I mean, just practically.

117
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,940
Well, we could discuss the history, we weren't there, we can only surmise what we're being

118
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:16,980
told about it, it's not true, but if we go and study how the cultures mingled and evolved

119
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:21,600
after the conquests, we see it's a very different way than we imagined it happening.

120
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:27,000
But one thing, let's just fast forward to the modern era, because making it more tangible

121
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,940
is probably simpler and easier.

122
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:34,840
I want to give the example of what happened in Switzerland around 2002.

123
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,840
Well, what happened in Switzerland around 2002?

124
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:46,140
You'll see on September 10th, 2002, Switzerland finally joined the UN.

125
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,240
Why did they wait so long?

126
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,840
The reason why is because the status of the government in Switzerland is the government

127
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:03,120
in Switzerland considered the people, their citizenry, that's where the citizen with a

128
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,160
capital C, let's say, not a US citizen, it was the only country in the world that held

129
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,060
this, they considered that each citizen was free on their own and a sovereign on their

130
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:17,980
own, and whether they had seven or eight or 20 million people living in Switzerland, I

131
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:22,240
don't think it's that high, the government considered them to be a free people, each

132
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:30,320
individual one, so they could not directly go and join the UN, because each person that

133
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,860
lived in Switzerland had to get their own ambassador, so you couldn't send eight million

134
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,600
or 10 million or 20 million ambassadors to the UN, it didn't work that way.

135
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,880
Well, that's impossible if you've only got eight million people, I mean, what, unless

136
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,620
everyone is going to serve as their own ambassador, which is not...

137
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,020
And they could not, the government said we cannot represent our people because each citizen

138
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:48,580
is free.

139
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,520
So what happened after 9-11, they really came down on Switzerland and said, listen, you

140
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:58,760
need to change the status of your people, so they become, you're the suzerain and they're

141
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:03,040
subjects or, you know, in other words, change the definition of citizen so they become property,

142
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:09,400
so then you could just represent one representative, just like, you know, General Motors can send

143
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,940
one representative to represent their cars, because the cars are not people, they're property,

144
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,240
right?

145
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:14,600
Right.

146
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:20,220
So, yeah, so whenever you see someone joining a worldwide organization, meaning a country

147
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,060
or a government, that means that their people are now considered property, because if they

148
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,400
weren't property, you couldn't properly represent them.

149
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:33,200
So what they tried also was a series of elections, if, mock elections, like if we were to make

150
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,300
an ambassador for Switzerland, everything that he would say in the UN had to be voted

151
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,580
on by the population.

152
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,480
That's really impractical.

153
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,780
So if Switzerland got an ambassador to go to the UN and he had, let's say, two paragraphs

154
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:52,140
with five points on it, everyone in Switzerland had to publicly vote on what he should say.

155
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,820
So it became impractical again, right?

156
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,020
So they couldn't work it.

157
00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:00,440
So the ultimate thing was, after 9-11, they sent people in there, because 9-11 was a worldwide

158
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:05,300
thing just like the pandemic was, and they went in there and they said, look, just change

159
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,200
the paperwork so that people agree to becoming property, right?

160
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:14,540
Just when I mean property, I mean like property, you know, just like inanimate objects, slaves

161
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,640
is another way to call it, a breathing, you know, property.

162
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,040
And they did that.

163
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,820
It was very, I've been researching that.

164
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,780
It's very interesting to see how they did that.

165
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,980
They did it through subscription and pledging.

166
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,320
And they sent out postcards and things that you signed and sent back.

167
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,380
And if you didn't send it, if you sent, here's the thing.

168
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,680
I want to give the, show you how the legal system works.

169
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:36,660
Okay.

170
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,840
What I mean by pledging.

171
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,380
When you're pledging, it means you're in a situation where you can't win.

172
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:51,300
That's not the direct academic definition, but pledging is really, if you have to pledge,

173
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,500
you end up in a situation where you're always going to lose, and this is how it works with

174
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,240
the legal system.

175
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:55,720
Okay.

176
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:59,960
I'll give an example, and I'll go back to Switzerland with the cards that they sent

177
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,380
to people.

178
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,300
All right.

179
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,020
The Titanic, which was really the Olympic, which sunk for insurance purposes, right?

180
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,320
Okay.

181
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,120
All the people on board that died.

182
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,460
By the way, I just want to put this out there, and I can't give any more details, so I'll

183
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,620
give what I know about it.

184
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,060
Crashing into an iceberg does not sink a ship.

185
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:24,000
You could look at modern day icebreakers going through ice, and they go through at like 20

186
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,080
knots, and they're not, I mean, yeah, they're reinforced and all that, but they break the

187
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,260
ice.

188
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:28,760
Okay.

189
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:34,460
What I mean by that is if you were to go up to an iceberg right now with a big bend, a

190
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:39,980
saw that's 10 feet, a blade that's 10 feet long, and you cut a chunk of the iceberg out

191
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,500
that was two feet by two feet by two feet, right?

192
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,500
Pretty big chunk, right?

193
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:49,740
If I pick it up, Chuck, let's say I do it, and you're there, I'll pick up that two foot

194
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,120
by two foot piece of ice and smash you over the head with it.

195
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:52,960
You're going to laugh.

196
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:57,100
You're going to say, I don't even feel anything because it's lighter than snow.

197
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:02,440
It's not like what we're used to living back east where things freeze up, and it's really

198
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:02,740
hard.

199
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,880
Your wheels could get stuck in it, and it takes a chisel to break.

200
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,840
No, nothing like that.

201
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:14,520
The icebergs are not made of ... Anyway, just like the World Trade Center wasn't brought

202
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,680
down with jet fuel, right?

203
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:16,380
Okay.

204
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,200
Anyway, this is the Titanic.

205
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:27,020
Cunard, which was White Star Lines, the attorneys said, wow, we've got 1,500 people.

206
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:32,460
By the way, when you see 5-1 or 1-5, that's an Illuminati, Freemason number signaling.

207
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,940
That's why when you read the newspaper, it's like Area 51.

208
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:41,640
When you look at the popular news, especially around Hollywood, this guy has a $15 million

209
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:47,420
fine, or this one is 51 million, or it's 5.1 million.

210
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,140
People look for the 33, but also look for the 5-1.

211
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,620
1,500 people supposedly perished on the Titanic.

212
00:13:54,620 --> 00:14:00,280
The legal department went into full steam to release the company of liability of being

213
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,600
sued, because it was clearly a mechanical failure, what they tell everyone.

214
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,700
If there's a mechanical failure, you're in a hotel and the ceiling collapses, you can

215
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,700
sue the hotel, right?

216
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,220
People didn't commit suicide, so they could sue the ... Okay, so this is how they got out

217
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:15,720
of it legally.

218
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:21,780
What they did, and this is what pledging is, pledging essentially is where you are counted

219
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:25,140
as a debtor, and a debtor has no rights, by the way.

220
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:31,420
This is how they established everyone that was aboard that ship to be a debtor.

221
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:36,580
The attorneys quickly got together these little postcards, and they sent whoever they could

222
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:44,460
through address, through the mail, a one-cent laundry bill to everyone that was on the ship.

223
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,380
Now, here's the deal.

224
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:53,780
Whoever paid the one-cent admitted that they were a debtor, and if you didn't pay the one-cent,

225
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,720
you acquiesced to being a debtor, to admitting a debtor, so basically the legal department,

226
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:03,320
when they tried to sue the White Star Line, they said, they have no legal standing.

227
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:09,800
Okay, okay, so let me just make sure I understood what you just said, okay, because it almost

228
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,680
sounds ridiculous.

229
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,220
It is, but that's how the ... Welcome to the legal system.

230
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,940
I got you, but I just want to be real clear here.

231
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:21,300
So all right, if I send you a bill for, let's just use the dollar.

232
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,940
Everybody says, oh, one dollar, right?

233
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,140
You know, oh, the guy was able to buy a house for a dollar.

234
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,900
He was like, okay, we'll use the dollar.

235
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,920
So I send you a bill for a dollar.

236
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:35,780
What I'm doing now is trapping you in a situation here, because if you received it, if I can

237
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:40,540
prove that you received it, right, you don't pay.

238
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,060
If the proof is brought up, but in this case, it's not.

239
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,800
If you paid the one cent laundry bill, all they do, it didn't matter, because it just

240
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,660
showed that you're a debtor, because if you weren't a debtor, they wouldn't have sent

241
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,520
Why would you pay the bill?

242
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,380
Well, why would you pay the bill if you didn't know it?

243
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,820
So obviously, you owed a debt, boom, okay.

244
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,100
But on the other hand ...

245
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,080
Because it was based on a pledge, not based on a true bill.

246
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,560
These were not true bills, so now we're going to get into some crazy legal stuff.

247
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,340
Well, just hang on before we get out of that, because like I said, if you paid it, then

248
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:14,400
you obviously admit that you owed it, because you had to satisfy it, therefore it was a

249
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:14,560
debt.

250
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,300
I get that part.

251
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:20,740
But if you can't show that I received that bill, turn it around, you sent me the bill,

252
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,500
how do you know I got that bill?

253
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,980
Well, if it doesn't come back, then just like if you don't show up for a court date,

254
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,420
they find you in default, right?

255
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,960
For example ...

256
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,200
So I'm in default, even if I don't know I got this thing, because they issued it.

257
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,660
I mean, that's what it comes down to?

258
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,420
Yeah, pretty much.

259
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,920
That's what pledging is about, right.

260
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,540
Okay, well, that sounds to me like you have no ...

261
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:50,580
If you deal with the legal rascals, they don't go by law, and it's pretty clear.

262
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,680
They don't have to say it, but they say it a thousand different ways without saying

263
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,960
we don't use the law, right?

264
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,180
Actually, they do sometimes.

265
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:01,000
I've seen a federal case where someone was bringing up laws, and the judge says, stop,

266
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,840
you're using law.

267
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,160
You cannot use law in this courtroom, but it never becomes public.

268
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,180
I've actually seen a statement by the Supreme Court that effectively said that it doesn't

269
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:16,119
matter that scientifically or whatever that ... The whole thing about declaring a tomato

270
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,300
a vegetable, right?

271
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,680
Oh, no, no, no.

272
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,520
I mean, this has nothing to do with the subject matter.

273
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,060
Oh, no, no.

274
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:22,859
The operation.

275
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:23,560
Yeah, no, no.

276
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:26,920
I'm pointing out the way the operation works here is that they put this thing through,

277
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:30,660
and they basically admit it doesn't matter what the thing actually is.

278
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,020
We have issued a precedent.

279
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,680
That precedent says this, therefore, that's it.

280
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:43,360
Well, the thing is, the Supreme Court is a hoax, by the way, how the people have it

281
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,680
in their mind, because it's just an appellate court.

282
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,040
They cannot make a decision.

283
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:53,840
That's why they don't say Supreme Court ... They say rulings, and it always has to get kicked

284
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,960
back to the district court that it appealed from.

285
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,200
It's a completely flawed process.

286
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,180
It's incomplete, but that's how people accept it.

287
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,540
Well, I was just trying to approach it in this way, because you're setting a precedent

288
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,040
by doing this with the bill, right?

289
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:07,780
The laundry bill.

290
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,920
You're setting some kind of precedent here.

291
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:14,080
It's just that I don't understand how, if somebody's not informed about being a debtor,

292
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,340
and it's not a true debt ...

293
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,180
It doesn't matter.

294
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:22,500
It's whoever has the more competent records, and in this case, the people that are being,

295
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:30,760
let's say, a claim is lodged against, they have to prove that the claim can't hold.

296
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,520
The way you do that is by having a more competent record.

297
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:39,800
Usually in court, when it comes to financial stuff, the more competent record holds, but

298
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,700
I just wanted to throw this about legal precedents, by the way.

299
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,300
They don't go by law.

300
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,020
In 1938, they said that case law will do, so you see the attorneys, they always list

301
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,220
these cases, right?

302
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,020
They say that this guy lost, right?

303
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:58,340
Well, the thing is, if you study a lot of these cases that they cite, the guy lost because

304
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,260
he had a flat tire, and he couldn't make it to court on time.

305
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:01,740
Oh, no.

306
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,000
It doesn't matter why he lost.

307
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:08,000
It's just a matter of if he lost, and they just make the, look, this case is like this

308
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,240
case, therefore, done.

309
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,360
That's pretty much what they do, right?

310
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:18,080
The system of pledging was also brought forward to Woodrow Wilson, who actually, most of his

311
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:23,260
administration was run by his wife, the biggest mass murderer in world history, by the way,

312
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,440
and then FDR, by the way.

313
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,960
Of course, you know what?

314
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:32,640
Because of the American army flu, they call it the Spanish flu, he's the one that approved

315
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,140
it.

316
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,560
I think Stalin's a close third in modern history, but yeah, go ahead.

317
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:42,560
Yeah, close third, because Woodrow Wilson would be over 100 million, and Stalin would

318
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,300
probably be in 50, 60 million.

319
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:49,880
I think more recent records would prove out that he's at about 70 or 80, but go ahead.

320
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:50,560
Yeah.

321
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:56,880
Anyway, so this thing, what they did with Switzerland is they finally got enough people

322
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,700
approved that you could call Switzerland now a piece of property that could enter the United

323
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,580
Nations Club.

324
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,540
Okay, so how do you change?

325
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,400
I'm sorry.

326
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:13,880
It's very hard, so I've got to ask these questions, and I'm hoping that it'll help somebody else

327
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,000
hearing this, because it might fly right by somebody.

328
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:22,220
How do you take a state of ... Forget the word state, excuse me.

329
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:29,040
How do you take a circumstance where you have people that are recognizable as their own

330
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,820
free sovereigns?

331
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,400
Because you hear this word sovereign a lot.

332
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,100
Well, they hear sovereign citizen, which is an oxymoron.

333
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,340
Oh, no, not just sovereign citizen.

334
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,080
You hear sovereign, sovereignty, the discussion of you can be a sovereign.

335
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:44,800
There's a whole community of people out there that have these discussions constantly, and

336
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,920
it's not just the American sovereign citizen movement.

337
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,700
I'm telling you, worldwide, people discuss this, okay, about sovereignty and being a

338
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,840
citizen of the planet, and things like all these different machinations about it.

339
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:01,760
But again, you had a circumstance here where in Switzerland, the individual living on that

340
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,120
land could be recognized, and it was the only place in the world where they could be recognized

341
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,240
as a sovereign.

342
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,460
They are-

343
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,640
Right, by their government.

344
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,500
Their own ruler according to their government, right?

345
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:13,720
Okay.

346
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:21,900
So, in that case, how do you transform that into ... I mean, is the answer as simple

347
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,960
as it was pledged?

348
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:23,720
Mm-hmm.

349
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,460
I mean, okay.

350
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,180
You didn't know what you were signing up for.

351
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,200
But here's the thing-

352
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,120
Basically, they sent out a bunch of postcards.

353
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:30,400
Yeah.

354
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,520
No, I get that, but-

355
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,960
And whether you sent it back or not didn't matter.

356
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,680
Yeah, understand, I'm not trying to fight with you.

357
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,380
I'm trying to understand this, because again, I'm still stuck on this laundry bill.

358
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,680
But here's the thing before I send it.

359
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,220
I haven't found the direct way that they did it, you see, because I wasn't there.

360
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:52,640
All the research that I've been doing, what was going on between September 11th, 2001

361
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:58,180
and September 10th, 2002, all I saw was certain activity as such.

362
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,760
People were getting extraordinary things in the mail.

363
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,760
That seems really minimal, but they were not.

364
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,620
To me, they were extraordinary.

365
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,480
This strikes me as extraordinarily important.

366
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,660
This is why I'm asking so many questions, okay?

367
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:14,920
Because this process, if this is the case, this sounds to me like you could do anything

368
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,260
to anybody-

369
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:16,560
Of course.

370
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,960
... with this kind of methodology.

371
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,980
And I mean, it doesn't matter.

372
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,860
I mean, moral parameters are irrelevant here.

373
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,380
Here's the worst part.

374
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:29,060
Before this happened, before Switzerland joined the UN, most other citizens of other countries

375
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:32,820
didn't know how important it was to be part of Switzerland or one of the people of Switzerland.

376
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:38,960
They thought the people of Switzerland, meaning the whole world, was in a similar status as

377
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,140
them.

378
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,580
Like, oh, why aren't they in the UN?

379
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,240
What's wrong?

380
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,860
They didn't comprehend.

381
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,180
So doing this to the Swiss was quite easy.

382
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,600
They didn't complain, by the way.

383
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:46,920
Yeah.

384
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,960
Well, general consensus with Switzerland previous to this is very simple.

385
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,360
Look, they're landlocked.

386
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,700
They're in a circumstance where they're constantly surrounded by people that are in conflict.

387
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:02,060
So what they've had to do is become amicable to everybody in a certain way.

388
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:04,160
So neutrality, right?

389
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:07,120
And basically not going to war.

390
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,160
That was the most clear, observable thing about them, right?

391
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,020
I mean, I'm talking about the pedestrian view of this.

392
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:13,900
Sure.

393
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:18,020
But there's a very simple, practical answer to that.

394
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:22,520
The reason why Switzerland was kept out of everything as it was, because it's the most

395
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:28,160
ancient, known, still functioning access to the underworld, openly functioning.

396
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:34,720
You could access the underworld, the underground civilizations from anywhere if you know where

397
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,520
to access it from.

398
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:42,600
But Switzerland was revered as the most, let's say, open and it was kind of like a hub, kind

399
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,900
of like a Grand Central Station for going into the underworld.

400
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:51,420
And I'm not talking about the ethereal underworld where, we're talking about the underworld

401
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,820
that you can see with your eyes.

402
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,440
No, you're talking about a third dimensional, physical.

403
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,300
Yeah.

404
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:02,240
It's a city where the underground, the beings that have been living there before us, let's

405
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:02,580
just say.

406
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:07,100
That's why when you look at, there's a fellow that used to have a YouTube channel.

407
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,880
He would walk around.

408
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,760
He declared himself homeless, but he wasn't poor and he had all the camera equipment

409
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,180
enough to have a YouTube channel and he walked Switzerland and he'd go through the forest

410
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:22,580
and he'd see just in the middle of nowhere, no trails or anything, a beautiful, ornamental

411
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:28,500
iron gate and you'd see the U.S. Confederate flag on a building in there and it's been

412
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,600
flying for 300 years.

413
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,380
So where did the U.S. Confederates get their flag?

414
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,460
So all this stuff.

415
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:45,260
So, for example, the flag of Greece came directly from the VSO, the Dutch East India Company.

416
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:51,040
Most of these flags were put in place by the Dutch East India Company all over the world.

417
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:58,220
If you look at, for example, the way anyone looks up the Dutch East India Company, that

418
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,040
is a model of the modern state.

419
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:06,640
There's a graph, how wealthy was the Dutch East India Company and they have a graph in

420
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:12,440
today's money, let's say, valued or price and then they have next to it a graph of all

421
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,880
the largest corporations today and this is still bigger.

422
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:20,180
I think you have to add up like the top three or four largest corporations to get close

423
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,040
to where that was.

424
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,640
To make it commensurate with the size or wealth of that.

425
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:23,840
Sure, yeah.

426
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:31,320
So what they did is they would hire some pretty barbaric people to go in and deal with the

427
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:37,120
natives but usually they convinced them to transfer the paper money so then the Dutch

428
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,320
East India Company would pretty much give them ledgers and paper to get their goods,

429
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,160
whatever it was.

430
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:41,480
Right.

431
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,100
Pretty easy.

432
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:47,140
So ink was important to the Dutch East India Company, paper was important to them.

433
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:51,200
Pretty interesting course of events.

434
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:55,560
No one really talks about it but it's such a behemoth of an organization.

435
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:03,220
But in other words, the state here, so what happened was Switzerland went from a pretty

436
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:09,280
much a sovereign state, not a sovereign state, sorry, a sovereign people with a government

437
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,460
to a sovereign state.

438
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:16,480
A sovereign state, when you hear sovereign state like the UN is sovereign states, it's

439
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,320
kind of like the word federal reserve.

440
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,040
It's neither federal nor does it have reserves.

441
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:27,880
So sovereign means that they're a corporation and a state means they're part of a member

442
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,700
club.

443
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:29,540
Okay.

444
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:34,420
Like the UN is a members only club for sovereign states to bring their property.

445
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:40,320
So in essence, the government is what people use as a function, as a central authority

446
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,800
because it benefits them, right, to have that.

447
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:50,320
It's a neutral central authority and also you can put certain things on it to perform

448
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:55,960
certain duties like issue money and hold a military and defend borders and whatever,

449
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,080
right, form an army and a navy.

450
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,540
But what I'm suggesting here is since the Dutch East India Company and recently what

451
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:11,180
happened in Switzerland is that the UN, all it is, is a member for these states which

452
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:16,380
are not really states because they come in holding people as property.

453
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,240
So when people become property, you're a slave.

454
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,760
But that's a bad word to use, right?

455
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,780
So anyway, they kind of coached it that way.

456
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:32,000
So in essence, a government is a centralized authority that is there to benefit you and

457
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,720
a state is what flavor it takes on and usually the flavor that it takes on is what's been

458
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:43,780
tried and true throughout the world through recent times and borrowing from ancient history.

459
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:49,620
And the main way that it's being done since the early 20th century is through a system

460
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,320
of pledging.

461
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:55,280
There is a speech that was done to – it was a written speech.

462
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:00,380
I think it was Mendel House did it to Woodrow Wilson and he says that now we're going

463
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:04,260
to – this is right before the Federal Reserve Act or during the Federal Reserve Act passing

464
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:05,540
1913.

465
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:11,360
He says we're going to establish a system in America that the people will be required

466
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,620
to pledge their biological property to us otherwise they won't be able to work or

467
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,260
live here, right?

468
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,880
This is like I'm prefacing, okay?

469
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,000
So this is the type of state that you have.

470
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:30,420
So usually what happens is the system of the state, right, which you got a flavor of.

471
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:35,980
I think the people listening kind of understand enough of it, is over – has taken over

472
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:39,740
the government's functions and any lawful authority the government has.

473
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:45,220
So what they've done with modern states, which is the system of pledging where the

474
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:51,780
people are no longer – they're no longer people, they're property and they are represented,

475
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,220
right?

476
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,580
It's a representative form of government, indirect.

477
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,820
By the way, today when they speak of people, they're speaking of themselves, meaning

478
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,660
the administrators of the state, not you.

479
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,700
You have no rights in legal or law.

480
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,020
That's why when you go to a court, it's all case law.

481
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:09,780
They can't use law.

482
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,800
Then they do quote the law but it doesn't apply because if you look at the definitions,

483
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,920
it doesn't apply to you.

484
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,280
So it's a long story.

485
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,060
I'm not saying that the laws don't apply to you.

486
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,060
Go do what you want.

487
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:24,140
But I'm saying that the way that it's being run, no, they don't apply to you, right?

488
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:28,560
Just like if you go to a doctor and he puts a cuff on your arm and inflates it and looks

489
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:32,760
at a fancy dial and tells you you have whatever blood pressure, that doesn't apply to you.

490
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,600
That applies to him.

491
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,480
Well, even though it doesn't – okay.

492
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,460
So even though it doesn't exist, let me ask you a strange reversal question.

493
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:46,820
Theoretically, if there was a collective organization, right, that actually represented the will

494
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:52,400
of the people and that's what it did, would we still use the same terms to describe it

495
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,180
that we use today?

496
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,080
Sure.

497
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:58,940
Well, look, for example, the Federal Reserve is not federal and it has no reserves.

498
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:09,160
You could actually use that to let's say describe and somewhat explain the monetary

499
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,380
system of the US Treasury when it was substance-backed.

500
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:17,060
So if you went to a place where they held the gold to back up the money, you could say

501
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,300
that's our Federal Reserve.

502
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,540
But it's not the Federal Reserve, right?

503
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,240
Okay.

504
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:26,620
You see how the name becomes – we see this often where a name – well, like, you know

505
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,660
what an example would be?

506
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,220
Windows.

507
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,040
Okay.

508
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:29,520
Right?

509
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:29,940
Windows.

510
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,380
Is it an architectural term or a computer term?

511
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:32,980
Well, both.

512
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:33,560
Very different.

513
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,120
Same word.

514
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,300
Same word, right.

515
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,900
This is how it's based.

516
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:44,300
Religions, this was all perfected with religious schemes through the centuries, by the way.

517
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:49,460
Religious schemes through the centuries went from gods to God, right?

518
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:56,120
So God is not the gods, but we only have records and dealings with gods, never with God.

519
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,880
So which one is it?

520
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,280
Well, now you're confusing me, right?

521
00:30:59,520 --> 00:30:59,780
Good.

522
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,500
If you're confused, you're doing great.

523
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:01,940
You see?

524
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:02,140
That's great.

525
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:03,560
Okay.

526
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:10,800
So in essence, this is something that has gotten to the point where the concept of an

527
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,540
egregore where most people – let's say a group of people get together and they have

528
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,980
a thought form, a meme, it actually materializes, right?

529
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,280
By induction, let's say.

530
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,160
This is what's going on right now.

531
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,740
So there's no way you're going to change this or break free from it.

532
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:30,120
The thing is you stay out of its way and don't get involved unless you want to because if

533
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:35,840
you want to get involved with their actions, you can prosper materially within their credit

534
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,000
systems and all that, right?

535
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,280
It's called working the system.

536
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,420
You hear that all the time, right?

537
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:39,660
Oh, yeah.

538
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:39,920
Right.

539
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:40,640
Yeah.

540
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:45,480
I mean, I've shown people who are millionaires years ago how to go get what they call food

541
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,760
stamps or EBT cards.

542
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,360
I said it has nothing to do with your income.

543
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,900
No one has any income until you write down that you do.

544
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:56,760
All of these government benefits they give to quote-unquote people that are of low income

545
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,380
or poor, let's say, has nothing to do with how much you make.

546
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,780
That's just like addressing.

547
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,700
It has to do with the birth certificate.

548
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:07,780
So I've showed people that were millionaires but they don't own a car dealership.

549
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,280
I said this is because they wanted to learn how the government system works.

550
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:16,840
So just go in there and just give them a certified copy of the birth certificate and

551
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,960
say you need this particular – don't even fill out the application.

552
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,040
Just hold the title up, whatever benefit you wanted.

553
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,320
You go into a social security office, they have all those benefit packages you sign up

554
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:26,720
for, right?

555
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,020
Right.

556
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,020
Just grab a bunch of them and put a diagonal line through the face on everything and staple

557
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:36,840
your birth certificate at the top, the one that you get, and say you want these benefits

558
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:41,640
applied to this document right here and you should give that to the clerk and they don't

559
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,640
know what you're talking about.

560
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,760
You're talking to someone too low on the totem pole.

561
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:50,720
Usually they tell you you have to wait until the person that knows what you're – comes

562
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,140
around.

563
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:55,400
When you finally see them, an administrator, you hand it to them and they'll look at you

564
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,140
and they look at the paper.

565
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:59,560
They look at you, look at the paper, look at you, look at the paper, okay.

566
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,840
I said I don't think it's going to happen.

567
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:08,120
One day I was telling them, I said, I don't think you're going to get those Arizona

568
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,520
teas you like drinking all the time and butter and whatever.

569
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:16,120
I saw him one day with an Arizona tea and I said, yeah, is that a new flavor?

570
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,920
He says, yeah, a new flavor and I got it from my EBT card.

571
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,900
By the way, you can't buy butter with an EBT.

572
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:21,700
This guy's a millionaire.

573
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,120
It has nothing to do with your income.

574
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,880
I mean millionaire in social standings, right?

575
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:28,400
I understand.

576
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:33,300
It has nothing to do – it's all a – you know how I said they put out – what did

577
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:33,620
I call it?

578
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:34,780
Markers or metrics.

579
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:40,280
You know, like in the world, if you use the word I believe in God or Jesus or have a

580
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:48,120
nice day or debt, those are metrics and the more people that use those words, that means

581
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:52,920
that those people don't know anything what's going on and you're safe, meaning you, meaning

582
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,480
the administrative side, right?

583
00:33:55,020 --> 00:34:00,240
If you see people using language accurately, those are the dangerous ones, right?

584
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,720
Because you know, the pen is mightier than the sword.

585
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:08,080
So anyway, I just wanted to cover those things because the state and the government are completely

586
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:08,920
two different things.

587
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:17,620
Just like when you say you're Christian or Jewish or whatever, to me, if you – usually

588
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:20,820
when someone – I said, yeah, are you religious?

589
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:24,860
You believe part of any religion and when they say what they are, whether Christian or Jewish

590
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:29,040
for example, I ask them again, are you sure you're Jewish or Christian?

591
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:33,639
You know, you're part of that faith and I ask them again and if they say it two or

592
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,760
three times, yes, I am.

593
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,780
To me, I translate that in my Babelfish Universal Translator.

594
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:45,199
It says this person doesn't know a damn thing about the scriptures of the Bible at

595
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:45,400
all.

596
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,980
They have no comprehension, right?

597
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:53,340
Because there's no way you can have comprehension of what they call the Bible, even the piss

598
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,920
poor King James Version and call yourself a Christian or Jewish.

599
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:56,600
There's no way.

600
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,380
It's not possible.

601
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,240
So, it's a metric.

602
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:01,080
You know, they were fed that line, you know.

603
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,680
An example of that is there's a couple of people I've run into.

604
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,220
Some even have YouTube channels and some that I know that are experts in the Koran and know

605
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,200
it really well and are faithful.

606
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,500
But if you ask them what religion you are, you know what they say, no, I'm not part

607
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,140
of any religion.

608
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,120
You say, come on, you're Muslim.

609
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,160
No, I'm not Muslim.

610
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,100
You get it?

611
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:22,720
Okay.

612
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,500
So, if someone says, I'm a Muslim, it means you know nothing, you have no comprehension

613
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,480
of the Koran.

614
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,660
Do you see how easy these metrics work?

615
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:35,980
Well, yes, but it's a little unclear.

616
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:43,900
I'll tell you why, because you kind of ask me this question when you and I first met.

617
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:48,460
I was just thinking of that, about, you know, what it is I consider myself.

618
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:51,700
And I told you I really don't have one of those labels.

619
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,860
It doesn't, none of them make sense to me.

620
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:01,040
I said, if you had to pin me down to a singular word, I might use the word pagan, but that's

621
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,960
only because that's the most easily understood version of what I might be.

622
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,240
But I don't subscribe to any of this stuff.

623
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:10,420
Yeah, exactly.

624
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,980
It's just a matter of, I've studied a lot of it, and I don't claim to have full comprehension

625
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:19,320
of, well, any of it, really.

626
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:24,900
Well, really, the religion is what you do regularly, and it also, how do you interface

627
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,540
with the non-material things?

628
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,360
Well, right, but you weren't asking about my...

629
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:33,260
But you, see, religion is your regular habits, but you weren't asking me about my regular

630
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,280
habits when you asked that question, you see.

631
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:39,120
That's why I said I don't have a definition for you, because, you know...

632
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:39,380
Oh, sure.

633
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,220
But the reason I'm saying this, because this is...

634
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,320
I mean, religiously, I'm a smoker.

635
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,020
I mean, you know, I smoke.

636
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:49,940
Well, I'm not a smoker, because in order to be smoking, you have to be on fire.

637
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,340
If you're using cigarettes, you're a sucker.

638
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,060
You're sucking.

639
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:53,900
You're not smoking.

640
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:57,680
That was the next part of our conversation that day, was, I recall this.

641
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,860
Right, because in order to be smoking, it means you're on fire, and I don't never look

642
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,360
forward to that kind of condition.

643
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:06,620
But they call this, generally speaking, they call this act smoking.

644
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,200
That's another metric.

645
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:14,360
Like, back in the old days, they'd ask you on the airplane, do you want smoking or non-smoking?

646
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:18,120
And I'd say, which one flies better, right?

647
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,640
Yeah, good question there.

648
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,180
Yeah, so, anyway...

649
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:27,300
Yeah, so I do actually suck on cigarettes regularly, and that's a fairly religious activity.

650
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,800
Yeah, and I think we've explained there's no lung cancer attached to tobacco use, right?

651
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:35,000
Any more than anyone else, right?

652
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:40,140
So yeah, it was the nuclear testing, the eye-breathing, the ionized particles, and this is easily

653
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:40,960
substantiated.

654
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:47,520
If you can get occurrences of lung cancer since the 1950s by state, there's nothing in

655
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,620
California to mention.

656
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,960
Everything is downwind, meaning from Nevada to the east, east of Nevada.

657
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:56,120
I'm only the second generation of my family born in this country, right?

658
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:02,200
So I've got to tell you that, although men seem to die in my family line fairly young,

659
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,220
I'm actually a rather old man.

660
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:09,800
However, the women, regardless of whether they were smoking or sucking on tobacco,

661
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:18,200
some of them lived to be, you know, 100, 90, 103, no lung cancer, and smoking every day,

662
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,700
you know, commonly smoking.

663
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:26,200
Things like lung cancer or cancer and blood pressure and certain things like diabetes

664
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:32,700
and religion, those things are all fictions ingrained in society.

665
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:39,260
What's interesting is we're taught by academia to view the ancients as being ignorant, and

666
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,400
by showing what the ancients partook in, what thought forms, and actually they were far

667
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,380
more advanced.

668
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:51,140
Geographically, but I'm just saying geographically, I take note that the family members that I

669
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:54,740
had did not get these things that weren't born here.

670
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:59,000
If they were children elsewhere and they came here, they participated in these activities

671
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,740
another 80 years and lived that long.

672
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,480
Sure.

673
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:08,160
Well, the yattricide, you know, being death by doctor, well, yattricide could also mean

674
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,460
killing the doctor, but the treatment is the disease here.

675
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:17,560
Now, I've been doing some studying recently, recently, let's say a year ago, and I put

676
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,000
it down after three or four months.

677
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:25,260
If you can get by the Google algorithms, you could find some pretty good information.

678
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:29,880
There's about a million people a year that die, they say, from direct medical neglect.

679
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,980
You've actually lowered the number to 300,000, which can't be.

680
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,260
Which can't be correct at all.

681
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:38,280
And I'll tell you, I've had people argue to me that they've done research enough, and

682
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:43,560
not just through the internet or through algorithms, that I count as fairly intelligent, who have

683
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:48,860
argued to me that, quite truthfully, regardless of the body counts they give you for wars,

684
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:54,100
in the 20th century, regardless of the bloodshed, which there was a significant amount through

685
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:59,860
conflict, more people died through what they would call medical misadventure or death by

686
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:04,620
the doctor, then all of those wars combined, if you combine the figures, you'll have a

687
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,420
higher number in medical deaths.

688
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,180
Oh, sure, by far, even, you know, Vietnam, they said it was 50,000, it was more like

689
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,500
150,000.

690
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:17,600
Yeah, 58,000 is the official count about, and yes, and then they say about a million

691
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:22,260
Vietnamese on the other side, and both numbers are drastically underreported, yes.

692
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:26,680
Yeah, it's also legal, technical, if you're in a helicopter and die in the helicopter,

693
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,880
you're not in Vietnam, right?

694
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,340
Right.

695
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:33,940
And the same thing with all the wars, but the casualties are high, but they're supposed

696
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:37,920
to be high, and it doesn't matter whose side, as long as you have casualties, that's the

697
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,480
whole idea.

698
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,120
Right, nobody ever talks about the Korean conflict and the body count there, which even

699
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:48,060
according to the official numbers is higher than Vietnam, but it is a different, it wasn't

700
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,960
protested the same way, it doesn't get the same attention, but again,

701
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,480
Yeah, it was just an extension, the Korean conflict was an extension of the

702
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,780
World War II, what they call it.

703
00:40:55,780 --> 00:41:01,360
Yeah, there was a small little cessation of hostilities, let's say, but it was the continuation

704
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:06,980
because the Japanese pretty much showed their power by creating the 38th Parallel with nuclear

705
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:13,740
landmines, which by the way, there were publications called the, I think the Atlanta Constitution

706
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:18,500
newspaper, you could look it up, 1946, they talk about the nuclear landmines that they

707
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:24,280
sent Army and Secretary of State observers, Japanese says, you think the two firecrackers

708
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:27,500
you dropped on us is a big deal, and what, send some observers, we're going to show you

709
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,060
something here, because they were stopping the Russian advance, right?

710
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:35,680
Douglas Dietrich is pretty good on all this stuff, I don't endorse him, but he's got good

711
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:42,040
information, so if you could listen to his stuff to a degree, if you could stomach him,

712
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:46,940
and then go on with your own research, that's a good place to start for World War II.

713
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:51,760
Regarding the access to the underworld, by the way, I was thinking, is it Joseph Farrell

714
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,140
that maybe has some stuff online about that, or is that, or am I mixing you up?

715
00:41:55,140 --> 00:42:00,380
No, believe it or not, Donald Marshall, which is the cloning center guy, yeah, but he won't

716
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:06,600
talk about Switzerland directly, but he does reference this kind of concept, yeah, it's

717
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:13,780
also, remember, this is, it's kind of like, what are these sublime, you know, there's

718
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:18,280
two types of censorship, you get a FOIA, and they put the black marker through it,

719
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:25,320
it's obvious, right? Then there's the subtle censorship, where after 9-11, the FBI hired

720
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:29,240
a few hundred people, maybe a few thousand people, to go around wherever they can and

721
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:33,180
buy up all the old dictionaries, and have them republished, changing the definition

722
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:40,460
of ground zero, right? So, it wouldn't be so technical, meaning it's, ground zero is

723
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:46,320
a strict technical term that defines a place above or on the earth that is for atomic or

724
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:52,500
nuclear detonations, and then they try to change it to make it a social thing. I think

725
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:59,140
I went real quick, Diane Sawyer, a day later, the term ground zero was not used until later,

726
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:04,140
there's more confusion, they're saying it wasn't Diane Sawyer that coined it, but I can't

727
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:07,680
say it was, but she was looking for someone to interview, and the area was blocked off,

728
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:13,060
and it was nighttime, and black SUVs with men in black looking guys, meaning black suits

729
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:18,180
with black ties and white shirts and sunglasses at night, and she's looking for someone, she

730
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:21,660
says, oh, you're going in there, where are you going? She goes, ma'am, we can't speak,

731
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:27,120
we're here to look at ground zero, and she says, oh, did you hear them? It's called ground

732
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:33,580
zero, and it started right there, so basically, you know, the probably Secret Service, whatever,

733
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:38,020
you know, group, international group or whatever, to go and see what's going on from a distance,

734
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:42,580
because what's interesting is they had the, anyone that was from any higher up government

735
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:48,820
agency was in full hazmat suits with breathing tanks, so reporters and firemen were looking

736
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:52,740
at these guys coming in, you know, they looked like they came out from underwater with breathing

737
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:55,980
tanks, and they're like, how come we're out here with these little particle masks, and

738
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:59,240
these guys from the FBI are in breathing tanks, what do they know that we don't know, right?

739
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:04,380
Yeah, well, very good question, but also, that means that Weird Al Yankovic's usage

740
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:11,140
of the term ground zero is more accurate than what you have today, quite frankly, he did

741
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:16,980
a song called Christmas Time at Ground Zero, and his usage, it still exists, they didn't,

742
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,260
you know, scrub that, but it's just kind of, you know, he's a goofball, so it's okay.

743
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:25,540
Did he mention anything nuclear or atomic? Yeah, that's what it's all about, is it's

744
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:30,920
Perfect. Yeah. That's what it is, yeah. Yeah, but it wasn't, it was done before 9-11, obviously,

745
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:37,380
so, yeah. Oh, retrospect, okay. Well, here's the thing, they're all these things that you're

746
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:42,060
told, what they are, they are real events, they're just not what, you know, so when they

747
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:46,620
tell you there's a terrorist event, it's not terrorist at all. It's a, it's a, you know,

748
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:53,480
it's a exercise. There are real things that happen. It's sort of like false advertising. Yes,

749
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:57,520
indeed, there's a story. Yes, indeed, they sell products, but it might not be exactly the product

750
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:02,000
that they're telling you they have. Sure, there is real terrorism, but it doesn't make the news,

751
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:07,480
because it's, it's viewed as weakness. I was in a hardware store recently, and I told someone

752
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:12,240
whose history, retired, you know, retired history teacher, works at a, as a clerk at a hardware

753
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:19,200
store, easy job, right? And I think you mentioned this guy before. Yeah, yeah, and I basically got

754
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:23,520
into, he got into the military, he did military history. I said, well, you know, 9-11 was to show

755
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:28,000
you that the military is not going to protect the country, right? That was a clear signal. That's

756
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,620
why, you know, they let that happen, right? He was like, what? You know, they already told you

757
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:37,860
several times, the military is not going to protect you. And they kind of left it at that,

758
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:42,720
you know. That's how I view it, you know. And also, when the military failed, why didn't they fire

759
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:47,060
everyone in the military and bring in all the Allied military temporarily, right? You see,

760
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:53,300
wouldn't you be fired? Like, if you were running the cash register all day, and it was minus $120,

761
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:57,620
at the end of the day, at the till, you're going to lose your job. It's not like 50 cents or $2,

762
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:02,760
right? Right. So if you let an event like that happen, you would have to disband your entire

763
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:07,680
military and call your allies to come in and fill in in the meantime, until you set up a new one.

764
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:13,440
That didn't happen. So it's clearly, evidently telling you that, you know, Americans are okay

765
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,720
with it. And that's what they do with a franchise is when you have a whole bunch of, you know,

766
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:21,900
you have a clearly there's, you know, serious shortages, they'll turn around and bring in a

767
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:25,360
bunch of guys from other places, let them wear it for a minute, because they're not familiar,

768
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:29,760
they can't be responsible for it. And then they'll investigate and figure out what went on.

769
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:36,420
Yeah. So the Americans obviously backed up. They're okay with it. They're not being protected.

770
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:40,580
They're just just fine with them. It's not fine with me. But it's fine with everyone around me.

771
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:45,280
That's why I always say, if they want to stop what they're doing, and turn this place into a

772
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,800
paradise, hey, listen, go have at it. I still I want nothing to do with it. If they want to go

773
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,720
ahead and kill each other, hey, go have at it. I want nothing to do with it either. So my thing

774
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:59,880
is nothing to do with any of the social creations that are taking place. Because it just can't be

775
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:07,180
good no matter what label they put on it. So in essence, if you were to, let's say, sum up what

776
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:14,660
we're trying to say, if this is Planet Earth, Inc, or One World Corporation, like One World Inc,

777
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:16,180
like I think, what's his name?

778
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,340
A lot of people use the term New World Order. Are you talking about that?

779
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:26,040
Yeah. It's One World. It's Earth, Inc. It's incorporated. And what's interesting about that,

780
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:31,220
you have these big companies, other than the DTCC, the Deposit Trust and Clearing Corporation,

781
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:40,360
and they have 24 quadrillion or 2.4 quadrillion on their balance sheet. I think if you put a

782
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:46,420
price tag on the earth, it wouldn't be more than 100, more than 1000 trillion, it would be way

783
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:53,360
below that. 2.4 quadrillion is 2.4 thousand trillion. So that means that they're monetized

784
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:57,620
on their balance sheet, the rest of the bodies in the solar system. You see what I mean?

785
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:01,500
Unless there's a whole lot of resources here that we don't know the value of. I mean, is that

786
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:02,100
possible too?

787
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:07,700
That's possible. But they're pretty much stating that overtly, that's what they have. They're not

788
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:13,940
telling us exactly where this goes. I'm just surmising. I think Joseph Farrell is talking

789
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:19,180
about the monetization of space. And there are international treaties that say that basically

790
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:22,600
slavery is okay up there. Have you heard of that one?

791
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:28,680
No, I've heard about it. Yeah, the space treaty stuff is very, very intricate and interesting. I

792
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:31,780
don't know where it all leads, to be honest with you. But I've heard it discussed. Yes.

793
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:37,360
Yeah. So this is basically the situation. But the government and the state, and by the way, they

794
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:44,320
do make a very succinct point to say the state, like if you apply for anything, a registration,

795
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:48,920
birth certificate on their application, the very last line where you sign it, if you look very

796
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:54,360
carefully, it says everything on this application would be used for the good of the state. Have

797
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:59,140
you ever seen that? Anyone look at any government application for anything, a vehicle

798
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:03,660
registration, driver's license, birth certificate application, it's always on the bottom line,

799
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:06,600
right by the signature where you sign, right?

800
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:10,620
I can't say that I personally observed that, but I will be on the lookout for it.

801
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:17,320
Yeah, maybe during this recording, I'll do a screenshot and send it to you. It's pretty easy to

802
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:23,300
find. Well, here's the thing. I'm not very familiar with, it seems like the Google, I am familiar

803
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:30,520
with the searching on the internet. But the, what do you call them? Oh, algorithms have gotten very

804
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:39,780
harsh and very, very censored. We did a recent Freeman talk, and most of the talk was about chat

805
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:46,720
GBT. And I'm suggesting that it's not an AI, but it's just a distraction in a sense as part of the

806
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:52,160
censorship tools, right? You could either show people you're taking information away or give them

807
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:58,520
a lot of information in the wrong direction, or many directions. If you can't baffle them with

808
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,240
bullshit, dazzle them with brilliance.

809
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:04,700
Well, yeah. And you know, as something else, two quick things I want to mention here before we get

810
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:10,120
away from it is one of have you gotten your your Bing bot yet on because we're talking right now

811
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,480
we're using Skype to communicate.

812
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:17,660
I was on Bing recently to do a search and it jumped on Skype and I removed it.

813
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:18,140
Okay.

814
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:19,820
Is that what you're referring to?

815
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:24,220
Yeah, but I see I didn't use Bing to search for anything. And I now have a couple of people who

816
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:27,660
told me about being just popped up as sort of a contact on their Skype.

817
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:34,500
And it was a better just to if you're looking at current events, I do Middle East and Asia current

818
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:39,380
events past week, past day, whatever. Okay, they have a much better image collection than Google

819
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:40,180
does, by the way.

820
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:46,540
Okay, fair enough. But I really I've avoided Bing for I forget what the reason was, but

821
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:46,960
something.

822
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:51,840
Oh, it doesn't matter. Remember, all the patriots who go duck, duck, go. And it turned out that

823
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,300
they're the same algorithm as Google.

824
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:57,880
Yeah, they're powered by Google anyway. So I don't know. Yeah, exactly. So no, but at some

825
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:03,080
point, I think I started avoiding Bing for one of those reasons. And I don't even remember what it

826
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:08,680
is now. But it was just strange that it added it to a car like it, it created a contact for me on

827
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:14,820
Skype. And suddenly I have this Bing bot asking me, you know, do I want information on like very

828
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:17,920
odd things? And telling me that it's there to help me.

829
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:28,280
So, yeah, it's just a it's just part of the look, I found it. I was very accusatory back. I think by

830
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:34,340
2010 2011. The smartphone thing was taking off, right? Yeah. And I everything that you see that

831
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:38,800
people comment on, I was commenting, commenting on back then before it became, you know, like, in

832
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,980
other words, people are going to be looking at this all the stupid rectangle all the time. Oh,

833
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:46,280
yeah, right. Even when they're next to each other, blah, blah, blah, they're gonna rely on it. And

834
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:53,000
then when it's taken away, then they'll beg for relief. You know, this is a very common thing

835
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:53,680
that goes on.

836
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:57,740
It's a common trope now. But honestly, yeah, there was only a very few people talking about how this

837
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:02,440
was going to become extremely dominant. And quite frankly, I kind of didn't feel as though people

838
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:09,640
would be dumb enough to be fully distracted by it. Yeah, I know. I keep having this idea that people

839
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:16,780
aren't as stupid as they are. And I'm always disappointed. And I just felt like there would be a

840
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:19,840
certain segment of the population that would be sucked into this. I didn't think it would be as

841
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:22,520
widespread as it is. But I saw it coming.

842
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:29,320
tattoos and the smartphone I was pretty vocal on I said you as the time goes on, you won't it'll be

843
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:34,120
very hard to find someone that doesn't have a tattoo. And I gave reasons for that. It's part of

844
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:43,220
the setup. So when you say the gender bending and LGBTQ RST, yeah, YZ and all the marriages and all

845
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:45,620
the same side of those stuff. All this is set up.

846
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:50,720
Yeah, even back when you and I first started talking, you were very, very, very much on that.

847
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:56,480
And I kind of didn't feel like that was going to be as dominant as it is. The tattoos I sort of

848
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:00,360
understood because things become trendy, and then they become commonplace. And then they're no longer

849
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:06,880
trendy. It's sort of like, you know, the the earring in the ear. You and I are similar age. So the the

850
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:13,100
pierced left ear, right? This was a big statement at a certain point when we were younger, wasn't it?

851
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:17,920
Yeah, a little diamond or whatever. I never never did any of that or tattoos. I have no marks. Yeah,

852
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,460
I did. But anyway,

853
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:26,220
no, that's fine. They were removed. I suggest people have them removed. If you can. Well, it

854
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:31,520
depends, you know, because that's going to be an important way to sort out society, not now, but in the future.

855
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:33,000
Yeah, near future. Right?

856
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:38,000
No, we went over it back then. But I do recall you talking about that. I had something else in mind, though, that I

857
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,040
wanted you to try and put in context, if you don't mind, if you're aware of what's going on with this, which, you

858
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:49,640
know, sometimes, look, we can't keep track of every sort of news trend. But and this isn't political or

859
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:54,980
anything, or maybe it's not. The train derailments. Have you taken notice of that recently?

860
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:01,000
Yeah, it was a ferry derailment as well in the Ohio River recently, more recently than the train derailments,

861
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:09,580
plural. Yeah, that was a setup because here's the thing. Okay, this is how the Okay, how do I put this? Right?

862
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:15,760
Very simple analogy. I go to the store and I buy a two liter bottle of soda. It's got compressed gas in it, right?

863
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:21,820
All right. Okay. And I have it in the shopping bag and get out of the car falls and hits the deck. Does the

864
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:26,820
bottle break and explode? Or does it get a little dent? I pick it up, dust it off, put it go wet, walk back

865
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:32,320
inside the house, right? That's how these things work. Most times, most times. Yeah, but unfortunately,

866
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:37,260
sometimes the plastic breaks and you got a mess. Really? I've never Well, that's pretty big height. I'm

867
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:42,240
talking about like, you know, waist level down. No, no beer can. I see this. Yeah, I see this all the time,

868
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:48,140
actually, that you have. Yeah, they see that analogy. Yeah, they seem to be making them thinner. Now. I'm

869
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:51,840
just saying they seem to be making some of these thinner now. So sometimes the thing just bursts open.

870
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:57,300
Well, trains. Yeah, they're, they've been scrutinized. They've been doing that kind of, they've been

871
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:04,420
developing railroad car technology, tanker car technology for over 100 years, right? And it's not going to

872
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:10,280
spill when it falls off the tracks. It seems like it should not. Yeah, it seems like it should not. And it's

873
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:16,220
not one big tank. Like a like a, what do you call an inflatable mattress, you make a hole and everything

874
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:24,180
comes out, there's a series of tanks and levels of absorbers and things in there to prove if there is a breach

875
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:32,080
to contain it. So it was deliberate, right? Just like years ago, when there were fires here in Arizona. A lady

876
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:39,760
was really distressed. She has a cabin up there in the in the White Mountains, in the well north of Tucson,

877
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:47,000
Catalina Mountains. And she says, my daughter reported she was some parks department guys are putting propane

878
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:54,140
tanks out in the forest and shooting them with a gun. So you know, and then they find some poor drunk homeless

879
00:55:54,140 --> 00:56:02,960
guy and blame it on him. Right. So also with the deer biscuits that have they put deer feed out that has mad cow

880
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:10,020
disease, let's say, you know, deer meat in it. So the deer get right. So anyway, right. Pretty interesting how how

881
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:15,560
these things are. Don't be naive. And I've been saying this for a long time. If you go online and find like the

882
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:21,680
most outlandish, outrageous conspiracy theories, stories that are way beyond anything believable. The truth is

883
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:29,200
even beyond that. I haven't found any. You see, it's so mild, even the worst conspiracy theories, quote unquote, are

884
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:34,460
still mild compared to what really is going on and accepted and done by those that you trust and whatever.

885
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:41,080
Yeah, well, so far, the more out there theories about this, because we are seeing a sort of a more common occurrence. I

886
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:47,100
mean, look, anything that is created by man has a failure rate, right? So it's possible no matter what the technology

887
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:54,500
is, we may see a failure like this with the with the trains and such, right. But like you said, 100 years already, they've

888
00:56:54,500 --> 00:57:01,360
they've been working on it. So they're upgrading all the trains. Yeah, the trains, the compartments. Even when people

889
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:06,640
see a gas truck, they think, oh, it's one. It's not one big tank. You know, they only really explode in the movies.

890
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:12,280
These things are very well made, usually. So you don't have that. Yeah.

891
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:18,700
No, the chemical rockets are not these tubes. If you cut one open, you'll find spheres in there because you can't get

892
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:26,520
5,000 pounds of pressure in a tube, it has to be in a sphere. So very often, these things wash up on beaches. And people

893
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:31,420
think it's alien technology. They're just rocket fuel tanks. You know, they're in other words, it would look like a bunch of

894
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:38,320
Christmas ornaments, round balls inside of that tube. Right. Right. So just getting a little more technical, just going one

895
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:46,020
more step beyond what's being shown. You know, it doesn't take much or you can have someone like me that susses things out

896
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:53,500
very quickly do a sonic and you can then look it up if you care. But, you know, right. But what why did you bring up the

897
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:58,320
train derailments? Do you think what was the what was the worry? What do you want to go with that?

898
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:05,140
Well, because look, people are talking about it. And and now, you know, turning it into well, was it because you know, Trump

899
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:11,260
deregulated stuff? Or is this happening? Because there is literally a terrorist because you brought up the terrorist attacks

900
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:17,060
that there are terrorist attacks, but they're not talked about. Because some people are saying that that's what's actually

901
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:24,200
happening. Yeah, but are they talking about that? They could have easily covered up the train stuff? Yeah, it was real. They

902
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:32,260
could have they want they want you to believe a certain narrative, a certain thought. It's here. Here's the other thing. When did

903
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:39,620
you ever hear something that the Patriot community or the mainstream media put out this is coming and it came never, never, never,

904
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:47,160
never happens the way that you're being told because you're so distracted. And you know, people's vantage point is really low. In

905
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:53,660
other words, if you're looking at each other, in essence, and watching the news, alternative or mainstream, you're it's too low of a

906
00:58:53,660 --> 00:59:02,380
vantage point, you have to get up in a helicopter and see the town from above to get a sense of what it really looks like. So yeah, I

907
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:09,500
think, yeah, you know, we can always discuss politics and current events, but it's not it's not the way it's being told. Oh,

908
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:17,720
and the real stuff is where it's quiet. And right now, it's really quiet in the Middle East. And in parts of Asia, the Pacific

909
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:26,320
Rim. So that's where you're going to watch. Well, not when but when things start coming out of there in the near future, don't be

910
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:34,660
surprised. And of course, Israel is, you know, I think, I think we've mentioned on previous sonic Israel's being set up to fail. And

911
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:41,580
then it's going to get really hairy there. So right, well, there's currently according to reports, and they're not well covered

912
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:50,320
here at all. But if you dig a little bit, you'll find that there's this issue about the judiciary, and them protesting in the

913
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:56,540
street, and some of them refusing to serve in the military now, even though that's supposed to be a compulsory thing. If you're, you

914
00:59:56,540 --> 01:00:03,360
know, it's still voluntary, though. Well, that's the other. Do you know how you volunteer when it's compulsory, even since World

915
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:10,020
War One? Well, even even when you have a draft, that's the case, because people say, Oh, what about a draft? No, actually, you're

916
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:18,060
still having to sit there. And at some point, you agree. You don't know when you're volunteering. This is when you volunteer when

917
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:25,640
they've got you in your underwear. You have to if you don't show up for draft inspection or sign up, you'll be arrested. So you show

918
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:33,500
up. And when they do the medical exam, they have you sit in standing in boxers or briefs. And they have everyone in a line and they

919
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:39,320
have you standing there long enough where you get irritated and they have a sergeant come in and says, Okay, everyone is ready to join

920
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:46,440
the US Armed Forces take a step forward. And what does everybody do takes a step forward, right? And whoever doesn't, they come up to

921
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:51,420
them and they stare you down for a minute. And they said, Come over here and take you in a room. They give you all your stuff, a $20

922
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:53,880
bill, and a bus ticket, go back home.

923
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:57,400
Even if you've been drafted, by the way,

924
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:01,760
well, this is pre draft, right? Well, you've drafted meaning you had to show up now.

925
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:08,020
So you were sent to notice? Yeah, well, you were sent to notice based on a numerical, you know, drawing and this and that.

926
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:13,580
Yeah, but you have to show up. Because if you don't show up, you default on that because it's your you know, you're residing there,

927
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:15,580
right. But I'm saying that even if it seems

928
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:22,760
like it's not voluntary, there's a point in there where you volunteer. The same thing happens with prisoners of war. Are you familiar

929
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:25,160
with the tactic use how they take prisoners of war?

930
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:30,020
Well, no, I'm not familiar with that. I'm just I just want to make this very, very clear is that even though you go through this

931
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:33,380
process, where you do have to show up because you've been summoned in a way,

932
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:40,660
that part is what they will prosecute you for if you don't show up. But just because you show up and go through the motions doesn't

933
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:48,240
mean that you're drafted at some point in that process. They, it has to be voluntary, just like in court, it's voluntary.

934
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:54,640
There is a there is a point there. And you described it the way somebody else actually completely independent from you described

935
01:01:54,640 --> 01:02:02,360
it just now to me at another point. And I was kind of amazed by that. But then I kind of had that confirmed by somebody who does

936
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:09,780
those processes that Yeah, that's exactly right. If you don't, it's a little different. It's not always exactly as you describe.

937
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:18,980
Yeah, you show up in court, the court, but if you show up to court, it's voluntary, even if it's whatever it is, right. So but that's

938
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:25,580
tricky, because they understand that people are learning how to do it. And that's a maybe we'll do that on a one hour sonic or

939
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:30,620
something that needs to be its own thing. But what I'm saying is, is that during a lot of these processes, where people figure

940
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:36,380
there's absolutely no choice, there is almost always a point at which now would you call that a pledge? Is that the point at which

941
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:43,300
that's right, that's where you when you pledge, you give up everything. That's right. And that word is also being used as a meme,

942
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:52,400
like on Begafon's, you know, pledge $10, pledge $20, right, you know, the Begafon's on the radio or TV. Because that goes,

943
01:02:52,700 --> 01:03:00,400
actually, it's a it's a term that's loosely used, but it actually is very important. Just like when you get a shopper's card, if

944
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:06,680
you go to one of these big grocery stores, they give you a card, you swipe and you get a discount. What they're doing the

945
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:14,720
full amount, let's say you go to Kroger's or whatever, a supermarket, and they have these membership cards, right, right. When

946
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:21,700
you swipe that the entire amount of that purchase goes on a credit balance sheet, and they can they can prove right there that

947
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:28,900
you approved that you bought that and this is the amount of credit that they are accruing, meaning the store, and they could

948
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:36,520
leverage that on what's called pro forma accounting. Boy, oh boy, do we I don't know if I want to go down there. But pro forma

949
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:43,800
just means percentage. Like for example, if you're a company like General Electric, and you're not doing well, you have a stock,

950
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:52,200
you buy a little company for a million bucks that makes 30% profit, right. And, you know, someone who puts like, you know, red

951
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:59,940
dots on semiconductor chips, you buy them for a million bucks, three employees, they make 30% profit. So at your GE meeting, you

952
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:11,180
say we just, we wholly, this subsidiary is wholly a part of GE, and it makes a 30% profit. Look at our spreadsheet now. It's great,

953
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:15,300
right. But it's gonna tell you it's 300,000 versus 17 billion in losses, right?

954
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:21,340
Right. But by the percentages, look, this one's making 30%. Okay, so that one lost 20. But this one's making 30. So

955
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:30,800
yeah, so they love doing that. So yeah, it's very interesting. You can do well, it gets gets complicated, but you could do a forensic

956
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:38,000
audit. Forensics just means evidence on all the stuff you spent, and have it monetized. And then they'll tell you don't ever come to our

957
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:43,580
store again, by the way, you know, because they, in other words, you find out how they're monetizing it, and you want a cut of that,

958
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:50,540
right? See, because they're giving you your cut up front, you know, they go shopping, you swipe the card, oh, you save $20 today, right? Or

959
01:04:50,540 --> 01:05:00,080
whatever, you see. So yeah, this is all the same thing happens. When you have these job fairs, big companies like Raytheon, GE, GM,

960
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:07,280
they go to these towns, and they have a job fair, and they have all these people apply. No one ever gets hired at those job fairs. Even

961
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:15,340
government agencies do that. They go to colleges, right, and they have you sign up. And they, if you give them, what they want is the

962
01:05:15,340 --> 01:05:22,340
money's signature, because the money is drawn off the signature. So let's say a big company like Raytheon or whatever goes to Kansas, and

963
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:30,780
there's a job fair, and 200 people fill out applications and sign it, and each application is a salary of 100 grand, that's 20 million right

964
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:36,680
there, let's say, or maybe I didn't do the math right, with signatures that they could go and monetize, because remember, the money comes

965
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:44,880
off the signature, right? And you see, that's how they create their funding. That's another way. Same thing with a university. When you go and

966
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:51,580
register to a college or university, it doesn't matter which one, you sign the registration form, they get the full tuition, they monetize your

967
01:05:51,580 --> 01:06:02,180
signature, but then they ask you to pay for it again, because, you know, it's plausible. You know who knew this? Gaddafi. All the utility

968
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:08,040
companies that were internationally owned were still getting paid. He just told the people, look, you get a bill, just sign it or put your

969
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:15,380
thumbprint and send it back. That's all you got to do. They didn't get free electric or free gas or whatever. And the utility, foreign utility

970
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:21,460
companies were getting all the money, but they were like, wait a second, this is spreading really, what if people find out? Let's get rid of this guy,

971
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:27,320
right? There's many other reasons. But right, but that was actually, that was one of the things that they used to say about him, though, is that

972
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:36,200
look, he gives people free electricity, and he goes and he gives them a house. No, they have to do the same with any form that you find. The

973
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:43,060
funny one is the hospitals. When you go to a hospital, and they have you find that registration form, you say, well, look, I need a cash

974
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:53,360
receipt for this. And they're like, what? No one knows what's going on. But when it gets to an administrator, you basically, it's a long form, a

975
01:06:53,360 --> 01:07:00,620
long yellow form. It's a carbon copy, pink, white, yellow, whatever, right? That goes under the QSIP convention, which is the Convention for

976
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:08,560
Universal Security Investment Protocols. But essentially, what's funny is playing around with the hospital, especially if you have a baby there, is

977
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:15,640
every time you fill out a piece of paper, you say, I need to speak to one of the administrators, and they'll say, why? You got to tell them why. You

978
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:23,940
say, because I need a cash receipt for this, right? So basically, there's no, you don't know the figure. The figures are between 50,000 to 5 million

979
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:32,540
for one of those applications, by the way, any hospital form. So the reason, and when they say, well, there's no cash, I don't know what you're

980
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:41,960
talking about. I said, well, I need something with your hospital heading on it that just say that this is an open cash receipt, that you received some

981
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:49,940
cash, that you're going to receive some cash value for this paperwork. Now, don't say on my signature. And they freak out. And they're like, okay, then

982
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:56,880
when you do this, they'll give you like, what's interesting, they because they have to have you sign another one when you're leaving. And when you

983
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:03,980
bring that up, again, it's you'll almost as if go to a hotel, and they give you a first class room. Right? And you don't get a bill, by the way,

984
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:09,900
usually, and if you get a bill, you just throw it away, because you have the cash receipt. Now the cash receipt, there's no number, it's just an open

985
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:17,979
check. So for example, if any money can be drawn from your signature, why do you need to put a number on it? You could, you know, it's a it's what do

986
01:08:17,979 --> 01:08:25,380
they call it, like an open check, right? This is how we're operating, because it's not our fault, we're in this condition. You see, so it's very

987
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:36,660
interesting how it works. That's why the system is in trouble, because they're producing so much, let's say fiat currency potential, that they don't

988
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:44,859
know where to put it all. Right. So if they really let the public know what's going on, it would be 100 bucks for a gallon of milk very soon. So the

989
01:08:44,859 --> 01:08:52,460
inflation that's going on right now is not so bad, because it should be around a minimum wage should be over $30 an hour and a gallon of gas should be

990
01:08:52,460 --> 01:09:01,760
25. You see what I'm saying? But it's not so it's not so bad. I tell people they didn't put a cap on inflation since 2012. And now you're getting hit

991
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:11,319
with it. But it's it's Yeah, anyway. Yeah, it sucks. And the thing also mentioned if your salary is not doubling in the next year, and you're just

992
01:09:11,319 --> 01:09:17,979
barely making it, you're not going to make it's going to be really hard to make it. So as salary has to double within a year, you know, depending on what

993
01:09:17,979 --> 01:09:24,979
your salary is, I know some people make quarter of a million a year salary, you don't need quarter of a million to live. But if you're making, you know,

994
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:33,340
less than 50,000 a year, if you don't see a way to be making 80 to 100,000 in a year, you're going to feel it, you're going to be, you know, looking for

995
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:42,240
another way to do things. So it depends on what, you know, whatever, you know, overhead you have. So, yeah, I just wanted to bring up these little

996
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:49,080
points, because, you know, there's no way we could do any kind of Greeks Greek speak without rounding it off, you know, because typically, I'm very rough

997
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:58,960
around the edges. So you got to smooth it out a little bit. But here's the good news. It's all good news. All right, because you have a short stay here,

998
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:07,920
it's not that long. And you do what you can pick a set of laws and rules that you live by that you live by and stick with it. Because that's really your way

999
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:22,740
that that's your freedom. When you pick a law form that works, or especially an old law form, that is actually a freedom, inviting condition, right? So it's kind

1000
01:10:22,740 --> 01:10:30,860
of complicated. You know, the state has millions of laws, if you count all of the countries, all the different codes and all that, which one don't you know?

1001
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:42,280
Right. But if you have, let's say, I use the biblical covenant, there's maybe a handful of things that you consider all the time. And maybe another few handful of

1002
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:53,120
things that you might want to look up once in a while, but it's very open. So in other words, for example, with Old Testament laws, if it's not expressly

1003
01:10:53,120 --> 01:11:05,620
prohibited, it's indirectly encouraged, indirectly, right? So with that said, I wanted to bring up something that Nick put in the chat. A while back, he's seems to

1004
01:11:05,620 --> 01:11:18,360
be asking a lot about the New Testament, and things like that, which would be called the kene the afiki, right? In Greek. I recently been looking at again, I don't

1005
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:30,380
endorse this person, but I do approve most of his message. If you want to get a handle on what I've discussed on other Greek speak stuff, mostly, maybe in other

1006
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:42,520
places, maybe loosely, and calls, I don't think we've done much of it, maybe. If you want to find out what what was going on in the New Testament, you're going to have to lean

1007
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:54,180
very heavily on the Aramaic because the quote unquote, apostleship and decisive discipleship and all that there's no john or Luke or all that those those sound like good old

1008
01:11:54,180 --> 01:12:05,440
boys, right? These these were Hebraic based people that spoke Aramaic. It was not Greek, the Greek didn't come until the end of that century, because it was an international

1009
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:20,720
language. What was penned if it was penned, as we recall, it stating it was penned in Aramaic. So it was translated from Aramaic to Greek. So what I'm trying to say is there's

1010
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:34,660
someone that wrote a book, and I've been looking at the Peshetta, which is the Aramaic form, there's someone who spent most of his life putting this together. His name is Andrew Gabriel Roth. You spell it just like it sounds

1011
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:48,060
Andrew Gabriel Roth, got a bunch go to YouTube, if you want to listen to it. He's got a couple of books out, but he keeps every time he puts out I've been looking at him now I for a couple of weeks, because I wanted to see what was on the Aramaic

1012
01:12:48,060 --> 01:13:17,800
New Testament, and he seems to be the closest. Okay, I don't endorse him because he's Jewish. Right. And when I say Jews, I spell it J O O Z. Okay, so don't get on me. Right. It's, it's great. It's kind of like Linda with a Y. Don't say it with an I. Right. Okay. Right. You know, kind of thing. I heard you say it with an I. So it's with a Y. Right. So anyway, he's very Jewish. And meaning that Saturday, Sabbath, he

1013
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:47,320
doesn't know how to keep time, right? Right. He keeps these rabbinical. But on the other hand, this is what this is how he won me over enough to mention his name. On a sonic, I found a short video, where he is, if he quoted what I had said, and there's the synchronicity, you got to appreciate synchronicity when it happens, right? And what it was on the short video, he stated, like, the name of the Messiah is not J. E. S. U. S. It's Joshua, if you're going to use it, Yahshua in

1014
01:13:47,320 --> 01:14:17,040
English. And there's no harm in using Joshua, because the sixth book of the Bible is the book of Joshua. So it's not like they can't say Joshua, no one will understand it or ever heard it before, because it's already been used. So if they were really trying to stick to something that was semi true, or truer than than not, they would have called in the New Testament, all the English would have been Joshua, not J. E. S. U. S. And when I saw that, I kind of play the

1015
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:46,380
video again, I'm like, wait a second, how did me and this guy end up saying almost exactly the same thing? Right? So that's, he kind of won, won my gratitude on that. So that's why I'm putting him out. I've listened to a lot of his stuff in the past week and a half or so. And I would suggest that he leans very heavily on, well, on the matter of the New Testament and everything being based in Aramaic, and not Hebrew, but you could say Hebrew, and not Greek.

1016
01:14:46,380 --> 01:15:16,360
And then it doesn't mean the Greek is invalid. But I would say 40% of the Greek is invalid, maybe more than 40% is invalid. So if you want to get to the 90% point of what's written, you have to study the Aramaic. So if you got time, Andrew Gabriel Roth on YouTube, he's got some long lectures, I think some stuff went back as far as five or seven years. But again, he does not understand. He's rabbinical. He's been, you know, pardon me, someone asked me that I brought this

1017
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:28,540
up to recently, says, Well, why don't you get in touch with him about timekeeping and Torah? I said, Are you kidding? Even if he wanted to do it, because he runs a ministry, he would he would be, you know, suicide for him. No one would, you know,

1018
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:46,040
he'd be invited, he'd be invited out of any any grouping he has there, that would be his groupings that he have would dissolve immediately. So in the past, I've heard more than one person talk about, you know, Yeshua, which is a more proper way to look at it. And I've had people even tell me that, you know,

1019
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:51,880
you remember Mel Gibson did that movie a while back, that he attempted to use the Aramaic.

1020
01:15:52,580 --> 01:16:02,860
Yep. And he is still keeping the Vatican censorship with the crucifixion, though. Right, right. Which is the other thing is just the the event there when you've got the the wooden cross and all this kind of

1021
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:07,600
Yeah, there was no such thing. Right. Which, you know, again, it's a it's a tree. And anyway,

1022
01:16:08,220 --> 01:16:31,620
well, let's just do a fast recap. There's no guy nailed to a cross wearing a diaper, right? Right. And yeah, it was he was he was arrested by the Judean religious authorities. And he ran they ran him through from the Judean authorities to the monarchy that was suzerain to the Romans, Prefect Governor Pilate Pontius Pilate had the last say and Pontius Pilate told the

1023
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:57,580
Judean authorities, you have your law, use your law. What law is that? It's law Moses. And there you go. So what's execution under law Moses simple. And if you look at what transpired, and how the event went from the third to the ninth hour people passing and this that and the other, it lines up with a stoning, not a, and it was an almond tree, because we're 36 references or so to the almond tree, not the olive tree. So

1024
01:16:57,580 --> 01:17:01,460
right. Right. Which, which, again,

1025
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:04,500
Mel Gibson, Mel Gibson, you could not approach him either on this.

1026
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:10,620
No, but he did. I'm just making the point that the attempt was there to use the Aramaic. But again,

1027
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:40,180
Oh, it is it's still used today. Yeah. Like, in the modern Israeli, Israeli, Judea culture, you have a bar mitzvah. It's not it should well, if you're speaking Hebrew would be a Ben mitzvah bar is sun in Aramaic. So they keep some Aramaic terms still today because of the culture, right to bring out a mitzvah means a rule or to do. So why is it bar when bar like bar

1028
01:17:40,180 --> 01:18:09,320
Abbas, right son of the father, right? Not Ben Abbas. So it's kind of confusing. And by the way, just like are you familiar with early American history, they didn't know what to be the official language was Ben Franklin wanted it to be French, you know, of America, United States, let's say America. Oh, you remember that little country? We're talking about what should be our language? Greek? Yeah. Yeah. Hessian or, or, or French English was like, kind of like third or fourth, but it prevailed, right?

1029
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:17,380
It prevailed, but then officially wasn't given the officially we didn't have a language. This is what I was taught initially in school.

1030
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:46,520
It was going to be French, I think was the top contender or German or something, but it ended up being English. And this was it sounds ridiculous. Now, if you bring this up, right? So it just turns out that the language lengua franca that everyone spoke back then was Aramaic, not Hebrew or Greek. And there's some big differences in the text when you have translations, like for example, the, the generations, if you count the book of Matthew, the generations,

1031
01:18:47,380 --> 01:19:17,300
it says they're 42 generations, we only count 41. Well, because the last two are the men have the same name, right? And one is described as a Gowda. So anyway, Andrew Gabriel Roth gets into some of this stuff. Also, there's some interesting things that he that I wasn't sure, so sure about, I was going to order his book, but he just trying to publish another one, which is basically, what's interesting about writing books is as you learn more, and you publish,

1032
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:46,120
you tell people will get this one, because it's more advanced and corrects what the previous one had. So yeah, there's always updated versions. Yeah, yeah. So it's a redo. So anyway, Andrew Gabriel Roth to get to a feeling of what he's saying there, and how their Christian community was never a Christian community until hundreds of years later. Yeah. So I just wanted to put that out for the New Testament, because it sounds very pedantic to go into correcting

1033
01:19:47,380 --> 01:20:17,360
notions that we have. And there's a lot of there's a Jason Breshears guy of archaics, and he just trashes everything, saying that the because the German academics 100 years ago said that it was all written at 300 BC for the Old Testament and the New Testament, we don't know. He leans on that without having comprehension. What my comment would be to Jason Breshears is, he says he's read the Bible 50 times, he has the notes to prove it.

1034
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:36,160
Well, that means that you passed the sequence that I just explained, where Pontius Pilate reverted the victim that day, back to using Mosaic law, you didn't pick up on that reading it 50 times, that means you don't have any comprehension, and you're taking what some academics are saying about it, right?

1035
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:56,560
Yeah, look, I've only actually read it, you know, cover to cover the King James Version twice. But I'm well aware of that. That's that's a key point that he they bring him to him because he's the ruler of that piece of land. Right? Because he's the governor. I mean, this is a very basic, really crappy understanding, I'm sure. But I think it's

1036
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:00,320
Yeah, well, when you're in the military, you're given an area book.

1037
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,700
Well, yeah, that's right. And the thing is...

1038
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:03,880
He had the area book, he knew their laws.

1039
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:08,720
Right. But that's the thing, they do give you a book where you're... Anyway, point is...

1040
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:17,460
Well, he was also a historian and a friend of Claudius Tiberius Caesar, who was a historian also, by trade, even though he was the emperor. So it's quite interesting.

1041
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:20,180
Right.

1042
01:21:20,180 --> 01:21:47,200
But all I'm saying is that in the story, okay, in the story, the way I understand it, is that he would have been controlling that area. So properly, they brought this person who was causing a disruption, he's there to maintain order to them, okay, according to the story to the governor, the guy who's in charge, who basically says, look, this I'm not even going to deal with, let the locals handle it and handle it with your rules, your laws, your courts, whatever it is.

1043
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:48,700
Right. There's an exchange there.

1044
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:51,980
There's an exchange there. And this happens, actually, this is not uncommon.

1045
01:21:52,740 --> 01:21:57,520
Well, yeah. So in other words, when you read crucifixion, it's inserted, right?

1046
01:21:57,780 --> 01:21:58,680
It has to be.

1047
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:00,260
It's a hanging, you know, and a nailing.

1048
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:11,140
Yeah, it has to be. Because according to that time period, there's no historical evidence that this would have been the way it was done, the way that they show it to you now.

1049
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:13,160
Well, crucifixion, sorry.

1050
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:18,160
Crucifixion, no, not the way that they showed you, okay? Not this whole building a wooden cross.

1051
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:19,980
No, it's not biblical. There's lots of...

1052
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:20,340
Yeah.

1053
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:26,140
Crucifixion came from the Assyrians, and it was used throughout Rome, usually for rebellions.

1054
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:26,760
Yes.

1055
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:29,560
It was a symbol of torture, not of dying.

1056
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:39,160
But you weren't building a crossbar, okay? And you used the things that were there, for the most part. I know in some areas they built...

1057
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:40,380
Well, the reason...

1058
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:46,280
Because you're given to understand, the way that these people try to explain it is that this is the way it was just done.

1059
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:55,380
This was the form of execution. That wasn't the common form of execution, and according to their laws, it definitely wasn't the way to go.

1060
01:22:55,860 --> 01:23:04,940
Well, he could have appealed to Caesar, you see. Anyone can appeal to Caesar. It's a very lengthy process, but you're held in a carcer, as incarceration.

1061
01:23:05,620 --> 01:23:16,600
It was very common, by the way, by Roman prefects to just give them back to the population to use their customary laws,

1062
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:28,060
because if they didn't, and they were going to use Roman execution method, the subject or the victim can appeal to Caesar, which is a representative Caesar, to Rome, in Rome.

1063
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:28,440
Right.

1064
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:34,220
It was kind of miserable to wait for such a thing, but the Romans were very open about this.

1065
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:43,600
So one way to stop all that bureaucracy is to just give them back. It was very more customary to give the person back and let the people use their customs of whatever.

1066
01:23:43,740 --> 01:23:47,980
Well, it was more expeditious to do so, because otherwise it's a very long process.

1067
01:23:48,420 --> 01:23:56,740
And then you had the argument of, well, is this person subject to Roman law, because Roman law is for Roman citizens.

1068
01:23:57,440 --> 01:24:02,900
Well, you could be subject to Roman law and still be given over to the customs of the people.

1069
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,860
Yes, but my point is…

1070
01:24:04,860 --> 01:24:05,680
Just to cut the red tape.

1071
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:08,240
Yeah, but my point is that's a whole lot of red tape to open up.

1072
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:16,160
If you stick to the Roman law and the person is educated enough to know that he can appeal to Caesar, yeah, that's a lot of red tape.

1073
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:22,080
That means conceivably you could have 10,000 people and the carcers would overflow, where you just give them back to.

1074
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:29,620
So it was more common to give them back to the culture and let them do what they will and then settle the books that way.

1075
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:38,760
Well, it was expedient. That's what I'm saying, is that it was just something to keep things moving, which was really a primary concern of anybody who was a governor or a prefect or whatever it is.

1076
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:43,560
It is to keep everything kind of, you know, to maintain order, which is the phrase I used before.

1077
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:49,520
So what I'm saying is that I even understand that that's there and that this makes sense.

1078
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:55,040
The way that you've explained this makes a whole lot more sense than most of the stories.

1079
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:57,960
Well, it's a metric. It's a metric.

1080
01:24:58,100 --> 01:25:07,780
In other words, when you have people walking around with crucifixes thinking, that tells the elite that these people are ignorant, right?

1081
01:25:07,780 --> 01:25:10,080
Now we're controlling ignorant people.

1082
01:25:10,220 --> 01:25:19,140
The way you control ignorant people is different than you control people who are of functioning intelligence, because the ignorant people have also a functioning intelligence.

1083
01:25:19,140 --> 01:25:20,380
They're just so damn stubborn.

1084
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:28,080
That's the one thing that I haven't mentioned very often, is, quote-unquote, people that are ignorant or, quote-unquote, stupid.

1085
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:31,520
It's not that they're ignorant or stupid.

1086
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:33,240
It's that they're stubborn.

1087
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:41,040
They have all the faculties to be aware and to be conscious or cognizant of what they're doing wrong and what is more correct.

1088
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:44,960
It's just the stubbornness, you see.

1089
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:50,360
And then, of course, there's the NPC, which is just the filler, which is a whole other discussion.

1090
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:51,300
That's a different story.

1091
01:25:51,500 --> 01:26:00,220
I'm trying to organize it in my mind on how to present it, because I think the easiest way to notice the NPCs is

1092
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:11,660
if you ever go by a big store like Macy's or Bloomingdale's or whatever, and you have these high-end mannequins in the window, right?

1093
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:14,040
In a high fashion, whatever, they have high-end mannequins.

1094
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:15,280
Look at the eyes of the mannequin.

1095
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:20,720
No matter how well they artistically put them together, they're still fake eyes, right?

1096
01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:21,240
Right.

1097
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:28,080
So when you look at someone and it doesn't look like there's any light at all coming from them, that's an NPC usually.

1098
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:33,400
But it's not that simple, because there are people that have small eyes that are not very bright that are not.

1099
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:38,620
But that's a general thing, is look at the eyes is the quickest.

1100
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:40,880
That's a fairly decent tell, let's say.

1101
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:46,140
And the Scripture does not say, by the way, the eyes are the window to the soul.

1102
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:47,820
It's the window to the body.

1103
01:26:49,340 --> 01:26:50,980
Which makes a lot more sense.

1104
01:26:51,850 --> 01:27:00,100
I find it interesting, though, just in general, because it's, look, here's another point, right?

1105
01:27:00,140 --> 01:27:04,100
You brought up the crosses and this, and they see people wearing them around their necks.

1106
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:10,320
Kind of interesting, because you can find that there were, that's actually a very specific thing.

1107
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:20,520
And clearly signals that your adornment doesn't represent the thing that you're supposed to be religiously attached to.

1108
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:22,440
It's a different, yeah.

1109
01:27:22,780 --> 01:27:24,560
It's a sky symbol from ancient Assyria.

1110
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:29,340
But most people don't know why they're doing what they're doing and don't care to know why.

1111
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:30,760
No, but that's a clear signal.

1112
01:27:30,860 --> 01:27:37,820
I guarantee you nobody you see with that cross dangling from a necklace has any idea that that's what that is.

1113
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:40,540
Well, that was customary in Assyria 800 BC.

1114
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:43,460
There's a stone stele carving.

1115
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:48,360
You could just write crucifix wearing, cross wearing in 800 BC in Assyria.

1116
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:50,380
There's plenty of statues and markings.

1117
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:52,940
But there's so much going on with that.

1118
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:55,480
It's not just the crucifix.

1119
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,040
It's the entire organization.

1120
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:08,360
I haven't found anyone in that organization to be competent or that, with, competent, in other words, with comprehension of the fundamentals.

1121
01:28:09,060 --> 01:28:12,020
That's why you have all the denominations in every religion, by the way.

1122
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:14,880
You know the Muslims also have their divisions, right?

1123
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,480
So once you see this division also, it's another problem.

1124
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:27,780
Usually I think the people that are, let's say, most functional in any real wisdom or knowledge don't profess any title.

1125
01:28:28,020 --> 01:28:32,560
I think I keep saying if someone really is a witch, they will never say they're a witch.

1126
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:35,560
If someone really is a shaman, they will never say it.

1127
01:28:35,860 --> 01:28:38,760
If someone is a healer, they will never call themselves a healer.

1128
01:28:39,020 --> 01:28:41,680
Someone is a prophet, they will never call themselves a prophet.

1129
01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:42,400
You see how it works?

1130
01:28:43,300 --> 01:28:44,780
Or a wizard or whatever.

1131
01:28:44,780 --> 01:28:51,140
All of these things that require, let's say, the manifestation or manipulation of qualities, which are subtle energies, right?

1132
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:57,160
Now it's okay to say you're a master carpenter, a good wood butcher, right?

1133
01:28:57,260 --> 01:29:00,920
You're really good at working with wood or whatever, so whatever.

1134
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:04,400
But that is very material and it's technically accessible.

1135
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:06,660
A lot of these other things are not technically accessible.

1136
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:11,720
They're technically guided, but not accessible technically, right?

1137
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:12,940
There's a difference.

1138
01:29:12,940 --> 01:29:15,140
Just like alchemy, you can guide it technically.

1139
01:29:15,380 --> 01:29:18,200
You know, you get a book on alchemy, you do these things, you should be an alchemist.

1140
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:21,700
But not everyone is because it's just a guide, right?

1141
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:25,160
So, yeah.

1142
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:28,300
Anyone can pick up a paintbrush, but not everyone is an artist.

1143
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:34,800
Right, and then you have two types of painters, painting houses or painting canvas, right?

1144
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:41,800
And there is an artisanship to both, actually, because you've got to properly do things if you're painting a house.

1145
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:45,300
I mean, you know, you can tell when someone who doesn't know what they're doing does it,

1146
01:29:45,460 --> 01:29:48,040
because the stuff falls off, it's a sloppy job, etc.

1147
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:49,140
Sure, sure.

1148
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:59,640
One of the easiest things, those things, painting, by the way, is technically guided and also technically, well, it can be achieved even with,

1149
01:30:00,140 --> 01:30:05,240
if you could paint like a picture, you know, no one's going to say that you're not very good.

1150
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:07,920
You know, if you could paint realism, right, and that's taught.

1151
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:12,680
I mean, that's strictly – paint by numbers, by the way, is a way to start, right?

1152
01:30:12,860 --> 01:30:20,940
But, yeah, that's why I've always encouraged weather work, because it's one of the things that is, say, quote-unquote,

1153
01:30:21,020 --> 01:30:22,200
no pun intended, ethereal.

1154
01:30:23,100 --> 01:30:27,040
It's a non-physical quality, like alchemy, to achieve it.

1155
01:30:27,580 --> 01:30:33,320
But I found that it's one of those things that it's kind of in between alchemy and learning to be a good painter,

1156
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:39,460
that if you get enough how-to's under your belt and you practice a little bit, you will be able to work the weather.

1157
01:30:39,820 --> 01:30:42,460
I think you and I – I'm not going to put you on the spot, but I will.

1158
01:30:43,340 --> 01:30:48,800
You and I, back in the original ONG, under Danny Romero, he said his brother was visiting him

1159
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:51,960
and there was going to be rain in Washington State all week, remember?

1160
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:57,160
And he asked me to please stop the rain and make it sunny for a couple of days, and you were like, what?

1161
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:02,100
And then next week we get on the call and Danny's like, thanks very much.

1162
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:05,900
It was sunny for three days, even though the forecast had half-inch of rain every day.

1163
01:31:06,620 --> 01:31:11,040
Well, there's another gentleman that we both mutually encountered named Larry.

1164
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:14,980
I don't know if you – we don't need to give his last name.

1165
01:31:15,180 --> 01:31:20,520
Yeah, he got it from one of my people that I was a student of, the Greek.

1166
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:25,180
And he – Larry, that's the guy that'd go fishing and he didn't like the wind,

1167
01:31:25,180 --> 01:31:28,680
and we told him, put this tube on the boat and the wind will go away, and he said it worked.

1168
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:29,100
That guy?

1169
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:29,940
Right, that guy.

1170
01:31:30,740 --> 01:31:31,640
Yeah, okay, got it.

1171
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:33,460
Yeah, because he didn't speak with me on that.

1172
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:38,920
Briefly, maybe once on something for a minute, he was working around with some electronic stuff,

1173
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:41,040
electrical stuff, I remember.

1174
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:48,840
And I would suggest that that was someone who – I got into weather work who was on calls with me about it,

1175
01:31:48,860 --> 01:31:50,660
and he says, no, I'm not keen on that.

1176
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:54,400
I'm not keen on that at all, and one day he had problems with too much rain,

1177
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:58,240
and I said – he says, you know, I'm not keen on the weather, but I'm tired of this rain.

1178
01:31:58,940 --> 01:32:02,260
If that stuff works that you're talking about, I'll be willing to try it,

1179
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:04,940
and he became really good at it, and he's the one that got in touch with Larry.

1180
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:05,660
Oh, okay.

1181
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:10,500
I thought that you had directly done it, but okay, either way, it was indirect.

1182
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:18,160
I've got about maybe 100 people now since I started doing – I was vocal about the weather work around 2004,

1183
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:19,980
so I could say two decades.

1184
01:32:19,980 --> 01:32:26,820
And also Trevor James Constable, I was – I would speak to him more than twice a week in the last few years of his life,

1185
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:31,740
and he sent me a couple of – well, two packages of his notes and boxes that I have here.

1186
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:36,800
He's a – I think one of the greatest weather worker people.

1187
01:32:38,180 --> 01:32:45,400
So anyway, I just wanted to bring up the weather thing because there are certain things that would seem ultra-fantastic

1188
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:51,820
and, quote-unquote, ethereal or alchemic, but you can access technically pretty well.

1189
01:32:52,540 --> 01:32:55,560
In other words, the guide will get you there.

1190
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:59,040
The guide doesn't always get you there with doing other things, right?

1191
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:04,180
So there is – cooking is another one.

1192
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:07,960
That's why I think I've been thinking about it more and more, should get into the cooking,

1193
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:12,920
because 99% of it is the approach and discernment.

1194
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:20,220
And of course, you have to have the tools working well, and you have to understand sanitary conditions.

1195
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:26,640
I've noticed that most people that always complain that they have stomach aches or colds and things like that,

1196
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:30,900
if I were to visit their abode, I'd notice they had very poor hygiene.

1197
01:33:31,740 --> 01:33:34,960
And it doesn't mean like flies and shit everywhere.

1198
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:39,460
It just means they just didn't know what they were doing in the kitchen.

1199
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:40,340
Right.

1200
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:47,460
So, yeah, so maybe the food talk, because I'm always developing food

1201
01:33:47,460 --> 01:33:53,880
and the way to be a very good cook or chef, the things that are required.

1202
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:59,800
Let's say if you wanted to be the best chef in the world, it's not just the training,

1203
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:03,100
but you also have to have the best sense of taste and smell.

1204
01:34:03,260 --> 01:34:05,380
It's taste and smell that makes a good chef.

1205
01:34:05,380 --> 01:34:10,600
And when people say they learn how to cook because they went to cooking class,

1206
01:34:10,780 --> 01:34:16,780
well, I hate to tell you, but if you go to cooking class, let's say French Culinary University,

1207
01:34:17,420 --> 01:34:21,360
and you want to stake your life on becoming a chef and nobody hires you,

1208
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:25,180
you end up becoming a cooking instructor.

1209
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:27,740
So you're not really learning.

1210
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:31,160
We used to joke around with those who can't do teach, right?

1211
01:34:31,320 --> 01:34:31,500
Right.

1212
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:37,000
So, yeah, you're not going to learn anything from a cooking class.

1213
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:42,480
Well, you might, but not the fundamentals on how to progress and make it a lifelong endeavor

1214
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:46,020
where every time you make something, it's better and better and better.

1215
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:48,720
And I don't mean like you forgot something on the stove and burned it,

1216
01:34:48,780 --> 01:34:52,420
but I mean developing the skill and, yeah.

1217
01:34:54,100 --> 01:35:00,340
Okay, what I wanted to also bring up was the world that we live in generally,

1218
01:35:00,340 --> 01:35:05,880
you have to remember, well, you know how I always say food, clothing, shelter,

1219
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:08,180
make that the basis of your existence here.

1220
01:35:09,060 --> 01:35:11,280
Some people think it's really simple-minded,

1221
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:17,760
but if you're trying to up the quality of your food, clothing, and shelter, it's not readily done.

1222
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:21,400
You have to change the way you approach things, your lifestyle,

1223
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:24,020
the way you think about, let's say, shopping, right?

1224
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:29,880
You have to change the way you prepare things, the place where you live.

1225
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:31,580
How do I improve the quality?

1226
01:35:31,820 --> 01:35:34,360
I don't know how, so you have to learn more about that, right?

1227
01:35:34,580 --> 01:35:36,960
So it puts you on all these tangents and adventures,

1228
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:41,760
and on your way of learning how to improve the quality of your food, clothing, and shelter,

1229
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:44,660
you will learn so many other things, right?

1230
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:47,700
Just imagine how all-encompassing that is.

1231
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:51,460
Just let's say you want to improve the quality of your shelter and you're in a building.

1232
01:35:51,580 --> 01:35:53,880
How many aspects are there to a building, right?

1233
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:57,820
You got floors, you got walls, electrical, plumbing, right, all this stuff, right, architecture.

1234
01:35:57,820 --> 01:36:01,440
So you're going to have to get familiar with architecture and energy and all that.

1235
01:36:01,660 --> 01:36:02,480
Food, the same thing.

1236
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:05,460
There's all the substances and seasons.

1237
01:36:05,740 --> 01:36:08,880
And then clothing, you know, what rules do you live by?

1238
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:14,140
Like, for example, the covenant that I live by, avoid mixed fabrics, right?

1239
01:36:14,660 --> 01:36:20,780
So you get 90% cotton, 10% polyester, right?

1240
01:36:21,140 --> 01:36:27,400
Now it doesn't mean organic fibers only because 100% polyester is fine, you see.

1241
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:33,500
And the interesting thing is, though, polyester with nylon is fine also

1242
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:38,040
because they both come from the same stock, basically, right?

1243
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:38,580
Okay.

1244
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:45,680
So synthetic weaves are, I tend to say, are fine but not too distinct.

1245
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:49,820
Like when you mix wool and cotton, well, one is animal and one is plant.

1246
01:36:50,020 --> 01:36:54,840
But you also see cotton and linen rarely, but don't mix that either, you see,

1247
01:36:54,840 --> 01:37:00,460
because they're very distinct, where the polyester and the nylon seem distinct

1248
01:37:00,460 --> 01:37:02,340
but they're almost from the same batch.

1249
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:04,360
They're polymers, basically.

1250
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:05,900
Actually, one, I think, is a monomer.

1251
01:37:06,380 --> 01:37:07,400
But no, they're both polymers.

1252
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:07,960
Sorry.

1253
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:10,420
So, you know, you get into all these things.

1254
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:12,900
So you get, see, right now we just said, what do you wear in clothing?

1255
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,320
I didn't bring up anything regarding fashion, did I?

1256
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:16,500
No, not at all.

1257
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:16,980
Not at all.

1258
01:37:17,020 --> 01:37:21,000
See, so it gets really, it gets, it's a very, they're all wide subjects.

1259
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,640
But this is the thing.

1260
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:27,280
What you will encounter, and this is a thing that I want to add to food, clothing, shelter,

1261
01:37:27,740 --> 01:37:31,780
is that man's world as we see it now under the influences that he's been under for,

1262
01:37:32,020 --> 01:37:38,660
let's say, specifically for the past 500 years, specifically, but further back from that,

1263
01:37:39,700 --> 01:37:44,580
is the introduction of toxicity in what man does.

1264
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:47,800
It's almost like a self-sabotage but it's influenced externally.

1265
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:56,280
And I mean, so when man tries to do something, right, it turns things toxic, like with energy, right?

1266
01:37:56,340 --> 01:38:00,900
So we develop these machines, industrial revolution, we need to power them with a prime mover,

1267
01:38:01,020 --> 01:38:04,460
usually steam, coal, oil, gas, toxic, right?

1268
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:07,380
We just went over religion, right?

1269
01:38:07,380 --> 01:38:11,600
You have all of these ancient texts that impart wisdom and it becomes toxic, right?

1270
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:15,320
You have people going to war over it, whatever, you know, you want to get into it.

1271
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:23,820
Medicine, there's a need for medicinals and which medicine, okay, forget about talking about medicine being toxic.

1272
01:38:23,980 --> 01:38:25,500
Which one is not toxic?

1273
01:38:25,860 --> 01:38:29,360
Put it that way, right, that you get, you know, mainstream, right?

1274
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:30,920
Very few.

1275
01:38:32,980 --> 01:38:34,780
So, you know, you see the politics.

1276
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:41,460
Okay, so if politicians are part of government, okay, which politician is not toxic, right?

1277
01:38:41,460 --> 01:38:44,680
So research, you want to research things.

1278
01:38:45,540 --> 01:38:48,740
What kind of information are you going to get if you go on the internet now?

1279
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:51,060
Yeah, what are your materials you're researching with?

1280
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:56,320
Right, the other thing I've said for, I've been saying this for two decades and it's just from first-hand experience

1281
01:38:56,320 --> 01:39:00,960
that everything that could have been known was already known by the 1890s.

1282
01:39:03,420 --> 01:39:09,620
So, and anything past 1913 or 1920 is, you see the censorship coming in.

1283
01:39:10,900 --> 01:39:17,700
So what you're doing is trying to seek a balanced life with food, clothing and shelter and evolving interesting,

1284
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:22,320
developing new traits in the way you behave on this planet, let's say.

1285
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:27,740
Most of the time now you're going to be encountering not just on what to develop and how to improve

1286
01:39:27,740 --> 01:39:31,700
but to avoid and abate toxicity that's in the system.

1287
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:34,080
Like, for example, with energy.

1288
01:39:34,780 --> 01:39:41,140
I have no problem directly with what they call fossil fuels, which are abiotic fuels, basically.

1289
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:42,480
We've gone over this.

1290
01:39:43,480 --> 01:39:44,440
You know, like oil.

1291
01:39:45,020 --> 01:39:46,560
It's called petroleum.

1292
01:39:47,300 --> 01:39:50,820
Petro meaning rock and oleum meaning oil because it comes from rocks.

1293
01:39:50,820 --> 01:39:54,240
Just like corn oil comes from corn and olive oil comes from olives.

1294
01:39:54,340 --> 01:39:57,020
It's not a fossil fuel and all that, right?

1295
01:39:57,240 --> 01:39:57,420
Right.

1296
01:39:57,560 --> 01:40:03,000
Okay, there's nothing wrong with using that if the machines and apparatus that you're feeding it in as a fuel

1297
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,920
are hyper-efficient, very, very, very efficient.

1298
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:15,900
When you put $100 worth of gas, gasoline in an automobile, engine-driven wagon really,

1299
01:40:17,460 --> 01:40:22,100
only $20 or $30 of that gas is going to moving the car.

1300
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:27,360
The other $70 to $80 is to heat up the engine, makes heat, right?

1301
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:31,340
So all of these things, toxicity, if you understand medical,

1302
01:40:31,900 --> 01:40:35,980
when they're trying to pass a drug is how well does it go against placebo,

1303
01:40:36,140 --> 01:40:38,220
and many of them are almost as good as placebo.

1304
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:42,280
So why would you take something that has side effects that could kill you

1305
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:44,560
where you could take a sugar pill and have the same result?

1306
01:40:45,020 --> 01:40:45,120
Right.

1307
01:40:46,060 --> 01:40:49,440
So this is another big opening that you have to consider.

1308
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:55,260
And the other thing to consider is just to bounce over to the input into our bodies.

1309
01:40:55,260 --> 01:40:58,220
You ever hear of people saying you need to detox?

1310
01:40:58,860 --> 01:40:59,000
Yeah.

1311
01:40:59,520 --> 01:40:59,740
Right.

1312
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:03,620
Well, combine that with what they're saying about getting stuff out of your system

1313
01:41:03,620 --> 01:41:06,800
with what we've said about how the body does everything by induction.

1314
01:41:08,260 --> 01:41:12,480
It has nothing to do with you have bad chemicals in your body you need to flush out.

1315
01:41:12,660 --> 01:41:14,420
It's not physical, the detox.

1316
01:41:14,580 --> 01:41:15,220
It's energetic.

1317
01:41:15,780 --> 01:41:20,400
In other words, yes, those things will appear and manifest when you excrete things,

1318
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:23,080
but it's not because you put them in your body.

1319
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:25,560
They went through your intestines, and now they're in your blood.

1320
01:41:25,640 --> 01:41:27,380
No, your body created those things.

1321
01:41:28,100 --> 01:41:33,440
So maybe in the future we'll get more into what a real detox is and how it really works,

1322
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:38,260
but once you understand on the front end how it gets into the body in the first place,

1323
01:41:38,600 --> 01:41:44,300
that word detox goes away and becomes something else, becomes more of a healing modality.

1324
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:48,100
So I think we covered quite a bit on this one, number 12.

1325
01:41:48,740 --> 01:41:49,680
Yeah, absolutely.

1326
01:41:49,680 --> 01:41:50,040
Absolutely.

1327
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:54,340
We started with pledges and kind of ended with the introduction.

1328
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:54,960
Detoxing.

1329
01:41:55,620 --> 01:41:55,720
Yeah.

1330
01:41:56,600 --> 01:41:59,280
Of the idea of what a real detox might be.

1331
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:00,380
Right.

1332
01:42:00,540 --> 01:42:00,720
Yeah.

1333
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:06,120
So yeah, that's a fairly wide spectrum there, and of course government and a few other things

1334
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:10,440
along the way got analyzed a bit, I think.

1335
01:42:10,660 --> 01:42:10,900
Yes?

1336
01:42:11,060 --> 01:42:11,260
Yep.

1337
01:42:11,540 --> 01:42:16,140
Yep, and I think, yeah, I think we're good on 12, and we'll see what happens on the lucky 13.

1338
01:42:17,100 --> 01:42:17,800
There you go.

1339
01:42:17,860 --> 01:42:20,520
Maybe we'll have to talk about that numerology on 13.

1340
01:42:21,060 --> 01:42:22,520
Yeah, let's try that, yeah.

1341
01:42:22,640 --> 01:42:23,320
Let's do that too.
