1
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,660
Rated Y, Sonic Event 120, Greek, how you doing, man?

2
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,580
Mouthful of kratom and coffee, I just let it smoke, chill it.

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,200
There's not much going on in chat other than a spell correction.

4
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,500
It's Jim Cartin, C-A-R-T-I-N.

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,260
I might have passed away recently in Oro Valley, I don't know.

6
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:31,759
Yeah, yeah.

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,800
So, yeah, I just want to bring up one thing I noticed.

8
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,480
How do you sum up a lot of the Greek-speak stuff?

9
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,520
I've been speaking with people along the years about wanting to do stuff with it,

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:49,260
and one thing I'm adamant about is this is a free-flow public service, sort of, public-private.

11
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,800
And if you're going to do a project, don't call it Greek-speak or Greek or whatever.

12
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,800
You're supposed to take the—

13
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,680
Oh, is somebody trying to do that?

14
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,280
Well, Sam, you know, is doing it. I don't mind that.

15
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,700
But what I even mentioned to him, when he first, first started it seven years ago,

16
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,840
call it something else because it's not about me.

17
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,120
It's not about—this is about holding people accountable.

18
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,680
So if you go to a bank, they're supposed to know what banks are supposed to do.

19
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,540
If you go to a doctor, they're supposed to know about the human body.

20
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,040
If you go to a lawyer, there are no more lawyers or attorneys.

21
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,120
They always give me a hard time, and they look it up, and they say,

22
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,900
well, a lawyer is an attorney now, of course, because there's nobody left.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,960
I want to get into how the country's been abandoned.

24
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,540
So the whole thing is to—By the way, anyone—

25
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,660
Okay, John Butts, who passed away—

26
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:45,000
I've had a lot of conversations of natural action tech, by the way, technologies.

27
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,220
He passed away, and he would call me and say,

28
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,980
I was in a conversation the other day, and I used a lot of your stuff.

29
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,620
Like, you know, I'm just visiting here, taking notes.

30
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,700
I said, that's fine. I mean, it doesn't matter to me.

31
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,000
I mean, saying these things in a way—

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,140
Okay, so you mentioned to me that you're saying what I'm saying. That's fine.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,780
All right, so say what I'm saying.

34
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,740
But what's the next level? What's the next level to that?

35
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,460
Take it on. It's going to be your stuff now, right?

36
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,480
So adapt it into your stuff, and now apply it.

37
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,020
Then you've got to apply it, right? Not just say it.

38
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,680
Yeah, use the stuff that I'm the first to say, let's say.

39
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,060
Because that's what drives me, and that's what drives me crazy.

40
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:29,220
Look, you're not actually taking ownership of this, because you're the Greek, right?

41
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,880
So anybody could be—no offense, but anybody could be the Greek.

42
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,320
2010, I was doing my private audio with Angela Stark.

43
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,640
She wanted to interview me.

44
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,680
And really long Greek name. She goes, you've got to get your nickname.

45
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,840
I said, I will figure something out.

46
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,760
A week later, right before the call starts, she goes, all right, we'll just call you the Greek.

47
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,760
Sure enough.

48
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,120
And it stuck, right?

49
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,340
But it was also—that had come up before, right?

50
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,500
When cell phones first came out in the late 90s,

51
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,180
someone says, I've got your number right here.

52
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,660
Someone asked for my number.

53
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,460
I said, it's all right, I have his number.

54
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:10,940
And he pushed the contact menu, and I looked over at the phone, and he had the Greek.

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,200
So anyway, it seems to be recurring.

56
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:20,400
But what I mean by this is I would like to see—and not just on any specific subject.

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,020
Lately—okay, just expansion.

58
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,860
Expansion, that's all it is.

59
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:24,520
Okay.

60
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,020
So it's kind of like when a country—you know, the country expanded.

61
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,760
It just didn't become the westward territories.

62
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,560
It became all the different states west of the Mississippi, right?

63
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,360
Kind of like that.

64
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,400
It's an analogy, right?

65
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,120
Well, fair enough.

66
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,200
Because it was the western territories, you know, before the French-Indian War.

67
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,500
So it starts with an idea, and then here's some substance.

68
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,280
Now we're going to give a name to that substance.

69
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,540
Now what do you do with it, is the question, right?

70
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,280
Well, we talked about a few sonics ago, what we do to do with it.

71
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,220
This is for people that do things and have skills.

72
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:54,700
Yes.

73
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,340
Because it's going to help you, right?

74
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:02,520
Because, you know, if you're a snowflake and you cry about somebody saying something about you

75
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:07,820
or your parents raised you with a silver platter and you can't handle adversity or whatever,

76
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:11,960
this isn't going to help you because this will create mental adversity, like I've told people before.

77
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,980
You try to live the stuff that I'm saying.

78
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,839
You say goodbye to your relationships and family and all that there, right?

79
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,740
The collective can't mix it.

80
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,820
So it's true.

81
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,060
But anyway, anyone who's doing anything with it, as long as it brings good, that's fine.

82
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,520
What did I say I was going to catch up on and mention just now?

83
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,140
Oh, there's a guy, Brandon, John Brandon Williams, something like that,

84
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,200
talks about getting rid of contracts.

85
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,340
It came up recently.

86
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,720
Someone said, listen to this guy.

87
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,260
And he discovered recently about all kinds.

88
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,320
Brandon Williams or John Brown is pretty popular right now.

89
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,140
He's only been at it for a year or less.

90
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,260
And it's all about releasing contracts.

91
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,240
But I had the videos that I'm working on a packaged AC unit.

92
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,400
So I had hours and hours of background.

93
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,180
Let some of this stuff play.

94
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,240
Not once.

95
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,560
He talks a lot about money, but he doesn't mention the conditional endorsement.

96
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,500
So he's going to get a lot of people in trouble.

97
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,640
You know, the 12 USC 411, right?

98
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,760
Because the Supreme Court case, basically,

99
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,100
there's people that argued the money any which way till Sunday,

100
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,000
you know, with gold and all that.

101
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,700
And the Supreme Court opinion on it was I don't see where he made a demand anywhere.

102
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,880
So he loses.

103
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,960
They're not going to tell you what code you should use, but they'll hint, you know, right?

104
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,080
Because the code is explicit.

105
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,020
You have to make a demand for it.

106
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,180
It's sort of like the famous case where, you know,

107
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,920
the bank was going after a guy for a mortgage,

108
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:46,100
and then he proved that the bank didn't actually own the property to begin with to sell it to him in the first place.

109
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:51,260
And when you do that, yes, if you break, you know, look, contracts are contracts, right?

110
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,460
I mean, yeah, but it's different.

111
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,740
That's what I wanted to get into.

112
00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:01,460
But if you voluntarily sign something or you ascribe something with your signature,

113
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,220
that's a fairly powerful thing.

114
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,320
Legally and lawfully, right?

115
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,240
Both legally and lawfully, isn't it?

116
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,700
Well, legally, it's powerful for them, not for you,

117
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:14,180
because you've abrogated all of your defenses and rights, let's say.

118
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,460
But here's the thing.

119
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,460
Okay, so this guy Brandon Williams, whoever he's talking,

120
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,860
he knows more than 99 percent of 99.999 percent of all the attorneys in the country put together.

121
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,160
And he's only been studying for two years.

122
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,000
Of course.

123
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:28,300
Right?

124
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,400
I've been looking at this for more than two decades.

125
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:37,560
I can say I know more than 99.999 percent of attorneys and Supreme Court judges in law, right?

126
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,140
How does that help us?

127
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:44,580
Absolutely nothing, because now they go into savage mode because, you know, like animals,

128
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,340
if you go to them, it doesn't matter.

129
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,160
Doctors are the same.

130
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:53,400
Yes, I do know more than 99.999 percent of doctors in the country or the world.

131
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,120
And these things are just sort of rudimentary.

132
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,520
I've said many times, you want to be an expert on something, believe it or not,

133
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:04,600
contrary to what you've been told, if you study it for five minutes a day in like two years,

134
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,520
you'll be in the world authority on it.

135
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:06,900
Yeah.

136
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,040
You know, even let's say an hour a day in a couple of years, you'll be very simple, very easy.

137
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,780
All you have to do is amass everything that's been amassed about it, get familiar with it,

138
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,860
and then see how it's being applied and then do your own applications.

139
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,020
And you'll be a world authority.

140
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,640
I mean, workable world authority.

141
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,440
They won't recognize you because you're not part of their clubs, their respective clubs,

142
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,140
whatever topic you're studying.

143
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,280
Right?

144
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:37,060
So these people, what they do, and I've had lunch twice, not once, twice.

145
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,280
Do you know the Miranda rights?

146
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,220
Yeah, of course.

147
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:40,660
Right?

148
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,820
Everybody, they even popularize them and say, okay, the person who penned that is a Supreme Court,

149
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,060
is a Supreme Justice.

150
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,660
His name is John Fitzgerald Malloy, and I had lunch with him twice.

151
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,040
And he invited me.

152
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,240
So he doesn't know much about law either.

153
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,720
He's passed away now because this was more than a decade ago, and he was about 90.

154
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,760
Yeah, he was old then.

155
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,640
A decade and a half.

156
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,080
Yeah.

157
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:09,240
So he was in his early 90s, and this was in the 2000 single digits, like seven or six or something.

158
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,960
The 20-ops, whatever you call it.

159
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,260
Yeah.

160
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:20,440
So he doesn't even, so basically what he let me in on, who are you going to tell this to?

161
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,340
Meaning they've got everybody.

162
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,480
Okay.

163
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,020
There's a guy in town, Josh Alberton.

164
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,500
He's in prison now.

165
00:08:31,299 --> 00:08:36,220
And I did a lot of studying, helped him out with a bunch of stuff, and vice versa.

166
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,640
He-

167
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,700
Doesn't sound like a ringing endorsement right away there.

168
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,700
I helped him out with a bunch of stuff.

169
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,660
He's in prison now, but sorry.

170
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,340
Yeah, no, no, but he's in prison for going.

171
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,280
Anyway, it's a long story, but he didn't, his legal stuff-

172
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,140
He didn't go to prison as a result of what you told him, is what you're saying.

173
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,480
No, no, not at all.

174
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:54,680
Okay.

175
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,820
No, he was just very aggressive.

176
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,620
He showed that you could buy a house with a social security number, right?

177
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:58,980
Okay.

178
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,600
Just put your social security number, make a check, and it clears and everything.

179
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,180
So I was like, oh, they're going to, I said, why are you doing this?

180
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,940
I want to be wealthy.

181
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,020
I'm like, oh, wrong planet, wrong planet, wrong planet.

182
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,380
And I stopped talking to him.

183
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,160
But anyway, he, where was I going with this?

184
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,300
Well, you had given him some advice.

185
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,040
Yeah, good.

186
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,900
Yeah, but okay, but anyway, just as an example, he was doing all this legal stuff very, very, very aggressively.

187
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:26,640
Right.

188
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:31,900
And what happens is when you start working and understanding stuff, none of the people,

189
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,780
like when you're doing legal stuff, you're going to deal with attorneys, judges, bankers, right, people.

190
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:42,320
None of them knew anything, what he was talking about, even though it was in their own rule books, right?

191
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,800
So they're like animals.

192
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,060
So what they do is, oh, this is what I wanted to get to.

193
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:50,520
He put in a bunch of paperwork to get people released from jail.

194
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,080
And all of a sudden it was working.

195
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,000
So what they did is they put him on the nightly news where you want this guy, the police want this guy.

196
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,140
Right.

197
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,000
And they put his face up because, you know, and everything.

198
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,260
Right.

199
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,420
And so wherever he went, people were giving him funny looks.

200
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,420
Everyone watches, you know, the collective.

201
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:07,840
Right.

202
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:14,200
I've seen clients, by the way, years ago when I was out in the field more and more at large, especially older clients.

203
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,020
Oh, you know, it was like five to six.

204
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:16,620
I got to go.

205
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,300
I got to go.

206
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,100
Where are you going?

207
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,420
I have to watch the news.

208
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,780
You know, it's like it was like a religious, you know, I have to go to church.

209
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,680
You know, I can't be late.

210
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,300
Right.

211
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:30,240
So wherever he was going, people were looking at him funny because they kept putting it once.

212
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,520
I think they did it on the nightly news primetime.

213
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,660
They're looking for this guy.

214
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,840
They put his name out and all that.

215
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,100
So that's all they have to do.

216
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,340
How many times have you heard where they plant things on you?

217
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,020
Right.

218
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:52,160
There was there was the Jim and Joanne Moriarty, the people, the oil people from Libya that got caught up there and they escaped ISIS.

219
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,060
Oh, right. Yeah.

220
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,840
And they were talking about it when they came here.

221
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:59,040
And he went to Wal-Mart to have some tires changed.

222
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,760
And the guy found a package under there.

223
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,760
They let him have it because they got pulled over by the police later.

224
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,160
And they were all looking under the car.

225
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:07,900
Remember that story?

226
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,340
And they're like, she was here, supposed to be here somewhere.

227
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:15,680
But the guy who then there was the police strapped a box of drugs under their car.

228
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:21,180
And when unbeknownst to the police, they stopped at Wal-Mart Moriarty's and had some tire work done.

229
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:24,440
And the guy, they said the guy was full of tattoos, looked a little worn.

230
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,660
He probably found the package, took it off, took it home.

231
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,680
Right. Probably.

232
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:32,600
And the sheriff that was there, the police that were looking under the car after they were pulled over for no reason.

233
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,080
He's on his earpiece.

234
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,840
And they hear him saying, keep looking.

235
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,760
It should be there.

236
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,380
You know?

237
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,280
Yeah. Right.

238
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,260
Yeah. Also, I've seen one of those trackers on a car, by the way.

239
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,420
I knew someone who had one.

240
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,840
And he said, why don't you take it off?

241
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,700
I said, no, no, take it off.

242
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,480
This is your chance to fuck with them, you know?

243
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:51,400
Take the car, put it, you know, can you get another car?

244
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,700
Do you have to use this one?

245
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,740
And just start, you know, let someone else drive it.

246
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,980
Someone else that's got a weird route.

247
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,220
And we knew someone that was a drug runner, a legal drug runner.

248
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,180
You know that drug stores don't keep a tremendous supply.

249
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,440
They rely on every two or three days getting a delivery from a warehouse.

250
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:09,980
Right.

251
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,280
Also, they don't stock up drug stores, you know, in pharmacies and pharmacies.

252
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,560
When I was growing up, we called them drug stores.

253
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,220
Right.

254
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,540
In supermarkets that much because they could be robbed.

255
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,460
You know, imagine they, you know, certain pills are popular and they know they've got 20,000 of them, right?

256
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,700
Yeah. That's why they don't.

257
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,640
They go to the cash register. Yeah.

258
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,120
Right. They don't keep a huge inventory because you get away with.

259
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,840
I mean, it's a lot easier to carry a couple of those big bottles, you know, with 500 pills.

260
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,540
Yeah, they're huge.

261
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,360
Yeah, that's right.

262
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,080
They are big bottles.

263
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,580
You know, they're kilogram size.

264
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:36,840
Yeah.

265
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,660
Literally, it says one kilo on there.

266
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:38,900
Yeah.

267
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,200
Over 5,000 capsules or whatever.

268
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,580
So you take a bag full of those home, you'll get more than you would a bag full of cash and it weighs less.

269
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,540
So, yeah, go ahead.

270
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,980
So Don was a real estate guy and he was running drugs out of a warehouse in service.

271
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,260
He serviced all the supermarket grocery stores out of pharmacies.

272
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:56,920
And he used it.

273
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,260
Anyway, so I could write a short story, make a short movie about all this stuff.

274
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,860
Oh, I've heard of people taking those.

275
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:10,200
Yeah, I've heard of people taking those and sticking them unbeknownst to, you know, the taxicab guys just sticking on a taxi.

276
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,620
You know, it's great, especially in a busy area.

277
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,180
But the interesting thing here, though, because he was a drug runner.

278
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:16,680
Yeah.

279
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:22,540
Meaning, you know, a licensed drug runner because he was taking wholesale drugs to grocery and resupplying them.

280
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,020
So I thought it was a funny thing.

281
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:24,860
Yeah, no, definitely.

282
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:31,900
So anyway, this legal stuff, when you end up knowing more about the people that are supposed to know,

283
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,600
they have the collective on their side to turn against you.

284
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,360
Now you become Dr. Frankenstein.

285
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,020
And here come the angry villagers with pitchforks and they don't know what they're angry about.

286
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,760
They've never seen the monster. Right.

287
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,520
So this guy, Brandon, he's what he's saying is mostly correct.

288
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:48,980
It's not airtight.

289
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,000
I use that term very often.

290
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,080
I hope it gives a good analogy.

291
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:52,640
Right.

292
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,020
It's mostly correct.

293
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,880
But right now he's in two years.

294
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:01,360
He's gotten to the level where he knows more than ninety nine point nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine percent of attorneys on the planet.

295
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,040
Right. Is that good?

296
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,360
Yes. Overall, it's good.

297
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:10,340
If you're going to do a tour group from someone for a group visiting this planet wants to learn about it.

298
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,860
Right. But the idiots that are born here, the morons that are here, it's just going to make them mad at you.

299
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,460
Right. So you have to keep that in mind.

300
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,740
You understand where I'm going.

301
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:27,580
Like, for example, because when I bring up to people that work in the medical field, biological vacuum.

302
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,140
Right.

303
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:32,260
They know I just mentioned something profound, but they can't associate with it.

304
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,220
What does it mean?

305
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,760
Well, it's a natural living.

306
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,180
Imagine an object, just an object doesn't have to be living or anything, just an object, a container.

307
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,300
Yeah. When it's not completely sealed or it could be this.

308
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,340
It's the same pressure inside the boxes outside the container, right outside the box.

309
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,440
Same pressure because it's open.

310
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:56,860
Now, if you close the container, seal it, it still probably is the same pressure until a temperature difference takes place.

311
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:00,080
If you drop the temperature through the container, the pressure goes down.

312
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,560
Right. Vacuum. Right.

313
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,700
And that's why, you know, people, old people have a hard time opening jars.

314
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,420
Right. Right. Because they're sealed when they're hot.

315
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,040
And then if the pressure inside the container goes up, the pressure increases.

316
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,880
You take the lid off, the lid pops. Right.

317
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:20,200
So. OK, so we understand things that are closed systems can have varying pressures.

318
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,460
Right now, when you go to all living things, all with a capital L.

319
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,680
All living things. OK.

320
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,280
Have a biological vacuum.

321
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:38,580
In other words, once they are formed from seed, literally humans come from a seed, also two seeds.

322
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,160
Right. All the way up to maturity till death.

323
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,060
There's a biological vacuum at death.

324
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,020
The vacuum ceases to exist.

325
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:52,100
And then you have the onset, the onset of chemical decomposition.

326
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,980
Now, let's go back to the container.

327
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,060
Let's say you have a metal container with aggressive acid.

328
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,580
And you have a very thin lining of plastic to prevent the acid from attacking the container.

329
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:09,420
Once that lining goes away, the acid inside the container is going to aggressively attack the metal.

330
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,340
Right. And go through. Right.

331
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,660
You know, it's funny, a lot of people say, I don't like drinking from plastic.

332
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,540
So they drink out of a can.

333
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,460
What an idiot.

334
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,700
The can is lined with plastic.

335
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,880
Actually, there's an experiment you can do.

336
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,820
I saw it on YouTube. I've been telling people this for 30 years.

337
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,700
Take a Coke can, whatever aluminum can, and put it in sodium hydroxide.

338
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,020
Don't open the can. Leave it closed.

339
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,120
Which is lye. A little hot lye would be even better.

340
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,140
And you'll see the aluminum completely dissolve.

341
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,020
And all you'd be left with is a very thin-walled pouch.

342
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,720
Plastic with your drink still inside of it.

343
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,920
All the aluminum will dissolve and you'll have a pouch of Coke or Sprite or whatever's in the can.

344
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,180
Beer.

345
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,260
There's a couple of YouTube videos.

346
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:56,500
Someone said to me, I heard you talking about this and there's a video on that.

347
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,040
I'm like, great.

348
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,240
I'm going to have to look that up.

349
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,200
Sodium hydroxide lye will completely dissolve aluminum.

350
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,099
It turns into hydrogen. Don't make too many sparks either.

351
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,339
It'll make a big fire if it's closed.

352
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,300
Flammable.

353
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,980
Yeah, even though hydrogen is very flammable, it moves at 700 feet per second.

354
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,240
Just under the speed of sound.

355
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,140
It's the fastest moving gas.

356
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,780
That's why they use it in a rocket.

357
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,640
All rocket fuels, the main constituent is some hydrogen compound.

358
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,300
So it's almost bang for your buck.

359
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,140
No pun intended.

360
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:34,060
That's why I was laughing at people still using gunpowder.

361
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,460
People are into guns.

362
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,560
Here in Arizona, into guns.

363
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,180
I said, oh, that's that gunpowder shit.

364
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:39,880
Get away from it.

365
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,440
Start using hydrogen-based stuff.

366
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,400
You'd be able to shoot a tennis ball through a brick wall.

367
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:44,820
But anyway.

368
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,680
If you could shoot a tennis ball through a brick wall,

369
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:53,160
could you imagine what you could do if you had a hollow point?

370
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:54,760
No kidding.

371
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,580
Yeah, it would be armor-piercing very easily.

372
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,200
So anyway.

373
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,880
Idiots. Idiots. These humans are idiots.

374
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:07,220
Anyway, what I wanted to bring up was just because people don't know something

375
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,660
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

376
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,100
Again, I'm commenting on the guys doing the legal work.

377
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,960
I think it's John Brandon Williams or something.

378
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,840
Legal stuff about getting rid of contracts.

379
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,980
He knows so much, and I'm impressed that he's learned a lot in two years.

380
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,580
No mention of the other things that I mentioned that are important.

381
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,300
But that's fine.

382
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'm not saying it works.

383
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,260
But he's going to have a lot of hard-knock experiences,

384
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,700
even though he has some successes.

385
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,300
Because you're on planet Earth.

386
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,620
You're a bunch of savage morons, basically.

387
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,040
That's why early on in the...

388
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,840
And by the way, no one did anything to piss me off.

389
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,420
I'm not saying...

390
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,260
I'm saying this with the most amount of affection possible.

391
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:45,700
Okay.

392
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,720
Just like when you hang out in the ghetto,

393
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,760
women are affectionately referred to as bitches.

394
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,340
Right?

395
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,020
It's not, right? Okay.

396
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,320
Where in other situations, when you refer to a woman as a...

397
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:57,500
Right?

398
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,800
And also, if you're not around dog people,

399
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,100
and you see a female dog and say,

400
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,140
that's a really nice bitch,

401
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,360
people around you get offended.

402
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,300
You just said something, right?

403
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:06,760
Yeah.

404
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,080
So you see the context of how it's used?

405
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:09,580
Of course.

406
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,600
This is exactly what's going on also.

407
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,940
Now, just because people don't know something,

408
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,360
people in the plural or singular,

409
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,040
it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

410
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,640
But most people have the emotional attachment

411
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,500
that the latter part is untrue.

412
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,020
In other words,

413
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,840
if people don't know something,

414
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,240
they inherently believe it doesn't exist.

415
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,300
Right?

416
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,320
You know the old saying,

417
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,700
I think, therefore I am?

418
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:37,680
Right?

419
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,400
So thinking what you know and what you think

420
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,800
as bearing on your proof of existence.

421
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,340
So if you don't know about something,

422
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,240
and you're made aware of it,

423
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,500
you have to prove that it exists,

424
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,600
because if you don't, it still doesn't exist

425
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,160
to the person, even though it was mentioned.

426
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,360
This is exactly what's going on.

427
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,920
On the other side of that coin,

428
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,480
the more something is repeated,

429
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,080
no matter how ridiculous it is,

430
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,600
it becomes more believable

431
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,800
simply by virtue of the fact

432
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,400
that it was repeated over and over again.

433
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,700
So people hear it over and over again.

434
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,520
They start saying,

435
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,140
well, it must be true.

436
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:10,940
I keep hearing that.

437
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,920
Because the repeat is an emo.

438
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,920
It's kind of like the woodpecker.

439
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,020
Not the woodpecker sound,

440
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,600
but when you're cracking a sidewalk,

441
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,880
it's repetitive hitting

442
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,620
that gets the job done.

443
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,380
The only thing worse than a woodpecker

444
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,140
is a two-headed woodpecker, but yeah, go ahead.

445
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,180
So when you say the word person,

446
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,820
they think it's a people

447
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,700
because they're emotionally attached to it.

448
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,400
Where in legal and in law,

449
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,600
it doesn't mean that at all,

450
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,440
because if you look at old documents

451
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,300
that were written in law,

452
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,300
they said the people of the United States.

453
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,980
Never use the word person

454
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,060
until they get into the corporate side,

455
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:48,800
the fictional side.

456
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,780
The people have been taken so far away

457
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,800
for so long

458
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,660
from what they could know,

459
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,680
not what they should know,

460
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,420
because they are where they should be.

461
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,200
There's an emotional attachment

462
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,340
to the word person.

463
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,080
They think it involves them.

464
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,460
They don't know the definition of it,

465
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,620
just like the word nice.

466
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,700
They have an emotional attachment

467
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,160
that nice is something positive.

468
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,260
That's my point.

469
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,300
There's an emotional attachment there.

470
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,400
It doesn't matter what the word really means

471
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,820
or what it actually applies to

472
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,480
because they think...

473
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,880
It's the emotion attached to the word, the sound.

474
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,560
For example, when you ask someone

475
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,660
your name, you know what you're really asking them,

476
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,300
what sound do you answer to?

477
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,120
Yeah, of course.

478
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:32,340
Right?

479
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,560
I was at a Chinese restaurant once

480
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,160
and the woman was obviously very Chinese from China.

481
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,060
Just came here.

482
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,820
Barely spoke enough English.

483
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,080
By the way, in China they have

484
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,100
schools to prepare you

485
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,280
for coming to America to work in the restaurant business

486
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:47,920
specifically.

487
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,280
It's a crash course for two weeks.

488
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,540
I've heard this before.

489
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,620
I've never seen it for myself,

490
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,200
but I've heard this before.

491
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,800
Yeah, and also in China men do the cooking.

492
00:21:59,060 --> 00:21:59,420
But anyway,

493
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,440
you won't see a woman cooking in a Chinese restaurant ever.

494
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,780
They're always the waiters or wives.

495
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,760
Yeah, I was just going to say,

496
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,940
I don't think I've ever seen a woman cook

497
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,120
in a Chinese restaurant,

498
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,520
whether it's the old-fashioned ones.

499
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,000
You remember there were the old-fashioned ones

500
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,320
with the red tablecloths

501
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,520
and the guys all had the same uniform?

502
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,780
Yeah, that's the stereotypical one.

503
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,440
Yeah, like the one you saw

504
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,520
in the movie Christmas Story

505
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,980
when they do the...

506
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,660
Yeah, they all wear black.

507
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,420
They wear tuxedos, bow ties, white shirts, black pants.

508
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,940
Velvet, red velvet.

509
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,860
Yeah, but whether it's that

510
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,200
or it's the strip mall style one

511
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,620
now where everybody's in a t-shirt

512
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,680
and the kids are there too,

513
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,260
I've always seen the men do the cooking anyway.

514
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:41,800
Never women.

515
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,440
I was going to go work at a Chinese restaurant.

516
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,140
By the way, Asian people love my food.

517
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,120
I was close to a Vietnamese restaurant here.

518
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:51,920
I helped them out.

519
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:52,880
One day I said,

520
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,400
I'm going to cook dinner and I came home.

521
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,920
I cooked it here and I brought it in.

522
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,160
And the waiter got in trouble

523
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,720
because he kept saying in Vietnamese

524
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,400
how good my food was, especially my fried rice.

525
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,400
And he got in trouble with the owner.

526
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,200
He said, what are you talking about?

527
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,120
We have fried rice here.

528
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,300
He got kind of shamed.

529
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,700
But I've done this for more than one Asian restaurant.

530
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,200
I kind of befriended them and then cooked for them

531
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:13,860
and they were amazed.

532
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,100
They were amazed that I could work a wok

533
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,340
because I could hear them.

534
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,000
For example,

535
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,760
Vietnamese and Chinese happened.

536
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,740
I approached the wok. They were really busy.

537
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,060
I said, I'll make the meal.

538
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:26,900
They're like, no, no, no.

539
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,180
They saw me working the wok and they all stopped

540
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,300
and started talking to each other.

541
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,800
I don't believe this white boy could do it.

542
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,760
Look at this white boy. He's got skills.

543
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,040
They gave me mad respect after that.

544
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:38,480
But anyway,

545
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,680
where was I going with this?

546
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,260
Sound you answer to.

547
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,600
I saw her

548
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,640
and I said,

549
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,780
her name tag said Jane.

550
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,160
J-A-N-E.

551
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,240
I said, what's your name in Chinese?

552
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,660
She said, Ting.

553
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,440
Very simple.

554
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,940
You would spell that T-S-A-N-E,

555
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,980
let's say phonetically.

556
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,960
Ting, not Jane.

557
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,120
Jane ended up being really close.

558
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,040
She was fortunate.

559
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,980
You could pick an English name

560
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,580
or Romanized English name,

561
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,240
American name

562
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,420
that's very close to your original name.

563
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,060
That's why one of the biggest tell-tale signs

564
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,780
that they really fucked up the Bible

565
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,740
is when you look at the names

566
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,380
of the prophets

567
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,620
and what they changed them to.

568
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,220
Yeshayahu is Isaiah.

569
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,520
Come on, guys.

570
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:29,780
No.

571
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,800
They're trying to tell you

572
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,820
what's going on,

573
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,900
but they can't define it for you.

574
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,480
People just go along with it.

575
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,960
I can't underscore

576
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,800
this enough.

577
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,400
How important the emotional attachment

578
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,500
is to the meanings of words

579
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,920
that you think they mean, not their proper meaning.

580
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,580
We've done enough talk

581
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,360
about the emo.

582
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,160
You can actually drive people,

583
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,600
control people,

584
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,460
whether they know the

585
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,760
correct meaning of the word or not

586
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,360
by what emotion is attached

587
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,280
to that word.

588
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,360
Nice is the easiest one.

589
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,240
They even have shirts and bumper stickers.

590
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,320
I saw one recently that said,

591
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,520
Have a nice day.

592
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,520
With a smiley face.

593
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,000
They'll take it momentarily.

594
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,340
That's why I always tell them

595
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,380
to look it up themselves

596
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,080
if they have a stupid rectangle.

597
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,440
What's a stupid rectangle?

598
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,360
The reason I don't like

599
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,760
defining it is because when someone

600
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,440
looks something up, they do it with a little effort.

601
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,500
Now they're a little invested

602
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,900
and it has 70-80% more punch

603
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,260
when they look it up themselves.

604
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,600
Then they go right back

605
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,240
to the little red flashy thing

606
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:42,960
in Men in Black.

607
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,400
I talk to people and say,

608
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,080
That's incredible.

609
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:48,040
I give people in public

610
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,720
2 or 3 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes

611
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,340
of Greek speak.

612
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,760
That's wonderful. Thank you.

613
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,780
I say, You're not going to remember a thing I said once I walk away.

614
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:55,740
They're like, Huh?

615
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,000
I actually do tell them that.

616
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,460
You're not going to remember a damn thing

617
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,420
you heard here once I leave.

618
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,840
That's why I've been able to repeatedly do the whole thing

619
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,060
where I look at the etymology.

620
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,020
The etymology website, I love that by the way.

621
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,260
Etymology online or whatever it's called.

622
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,060
It's bookmarked.

623
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:12,560
Sure.

624
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,460
The dictionary is diction.

625
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,620
How you should pronounce.

626
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,380
That's why when you look up a word in the dictionary

627
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,780
it always shows the phonetic spelling first

628
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,440
and then the common definition.

629
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,400
Not the etymology.

630
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,420
Sometimes they give some etymology.

631
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,260
The only reason why they do that

632
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,000
is to give you an indicator

633
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,300
as to identify the word

634
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,180
specifically.

635
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,480
That's why it's like that.

636
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,020
The purpose of the dictionary

637
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,180
was to create uniformity in society.

638
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,220
Because they were going for the industrial age.

639
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,520
Yeah, that's the uniformity.

640
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,140
The oldest dictionary you can find

641
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,300
is the Industrial Revolution.

642
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,020
There were no dictionaries before that.

643
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,600
You were educated or not.

644
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,820
The dictionaries are a product

645
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,260
of the Industrial Revolution

646
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,200
because what they did

647
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,900
was they didn't

648
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,180
gauge people on character.

649
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,600
They gauged people with a stopwatch.

650
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,300
In other words, you showed up to work,

651
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,620
they put a stopwatch on you.

652
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,220
Your character was not important

653
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,320
because how many pieces you made per hour

654
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,020
times how much they could sell them for

655
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,780
equals this.

656
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,780
They wanted productive workers.

657
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,060
Ford was not the first assembly line.

658
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,300
It was Dodge.

659
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,920
But Dodge didn't move the cars.

660
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:24,780
He moved the people.

661
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,960
Ford moved the cars and didn't move the people.

662
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,360
As a matter of fact,

663
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,580
Ford, from the history

664
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,120
there are several things I can talk about Ford.

665
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,680
I studied him a lot in the 80s.

666
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,140
He did a free

667
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,980
energy thing too. You could probably

668
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,300
still find it online. It's called the cow magnet.

669
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,740
I'm not going to get into the

670
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,160
free energy that he did.

671
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,700
If you bought a Model T or a Model A

672
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,920
after you owned it for a certain while, he secretly

673
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,140
sent you a box of cow

674
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,540
magnets and instructions.

675
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,560
See all those holes around the cow

676
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,880
that everyone asks what that's for?

677
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,180
You put these magnets in there and then you'll find out.

678
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,860
Basically, I'm not going to get into it.

679
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,680
But once the engine warmed up

680
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,800
and you had the cow magnets in there, it just ran and ran

681
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,920
and ran with no fuel. Very little fuel.

682
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,760
Basically, the vapors. In other words, if your

683
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,740
gas tank, which was the size of a large

684
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,240
coffee can in those days,

685
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,800
ran out of fuel, there was enough vapors

686
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,800
in there to run it for as far as you wanted to go.

687
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,700
But you could look it up. Ford cow

688
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,900
magnets. So you wouldn't believe

689
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,860
how many people that are car historians have never heard

690
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,840
of it. It may not even be online.

691
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,440
Who knows? This is what

692
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,860
the benefit of reading old books.

693
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:30,440
But the king

694
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,140
of old books on the Internet is archaics,

695
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,000
by the way, not me.

696
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,960
I'm pretty much telling you what I've

697
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,920
read, and I'll paraphrase, and you can find it great

698
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,940
if not tough shit. Because I ain't

699
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,840
going back to the New York City Public Library.

700
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,080
The main one with the lions outside on 42nd

701
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,560
and right

702
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,560
by the park there.

703
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,080
Yeah, is that even there anymore?

704
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,840
Yeah, is that even there anymore?

705
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,540
You know that Bryant Park, by the way, by the library?

706
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,740
They spend a quarter of a million dollars

707
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,200
a year on the flowers and the landscaping

708
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:58,780
of Little Park.

709
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,780
Yeah, and they also spend another

710
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,680
quarter of a million a year on maintaining

711
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,760
the bathroom. Have you been in the bathroom in Bryant Park?

712
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,700
I don't remember being there.

713
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,120
It's like a luxury hotel. It's a public bathroom.

714
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,800
It's a New York City Public

715
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,900
Park bathroom. It's like being in a luxury hotel.

716
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,800
Is that one of those things with the couch in it

717
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,300
and all that? Is it like that?

718
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,420
No, no couch. It's just all marble gold fixtures.

719
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,360
Yeah, it's beautiful.

720
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:24,020
There's an attendant. Super clean.

721
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,920
Then they have the automatic

722
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,920
down by City Hall. They have the automatic bathrooms

723
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,820
that look like these big stainless steel cylinders.

724
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,900
You go in there and once you're done using

725
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,140
it, it seals it up.

726
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,260
No one can go in there for a minute and

727
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,360
it sprays down the whole thing.

728
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,600
It dries it and then the next person can go in.

729
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,800
Are you familiar with that one?

730
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,100
No, I've never seen that either.

731
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,020
So anyway, I used to go to the library there

732
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,060
and Henry Ford

733
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:49,960
worked with Dodge.

734
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,860
This is his story. This is very easily

735
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,480
to access and he left the company.

736
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,740
He took his name and

737
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,820
he still ordered engines

738
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,900
and things from Dodge.

739
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,140
When he ordered engines, he specified

740
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,660
they should be crated

741
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,680
in a certain kind of wood and a certain species

742
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,060
of wood and when the engines

743
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,040
came, not in those specified

744
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:10,860
crates,

745
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,740
he sent them back because he

746
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,580
salvaged the wood from the crate

747
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,580
to put the wood into the body because there were

748
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,640
real wood sides on cars in those days.

749
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,800
This is how stringent

750
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,500
he was and how cheap he was.

751
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,180
He was a real bastard too.

752
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,620
Henry Ford, but you look where

753
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,060
it got him.

754
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,500
It's the real bastards

755
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,560
in the world. The real hard, like Vanderbilt

756
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,520
was a real bastard.

757
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,700
When there were strikes and stuff like that

758
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,660
with Vanderbilt, he just paid the army to go

759
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,480
and shoot everybody. There were

760
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,460
massacres and strikes back in the day.

761
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,540
Many industrialists paid all sorts

762
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,100
of different people to just go in and either

763
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,240
beat somebody to death with shovels or shoot

764
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,640
them. That's right. It was brutal.

765
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,260
Also, what was it?

766
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,080
The fruit company.

767
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:57,000
The American fruit company where they killed

768
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,020
2,000 workers picking bananas.

769
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,380
You could look it up. Massacre.

770
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,420
United Fruit and then they were followed by...

771
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,960
Yeah, United Fruit. There you go.

772
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,900
And the sugar company right after.

773
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,260
That's what I was going to say.

774
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,120
You're domino sugar today.

775
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:11,720
Right. Go ahead.

776
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,460
You're dealing with some people who say,

777
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,320
oh, good old days. No, it wasn't.

778
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,340
It was brutal. It was brutality. Extreme

779
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,620
brutality. Law is great,

780
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,360
but if you're

781
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,040
subject to it and you're on the wrong...

782
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,460
If you have witnesses, it's brutal.

783
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:29,060
You don't want to be under it on the wrong side.

784
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,400
In West Virginia and Kentucky

785
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,360
alone, over 10,000 people were killed

786
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,020
over tobacco fields,

787
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,760
by the way, just during a little

788
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,200
time of consolidation.

789
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,440
A consolidation with the tobacco

790
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:40,940
companies.

791
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:43,940
A company

792
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,580
in Labor Day.

793
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,260
These farmers

794
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,360
wanted to sell their tobacco at a different

795
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,320
price. They thought they could bring it to price

796
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,160
for a different market.

797
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,380
And then the big company

798
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,380
said, that's not the price that we're going to

799
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,260
endorse. So therefore

800
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,220
they just sent people onto their farms.

801
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,240
Like I said, they would beat them to death

802
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,640
with pharmacopoeia. It didn't matter.

803
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:06,800
Right now,

804
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,420
disturbing commerce

805
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,280
is the highest crime in the current system.

806
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:12,960
It's like

807
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,520
literally 10,000 bodies on that.

808
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,960
And people don't even talk about it.

809
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,540
It was literally like a domestic war

810
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,660
that nobody writes about.

811
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,960
They don't know about it.

812
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,400
Like we said earlier, if they don't know something, it doesn't exist.

813
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,180
Right? Exactly.

814
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,200
Not only do you make them aware of it,

815
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,620
it's not just making them aware of it.

816
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,960
Some people, maybe like us,

817
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,480
just have to hear something

818
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,600
that can be referenced,

819
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,620
and it sounds, trusted from a trusted

820
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,120
source is good enough, usually.

821
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,540
But I still would check it out if I took interest

822
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,640
in repeating it, right?

823
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,120
You know, Pearl Harbor

824
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,520
in the U.S., Douglas Dietrich

825
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,720
is good on this.

826
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,700
You know, the Japanese did not attack

827
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,680
the U.S. They were trying to free,

828
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,660
they attacked the U.S. trying to free the kingdom

829
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,540
of Hawaii, right? Because the Marines had the

830
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,600
kingdom of Hawaii under house arrest.

831
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,360
The king had already died. They had the queen.

832
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,320
Right? And

833
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,300
it was also a cover. What you don't hear

834
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,980
about is the Japanese took over

835
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,040
the Aleutian Islands a day or two later,

836
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,260
a week later, and the reason they did

837
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,340
that, and they didn't leave

838
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,400
until after the war.

839
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:18,240
The reason they took the Aleutian Islands is because

840
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,200
if the Americans, they knew they were going to go

841
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,100
into a full-blown war with the Americans, and it was going to be

842
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,220
an aerial war. If the Americans had the

843
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:26,160
Aleutian Islands, it would have been an hour and a half

844
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,880
flight, hop, skip, and a jump to Japan.

845
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,460
So because they held the Aleutian Islands,

846
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,140
the Americans had to go

847
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:34,080
island hopping through 7,000

848
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,900
miles of islands for refuel, right?

849
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,840
You had to keep refueling to get there, yeah.

850
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,100
So it's very simple. It says the Japanese won

851
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,160
the war. Of course they did. You don't even have to

852
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,100
be told that. You could look it up on Wikipedia.

853
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,000
All the various battles

854
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,860
that are listed in Wikipedia

855
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,020
between the Americans and the Japanese, I think there's

856
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,060
like 20 battles listed, and 17

857
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,100
out of the 20, or 16 out of

858
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,540
the 20 are favored the Japanese.

859
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,040
So the Americans only got 3 out of 20, right?

860
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,660
Or 2 out of 10.

861
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,160
So it's very simple, and you know

862
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,060
the Mustang, the

863
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,100
plane, the real killer plane

864
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,280
the Americans made, the PT Mustang

865
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,080
or whatever it was, copied the old

866
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,980
they couldn't make that until they got

867
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,000
enough Japanese Zeros to reverse engineer.

868
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,179
So anyway,

869
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,840
the whole, but people, again,

870
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,880
this is an example that the Americans

871
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,020
lost World War II. You can't, who are you going to tell

872
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,020
this to? It's stunning to tell this to anyone,

873
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:27,719
you know, because they, you know,

874
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:31,080
right? So...
