1
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:15,820
Hey, Sonic Event 121 and there's a bit of noise happening because I guess you might

2
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:16,480
sound strange.

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:18,280
Greek pizza.

4
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:18,720
That's right.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,720
Greek pizza.

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,420
Yeah, I said it.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,060
Greek pizza.

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,580
But is it Greek pizza?

9
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,140
No, it's the Greek making pizza.

10
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:25,660
All right.

11
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:33,300
Well, you know, Greek, I actually used to eat pizza from a stop in Connecticut when

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:33,920
I lived there.

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,540
And it was it was like Alpha Pizza, I think they called it or something like that.

14
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,200
Well, you know, Greek letters on it.

15
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,380
And it was literally Greeks running a pizza shop.

16
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,280
Yeah, yeah.

17
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:45,720
Yeah.

18
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,620
I just sent you a picture, by the way, if you want to describe it, we see what I'm doing

19
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,800
with Sonic on a phone.

20
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:58,100
So these are not polyton style pizzas and a polyton style oven, you know, outdoors mesquite

21
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:58,420
wood.

22
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,099
They take about 90 seconds to make.

23
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:09,060
That's the oven right now in Fahrenheit, seven hundred and seventy degrees because I keep

24
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,280
opening the door.

25
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,380
OK, see, but right there, you just made the mistake, though, that you complain about with

26
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,200
the TV chefs.

27
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,400
You're saying it takes 90 seconds to make a pizza.

28
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,240
It doesn't take 90 seconds to make a pizza.

29
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,440
It takes a lot to make it, to cook it, to cook it.

30
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,080
Right.

31
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:25,740
I mean.

32
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:26,160
Right.

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,700
But but you you didn't show.

34
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,080
Hey, if you're telling me it's 90 seconds to make a pizza, you're definitely not showing

35
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,540
me any of the prep work, any of the selection or no, no.

36
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:35,000
That's right.

37
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,520
You just did the thing.

38
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,340
Well, people.

39
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:38,580
Yeah.

40
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,240
People would have been around for the phonics.

41
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,180
This is the no need.

42
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,360
No, it's OK.

43
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,220
If it's really wet in the end, you just handle it like you handle anything.

44
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,120
Let's really wet.

45
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,360
Right.

46
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,760
So anyway.

47
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:49,540
Yeah.

48
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,380
You handle it in a way that you're careful.

49
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,300
But just because the dough has high moisture content doesn't mean that it's not it's going

50
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,280
to lack tension when you have to work it.

51
00:01:59,480 --> 00:01:59,580
Right.

52
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,160
Right.

53
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,320
Anybody that you know.

54
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,860
And we're talking Napolitano style, small pies.

55
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,280
These are like 12, 13 inches.

56
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,440
Just sauce and cheese.

57
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,120
Look at this one.

58
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,180
Yeah.

59
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,400
So I just made two pies and do the sonic and then I'm going to enjoy them.

60
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:18,060
They actually do taste better when they cool down just above room temperature.

61
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,100
I don't like biting into a really hot, you know, burn your mouth kind of stuff.

62
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,160
No, no, no.

63
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:28,260
A warm pizza is best if you can't enjoy the pizza when it's just warm.

64
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,720
It's a problem.

65
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,480
It's not good.

66
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,000
Yeah.

67
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,200
Well, that's the thing about really good food.

68
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,060
You could have it at any temperature where crappy.

69
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,740
You imagine having any fast food cold.

70
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,240
So that's horrible.

71
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:40,640
Yeah.

72
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,480
I mean, a cold, cold French fries is the absolute worst.

73
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,580
If you get your McDonald's and you can't you can't reheat them or anything.

74
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,080
OK.

75
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,440
Nothing.

76
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,340
But if you make them yourself, they're.

77
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:52,860
Yeah, they're.

78
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,460
Yeah, exactly.

79
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:53,800
Right.

80
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,700
You wanted to ask.

81
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,720
I wanted to get into this tonight about law.

82
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,060
Somebody sent you a message about why I chose.

83
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,440
Go ahead.

84
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,740
The biblical law.

85
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,240
Oh, yeah.

86
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,740
Well, I want to refer to a few other few other things.

87
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:03,980
Yeah.

88
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,280
Yeah.

89
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,260
If you don't mind that.

90
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,160
Because this question comes up a lot.

91
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:07,880
And I love this.

92
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,060
By the way, guys, all the noises and stuff.

93
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,620
I'm not going to filter none of this out.

94
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,080
It's going to be exactly as I'm making pizza.

95
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,300
Yeah.

96
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,860
While he's making pizza and he's moving around, which causes that other noise.

97
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,880
It's actually not bad, though, because you're actually are you outside right now?

98
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,600
Yeah.

99
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,580
Now I'm inside.

100
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,280
But the back the kitchens at the back of the house, I go through the back door to the pizza

101
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,480
oven outside and then I come back inside.

102
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,200
All right.

103
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,020
So right now I'm going to take a slight break from that because I've made two pies already.

104
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,480
And let's just kick it.

105
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:38,080
Yeah.

106
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,920
No, we're going to do that.

107
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,280
But which is really fast.

108
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,440
He's inside.

109
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:41,960
He's outside.

110
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,100
So all the different noises.

111
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,880
I'm going to leave it in there exactly as is.

112
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:45,900
Oh, yeah.

113
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,420
So.

114
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,280
So you guys have a definite rough, you know, this is just the way it was recorded.

115
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:50,840
That's it.

116
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,240
OK, so.

117
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:52,940
Well, yeah.

118
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,960
This question, like I said, you kept asking, what's that noise?

119
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,100
I said, I told you, you're making pizza, making pizza.

120
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:58,540
Yeah.

121
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:58,800
Yeah.

122
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,820
But there's many noises happening here.

123
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,440
So all these noises all are coming from the inside, the outside, the oven, everything.

124
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:04,720
OK.

125
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,920
And the reason why I'm not pausing and we don't need to reschedule recording is because

126
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,160
once you get that oven hot.

127
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:10,760
Yeah.

128
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,160
Right.

129
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,540
You got to go for it.

130
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:12,780
Right.

131
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,839
Because, you know, a thousand degree, you know, between seven and a thousand seven hundred

132
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,420
Fahrenheit, you're going to six hundred Celsius.

133
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:19,860
Right.

134
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:20,860
To do it.

135
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,120
Right.

136
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,160
You know, if your oven's not that hot, the type of dough that it is takes much longer

137
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,320
to cook and it gets tough.

138
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,220
So it's really soft.

139
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:29,820
It's crisp.

140
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,100
It's like we have a really good plate of pasta.

141
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,720
There's only one way to make it right.

142
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,320
Good pasta.

143
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:34,700
Yeah.

144
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:35,120
Right.

145
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,100
Not soggy.

146
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:36,780
Not too well done.

147
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,400
You're just right.

148
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,520
You're same thing with pizzas.

149
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:39,380
So.

150
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:40,480
Yeah.

151
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,500
So anyway, the question that comes up often.

152
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:44,280
Right now.

153
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,080
So I wanted to explain this real fast.

154
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:46,420
All right.

155
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:51,000
So I get this question every so often and over the years, even I've gotten this question

156
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,200
in one form or another.

157
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,760
But this is somebody who is sort of newer to listening to the Sonics, has come to them

158
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:04,360
recently and is catching up on the old ones, but is going off of the most recent mention

159
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:10,420
that you made of why you decide to use the biblical text in any way, shape or form.

160
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:16,240
Not because you necessarily believe in it, you said, to paraphrase, but because it does

161
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:24,880
provide you your law and the listener asks you basically why and not just why, but why

162
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:32,600
is this any better or worse than any other set of regulations, rules out there that somebody

163
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,020
else could adapt his law?

164
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,380
Other people have certainly done it one way or another.

165
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,880
And some people have picked up something else and decided to rewrite it.

166
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,120
I mean, we could get into the work of John Smith and the Mormon church.

167
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,160
Again, we don't have to be that broad.

168
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,160
It's a broad question, but let's jump on something specific.

169
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,820
I mentioned last week this new guy has been studying law for about two years.

170
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,020
It's Brandon Joe Williams or something.

171
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,340
Joe Brandon Williams.

172
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:58,800
Yeah.

173
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,920
And he's an ex-marketing guy, young guy, funny looking dude.

174
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,900
And he's spending all this on marketing because he wants people to learn the law.

175
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,040
Kind of like what I've been saying, but that's the thing, like I'm moderating between him

176
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,600
and Archaic.

177
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,160
Archaic and this guy, Brandon Joe Williams, are probably the two best stuff you can research

178
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,020
online right now.

179
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:23,180
And I'll tell you what they're lacking, you know, in terms of if you understand this point,

180
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:27,200
then you put it together, what they're saying, and then you got a pretty complete breakfast.

181
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:27,540
Right.

182
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,080
Okay.

183
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:34,000
So what you're telling me is that somewhere between the chronology and this other guy discussing

184
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,580
law.

185
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,000
Well, these are two subjects.

186
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,260
I want us to go to Joe Brand.

187
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,440
If you watch him, he basically shows you how all the definitions are circuitous.

188
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,220
Like for example, the United States, to give you an example, I've been saying this all,

189
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,120
but he kind of underscored this.

190
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,440
When you look at the law of, before you become a citizen of the United States, you have to

191
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:56,520
identify the United States and it's in the district of Columbia, but it doesn't specify

192
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,660
where it is.

193
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,280
It doesn't specify.

194
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:04,380
It doesn't say the district of Columbia is United States, somewhere in the district of

195
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:04,780
Columbia.

196
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,060
But there's, if you keep reading the statute, I believe it's title eight, title five, title

197
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,260
50, which is war.

198
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:14,560
It says that if you want to live in the United States, dig this.

199
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,900
You need permission from the board members.

200
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:17,920
Okay.

201
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:18,700
Whoa.

202
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:19,420
Okay.

203
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,400
So we cannot define the United States citizen if we got to find the United States what you're

204
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:23,980
a citizen of.

205
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:28,240
So what I'm trying to say, like, for example, IRS, you're a taxpayer.

206
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,580
Well, if you look at the definition, they call everyone a taxpayer, a taxpayer, it's

207
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,900
someone who's subject to the tax.

208
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,700
Oh my gosh, how do I, right?

209
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,080
So what you, when you look at all of these laws, right, they're all circuitous.

210
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,380
They really, they define themselves as, as air smoke.

211
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,260
They're not really there.

212
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,040
It's all in your mind.

213
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,780
It's all illusion.

214
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,120
Right?

215
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,660
So now a lot of people follow these laws.

216
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,260
Like they'll say, you know, it's the law.

217
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,580
You can't carry a firearm.

218
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:54,900
Right.

219
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:55,740
Okay.

220
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,560
And people think that a handgun is a firearm, which it's not by definition.

221
00:07:59,800 --> 00:07:59,980
Right.

222
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,540
And all these things.

223
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,880
So they live by it.

224
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:03,160
Okay.

225
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,000
So there's nothing there.

226
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,180
But let's go now.

227
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,760
I'm giving this as a preface.

228
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,040
Yeah.

229
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:13,020
And do I endorse Brandon, Joe Williams or Belinda Williams, Joe Brandon or whatever?

230
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,500
No, I don't endorse him.

231
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,860
Are you going to get like hours of fun?

232
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,060
You know, I remember they used to advertise games.

233
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,780
It's hours of fun in the seventies, right?

234
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,920
Hours of fun and good education.

235
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,760
Yes, you will.

236
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:24,580
Right.

237
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,000
And he doesn't know about the endorsement clause.

238
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,140
So he can get nailed by the IRS.

239
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,679
They'll just ignore the other stuff that he does because he, you don't have to be a citizen

240
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,000
to endorse a check and have a tax liability.

241
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:41,480
You just have to show each individual time, uh, you know, 12 USC for 11.

242
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,860
It's unbelievable when I speak to people in private, how terrified they are of that.

243
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:49,560
But on another sonic, I'll talk about how to experiment with it harmlessly.

244
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,580
OK, so you have all these laws that are hard to define and people follow.

245
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:58,160
Right. But there's if you look at the meat and bones, there's nothing there.

246
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,380
Now, let's jump to the biblical stuff again.

247
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:05,880
Right. OK, so if you say you follow the Old Testament right away, people think you're

248
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,820
Jewish. Right.

249
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,900
And then I've had this done many times.

250
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:13,340
And when the Jewish holiday of Passover comes around on their Pope's works, you know, on

251
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,600
their schedule, they wish me a happy Passover.

252
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,980
I said that was a month ago.

253
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:22,180
That was two weeks ago or that was, you know, no, I don't know what you're talking about.

254
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,700
So that confuses them.

255
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,580
Right. So here's two quick questions, then.

256
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:31,400
Is it incorrect to think that people who are identified as Jewish are supposed to be

257
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,020
following the Old Testament one and two?

258
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,220
How is it or what what measurement of time?

259
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,520
They don't use the Pope's works.

260
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,020
It's like getting to the subject matter, just the subject matter, not the subject itself.

261
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,660
So what I'm trying to say is so when these U.S.

262
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,860
citizens, that's where the U.S.

263
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,260
citizens cannot define what U.S.

264
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,940
citizenship is. Actually, it's defined very loosely.

265
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,600
And they think the United States is what they've been told.

266
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,860
And it's not legally right.

267
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,160
So the Jewish people think they're following the Old Testament.

268
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,020
They don't have a clue.

269
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,580
Right. Like, for example, they, you know, in very Orthodox, they have what's called dare.

270
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:12,360
Remember to go to especially New Jersey deal would be a very Jewish neighborhood, a summer

271
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,940
resort town. Right.

272
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,900
Very well known as not too far from maybe where you were.

273
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,560
Yeah. And I was discussing deal recently.

274
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,920
Yeah. Good. Yeah.

275
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,260
OK, well, they have what's called a dairy restaurant.

276
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:26,600
The reason why they have a dairy restaurant is because if you serve meat, you can't serve

277
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,260
any dairy if it's kosher.

278
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:32,260
And if you serve dairy, you can't serve any meat because of the 10th Commandment.

279
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:38,620
Do not serve. By the way, the 10th Commandment written on stones is do not see a goat

280
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:44,160
in its mother's milk or boil, cook meat, you know, of a goat or right.

281
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,040
But they don't know which way to interpret.

282
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,460
It means you've not cooked the meat with the milk or do you not?

283
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,920
If if the goat or the lamb is still suckling, you should not slaughter it to eat.

284
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,600
You have to wait for it right to be weaned away.

285
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,380
Right. So they just go right.

286
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:03,680
And how this gets applied, because, look, I also lived in Lakewood, right, which has

287
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,320
quite an Orthodox Jewish enclave and has a shul there.

288
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,420
And a few other things. Right.

289
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,320
And they have a dairy restaurant, probably.

290
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,240
So, no, they had a sandwich shop.

291
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,820
Now, the sandwich shop.

292
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,640
No cheese. Yeah. Well, here's the thing.

293
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,760
Under the supervision of the rabbis there, they had to separate that.

294
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,760
So if you had you could make cheese sandwiches, you could make meat sandwiches.

295
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,920
No problem. Different, different fridge, different slicers, different counters.

296
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,020
Everything separated tremendously, whether it's the knife point.

297
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,540
Let's not get into the subject.

298
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,520
What I'm just explaining that quickly, that that's one of those things that they

299
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,760
absolutely separated, like you couldn't even put the meat on the same counter as the

300
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,880
cheese if you did.

301
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,480
And the story, it's no longer proper based on that.

302
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,200
But the commandment, the commandment basically says to not cook it in its mother's

303
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,580
milk. So you can probably if you have milk from not its mother, you can cook it in its

304
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,980
milk. Right. Like fricassee is basically cream sauce.

305
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:04,560
Right. Or if it's on its mother's milk, meaning

306
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,580
it's still suckling, you shouldn't eat it.

307
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,040
Right. So either one is not being followed.

308
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,500
The letter of the law and the definitions provided are not being followed.

309
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,860
They just separate everything.

310
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:19,160
So anyway, it's not very difficult to see that if you're Jewish, you really are not

311
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,920
following the Old Testament because they're on a completely different calendar.

312
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:29,320
OK, so so what I'm doing when I say biblical law, I do biblical law, but I'm not

313
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,900
Jewish. Like when I go to a restaurant and I see a lot of pork on the menu, I say, do

314
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,160
you have anything without any swine?

315
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,480
And they're like, are you Jewish?

316
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,700
I'm like, no. Are you Muslim?

317
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,160
No. Right.

318
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:48,260
So so when people ask that question, I'm going to take that question as if they are

319
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:52,980
competent and what I'm saying and their question is competent can be answered

320
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,360
competently. Right.

321
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:01,660
So I've made this long roundabout that I'm not Jewish and I don't follow any

322
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:06,580
religion. So what I'm trying to caution and you're clearly not you're clearly not a

323
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,640
Muslim either who is concerned about Haram, not a Muslim.

324
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,240
Hello. But it's the same.

325
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,320
But, you know, the Koran indirectly tells you to go read the law in the Bible.

326
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,480
Right. Well, basically, they say directly.

327
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:22,340
Yeah. I mean, basically, my understanding is as far as it comes, you know, when the

328
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:26,440
food thing is concerned, they basically say, look, just go look at the Jewish idea and

329
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,880
it's about the same thing. Well, no.

330
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:33,120
It says basically in several places, several areas, starting on 28th, it states that

331
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,340
Allah gave the law to Moses.

332
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,040
That's all. Now, where is Moses?

333
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:42,580
Where do we find out about? You know, I mean, everybody and they and they call it Torah.

334
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,420
You know, they call it they did follow the Torah.

335
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:50,740
Right. Back then. I mean, and they the old they stopped about 50, about 100 years ago

336
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,320
when the when they were restructured.

337
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,020
Right. But you can still do the Torah.

338
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,580
They even have holidays that are based on some of the same characters like they have

339
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:02,380
Ishmael's day, which is a big deal among the Muslims, because he's the.

340
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,660
Yeah, good. Sorry. But the competent.

341
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:10,520
Whenever I get a question, I try to answer it where the competency yields and that

342
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,920
doesn't yield, but can go through.

343
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:20,480
So what I'm trying to say is that anyone asking that, why do I follow biblical law

344
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:27,180
must be aware of biblical law in the sense that it has nothing to do with anything

345
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,100
that's out in the world, really.

346
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:36,140
And when I say nothing to do, I mean, cannot be administered with anything that's

347
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:41,180
followed in the world. So someone might say, I've seen this more than once back 15

348
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,100
years ago when I decided to take on this law form.

349
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,320
Right. Right. Because we all have law forms like I'm going, you know, what Bougainvillea

350
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,740
is, are there like desert plants?

351
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,780
Say they grow like weeds, like vines.

352
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,920
They're huge. They have thorns.

353
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,200
They grow like six feet a year.

354
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,120
They have these beautiful red flowers, but they're not they're full of red.

355
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,920
People hate them because the whole neighborhood gets full of these red petals.

356
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,540
Right. OK. And but they're not really flowers that leaves that turn red.

357
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:05,640
Bougainvillea. Right.

358
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,620
OK. Don't ask me how to spell it.

359
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:13,580
B-O-U-G-I-N-V-I-L-I-A-H, some Bougainvillea, it's a desert plant.

360
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:19,280
So first time I'm planting these things and growing them and, you know, it's a plant.

361
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,000
So you water it, leave it alone.

362
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,620
Right. No, I want these things to thrive.

363
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,740
So guess what? I need to go and find the law of Bougainvillea.

364
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:30,560
I need to find. And it turns out there are some specific things that do's and don'ts

365
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,580
with these things. Right.

366
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:36,160
You can most people that buy the Bougainvillea pot and kill them because, you know, they

367
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,180
grow a very sensitive root ball.

368
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:42,200
So if you buy it in a pot and you take it out of the pot, you've seen how you turn a

369
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,500
plant upside down, take the pot off, cut the pot off, plant it.

370
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,560
Any motion to the root ball will kill the plant.

371
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,960
So what you should do is take the pot and cut the sides open.

372
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,040
It doesn't have a tap root.

373
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,420
It always maintains this ball.

374
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,660
If you disturb that ball in the slightest, it's like a prima donna.

375
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,480
It'll just die. So.

376
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,680
So I discovered this before, thankfully, because I was planning on taking them out of the

377
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,160
pots. I would have had four plants that were dead, 40, 50 bucks for plants.

378
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,700
So. So what I did was I followed the laws of Bougainvillea and they're thriving like

379
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,680
crazy. I mean, they froze a bad freeze this year.

380
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,340
I cut them down to the ground and they're already four feet tall.

381
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,720
So and I'm looking for I'm using them as shade cover.

382
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,500
Right. OK, so my example here is very, very clear.

383
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:29,620
Another example, which should be very clear, is do you remember Mitsubishi motor cars?

384
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,240
You don't see them that much here anymore.

385
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:37,480
Not so much. But yeah, in the 90s, they decided to put out next to Rolls-Royce

386
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:43,280
is a fact the most precision manufactured engine in the world, you know, that you can

387
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:48,320
buy. Right. In other words, the tolerances of the manufacturing of the rings, the seals

388
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,740
of that was super high precision.

389
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,640
Right. Very, very, very, very tight.

390
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,800
Anyone can afford something as the quality of a Rolls-Royce engine, a Porsche, a

391
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,660
Mercedes or actually higher tolerances of Mercedes, Porsche.

392
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:05,660
So. But the kick was in the early 90s that you had to use a special synthetic oil or

393
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:10,000
you could use a zero 20 oil has to be synthetic, though.

394
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:11,260
Right. In order for it to work.

395
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,680
So all these people that bought Mitsubishi's right.

396
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,819
Three thousand miles, six, five.

397
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,040
Got to change the oil, honey.

398
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,480
What do they do? What do they do?

399
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,079
They go to name an oil change place.

400
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,560
Right. Yeah. Discount.

401
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,960
Nineteen. And what do you think they did?

402
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,720
What do you think? Do you think they went and got the right oil or do you think they

403
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,020
just put in the cheapest shit?

404
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,460
Right. OK. Yeah.

405
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:35,160
Your average Jiffy Lube monkey doesn't even look at the the standards.

406
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,180
They just how many ports do I have to put in?

407
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,480
And that's that. Right.

408
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,660
Yeah. The cheapest oil.

409
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,440
So what happened? The oil was 10 times thicker than it should be.

410
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,840
And now now, wait a second.

411
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,760
About two years after Mitsubishi released the highest precision factory motor, you

412
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,540
can buy an engine, you can buy.

413
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:57,200
They got a bad reputation because, oh, don't buy the Mitsubishi because it's going to

414
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,500
start smoking on you.

415
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,460
The engine will start smoking.

416
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,100
It's only a couple of years old.

417
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,720
They got a bad reputation and they nobody bought it.

418
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,340
Right. And if you remember back in the 90s, if you had a red light, light turns green

419
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:14,360
if it was chances are nine out of 10, if there was a Mitsubishi car, new Mitsubishi

420
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,860
car around you, they hit the gas and watch a big puff of smoke out of the car.

421
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,820
Right. So so what did they try to do?

422
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,360
They try to do something good. What happened?

423
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,660
Something bad. They lost their reputation by trying to do that.

424
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,620
Right. So you got to understand why.

425
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,080
Because they didn't follow the directions, the laws of that engine.

426
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,540
It's very, very simple.

427
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,520
Let me just go back.

428
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:40,280
What before I decided to follow biblical law, I did my research on it.

429
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:45,980
Right. I started finding out that I'm not for circumcision, but I'll just say it like

430
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,760
this. Circumcision happens in eight days.

431
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:54,000
Well, it turns out it's been clinically proven that at eight days old, the human male

432
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,820
has the highest coagulative properties.

433
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,240
How did they know that? And it wasn't nine or 10 days or a month.

434
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,580
All these other things.

435
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:07,500
For example, pork has if you eat, you get what's called trichinella, one trichinosis.

436
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,720
It's a roundworm. Right.

437
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,520
Right. Now, what's interesting, it tells you to eat.

438
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:16,120
It gives you discernment. If you're going to eat anything with four legs, it should chew the

439
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,240
cut and have a cloven hoof.

440
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,860
And it gives the example of a pig as a cloven hoof.

441
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,120
Right. You've seen pigs feed at the deli at the deli.

442
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,160
Right. Delicacy in many places.

443
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,020
Yeah. And but it doesn't chew the cut.

444
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,740
Now, rabbit chews the cut, but he has a paw.

445
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,040
You've seen a rabbit's paw. It's like a cat's paw or something.

446
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,220
Right. Right. OK.

447
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,380
All right. So but you know what's interesting, interesting here.

448
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,940
Is not only can you get trichinosis from eating pork, you get trichinosis from eating

449
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:48,400
bugs, bunny, rabbit hair also wasn't aware how the hell they put this stuff together.

450
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,140
Right. It's really interesting.

451
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:57,880
So I started looking at a lot of these, quote unquote, laws were in concert with the

452
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,740
natural environment.

453
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,620
Now, let's go back to man's law.

454
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,860
Oh, you can't smoke cannabis.

455
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,540
It's illegal. Now, how is that in line with the natural environment?

456
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,420
It's a fucking plant. Right.

457
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,120
So you see what happens?

458
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:16,040
Yeah. So, you know, and you know, the story behind making cannabis illegal had nothing to

459
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:20,640
do with getting high. Of course, it was about the paper manufacturers didn't want it.

460
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,380
And that's right. The fiber industry, the fiber industry wanted synthetic fiber.

461
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,620
Right. Right. And by the way, the hemp is still superior here, by the way, unless you go

462
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:32,120
to these nanofiber, you know, aramid, which is Kevlar and all of it.

463
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:36,200
That's not practical. You know, aramid, the Kevlar, bulletproof vests, all that stuff.

464
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,380
If you expose it to UV for more than 18 hours, it loses 40 percent of its strength.

465
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,780
No, I wasn't aware of that.

466
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,060
Well, it's crap.

467
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,260
Yeah, it's total crap.

468
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,220
So. So anyway.

469
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,600
So here's what the ultimate why is from what I'm gathering here, from what you're

470
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,580
saying. And I hate to cut to the chase, but let's do it.

471
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:58,200
It sounds to me like what you're saying is this is something that makes just behaviors

472
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,860
more conducive with a higher level of function.

473
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,220
In other words, it's a practical thing.

474
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,320
It's a benefit.

475
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:09,100
It's a benefit. Like like you're sitting there telling me, OK, look, I need to know

476
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,480
about the laws of the plant because I want the plant to thrive and survive.

477
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:17,220
And the same principle applied here is that this is a better way to thrive and survive

478
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,660
in the environment.

479
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:25,100
And based on the organism, OK, because you're an organism, a plant's an organism.

480
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,580
I think that's a fair characterization.

481
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:33,660
So you got to know what goes into the organism, what's best for it, what the, you

482
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:37,540
know, for example, when somebody's working too hard and they can't think straight, what

483
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:40,100
do you say? You need to take a break, break.

484
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:44,340
Yeah. So if you have a scheduled break, let's say the seventh day.

485
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,220
Right. It doesn't say don't work.

486
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,860
Right. Specifically, it's you need to take it's basically taking a break from work.

487
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,680
Right. And also making others work.

488
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,800
Right. So the word was like, I always heard directly.

489
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,740
It tells you she'll do no work on the Sabbath.

490
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:04,620
It's it's kind of like it means like don't be industrious in a way that you do not like

491
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,880
the fires of your shop.

492
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,000
So. Right.

493
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,680
And, you know, the day starts at noon.

494
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:14,860
Right. So with these idiots that are still, you know, archaics, by the way, no, I'm

495
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:18,300
surprised no one's retired. He doesn't know that the day starts at noon.

496
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,400
He thinks it's sundown. You can't measure that.

497
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,560
Right. But I'm not going to reach out to me.

498
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,780
And I think Sam sent him like a dozen emails.

499
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,160
He didn't answer one. So I would

500
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,900
suggest that when you cannot

501
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,040
approach there, OK, there are certain things.

502
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,960
It's jurisdictional also in the Bible that ninety nine percent of the people here.

503
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,280
And this is something if you don't know how to keep biblical time, you're not going to be

504
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:49,540
able to do these things properly because the seventh day off, by the way, if you're in

505
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:52,960
an agricultural society, I've said this many, many times before, it's worth saying it

506
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,560
yet. The Jews, right.

507
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:00,360
They they do Sabbath at night, sundown to sundown.

508
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,860
Now, you're agricultural society.

509
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,920
Yes or no. Yes.

510
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:07,120
Right. You have animals you got to feed and water.

511
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,600
Right. And so Sabbath comes Friday night.

512
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:15,160
You know, they whatever Pope's work schedule Sabbath starts the end of the day.

513
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,540
Right now, the next all night.

514
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,020
And that's the whole next day.

515
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,320
Your animals don't get watered.

516
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,560
They don't get fed the whole next day.

517
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,520
And you got to wait till sundown.

518
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,120
Got to wait till sundown.

519
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,120
But now the Sabbath's over.

520
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:30,640
So we're all going to. So Sabbath's over Saturday night sundown.

521
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:34,260
Now we go to the farm in the middle of the night and feed water the animals.

522
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,700
That makes no sense. No, because you're not going to make that all in the dark.

523
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,060
Yeah, of course. Right.

524
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,420
That's right. So pretty much you're going to show up the next person.

525
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,020
That's 36 hours later.

526
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,580
And the animals are distressed.

527
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,800
Right. This is all about distress.

528
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:51,560
Now, if you know biblical timekeeping and you start your Sabbath at noon, it goes from

529
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,580
noon to noon.

530
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:58,340
You show up at the farm in the morning and you get all your stuff done by noon.

531
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,800
So the animals are usually going to feed them and water them in the morning.

532
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:06,140
Right. They might miss a late afternoon meal or watering at night because you left at

533
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:11,100
noon. Right. And the next day in the morning, instead of getting the early feed and the

534
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,480
early whatever, they're like, where is he?

535
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,560
We show up at noon.

536
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,260
Right. And you catch up for the race.

537
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,860
I have the other half of the day to catch a minor delay.

538
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,080
So what you know, major stress.

539
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,240
If you do this, there might be some stress.

540
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,300
So major stress. So if you do this properly, right, you get everything done in the

541
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,920
morning all the way up to noon and that begins the new day.

542
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,520
So therefore, now your Sabbath day occurs starting at noontime.

543
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,340
You go back around. It goes to noon.

544
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:39,740
And the next noon here is an easier way to say it.

545
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,560
Bear with me on this one more.

546
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:47,200
So the Greek says he does the Sabbath, but I saw him show up every day.

547
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,760
I don't know how he's doing the Sabbath.

548
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:55,060
Yeah, but he left early and one day and the next day he came in late.

549
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,220
But to them, it looks like I'm showing up every day because their day starts.

550
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,900
Well, that's why I was just explaining that, because it look, if you get everything done

551
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,580
before noon, OK, that's one day.

552
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:07,200
The next day, you get everything done immediately after noon.

553
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:10,560
It seems like, well, you didn't take a day off, but you actually did.

554
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,580
That's right. To noon.

555
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:14,740
That's right. Because even now, my day goes from noon to noon.

556
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:18,420
As a matter of fact, there's a major cultural movement still.

557
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:22,320
Not so much, but up until the 80s, it was still very strong in Europe.

558
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,900
They did siesta right around noon, around 11 o'clock.

559
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,600
Everyone home at a big meal, slept till two o'clock.

560
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,780
Right. Spain, Italy, Greece, everywhere.

561
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,420
And all over the world.

562
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,100
It was typical because it was ingrained.

563
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:34,940
That was the end of the day.

564
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,360
When you fast for a day, you break your fast.

565
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,500
And right before the day ends, which is it.

566
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,940
Right. Yeah. That's why you break fast.

567
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,200
Break fast breakfast. Right.

568
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,960
So these things are critical.

569
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,940
So these questions about biblical law and not only law, do you have to do?

570
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,820
OK, so if you want to follow the laws of the United States, first of all,

571
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,820
it's all voluntary.

572
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,960
All the laws in the U.S. are because you say it's the law.

573
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,040
Each individual person has to agree to it.

574
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,320
No one can enforce them as such unless they coerce you.

575
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,820
And you're ignorant. You don't know. Right.

576
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,320
So it's I like what Brandon Joe Williams is doing.

577
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,020
I think that's how you say his name, because he basically shows like this,

578
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,660
you know, is getting citizenship and nationalities by declaration.

579
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:18,440
He doesn't know about the passport, by the way.

580
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,880
He used to use a passport.

581
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,660
What I would just want to add here is I don't have a passport

582
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:26,760
and I could still travel anywhere because I think it's State Department code

583
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:31,620
1865. I think it's 1865 or 1867 or 1896.

584
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,760
They have their own codes.

585
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,960
It's called an affidavit in lieu of passport.

586
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,780
LIEU in lieu of instead of you put an affidavit

587
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:42,080
in lieu of passport in a Google search and images.

588
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,220
You'll see after World War Two, a lot of these countries,

589
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,140
their government building and administrations were blown up.

590
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,420
People still wanted to travel for years.

591
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,340
You know, they didn't patch up Europe until like the early 50s.

592
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,840
Right. Late 40s.

593
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,940
So people had affidavits in lieu of passport.

594
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,100
And basically, you write, you swear who you are.

595
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,700
You say who you are, what your nationality is.

596
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,600
And they stamp the letter just like a passport.

597
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:08,440
So you see these letters, affidavits, little passport.

598
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:11,460
And you see all these stamps just like a passport, the picture on it and everything.

599
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:15,700
So if you understand that, like I use, but this is how I do it.

600
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:19,000
If I'm going to go fly, I fax a copy to the airport

601
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:23,120
before like four hours or the day before.

602
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,160
I let them know I'm coming to fly the next day. OK.

603
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,480
And you show up at the airport, show up at the airport.

604
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:32,260
And I go to the guy said he talks to head of security.

605
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,580
And he goes, oh, really? Why?

606
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,600
I said, because I fax.

607
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:38,520
And before I even finish saying I faxes, I know who you are. Come with me.

608
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,180
It's like they're all briefed.

609
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,740
All the security outside is briefed on who I am and what I look like

610
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,700
because I have a picture. Right.

611
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,160
And they sit me down. I got away for half an hour.

612
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,600
And then they walk me right to the plane.

613
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,580
No security check. Nothing, nothing.

614
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,200
None of that TSA stuff, whatever. OK.

615
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,580
Right. Let's just make a long story short.

616
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,880
So people think it's a disadvantage.

617
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,520
I find it as a high advantage.

618
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:02,720
Now, you can be pulled over and they could delay your flight sometimes.

619
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,320
And they delay you from taking, missing your flight.

620
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,520
And they'll say, oh, why do you do this?

621
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,300
You hate the United States.

622
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,020
I just don't know how to answer your question.

623
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,860
It goes both ways that you always if they give you a hard time,

624
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,160
they always apologize in the end. Right.

625
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:18,920
So make a long story short about all the travails and things

626
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:22,160
that I personally take on because I still don't do banking.

627
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,180
You know, someone sent me a PayPal still sitting there.

628
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,540
I'm looking at I just read the whole legal thing of PayPal.

629
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,760
I'm like, you got to be kidding.

630
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,800
You have to be insane to use this unless you're going to

631
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,560
you're willing to put something else forward.

632
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,780
You can't just go inside, you know.

633
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:39,800
But, you know, the definition of that nasty term, conspiracy theory

634
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:43,320
is a dirty term that they give to people who are not insane.

635
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,600
Right. You get it.

636
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,920
So so someone calls you a conspiracy theorist.

637
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,700
It's like they're just calling you sane because, you know,

638
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:55,060
you have to be insane to believe what you've been told all around.

639
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,860
But back again about law, it should prove out.

640
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,320
You should know it. You should know how to administrate.

641
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:07,720
So if someone is Jewish, I'd say about 75 percent of what they told is the law.

642
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,460
They'll tell you, by the way, if you corner a rabbi says, no, this is Jewish

643
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,440
tradition we're doing.

644
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,120
We're not trying to do the one in the Old Testament.

645
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,140
They'll tell you. They'll tell you right away. Right.

646
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,580
And again, with the U.S. codes and the U.S.

647
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,620
laws, doesn't matter if they're local, federal, state.

648
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,000
When you speak to someone higher up, forget about all the rights

649
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,100
and all the stuff they tell you.

650
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,480
They say you have to do what everybody else does,

651
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,520
even when you show them the law, that they're wrong.

652
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,760
They'll just tell you, just do what everybody else does.

653
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,580
They don't have no. That's called scoff law.

654
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,820
When you scoff at the law, it's called a scoff law.

655
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,400
People don't even use that term anymore.

656
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,240
You've heard of it, I'm sure.

657
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,900
It is a it is a scoff.

658
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,600
They're used to get tickets for scoff laws.

659
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,100
Remember jaywalking?

660
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:50,900
Yeah, right. Right.

661
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:53,620
But it's hardly ever, ever used anymore.

662
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,080
Some of the highlights that I like about Brandon Williams,

663
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,220
he brings up about law or two, two of them.

664
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:04,720
One of them is a lot of the black people lean on civil rights,

665
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,040
freedom and getting the rights.

666
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,540
Well, you have to remember that law comes first.

667
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,260
Then human rights came with various conventions.

668
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:15,240
And the last thing that came along, I think it was Johnson

669
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,560
that finalized most of them with civil rights.

670
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,160
So each one descends.

671
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:24,580
So when you ask for civil rights, it's actually less than human rights.

672
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,180
And the system understands that.

673
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,500
That's why the police and paramilitary target black people,

674
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,440
because they're under civil rights, which means they don't have human rights.

675
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:36,700
Anyway, that's a point that he brought up, which is absolutely valid.

676
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,220
He brought up some other points that were pretty valid.

677
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,020
None really come to mind.

678
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:46,460
But I just want to and if you're, by the way, black or other than white,

679
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,360
don't call yourself a minority because it has nothing to do

680
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:54,720
with how many of you there are that look like you or say you are who you are.

681
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,940
It has to do with being competent or not.

682
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:00,880
When you say you're a minority means you're not competent to go into contract

683
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,220
or to have the law competently applied to you as any minor.

684
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:08,700
As any minor would be incompetent to be under contract.

685
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,040
You need a guardian or your award award of the state.

686
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,420
You need to be you need an attorney.

687
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,120
Has nothing to do with being represented in court, which is an interesting

688
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:21,180
chronological question here based on something you just brought up is, look,

689
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,140
if you have the human rights to begin with,

690
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:28,320
then why is there even a necessity to have the civil rights applied?

691
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,680
Because they were they were created by convention.

692
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:36,320
Yes. But a lot of individuals are not included in the human rights equation.

693
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,260
You see, that was the whole.

694
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,500
No, but that's what I'm just saying.

695
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,700
There is a descending order.

696
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,060
So let's say they come up with a new set of rights,

697
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:48,020
which is they're doing with the LGBTQ, RSTUV, FUCK stuff.

698
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:48,960
Yeah. Right.

699
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:53,060
That is even worse because now you're a binary.

700
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:56,200
You're not binary because law only applies to men and women.

701
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,140
So now you're an object.

702
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:03,460
And when you get the vaccine, you have a patented substance in your body.

703
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:06,780
And you your control of your body goes under the patent laws.

704
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:11,260
Now, just like when GMO crops are neither an organic farm

705
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:14,260
and they take seed in the organic farm, they come and claim the farm

706
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:17,240
because you're growing the right, the wind blew it over.

707
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,960
I still feel like this is a legitimate question, though.

708
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,880
If you already had the human rights, though, and you had access

709
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,980
to all of the activities and facilities, et cetera.

710
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,660
No, hold on. You don't have the rights.

711
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,400
You have what you say you have.

712
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,840
Yes. But if that were the case, then there wouldn't have been a need.

713
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:34,660
It is the case.

714
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:38,780
No, it's not the case in case law, but it is the reality in the law.

715
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:39,940
You say who you are like.

716
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,860
They have these long processes for becoming a U.S.

717
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:43,900
citizen, which is criminal.

718
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,560
You could just do it with a piece of paper in five minutes.

719
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:50,240
And if the State Department doesn't accept it, you litigate against them.

720
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,460
And they won't take it to litigation because the law is there.

721
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:56,180
And one thing that Brandon does say that I do is, is no one knows anything

722
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,760
that's going on. No one.

723
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,260
No one in the State Department.

724
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:02,020
He's been through various offices all the way up.

725
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,400
No one knows anything at all.

726
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,700
They'll just when you bring up the lessons, you know, I've been doing this

727
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,040
for twenty five years and it doesn't matter how you do it.

728
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,460
You know, they don't know what it sounds exactly.

729
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:14,960
No one knows. Everything is completely wide open.

730
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,980
So the thing about all the U.S.

731
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,760
laws and codes, including the Constitution, if you understand the Ninth

732
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,760
Amendment, Ninth Amendment in the Bill of Rights basically says that as long

733
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:28,100
as you do, you can make up your own rights as long as it doesn't interfere

734
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,160
with any of these other rights and hurt anyone.

735
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:35,740
Right. So, you know, so if you say it's in the Bill of Rights, well, no, it's

736
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:38,820
not, you know, whatever, you know.

737
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:42,620
So the Second Amendment thing with the guns and the First Amendment, this

738
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,540
should always be paired with the Ninth Amendment.

739
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,620
Because they'll say, well, what you're doing isn't defined by that.

740
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,660
Well, then go to Ninth Amendment.

741
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,060
That's like a catch all. No one's being hurt and I'm not violating the other.

742
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:57,060
So anyway, he's doing a pretty good public service, but I wish you would find

743
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:00,780
out about doing the Senate because he's still doing he's doing conditional

744
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,780
endorsements, but he's not showing a demand.

745
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:08,040
So the IRS might might cook his bird because I've seen it.

746
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:12,360
You know, for example, taxation has nothing to do with citizenship because I

747
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:16,699
know someone who has a YouTube account in England and they do YouTube does

748
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:19,260
IRS withdrawal, even though he's getting paid in pounds.

749
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,820
How is he a U.S. citizen?

750
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,780
Right. How? How does he fall into that?

751
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,159
So there's a lot of stuff.

752
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,639
You know, I've already been over the holes in the archaic stuff that he talks

753
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:32,560
about just to correct, not to knock the archaics or not to knock Brandon.

754
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,219
But if you want if you study what they're putting out, which is generally

755
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:39,659
good and supplement it with these things that I put forth, you've got a pretty

756
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:40,800
good basis.

757
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,360
OK, right. So I'm filling in what they either forgot or incorrect.

758
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:49,179
Now, chances of them coming back and doing it with me is zero to none because

759
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:52,120
you only have like 50 subscribers and like five listeners.

760
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,780
Right. So it's not going to happen.

761
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,500
So but I would I would I would love to have dialogue with either one of them.

762
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:03,340
Right. So I'm not I'm too right now.

763
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,500
I'm at the point where emails I get to the email every three days.

764
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,380
That's the fastest I can get to it.

765
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:12,820
Right. So and you notice when we do the record the sonics, I'm always doing

766
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:15,660
something else. I'm multitasking.

767
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,980
Right. So with that said, I'm going to multitask and eat some pizza.

768
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,700
Well, there you have it.
