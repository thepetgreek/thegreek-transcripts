1
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:13,220
So you wanna be hardcore, with your hat to the back, talkin' bout the gats and your rats,

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,080
but I can't feel that hardcore appeal that you're screamin', maybe I'm dreamin',

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,200
this ain't Christopher Williams, still some MC got the feel one, cats I got the feel some.

4
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:30,260
So Sonic 1-22, and uh, yeah, you didn't, you didn't press play on the wrong thing, just so you know.

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,480
Rated Y, and uh, little, little bit of a different start, but here we are,

6
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,980
Greek, uh, you wanna explain that clip at the beginning there, or?

7
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,960
Well, if anybody likes to hear the rest of it, just uh, send me an email or a Skype and I'll send you the file.

8
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,260
I did that about seven years ago.

9
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,620
It's uh, Christopher Williams, Biggie Smalls over Grammatic Beats.

10
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,000
Yeah, I think it's well done, it's only a minute and a half, the whole thing.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,220
Some people out there have it, from a while back, and some other stuff like that.

12
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,300
Yeah, and it's uh, it's a really interesting mix, uh, it's slightly compressed here,

13
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,240
so, you know, you'll get the full experience if you get the file from the Greeks, so there you go.

14
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,540
Anyway, Greek, speakin' of files, and weird stuff that goes on, you know,

15
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:21,000
I was lookin' back at somethin' that we talked about before, and it's always relevant,

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,620
because death is a constant, and it used to be, you know,

17
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,960
because I spent a lot of time lookin' at autopsy reports, right, for various studies that I was doin',

18
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,660
and they have changed in recent years, but they've changed over time, several times.

19
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:41,080
Let's just hold on, an autopsy report is not the autopsy, it's a report of the autopsy, right?

20
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:41,640
You get it?

21
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,580
Yes, absolutely.

22
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,120
But that's usually what you end up looking at, unless you can get into the materials themselves,

23
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,340
and that's past the report, that's your photographs, your collection of stuff, your slides,

24
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,040
and that's a whole other area of interest.

25
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,820
But just lookin' at the paperwork, they've changed that too,

26
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,720
which I imagine means they've changed all the procedures.

27
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,360
Anyway, forget all that, problem is the alternative.

28
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,380
By the way, hold on, everything's about procedure, there's no law, there's no medicine,

29
00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:08,539
there's none of that stuff, right?

30
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,100
If you know a doctor that's tryin' to be, to improve the procedures,

31
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:18,080
he gets reprimanded because he's supposed to follow those standard procedures, right?

32
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,420
It has nothing to do with whatever.

33
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,300
Oh yeah.

34
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:20,520
Okay.

35
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,680
No, being taught by forensic pathologists, right?

36
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,960
Look, what do I need to know in order to interpret things properly?

37
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,440
What word comes out of their mouth first?

38
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:29,960
Procedure.

39
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,060
You need to know the procedure, what procedure, you know, what was performed,

40
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,300
here's how you do the Y incision, blah, blah, blah, all these different things.

41
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,940
But what's fascinating to me is the ultimate conclusions, right?

42
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:44,120
People talk today about, gee, there's a lot of people droppin' dead of heart attacks, Greek.

43
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,760
Well, that's been the case since about, I don't know, the 1960s to the 80s.

44
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,240
Well, why in the 60s?

45
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:58,180
Because that's when they introduced, they had a big, big push to get people to start eating margarine.

46
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,260
Ah, yes.

47
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,540
Believe it or not.

48
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,180
And the way, yeah, there was no standard way of making margarine,

49
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,100
they just made margarine and a lot of the chemicals in there.

50
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:12,120
And we'll get into that because most people don't know what a heart attack is, and I'll simplify it.

51
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,160
Well, yeah, but what is a heart attack?

52
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:20,000
Anyway, they got a lot of different words for different cardiac events, right, that they say caused death.

53
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,180
And what's funny to me is I would sit there, you know, novice, reading it, going,

54
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,120
well, that's not the cause of death, but that is something that happens.

55
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,980
I mean, if you die, the heart stops workin'.

56
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,320
And I'm wondering what order they're puttin' it in.

57
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:38,160
Now, you and I discussed before that there was a point in time where people were dying from all sorts of dental issues

58
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,180
because their teeth would rot, they would get infections, they would spread, and it would kill them.

59
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:42,920
Right?

60
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,280
Right.

61
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:56,540
And two research that I've done from the 1890s to 1920s was death certificates that listed the cause of death was poisoning of the teeth.

62
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,160
And there was another term, I feel bad, I can't remember it,

63
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,060
but basically it's shock and trauma.

64
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:10,680
Like if you were hit by a horse and run over, and you went into shock, right, basically from pain, you died from that.

65
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,640
I've seen people go into shock, it's quite a thing.

66
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,500
And, yeah, so.

67
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:21,720
And that allegedly started the movement to, you know, give opiates to everybody, to reduce pain, and so on and so forth.

68
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,460
Because up to that point, believe it or not, pain was not an issue in medicine.

69
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,820
It was like a, yeah, pain is just something that's there.

70
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,600
We're not trying to deal with the pain.

71
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:40,080
Yeah, so the reason people are not dying as much as they used to back in the day is because of the tranquilizers, anesthesia, painkillers.

72
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,180
The water is separated.

73
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,860
What I mean by the water is separated, your freshwater and your sewer is separate, right?

74
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,280
Right.

75
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:53,440
And because, by the way, years ago when you had a freshwater source, people dumped their sewage in it,

76
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,240
and then they stopped drinking it when it got too much sewage in it.

77
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,460
I know it sounds crazy, right?

78
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,320
Yeah, so it's completely separate.

79
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:08,400
And also dentistry is what, and by the way, most, you know, the easiest way to access dentistry,

80
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,320
other than having an acquaintance that's a dentist, is to go to a dental school.

81
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,860
And most people will find a way to be accommodated.

82
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:21,960
So, but let's just jump right into the heart attack thing real quick, because there's no such thing really.

83
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:27,120
First of all, it's been very well known, the heart doesn't pump the blood.

84
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,760
It's physically impossible, right?

85
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,820
It's physically impossible to do that, just no matter how you look at it.

86
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:38,300
The quantity of blood, how thick the blood is, and how much linear,

87
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,660
or like some places in the country they don't use, they say linear, they say lineal,

88
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,700
feet of, or meters of blood vessels you have.

89
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,000
It's impossible to pump anything through that.

90
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,780
So it has to be self-moving.

91
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,320
And I've described, we'll do a quick recap.

92
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,040
It's the capillaries that cause what we call blood movement throughout the system.

93
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:05,680
The Greeks, ancient Greeks, they said the blood moves in the body like the waves in the ocean.

94
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,120
It's very accurate, actually.

95
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,720
When there's a transfer of nutrition, nutritive and eliminative matter,

96
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,940
on the capillary level, what's a capillary?

97
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,420
Go look in the mirror, if you have an organic eye,

98
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,360
and you look at your eye, you'll see these very fine blood vessels, right?

99
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,180
That's what I, that's the level, that's, in other words,

100
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,880
that's a good demonstrative example of the size that I'm talking about.

101
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,360
Because they are small, and they can be smaller than that also, and larger,

102
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,320
and still be classified as capillary.

103
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:40,160
But in other words, all of the blood movement in the body is caused,

104
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,640
well, originated on blood vessels that size, right?

105
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,340
So, which you have the most of.

106
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:53,200
And it goes around a circuitous path, branches off,

107
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,940
and goes into different parts of the body.

108
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,840
You could research that anatomically, what they tell you in the coacademic books,

109
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,880
it's fairly accurate.

110
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,540
And when it gets to the heart, it's not about mixing or anything,

111
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:09,660
even though there is, the heart's job is to slow that down.

112
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,700
So, let's use an analogy of slowing something down.

113
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:18,120
Can we think of anything that slows something down in the world that we live in?

114
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,140
Brakes, right? Oh, yeah, brakes. Very good.

115
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,980
So, you have brakes on cars and things like that, right?

116
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,420
Automotive, motorcycle, trains, planes, and automobiles.

117
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,960
Okay, so, what do we know about brakes?

118
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,060
Well, anyone who's been around before anti-lock braking

119
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:37,760
was more aware of how critical it is to brake.

120
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,100
So, with anti-lock braking, that spoiled everyone, right?

121
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:44,360
Years ago, before anti-lock braking, you were concerned about skidding,

122
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,820
you couldn't stop in the rain, right?

123
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,920
Yeah, you can read that in the old driver's manuals.

124
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,500
They would tell you, look, in these circumstances,

125
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,900
you have to actually pump the brakes.

126
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,860
Stuff like that. Right, go ahead.

127
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,280
So, it's been more of a concern on the older folks.

128
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,220
They know about it, but these days, it's been very automated.

129
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,560
And by the way, if you want, just since we're on the subject,

130
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,200
because I also work with high-performance automobiles, or used to,

131
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,500
they found out that if they remove anti-lock braking systems

132
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,780
from high-performance cars, they actually go faster,

133
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,620
and have better braking. Go figure.

134
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,660
So, what goes around comes around. That's another subject on why.

135
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,120
So, what happens?

136
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,500
So, think of a heart attack as being your brake failure.

137
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:29,340
Because the heart, let's just say it this way,

138
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,860
if we view the heart as its mechanical function,

139
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,539
it is a brake, not a pump.

140
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,640
I couldn't make it any simpler than that.

141
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,039
Because what we're told in the simplest mechanical form,

142
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,620
the heart is what? A pump.

143
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,360
Wrong. It's not.

144
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,100
So, if we're going to simplify it as a pump,

145
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,080
why don't we simplify it down to what it really does?

146
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,640
It's not a pump at all. It's a brake.

147
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,160
Okay, so, if you have a heart attack,

148
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,960
it's a failure of the pump to be working properly, according to them.

149
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:01,080
But if you find out that it's not a pump at all, and it's really a brake,

150
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,480
a heart attack is what? Brake failure.

151
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:03,940
Right.

152
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:09,360
Okay, so, when you don't have resistance, you have no braking.

153
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:10,640
Correct.

154
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,620
Simple as that.

155
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,000
So, if the heart cannot get in alignment,

156
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,440
mechanically, electrically, flow-wise, hydrodynamically,

157
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,140
flow, you know, purely on a fluid level,

158
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,160
purely on a mechanical or electrical level,

159
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,040
and it cannot slow down the blood,

160
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,080
what happens when you start losing your brakes?

161
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,500
It gets worse and worse, right?

162
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:31,900
Right?

163
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,400
Back in the old days, if you lean on your brakes,

164
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,800
and they're not doing good, and you keep leaning on them,

165
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,920
they're not going to do better, they're going to get worse, right?

166
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:40,840
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

167
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,220
So, once it starts, the blood flowing through the heart system,

168
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,000
you know, what we call the heart,

169
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,500
because it says ventricles and chambers, right?

170
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:55,800
And it cannot basically apply the brakes to the blood flow,

171
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,140
is what they're interpreting as a heart attack, right?

172
00:09:59,360 --> 00:09:59,640
Okay.

173
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,180
So, what'll happen is it'll create too much, okay, what is,

174
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,580
when you don't have brakes, you can't regulate your speed.

175
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:07,620
True.

176
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,620
Right? Very simple.

177
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,000
So, when you, the heart stops acting as a proper braking mechanism,

178
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,360
it cannot regulate the speed of the fluid in the body.

179
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:15,920
Right.

180
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,480
So, it'll pull too far away on one end,

181
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,040
and clog up too much on the other,

182
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,620
and that just makes the recovery even harder.

183
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,360
Now, this has been in many medical circles,

184
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,740
and I just did this from understanding Yin and Yang,

185
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,380
but this is actually applied therapy.

186
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,240
So, without even getting into my personal experimentation,

187
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,600
right now, they've found that most effective treatment

188
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,940
for someone who is experiencing a cardiac arrest

189
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,300
is throw them in an ice water bath.

190
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,100
Mm-hmm.

191
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,200
Right? Contraction.

192
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,120
So, it's based on that.

193
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,980
But part of the shenanigans of what's going on now

194
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,200
with people with heart failure

195
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,700
is the same people that are writing all the shenanigans

196
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,920
with the COVID thing, right?

197
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:57,360
Right.

198
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,440
Now, if you've been injected with what they call a vaccine,

199
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,020
by the way, I think I've gone over enough.

200
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,420
There's no such thing as a vaccine.

201
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,680
They call it an injection, a vaccine injection, or whatever,

202
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,560
but there's no such thing.

203
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,360
You cannot give someone...

204
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,340
It sounds rational and logical,

205
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,020
and it might be effective if done right,

206
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,860
but you cannot give anyone part of a pathogen,

207
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,960
even if it's not live,

208
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,980
and their body develops an immunity to it.

209
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,260
That's a fallacy.

210
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,020
That's not true at all.

211
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:26,540
Right.

212
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,980
It's a subject that sounds reasonable,

213
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,360
and they're perpetuating this now for over 200 years.

214
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,440
Well, right, but that's the problem with it

215
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,300
is that it does sound reasonable, but...

216
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:37,480
That's right.

217
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,600
Yeah, go ahead.

218
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,420
That sounds reasonable that also when you eat food,

219
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,720
you absorb it, right?

220
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,400
Well, you know, you think to yourself...

221
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,860
And you're getting energy from calories.

222
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,060
They keep it going.

223
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:47,540
Right.

224
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:47,820
Right.

225
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,500
That's why I said, you know, I brought up archaics.

226
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,260
People look at that.

227
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,260
People also look at Brandon Joe Williams.

228
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,620
He's doing some stuff with law.

229
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,820
He's pushing it, you know, and it's the same everywhere.

230
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,460
It's funny.

231
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,240
With Brandon Joe Williams,

232
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,220
I don't endorse either one of them, though, by the way,

233
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,100
but they're fun to look at,

234
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,480
and I can tell you what they're not doing as well,

235
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,980
better than they should be.

236
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,020
But the Brandon Joe Williams guy,

237
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,560
recently I've been putting some stuff on

238
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,580
in the background while I'm working.

239
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,920
By the way, when I say recently I read a book,

240
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,280
I do not sit and read a book.

241
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,600
I have audio books playing audio,

242
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,700
so I could do other things.

243
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,180
I'm always doing at least two or three things

244
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,300
at the same time, right?

245
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,960
I don't sit and read anything, unless it's specific.

246
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,820
But he's been coming out lately

247
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,080
and making statements like,

248
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,600
attorneys don't know any law at all.

249
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,140
None of them.

250
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,440
I wonder where I've heard that before.

251
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:37,120
Yeah.

252
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,580
And he's only been saying this for a year.

253
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,360
So he's, in other words,

254
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,040
if you hear people saying that,

255
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,000
that means that they know what they're,

256
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,040
you know, they found out.

257
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,300
They know it now, right?

258
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:47,880
They know that.

259
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,600
And just to add to that,

260
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,960
if you're an attorney

261
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,600
and you decide to learn some law,

262
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,900
like, you know, remember the juice?

263
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,960
They have pulp and then no pulp,

264
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,540
and then they have some pulp, right?

265
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,060
Okay.

266
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,280
On the orange juice.

267
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:04,560
Okay.

268
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,440
So if you're an attorney

269
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,960
and you decide not to learn law,

270
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,980
but some law, a little bit,

271
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,440
a little bit, a little bit,

272
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,320
like De Niro would say,

273
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,400
just a little bit, right?

274
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,180
You start talking that you're doing that,

275
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,000
you're going to get disbarred,

276
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,720
which is not a license to practice law,

277
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,460
I assure you.

278
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,880
And this is a phenomenon.

279
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,500
When you're a lawyer

280
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,620
and you become disbarred

281
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,500
or disenfranchised with the bar

282
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,220
and you decide to do something else,

283
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,900
they always work in the car sales industry.

284
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,920
Now, I didn't say used,

285
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,480
so much as, yeah,

286
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,720
they become used car salesmen.

287
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,060
I never said used car salesmen.

288
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,840
They could be used car salesmen,

289
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:41,800
but you'll find them

290
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,100
in new car dealerships as well.

291
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,040
They somehow, it's a phenomenon.

292
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,400
It's a phenomenon.

293
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,860
So I'm bringing these guys up

294
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,840
and that's just to interject,

295
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,560
just a reminder,

296
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,980
if you look at archaic stuff

297
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,720
and look at Brandon, Joe Williams,

298
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,780
this little recent guy

299
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,340
that popped up on the scene,

300
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,140
yeah, they've got good stuff going.

301
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,520
But what I'm trying to say is

302
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,540
when you learn a little bit about,

303
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,480
well, where have you heard this before?

304
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,080
All fields are wide open.

305
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,340
Every subject under the sun and moon

306
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,320
and stars is completely wide open.

307
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,380
So whatever you start finding out about it,

308
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,920
stop reading stuff that's recent.

309
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,060
You've got to read stuff

310
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,560
that's before World War II,

311
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,100
preferably 1890s.

312
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,720
People that are familiar with Greek speak

313
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,380
that used to hear me back in the day

314
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,860
in 2010, 11, and 12

315
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,620
when I was just on call in radio.

316
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,360
Even American Freedom,

317
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,360
I was going to say American Spirits,

318
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:35,940
that's a cigarette.

319
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,560
But American Freedom Radio,

320
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,360
I used to call in

321
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,920
and have long conversations as well.

322
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,280
What I've said is everything

323
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,100
and everything was already known

324
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,400
by the late 1800s.

325
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,360
Everything.

326
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,960
And archaics also says that,

327
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,040
also, similar to it.

328
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,960
Everything that, yes, everything.

329
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,940
Just about anything that we could.

330
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,300
And right now, okay,

331
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,180
back in those days,

332
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,300
they used to put out future,

333
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,760
the World's Fair and all that stuff

334
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,600
that by the 19,

335
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,800
say in the teens and 20s,

336
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,440
1970s we'll have a hotel on the moon

337
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,380
and everybody will have jetpacks

338
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,300
and flying cars, right?

339
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:12,980
By the 1970s.

340
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,080
The world of the future, yeah.

341
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,940
That's right, yeah.

342
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,980
And the Jetsons and all.

343
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:17,860
The Jetsons are supposed to be

344
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,760
like 2100.

345
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,600
But anyway,

346
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,060
you're never going to get that.

347
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,880
But they had known enough technology

348
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,300
that that stuff was not

349
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,500
pure fantasy to them.

350
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,620
They already knew it was plausible

351
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,540
and doable, right?

352
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,260
There's a couple of futuristic stuff.

353
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,340
Actually, futurism was a big deal

354
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,340
in France and Paris in the 20s.

355
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,860
There's a lot of illustration books.

356
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,300
You can get books online

357
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,680
and look up futurism from France

358
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,920
in the 1920s and you'll see

359
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,560
1980s flying cars,

360
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,020
1990s this and that.

361
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,080
It's not because they were

362
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,640
super fantastic imaginations.

363
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,740
They had the technology to do that.

364
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,860
And I think as we speak,

365
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,240
it would not be impossible to have

366
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,260
flying cars out there, right?

367
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:00,480
Right.

368
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,640
Well, it sort of depends

369
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,620
on when you say flying.

370
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,340
It's because birds don't fly.

371
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,080
Birds are flown.

372
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,200
They set up their bodies

373
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,480
so the environment lifts them

374
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,020
versus thrust where an airplane,

375
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:09,320
right?

376
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:09,720
It's different.

377
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,060
Things in nature,

378
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,340
they don't thrust.

379
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,300
There are things like

380
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,340
certain kinds of shrimp

381
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,620
and things that do thrust,

382
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,140
squid,

383
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,080
but most things that fly

384
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,960
just to manipulate

385
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,840
their immediate environment

386
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,360
to create loftiness.

387
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,700
How about hovercraft?

388
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,920
Is that a better term?

389
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,080
Yeah, you could,

390
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,580
but not by thrust and propulsion.

391
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,720
Yeah, but there are other ways.

392
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,280
Okay, so what I'm trying to say here

393
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,140
is you're not getting

394
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,860
any kind of talk like that anymore

395
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,940
because you're never going

396
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,760
to get flying cars.

397
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,720
You're never going to get

398
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,660
a hotel on the moon.

399
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,520
That stuff is never...

400
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,000
So what I'm trying to say,

401
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,600
the 20th century was stalled out.

402
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,400
They stalled...

403
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,800
Nothing happened in the 20th century.

404
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,720
When you think of the 20th century,

405
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,300
what did you get?

406
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,460
Okay, you got airplanes

407
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,280
and whatever,

408
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,680
but there's all these big wars,

409
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,020
financial situation, right?

410
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:54,640
There's nothing.

411
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,220
It stalled out the whole century.

412
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,220
It stalled out.

413
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,900
And it's still stalled out,

414
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,260
but now it's becoming different.

415
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:01,940
Now it's cultural

416
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:02,620
because they know

417
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,859
you don't have a lot of time left.

418
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:05,819
So my point here is

419
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:06,760
if you want to learn

420
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,119
about all of these things,

421
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,180
first thing to learn,

422
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,560
I assure you,

423
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:12,200
is what the public knows

424
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,540
about the subject is false.

425
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,160
Even though it looks workable.

426
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:17,980
And it happens...

427
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,200
This happens in cultures constantly.

428
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:21,700
In other words,

429
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:23,280
the corruption of information

430
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,420
increases in proportion

431
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,160
to the technological advancement

432
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,140
that's available

433
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,280
to the general society.

434
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,660
So when you see

435
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,300
the society at large

436
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,140
is becoming more technologically advanced

437
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,080
where devices in the homes

438
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,640
and all this stuff,

439
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,520
the information that they're getting

440
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,400
about everything else,

441
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,140
even that is corrupted

442
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,640
more and more and more.

443
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,360
So in other words,

444
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,340
the people that relied,

445
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,220
that had a more natural environment

446
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,380
without all this technological stuff,

447
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,780
that relied on signs

448
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,160
and superstition,

449
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,560
were better off in many ways

450
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,180
and less corrupt, right?

451
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,580
Like if you look at

452
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,080
one of the most corrupt times in Europe

453
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,080
is with the Inquisition

454
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,620
when the Vatican took over Europe.

455
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,260
That's the initial major corrupt,

456
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,760
horrible shit, right?

457
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,620
Other than the Mongol invasion

458
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,320
and all that, right?

459
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,040
And that was a lot

460
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,880
based on superstition and all that

461
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,920
but it was based on

462
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,680
creating a political body again

463
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,280
which is part of technology

464
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,060
because as technology gets stronger

465
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,720
you'll notice the state gets stronger

466
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,940
which is a political body

467
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,100
not the government, right?

468
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,120
The state.

469
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,900
So just like 1984,

470
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,520
the whole premise of 1984

471
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,580
was based around a state

472
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,900
that had a lot of power.

473
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,600
Right?

474
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,260
Right.

475
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,000
So this is the situation

476
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,820
that you're in

477
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,720
and your information

478
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,860
is all corrupted

479
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,980
no matter how many people think

480
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,380
the corrupted information

481
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,700
is usable or correct.

482
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,440
This is on every subject.

483
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,260
So if people are having heart attacks

484
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,420
and they go to a medical quack

485
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,660
that, by the way,

486
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,060
people tell me they have

487
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:04,960
a certain condition

488
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,620
when I meet them

489
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:05,900
and I say,

490
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,540
did you go to a medical technician

491
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,440
known as a doctor?

492
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,680
Did he ever engage you

493
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:10,820
and say,

494
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,780
I gotta take your vitals?

495
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,500
Does he put a cuff on your arm

496
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,080
and inflate it?

497
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:14,540
He says, yeah, yeah,

498
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:14,980
blood pressure.

499
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,920
I say, it's a quack.

500
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,380
Anyone who does that

501
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,160
is a self-proclaimed quack.

502
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,280
But they all do that.

503
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,260
Thank you very much.

504
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:22,300
Right?

505
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,060
They're all quacks.

506
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,200
Right?

507
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,140
Because it's procedure

508
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,340
like we started off early.

509
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:26,860
Yes.

510
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,700
So these people

511
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,660
that have heart conditions

512
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,020
they go and they supposedly,

513
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,000
oh, the doctor helped me

514
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,940
get better and all that.

515
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,780
Yeah, you actually survived

516
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,440
the heart attack

517
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,570
and survived that treatment.

518
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:37,710
Right?

519
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:38,450
Right.

520
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,170
So you're a pretty tough individual.

521
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,470
Don't think that they helped you out at all

522
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,850
unless they gave you some pain relief.

523
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:47,370
Because pain, by the way,

524
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,210
is circuitous.

525
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,410
In other words, pain is like,

526
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:52,150
what do you call it

527
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,430
when a dog chases its tail?

528
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:54,630
It's a compounding.

529
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:56,050
When you have a little bit of pain

530
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:56,610
it gets worse.

531
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:57,530
It makes it even worse.

532
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:57,810
Right?

533
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:58,810
It's cumulative, yeah.

534
00:19:59,270 --> 00:19:59,990
Yeah, yeah.

535
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:01,750
So relieving pain

536
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,970
is a very, very big,

537
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:03,670
it's a bad,

538
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,590
over-signaling the body,

539
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,610
the nervous system

540
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:07,970
can actually create shutdown

541
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:08,790
of other systems.

542
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:12,170
So what does that mean?

543
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:12,610
Okay.

544
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:14,450
It means that

545
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,590
if you're talking about something

546
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,590
like heart attacks

547
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:18,250
and whatever,

548
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,930
are they misclassified

549
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:20,470
or whatever?

550
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:21,830
Yeah, you know,

551
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:22,850
it doesn't really matter.

552
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:23,770
Like, I started,

553
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:24,770
this is a big tangent

554
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:26,750
because I got into this tangent

555
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,350
because of the vaccines, right?

556
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:28,710
Right.

557
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,470
The people that are dying

558
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,190
from, let's say,

559
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,830
side effects of the injection

560
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,770
they're calling it heart failure.

561
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,430
We're talking like 19-year-olds,

562
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:39,370
30-year-olds, right?

563
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:39,990
Athletes.

564
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,190
Yeah, people that you would not

565
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,130
normally expect

566
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,110
to be suffering

567
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,250
from such a thing are.

568
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,930
Is it possible?

569
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,550
I don't need to study

570
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,330
what they inject.

571
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,470
Because no one really knows

572
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,650
because the information

573
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,310
is corrupted.

574
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,410
Is it possible

575
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:54,870
that there are constituents,

576
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:55,890
even technology

577
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,390
in those injections

578
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:01,030
that would prevent the heart

579
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,610
from acting as a proper

580
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:03,610
breaking mechanism?

581
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,630
And the answer to that

582
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,070
is yes.

583
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:05,890
Yes, of course.

584
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:06,650
Of course.

585
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,590
But also, those people,

586
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:09,930
could they be monitored

587
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:10,990
and then hit with

588
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,250
other types of things?

589
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:13,950
You know, the phone

590
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:15,550
and devices

591
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,690
has enough energy

592
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,770
to induce biorhythmic signals

593
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,250
that can induce that also.

594
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,110
And here's the thing

595
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:22,990
about this concept

596
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,070
of a nanoparticle

597
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:24,830
that they introduce

598
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:25,530
into this thing

599
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,290
is that that is now

600
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,910
another receptor,

601
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,650
not one that is native

602
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:31,350
to the body.

603
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:34,070
Well, they're not that mystical.

604
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:35,930
Now imagine, okay,

605
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,490
take a piece of sheet metal,

606
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,350
very thin piece of sheet metal,

607
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:39,990
very small,

608
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,470
bend it in half.

609
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:42,430
But you know when you have

610
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,130
a sheet of paper

611
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,030
or a piece of sheet metal,

612
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,170
it's even thickness throughout?

613
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:45,690
Yeah.

614
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,530
But imagine the paper

615
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:48,110
or the sheet metal,

616
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,590
it's not an even thickness throughout.

617
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,530
And depending where you bend it,

618
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,310
at that bend,

619
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,490
what the thickness of it is

620
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:55,610
at that bend point

621
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:58,370
will react to certain radio frequencies.

622
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:01,810
It's not that mystical at all.

623
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:02,750
This is what I'm telling you,

624
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,510
remember,

625
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,750
the simplest technology, right?

626
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:06,130
Right.

627
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,450
So they make these

628
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:08,450
little nanoparticles

629
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:10,410
that are asymmetric or symmetric

630
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:11,330
in a certain way

631
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,130
and they're folded up.

632
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,650
And based on how they're made,

633
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,350
whatever frequency

634
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,130
they are activated with,

635
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,070
they will unfold

636
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:21,750
and open up.

637
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:22,170
Okay.

638
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:23,910
So it's the opposite

639
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:24,730
of a bear trap.

640
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:25,390
When you get caught

641
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:25,970
in a bear trap,

642
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:26,790
the thing is open,

643
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:27,470
you step on it,

644
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:28,470
it closes and it clamps

645
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:29,350
on your foot, right?

646
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,410
Or while the bears paw away.

647
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:32,170
It's like the thing

648
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:32,910
in the Saw movie

649
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:34,030
where they put the bear trap

650
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:34,690
on in reverse

651
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:36,110
and it pries the jaws open

652
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:36,690
radically.

653
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,310
This would be more like

654
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,310
a jack-in-the-box

655
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,430
that's folded up

656
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:42,350
and it's folded across

657
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,090
certain lines of thickness,

658
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,250
nanometers, right?

659
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,310
That's why it's nanotech.

660
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,350
That when it's succumbed

661
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,150
to a certain amount

662
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,570
of amplitude and frequency,

663
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,290
amplitude meaning volume, energy,

664
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:54,750
and frequency would be

665
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,270
where in the band it is,

666
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,230
the thing unfolds.

667
00:22:58,330 --> 00:22:58,470
Okay.

668
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,270
So it'd be like, you know,

669
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,950
opening a jackknife

670
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:02,710
in your pocket.

671
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:03,850
Right?

672
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,070
Let's say it's an analogy.

673
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:05,650
Okay.

674
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:07,550
This is what nanotechnology is.

675
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,030
It's nothing mystical or magical.

676
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:11,290
This is like 1930s technology,

677
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:11,790
by the way.

678
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:12,870
You know, the idea

679
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,490
of having something

680
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:15,450
like that activate.

681
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:16,950
Yeah, but clearly, again,

682
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:17,730
that's not something

683
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,510
that is native

684
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,390
to the capillaries.

685
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:21,630
No, no.

686
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:22,130
It would be something

687
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:23,290
that would be easily

688
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:24,850
put into an injection.

689
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:25,390
Yeah.

690
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,310
And easily activated

691
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,690
with a specific frequency.

692
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,130
You know, there's no,

693
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:30,670
everybody's talking

694
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:31,750
about these nanoparticles.

695
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:32,150
They've been talking

696
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:32,650
about it since

697
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,310
10 years now already, right?

698
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,070
And I've never heard,

699
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,810
I don't spend that much time

700
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:39,650
on the Internet, of course,

701
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:40,530
but I've never heard anyone

702
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:42,370
explain it so simply

703
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:43,250
like I just did.

704
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:43,690
No.

705
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:44,730
Why?

706
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:46,310
Because maybe

707
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,430
it's a planet of morons?

708
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:48,950
Anyway, did I just say that?

709
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:49,430
Could be.

710
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:50,310
Okay.

711
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:53,150
Yeah, so, yeah.

712
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,050
Yeah, so all of these things,

713
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,310
you've got to somehow

714
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,950
relax about the whole thing

715
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,390
because let's go back

716
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:00,510
to the idiot that went

717
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,070
to the medical professional.

718
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:02,970
By the way, there's so many

719
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:03,950
people that I've known

720
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:04,730
even in the neighborhood

721
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:05,170
or whatever,

722
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,110
maybe let's say 60s or 70s.

723
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,710
I said, I haven't seen you

724
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:08,990
in a while.

725
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,210
Yeah, I have a doctor

726
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:10,650
who says I have

727
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:11,150
a heart condition.

728
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:11,670
I said, you know,

729
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:12,670
you'll be dead in six months

730
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:13,350
to a year, right?

731
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:15,010
You look fine.

732
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,390
You watch them degrade

733
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,690
and then you don't see

734
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:18,190
them anymore

735
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,330
and you see the other wife.

736
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,630
Oh, he died a month ago.

737
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,010
And everybody's okay with that.

738
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:22,410
I said, you know,

739
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:23,770
there's nothing wrong

740
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:24,790
with him in the first place,

741
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:25,070
right?

742
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:28,490
So anyway, at all.

743
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:30,830
But look, if I call

744
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,150
that medical Darwinism,

745
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:33,590
if you're so stupid

746
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,470
that you actually think

747
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,050
what they're doing

748
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:36,670
is helping you,

749
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,490
you shouldn't be procreating,

750
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,650
even though it's kind of late.

751
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:40,570
But remember,

752
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:43,310
if you have a male American,

753
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,950
65, 70, totally fine.

754
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:47,150
He's told that

755
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,610
his blood sugar is off,

756
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,170
which there's no glucose

757
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,270
in the blood anyway.

758
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,010
If you read,

759
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,090
I'm not going to go over

760
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:54,510
that again,

761
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:55,590
but if you see how they

762
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,490
determine blood glucose,

763
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:56,770
you're like,

764
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:57,310
wait a second,

765
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,870
that is so far off.

766
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,130
It's by analog, right?

767
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:03,630
And they tell you

768
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:04,350
you have a heart condition.

769
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,850
They start experimenting on you

770
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:07,990
and you die.

771
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,510
Is it possible at 65

772
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,870
that you could still have babies?

773
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:12,330
Yeah.

774
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,810
A man could have babies

775
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,050
till he's 90 or whatever.

776
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,310
I think the sperm hang around

777
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:19,090
pretty long in a male.

778
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,170
Yeah, the male can go

779
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:22,130
all throughout their life.

780
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,190
A woman loses it

781
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,290
between 40 and 50 years of age,

782
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,310
but the male, no,

783
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:28,030
they can keep going.

784
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:29,430
Yeah, the women

785
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:31,010
really get the bum deal here

786
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:32,430
because after menopause,

787
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,330
their brain can shrink

788
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:34,550
as much as 30%,

789
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,110
physically in size.

790
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,590
You know about that?

791
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:39,710
That explains a lot,

792
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:40,570
but no, I've never heard that.

793
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:41,630
It does explain a lot, yeah.

794
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:43,230
Maybe it does.

795
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,230
It explains why

796
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,410
a lot of these women

797
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:47,750
become interior designers.

798
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:48,230
But anyway,

799
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:49,110
you ever notice

800
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,290
the most interior designer women

801
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:51,490
are over 50 or 50?

802
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,250
I call it a post-menopause career.

803
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:54,450
Yeah, definitely.

804
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,550
But anyway, yeah, yeah.

805
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:59,970
So I would, well, anyway,

806
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,790
it's not the size of the brain.

807
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:04,410
Is it working or not, right?

808
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:05,110
True.

809
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:08,670
So here's the point,

810
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:11,470
which is pointless in a way.

811
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:16,570
The Darwinism part for the women,

812
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:17,010
I don't see it,

813
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:17,610
but for the men

814
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:18,630
because they could have babies.

815
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:19,610
So these older men

816
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:20,130
that believe

817
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:21,570
what the medical idiots

818
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:22,250
are telling them

819
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,250
and they are killed

820
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,150
by the treatments,

821
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,890
it is a form of Darwinism,

822
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:29,230
so they can't procreate.

823
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,510
I call it medical Darwin.

824
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:32,650
I'm totally okay with it.

825
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,070
It's like a test.

826
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:35,790
You know, when you're taking a test,

827
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:38,690
you stand up during the test

828
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:39,310
and let's say

829
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,490
in one of these public schools

830
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:41,290
or private school

831
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:42,690
and you start walking around

832
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:43,750
and telling other people

833
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:44,670
they did this wrong,

834
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:45,390
they did this right,

835
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:45,910
they did this wrong.

836
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:46,730
What are they going to do to you?

837
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:47,910
What are they going to do to you?

838
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:48,750
Throw you out of there.

839
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:49,530
Kill you, right?

840
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:50,970
Guaranteed.

841
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:52,650
Yeah, it's academic suicide

842
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:53,650
as a fifth grader

843
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:54,450
if you do that, right?

844
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:55,350
Right, exactly.

845
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:56,410
It's the same thing

846
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:57,290
here in this society.

847
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:58,070
You start going around

848
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:58,550
telling people

849
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,070
what you're doing

850
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,110
is absolutely asinine,

851
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:00,870
it's suicidal.

852
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:02,050
It's socially suicidal.
