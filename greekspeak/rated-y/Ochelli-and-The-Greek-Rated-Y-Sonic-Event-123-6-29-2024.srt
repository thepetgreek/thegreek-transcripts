1
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:18,600
Sonic Event 123, Rated Y. Anyway, look, it's a little noisy over there, but that's okay.

2
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:19,900
We knew that was going to happen.

3
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,960
Greek, how is things?

4
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,300
It's going, yeah, it's all right.

5
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:33,440
Yeah, we had a little delay this week, but let's see how the internet goes, because they

6
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:40,920
were chopping lines here, the Cox Communications, you know, the internet, the cable people,

7
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,060
they don't have any crews.

8
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,680
All those crews, they put a magnetic, it's part of the subcontract, because they get

9
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,500
paid well, and they slap a magnetic sign on the side of their truck, right?

10
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,120
Yeah, exactly.

11
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,660
Everybody's a subcontractor, and look, you and I are in two totally different parts of

12
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,280
the country, but Cox Cable is the same thing all over.

13
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,320
Yeah, it's a guy that's just like, yeah, I do this, and sometimes I work for AT&T, too,

14
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:03,040
you know?

15
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:03,800
Right, exactly.

16
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,600
Yeah, this way, there's no pensions to pay, if the guy gets injured, get out of here,

17
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,600
get another one, right?

18
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,200
Oh, yeah.

19
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,460
That's what the Japanese do here, when they make car factories here.

20
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,440
And they don't even have to do the payroll stuff, either.

21
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,940
You just turn around and go, look, man, your taxes are your problem, and that's that.

22
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,960
Well, no one has to do it.

23
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,600
You can get hired and refuse the paperwork.

24
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:34,000
There's a lady that was doing a survey recently, about two weeks ago, can you sign this petition

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,520
for what?

26
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,720
Raising the minimum wage.

27
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,700
So the minimum wage, it should be at least $27 to $28 to live, right?

28
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,820
And I was trying to explain it to her, you know?

29
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:50,060
If you get hired, and you don't fill out any tax paperwork, and they fire you because of

30
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,820
that, you could sue, you litigate.

31
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,420
That's one thing that Brandon Joe Williams is into.

32
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,760
He's going to get slaughtered, by the way, I don't know if anyone watched his stuff.

33
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,180
But he's putting out good information that if you use most of it, if you actually do

34
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,260
what he says, you'll be okay.

35
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,460
But his litigation, he doesn't understand.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,100
But anyway, I don't endorse him, just like Archaic, I don't endorse him, but you'll find

37
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:10,800
good stuff there.

38
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,360
Brandon Joe Williams, onestupidfuck.com.

39
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,620
Yeah, that's his website.

40
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:24,540
Anyway, yeah, there's a while back, if they ask you for a social security number and refuse

41
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,800
to hire because you don't have one or don't produce one, if you can get it in writing,

42
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:34,880
the full year salary is what you litigate for, plus treble damages.

43
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:42,720
So let's say it was back then, when I helped someone do this, it was a 30K job, and 90K

44
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,040
triple on top, not 60, triple damages.

45
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:54,180
I think they went for, but they did settle for 42,000, and it was with, and it was, the

46
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,180
employer could afford it, it was a hotel chain.

47
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,740
Not bad for not going to work.

48
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,240
Yeah, go ahead.

49
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,160
Yeah, and I said, well, all you got to do, I was telling people, is apply, go apply to

50
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,820
work, and I'll show you how you can make a quarter of a million dollars a year, anywhere

51
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,260
between 50 to 100,000 a year, just for applying to get jobs.

52
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,280
Not working.

53
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,360
And they're like, huh?

54
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,920
And when you explain it to them, they're, you know, but you don't apply like some mom

55
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,700
and pop, whatever.

56
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,740
You could do that too and hurt them, but they won't, you'll have to liquidate their store

57
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,300
and all that.

58
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,660
You go to the big companies that are always saying, we're hiring, right?

59
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:33,180
You just go keep, you just keep applying, and you just be very careful what you say,

60
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,660
very careful of what they say, and then use it against them.

61
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,100
And that's how you're going to change the system.

62
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,000
And the way, see, this system is set up, it's all fraudulent, right?

63
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:47,180
The money is completely fraudulent, the medical is completely fraudulent, the religions are

64
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,140
completely fraudulent.

65
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,000
I mean, all you got to say is Santa Claus, right?

66
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,900
And that proves that religions are fraudulent, on and on and on and on.

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,660
So any fraudulent system throughout history does collapse, yes or no?

68
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,500
Yes.

69
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:01,420
Right?

70
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,420
It always falls apart.

71
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,180
It seems to me every system collapses.

72
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,120
You don't even have to say fraud.

73
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,640
Every system seems to collapse, whether it's fraudulent or not, I can't even determine

74
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,280
because they all collapse.

75
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,020
But a fraudulent one will go much quicker.

76
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,240
Now, here's the thing.

77
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,380
If people followed everything that's in the laws, we'd be great.

78
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,380
We wouldn't be using money.

79
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,440
Anytime you want something, you sign your name and you get it.

80
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,500
That's why when I go out to the shops and let's say at Goodwill, do you want to donate

81
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,380
the change to this charity?

82
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,380
And I'm like, why?

83
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,240
Are their hands broken?

84
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,120
And that starts the conversation, right?

85
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,480
Because all you need to do is sign your name.

86
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,940
They're not following.

87
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:39,560
So if everyone, let's say, did what Joe Brandon says, go ahead and litigate every time you

88
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,220
write a check.

89
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,380
You know, I've gone over the banking, how it works, right?

90
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:47,460
That's why you notice everything, the prices have doubled nearly or gone up like 60 percent.

91
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,760
That's because of all those stimulus checks.

92
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,640
And I told people on private Skype calls to watch the massive inflation within 300 to

93
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,280
1000 days, which is within one year or three.

94
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:04,140
That's how they work on 90, 180 day increments, the financial rate.

95
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,220
And they work on quarterly.

96
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:05,500
Right.

97
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,420
So I bunched it up.

98
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,380
I said, they'll give them three.

99
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,500
Anyway, everything's got a three and a half year drift anyhow.

100
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,560
You know, that's right.

101
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,120
Sort of.

102
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:13,480
Yeah.

103
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:13,800
So.

104
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,340
So what better thing to be part of taking down the system?

105
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,860
Now, here's the thing.

106
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,620
Not not the way they say take the most patriots, which are idiots.

107
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,500
You take down the system by using everything that it has in there.

108
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,620
Just do it.

109
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,960
Like, for example, attorneys do not know any law at all.

110
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,060
Guaranteed.

111
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,520
There's very little exception.

112
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,200
Now, let's talk about the exception.

113
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:43,000
If you're one of the exceptional attorneys, not exceptional, but exceptions that do know

114
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,680
law and your colleagues find out that you're studying law, you can get rule 11 on your

115
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,020
ass.

116
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,440
You know what rule 11 is.

117
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,120
Look it up.

118
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,240
But anyway, and you will end up working selling cars.

119
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,340
Now, some people think it could be used cars or new cars.

120
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:04,080
But I've seen attorneys leave the field and they always go to selling cars used or new.

121
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:11,940
How come it is that it seems like everything is a Section 11, Chapter 11, Rule 11 that

122
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:12,940
puts you out of business?

123
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,200
Is that a coincidence or is it just me?

124
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:23,300
Because I notice whether it's the military or it's, you know, the financial is another

125
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,000
one.

126
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,140
But I'm just saying there's a whole thing about that.

127
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:30,500
Everything that puts you out of business, though, you have to do it under the 11th and everything

128
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,800
that puts you really there's others.

129
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,800
But yeah, I get what you're saying.

130
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:37,200
There's also about a decade ago, people seeing 11s all the time show up.

131
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:43,400
I mean, even the punitive stuff in the military, you go under Section 11, you're done, you

132
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:43,620
know.

133
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:43,980
Right.

134
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,300
Right.

135
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:44,700
Yeah.

136
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,520
All right.

137
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:45,720
Anyway.

138
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,000
Sorry.

139
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,620
I just noticed.

140
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:46,880
Yeah.

141
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,680
No, no, it's fine.

142
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:47,900
So.

143
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,160
So, yeah.

144
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,720
I want to get into something in chat.

145
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,220
A little segue.

146
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,000
Let me just open it up.

147
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,740
Now, I do read the chat every three days or four days, but I'm not writing in there because

148
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:02,320
it seems like everything that that I do, other than what I'm doing, seems to take forever.

149
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,760
So I don't spend time answering emails.

150
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,960
I don't spend time writing in chat.

151
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:07,880
I see.

152
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,100
I see what's going on, though.

153
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,720
I try to keep eyes and ears, you know, or someone say, how's it going?

154
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,600
Would you read the chat?

155
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,400
Let me know if anything addresses me.

156
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:22,240
But there's a fellow in the chat, or gal, I think it's a fellow, Sojourner Sleuth, he's

157
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,480
a New Yorker, New Yorker, right?

158
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,760
And he gave a bunch of stuff in there.

159
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:31,460
One of the questions, just the latter question, well, he talked about walking through Union

160
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:36,640
Square and someone got a flash of consciousness upgrade at 14th Street and 4th Avenue.

161
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,020
I guess 4th Avenue was the old Lafayette Street.

162
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,900
That's where the L was.

163
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:45,720
But I really like the 14th Street, Union Square, you know, Farmer's Market and all that.

164
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,520
I lived on 11th and 3rd.

165
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,300
Is that the L that went over to Bayonne or is that the other one?

166
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:50,960
That's still there.

167
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:51,480
OK.

168
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,260
It's still there.

169
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,000
It's a real Farmer's Market.

170
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:54,420
Yeah.

171
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,140
It used to connect to Bayonne, though.

172
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,060
The elevated train connected to Bayonne.

173
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,820
Oh, the train.

174
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:59,120
Yeah.

175
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,000
No, no.

176
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,380
The 4th Street, it wasn't.

177
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,340
It went up to 34th or 23rd.

178
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:05,940
It's pretty short.

179
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,840
But they tore it down in the 30s and sent the steel to Japan.

180
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:10,420
Right.

181
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,240
And then they threw it back at the Americans 10 years later.

182
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:14,920
OK.

183
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,240
Sorry.

184
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,660
But, you know, that's fine.

185
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,420
He talks about also the George Washington.

186
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:18,800
OK.

187
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,920
George Washington was known as the general.

188
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:27,580
If you read private writings of the revolutionary era, the American Revolutionary Era, and they

189
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,900
mentioned the general, the general, right?

190
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,840
There's referring to JW, GW, right?

191
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,240
Yes.

192
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:34,340
Yes.

193
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:34,500
Always.

194
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:41,480
So from two sources, one is David Barrow, who does the lawful money, the saving to

195
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,360
suitors group.

196
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,140
He mentioned it.

197
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,440
And also about a decade before that, I used to go to something called the Saturday Morning

198
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,120
Breakfast Club.

199
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,920
It was a bunch of old farts, World War Two vets talking about how the country's on a

200
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,460
bad foot.

201
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,600
This is around the year 2000.

202
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,640
And how they're going to make it better.

203
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,960
And, you know, we should be following the Constitution, which, by the way, I didn't know it doesn't

204
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,520
apply to them.

205
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:10,700
But anyway, they talked about that George Washington had died in the war, frozen.

206
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,640
Now, the Battle of Brooklyn was in the summer.

207
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:18,280
So the first that winter, they were being chased around Brooklyn, chased around Manhattan.

208
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:18,800
Right.

209
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,240
All this.

210
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,280
He was something happened.

211
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,620
I don't think it was an assassination.

212
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,500
I don't quite remember all the details of the circus.

213
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,420
It went back and forth.

214
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,780
I didn't have that much interest in it.

215
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,460
He died.

216
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:34,280
And if he was found dead, frozen, solid, and they buried him right there on Montague Street

217
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:40,620
in Brooklyn and Brooklyn Heights, there's a memorial there to not just to George Washington,

218
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,760
but the Revolutionary War.

219
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,820
And he's buried under it.

220
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,100
So all you got to do is go there with a shovel.

221
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,940
Now, I think and there's some very cryptic as a plaque there has some cryptic things

222
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,440
in it, too.

223
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,520
OK, the whole thing was to keep the morale high.

224
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:00,200
So they got this poor sucker who looked just like him, but didn't have any teeth in his

225
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,580
mouth.

226
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,280
So the biggest priority was to get teeth in this guy's mouth so they could pass him off

227
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,880
as GW, George Washington.

228
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:13,200
That's why he's the only president in history whose medical concern or dental concerns have

229
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,080
ever been brought up.

230
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,440
So they give him the uniform that his wife got for him.

231
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,620
And oh, crap.

232
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,220
We got to put teeth in his mouth.

233
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,460
He walks like him, looks like him, probably smelled like him, but he didn't have teeth

234
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:22,800
in his mouth.

235
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,340
So the biggest concern is we got to get teeth in this guy's mouth.

236
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:25,620
OK.

237
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:26,840
Yeah.

238
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,300
And when they brought it, you know, there's also stories that George Washington freaked

239
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,980
out when they went to the Masonic Lodge and they bled him, his doctor bled him to death.

240
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,480
That wasn't George Washington.

241
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,040
George Washington was already dead and gone.

242
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,420
He was the guy playing George Washington, right?

243
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:45,180
That was brought to the Masonic Lodge and said, what the WTF is going on here?

244
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:45,480
Right.

245
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,480
Freaked out.

246
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,960
Back then they were doing more hardcore rituals.

247
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:49,220
Yeah.

248
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,660
I wonder if that guy knew even what the hell was going on, you know, or did they just say,

249
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,840
hey, look, we're going to hook you up with something for do do this and we'll hook you

250
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,100
up.

251
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,080
I mean, did they really let him in on it or.

252
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,000
I don't know.

253
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,600
But here the story was that it's all a fraud and it's true.

254
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:02,940
OK.

255
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,240
OK.

256
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,420
If you advertise you have the freest neighborhood or the freest city or the freest country in

257
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:13,580
the world, you're going to attract just as many criminal scumbags as you are people who

258
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,340
want a fresh start in that kind of situation.

259
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:15,680
Right.

260
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,460
Oh, always.

261
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:16,660
Yeah.

262
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,180
So the people who want to be honest, good people are not going to think of coming over here

263
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:21,960
and taking over.

264
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,300
So but at the same time, you attracted the biggest scumbags in the world.

265
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:31,360
I mean, the people left from the Vatican, people left from various underground groups to come

266
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,980
here and, you know, hide their way.

267
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,140
That's what the McCarthyism was about.

268
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,380
It wasn't just about communism.

269
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:44,440
It was all these were these people coming from that that are extremely Jewish and extremely

270
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,120
dedicated to secret societies and changing their names and all that.

271
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:48,940
Right.

272
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,680
So McCarthyism was correct.

273
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,800
He was like, we're losing.

274
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,040
We're going to lose our country finally here with this.

275
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,380
It's all infiltrated.

276
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:56,660
Right.

277
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,880
It's kind of like I knew a sniper for the Mexican government.

278
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,380
And we once talked about when it was even before Obama came in.

279
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,480
But just around that time, a lot of people were worried about immigration stuff.

280
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:08,720
Right.

281
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,780
It was a big immigration thing then also.

282
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,060
And I said, Armando, did I just mention his name?

283
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:15,460
Yes.

284
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,140
I said, what do you think will happen if Mexico and America go to war?

285
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:23,420
I said, America will lose in 24 hours because we already have almost half a million military

286
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,460
people here in the United living here.

287
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:33,560
I said, you think they're mowing lawns and working in tire shops or flipping burgers

288
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,380
and diners?

289
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,280
They're all military.

290
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,700
You know what I mean?

291
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,840
So like like a sleeper cells.

292
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:41,420
Right.

293
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,500
Smart strategy.

294
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,260
Look, I don't need to send an army.

295
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:44,900
It's already there.

296
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,100
It's already here.

297
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:46,260
Yeah.

298
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,120
They're trained, you know.

299
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,640
So and they just sit here and they live normal, quote, unquote, normal lives and they go back

300
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,160
to Mexico.

301
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:57,020
I mean, that's exactly how a mob expands into like they go, oh, gee, how did the mob get

302
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,180
from this state to this state?

303
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,080
Just like that overnight?

304
00:12:59,220 --> 00:12:59,800
No, they didn't.

305
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,140
What they did is they sent a bunch of guys in.

306
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,460
They went doing business, didn't advertise who they were.

307
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:10,880
And it turns out all these guys actually know each other, you know, and then somebody

308
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,780
just kind of flips a switch and says, OK, now declared it's ours.

309
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:19,360
And yeah, it's the mob tactics is the same tactics as everyone else's.

310
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,700
Exactly. So anyway, yeah, go ahead.

311
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,500
So you were saying, yeah, they would take you overnight.

312
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,980
All right. Well, hey, is that all that was in the chat or was there any more?

313
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,180
Oh, other miscellaneous stuff.

314
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,720
But I think that's all for now.

315
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,900
So I'll go back and see what I could reference.

316
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,540
Anything. I mean, there's a cryptic thing about inventing as I wrote.

317
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,620
You all got a heads up on that last sonic.

318
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,780
And I guess that was sonic.

319
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,480
This is one, two, three. So it's probably one, two.

320
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:49,060
Oh, I don't know. I don't know what I was getting into.

321
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,280
But yeah.

322
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,360
So if Van Diemen, Van Diemen's land, if he can expand on it, that'd be great.

323
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,460
What the heads up was.

324
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,620
Yeah. Because I think I'm always giving a heads up.

325
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,720
I didn't think one specific thing was a heads up.

326
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,680
Why say it now? So clarify.

327
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,500
I'm thinking it might have been the one with the, you know, look, this is the way the

328
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,780
robot actually works.

329
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,540
And, you know, you were talking about with the the shots.

330
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,020
No, I think that. Yeah.

331
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,540
Was that before or after? I think, yeah, that might have been it.

332
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,940
That was the last one. It's all simple, very simple.

333
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,420
And, you know, you were talking about, well, look, if you just remotely make this

334
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,520
thing unfold, boom, it expands too much.

335
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,200
And therefore you have, you know, it's like, oh, yeah, right.

336
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,280
It's a slap against the cell that it's next to.

337
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,420
Right. Right. So I'm not articulating it as well.

338
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:35,920
But I'm just saying there's a huge heads up because nobody's saying that at all.

339
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,160
Something will double its size inside of you.

340
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,400
Right. What is it? Right.

341
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,060
It's clearly going to cause a disruption.

342
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,060
And gee, what what is a aneurysm?

343
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,540
Blah, blah, blah. All these different things.

344
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,520
They call it at the same. It's a bursting blood vessels.

345
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,820
And how are these blood vessels magically bursting?

346
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,120
Well, that can also be done radionically.

347
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,240
Like if they have your signature biosignature, they can do it.

348
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,660
They can create these conditions in you radionically.

349
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,820
Like Ruth drowned like Brown, but with a D drown.

350
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,380
Someone's in water. She was able.

351
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,360
She had a she radionic.

352
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,680
So Trevor James Constable took a lot of her writings and made them public.

353
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,900
She had a client who was going to travel.

354
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,380
She checked him out. He had a toothache.

355
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,800
She's go on your trip. Come back.

356
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,840
We'll take care of it on his trip.

357
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,700
He calls her, says it's really hurting.

358
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,760
She goes, let me look at it.

359
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,700
So he's somewhere in Europe and she's somewhere in Jersey, I think,

360
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:33,400
or Connecticut. And she takes an X-ray of his mouth while he's in Europe.

361
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,320
And she's in New Jersey using radionics.

362
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,580
And actually, she she developed it on X-ray paper,

363
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:43,760
but it was basically using radionics, basically coils and resonance.

364
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,260
Right. Witness pads.

365
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,460
OK, how it works. You could look up radionics, how it works.

366
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,780
It's sympathetic vibration. Right.

367
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:55,640
OK, so they can trigger your any heart attacks

368
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,260
and aneurysms that could trigger remotely.

369
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,440
Donald Marshall talked about this. Yes.

370
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:04,200
I've said many times, if you the reality of what's really going on

371
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,420
is weirder and crazier than anything you hear on the Internet.

372
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,080
So if we hear something really bizarre and crazy and filter it

373
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,520
and see if it doesn't put out by them. Right.

374
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,420
No, I mean, yeah, make no mistake.

375
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,980
Look, the old trope of having to wear tinfoil hat. Right.

376
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,680
Why were people doing that?

377
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,340
Because they were trying to block the microwaves.

378
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,980
Yeah, that was back in the day. Yeah, that was a long time ago.

379
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,900
But still, Delgado showed that in the 60s. Yeah, yeah.

380
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,420
But you do that. Yeah, exactly.

381
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,880
But it existed before that.

382
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,480
I'm just saying that that's how that trope came about,

383
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,180
is you had to block the microwave somehow.

384
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,860
And make no mistake, again, AM radio in and of itself

385
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,480
is a mild microwave signal. Oh, yeah.

386
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,640
Oh, yeah. It's a radius.

387
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:47,460
And it's the real it's the various transducers give you different fluctuations.

388
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,100
Right. So microwave is a smaller wave.

389
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,640
You know, it's not that small.

390
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,700
It's about an inch. Right.

391
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,900
Where the radio, the AM could be 30 feet. Right.

392
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,000
So but still, it has various implications

393
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,600
because you have quarter wave theory, which is the most efficient.

394
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,540
But that's the thing in the old days when we had, you know,

395
00:17:03,579 --> 00:17:05,260
the crystal radios and everything. Right.

396
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:08,400
If you tuned to AM radio, you could possibly be hearing AM radio

397
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,640
four or five states away.

398
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,839
No problem, even though it's only supposed to broadcast in,

399
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,099
you know, their area or whatever.

400
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,300
If you use a fire hydrant, which is really well-grounded,

401
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,140
you could pick up China, China radio.

402
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,240
Right. I mean, you could see a shortwave tuning in.

403
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,380
But that's all just perturbations in the ether.

404
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:31,000
You know, transducers, you know, transducers like a speaker cone.

405
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,280
But instead, you know, it's moving at such a high frequency

406
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,960
that that ripple effect goes through.

407
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:36,900
And we're sensitive to that.

408
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,260
Fortunately, we're not that sensitive as many of the new agers

409
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,940
and alternative people say we are.

410
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,360
We're not that sensitive to it.

411
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,620
What makes us what's damaging is when it's pulsing at a specific rate.

412
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,060
Well, my point is that these things are traveling around all the time.

413
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:51,960
They always have been.

414
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,540
And even, you know, people talk about, oh, the cell towers.

415
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,580
Oh, you're crazy because, you know, these all these waves traveling around.

416
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,420
You are being hit with them.

417
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,220
Most of the time that you don't notice them because they're not.

418
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,340
Yeah, but it's radiation.

419
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,280
It's like, for example, I know people that work on nukes, submarines. Right.

420
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,560
And they have all this elaborate equipment that's been developed

421
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,520
by Department of Energy.

422
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,860
By the way, the biggest, baddest quote, unquote

423
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,880
air quote government agency is the DOE Department of Energy.

424
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,420
Not the CIA, not this, not the IRS, whatever.

425
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,340
It's the Department of Energy.

426
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,800
Anybody who has any dealings in military or that

427
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,400
well, knows what I'm saying is true, but it's not popularized on the Internet.

428
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,040
Right. The CIA, FBI, the logistical,

429
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,920
you know, the judicial executive.

430
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,880
No, it's the deal.

431
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,860
He is the most powerful agency in this country.

432
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:45,940
And it's not tell it's not, you know, known as such.

433
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,940
But anyway, people I know that worked on nukes, submarines,

434
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,140
they have all this elaborate equipment to see if the reactors are leaking. Right.

435
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:55,340
And then, you know, the equipment is here to measure

436
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,600
leaky reactors, very sensitive, whatever.

437
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,440
But they found the most reliable thing

438
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,760
to see if there was a leaky reactor is when it was docked.

439
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:08,460
If there were any, they looked at a clock and say, what time did you dock?

440
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,300
What time is it now?

441
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,300
And if an hour passes and all the flies disappear,

442
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,780
there's a leaky reactor, meaning all the flies, meaning like flies,

443
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,520
like, you know, the flies that that fly on shit, right?

444
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,560
Insects. OK, right, right, right.

445
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,600
So if you know, so if you're in a dock area

446
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,420
and there's a nuclear like San Diego's got a big naval port.

447
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:30,480
But anyway, if you walk on the dock near one of these ships or something

448
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,780
and you see all the flies are gone, no flies in the hot summer. Right.

449
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,360
That's a leaky reactor. I wouldn't stand around.

450
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,480
So that's something that you don't read about.

451
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,520
You just figure out, share that.

452
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,640
Speaking of sharing, I want to get into something that I haven't really discussed,

453
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,100
but I've alluded to, you know, with all the energy work, the health work and stuff.

454
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:53,940
You know, OK, how to get fit, because I know personally,

455
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:59,560
I mean, I'm pretty fit for my shape, for my age and the type of body that I have.

456
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,080
I'm not a mesomorph.

457
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:06,220
I'm more of like a thin mesomorph for people are naturally muscular.

458
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,780
What happens when they get older?

459
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,400
They get flabby and they fall apart.

460
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,440
Look at the ex bodybuilders, right?

461
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,980
So you want to be more on the fit.

462
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,140
Well, I have a more of a thin frame,

463
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,380
but I can develop muscle very quickly. Right.

464
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,440
So I always tell people, you know, in 30 to 60 days,

465
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,880
I can get in the best shape I've ever been in in my life.

466
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,500
And anyone can. And this is how you do it.

467
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,260
And I've been talking about this to people on and off my whole life.

468
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,680
Well, actually, more like the past 30 years, you know, as a fitness coach,

469
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,180
you know how to get in shape and all that.

470
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:41,400
Like one thing I have not gone back to is one of the emails a fellow sent me.

471
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,960
He works in the cycling industry.

472
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,580
And I think he knows who Eddie Merck says now.

473
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,700
And I'm not being sarcastic.

474
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,620
It's just like, please, people do your research.

475
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:56,340
But, you know, one of the questions in that email I didn't go go over is,

476
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,260
how do you, you know, excel yourself?

477
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,100
How do you excel on being on a bicycle performance wise?

478
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,900
And it's just did you do it all the time?

479
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,260
I'll give a quick example.

480
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,600
I was really into cycling. I was dissuaded from it.

481
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,700
Then I didn't know what to do in Manhattan in the early 80s.

482
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,020
I became a bicycle messenger.

483
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,940
So that means I was on.

484
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:18,640
And I'm not one of these guys that has a Toys R Us bike with sneakers.

485
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:22,920
I went out and got the best track bike I could afford and the best cycling gear

486
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,880
right away and got on the bike.

487
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,720
And I was on the bike between eight and nine hours a day, every day,

488
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,640
five days a week.

489
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,860
And aggressive riding, aggressive riding, not just tooling around.

490
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,740
And I found that in three months of doing that, I was in better shape

491
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:43,460
and fitness and skill level as people who were training to be pro cyclists

492
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,500
that were doing it for three or four years

493
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:49,600
because they were not doing it eight hours a day every day.

494
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,980
Right. They had jobs.

495
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,600
They had other things right to do. Right.

496
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,140
So I found that you just do it a lot like there's a there's Dan Pena.

497
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,260
I don't know if people know him.

498
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,400
It's funny. He calls people morons, but he's a moron himself.

499
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,940
That's kind of ironic.

500
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:10,320
But he talks about people go to him for encouragement.

501
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,760
So there's one guy that came to him in England.

502
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,680
He was an archer shooting arrows, right?

503
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,120
Bow and arrow sport.

504
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,000
And he was a skinny guy.

505
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,420
He always finished in the top 20, top 30.

506
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,560
Never, never even close to being contender.

507
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,340
And he says, what do I do to become a better archer?

508
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,600
He says, well, how many arrows are you shooting a day?

509
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,920
He says 50 to 100 to shoot 500 hours a day.

510
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,460
And you'll be the best champion in the country in a year.

511
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,500
Now, the guy was obviously you try to do that.

512
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,200
Your fingers are going to start bleeding, right?

513
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:51,760
At first. And yeah, and if you know, and he he got up to the point

514
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,780
where he was able to pull 140 pound bow, even though he only weighed 130 pounds.

515
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,780
Right. And he did win the championship.

516
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,560
He became a first place in England.

517
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,300
He got a hell of a callous on at least one hand doing that.

518
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,740
Of course. Of course.

519
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,320
So the same thing happens with the cycling.

520
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,940
What happened was I jumped on the bike.

521
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,620
The first week was just living hell, living hell.

522
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,240
The rashes and the blisters and everything.

523
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,460
It was just living hell.

524
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,320
By the second week, you started recovering.

525
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,260
Then a new set of things came.

526
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,220
OK, that is not the way to get into fitness.

527
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,520
But it is the way to become great at something and reach the top of the field.

528
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,200
You know, like you couldn't get any better than that.

529
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,360
Right. If you do something a lot and do it every day,

530
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,760
you're going to get good at it. Right.

531
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,000
So what what do I say to go back how I started?

532
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,080
How do I get the best fitness in 30 to 60 days?

533
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,720
If you have the body type, in other words, where you're inclined to be athletic,

534
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:52,700
more of a not a very lean, OK, very lean person

535
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,500
is someone with a very weak chin, very triangular face,

536
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,360
kind of bulgy eyes. Right.

537
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,100
That's a very lean that type of person.

538
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,780
When they get ill, they catch a cold. It takes forever to heal.

539
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,020
If it's a female, she has her period.

540
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,440
It's all month long, not just two weeks. Right.

541
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:13,080
You know, if they have an allergy, it's like six months to get rid of it.

542
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,340
You know, they don't heal well.

543
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,260
You know, very lean person.

544
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,200
I see this very often.

545
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,860
It's like I'll run into someone and I'll say that person's very lean.

546
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,900
It's like, what do you mean? I say, watch this.

547
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,980
When you get a cold, it's real hard to recover. Right.

548
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:25,780
And I'm like, yeah.

549
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,320
And if you have, you know, striking resemblance to a rodent,

550
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,360
maybe in their appearance, yeah, sort of. Yeah, that's right.

551
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,600
Yeah, exactly. Very similar.

552
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,020
There's other yin features as ones that it's inverted

553
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:39,700
where you have a very wide chin and a narrow like a pinhead.

554
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:44,540
Then the ears are very set back, not forward as another yin constitution.

555
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:48,000
This is called phrenology, where you face reading. Right.

556
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,100
But anyway, yeah.

557
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,140
But that point that you made, yes, is a very.

558
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,480
But you can also be young.

559
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,500
You have to look at the entire character also and the rest of the body.

560
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:00,700
Hmm. So if you have a proponent to being flexible,

561
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:05,120
being quick at recovery, you know, if you sprain an ankle or catch a cold,

562
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,940
whatever, you can recover quickly. This is for you.

563
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,420
So this is what's done.

564
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,220
There's people that talk about building muscle and going to the gym.

565
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,760
Everybody seems like they have to go to the gym, avoid the gym completely,

566
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:17,960
completely unnecessary.

567
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:22,040
It's the gym has become like playing golf in business.

568
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:26,020
Right. And certain businesses or whatever in business culture,

569
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,780
you play golf with the boss. You made it. Right.

570
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:32,800
So, well, after all, they take three, four minutes of the presidential debate

571
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,260
the other night to argue over their golf scores. So, yeah, good.

572
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:40,600
OK, so right now it's become in the past few decades going to the gym.

573
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,900
Right. Even corporations, they have corporate gyms. Right.

574
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,120
So that's the new thing now.

575
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,740
So you don't need any of that. This is how you do it.

576
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,100
OK. Basically, you use your own body weight

577
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,500
and you do the basic calisthenics, which are push ups.

578
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,880
Push ups, sit ups, pull ups.

579
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,860
Now, this is how you get back into.

580
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,020
So right now, I consider myself to be out of shape.

581
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,160
I drink a gallon of coffee a day, one and a half pack of cigarettes a day

582
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,980
and about 80 to 100 grams of kratom a day. Right.

583
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,180
All of that should have killed me a long time ago.

584
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,820
I'm still doing fine, supposedly.

585
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,820
So you include squat thrusts and jumping jacks, too, and all that kind of stuff.

586
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,040
Right. Yeah. Not necessary.

587
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:21,000
But you can do that because I'll get into how you develop a very quick fitness level.

588
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,800
So when you're doing, let's say, the easiest thing to

589
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:29,360
show that you can build the most upper body and getting fit is a push up.

590
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:33,420
Now, what's important when you're doing the push up, the pull up,

591
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,800
not so much to sit up because you might have to get up.

592
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,840
That's fine, is the negative resistance.

593
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,260
So when you're doing a push up and you're out of shape,

594
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,940
you can let yourself down, but you can't push yourself up.

595
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,760
Don't worry about it.

596
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:50,340
It's the it's the resistance, the negative resistance, letting yourself down.

597
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,980
Right. Not pushing yourself up.

598
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,100
That builds the most muscle.

599
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:58,680
So if you're out of shape, go ahead and try to do a push up.

600
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,760
And as you're letting yourself down, you know, your arms are shaking

601
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,540
because you don't have the joint strength. Right.

602
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,260
And your muscles aren't used to pulling on the joints and you vibrating and shaking.

603
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:10,680
Soon as you hit the ground, you know, your feet, you know, you're flat.

604
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,900
You try to lift yourself up.

605
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,320
If you're having a hard time, don't bother.

606
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,640
Sit up, get into that position and just let yourself down.

607
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,600
A pull up would be similar.

608
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:22,540
So let's say you grab the bar and you try to pull yourself up.

609
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,260
You're like, oh, shit, your back is cracking.

610
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,960
You're really shaking again. Can't do it. That's fine.

611
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,640
What you do is get yourself a little step stool.

612
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:33,740
Get on the step stool or short ladder that has the height of where the pull up is

613
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:36,660
and then just move it aside and let yourself down.

614
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,860
So right. So your negative resistance don't.

615
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,320
And if you can't pull yourself up, don't worry about it.

616
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,780
Grab the step stools, take a few steps up, get into the position

617
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:49,140
where the pull up is fully up and then let yourself down.

618
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,140
The negative resistance will build 40 percent more.

619
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,200
Strength at 40 percent faster.

620
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:58,460
Now, if you find yourself, let's say, doing pull ups, sit ups and push ups,

621
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,460
even just doing the negative part. Right.

622
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,980
Right. You're not pushing yourself.

623
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,580
It's the negative is the part where the right.

624
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,660
So each exercise is a different movement for the negative part.

625
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,720
You're not pulling your weight or lifting your weight at all.

626
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,480
You're just allowing your weight to go down.

627
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,060
That is that will develop more muscle.

628
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,280
Now, this is what happened with me.

629
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,740
What I found out, I started doing some push ups and sit ups and I'm out of breath.

630
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,360
Right. So I can't do the physical work that will tone the musculature

631
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,280
and the skeletal and all that.

632
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,940
I can't do it because I'm out of breath.

633
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,940
So that means that you have the first exercises I explained.

634
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,320
We're building up the tonality of the muscles and the joint strength. Right.

635
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,500
Or muscle strength and joint strength also.

636
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:45,540
But if you're running out of breath, that means it's a total separate regimen,

637
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:49,120
which is strictly cardiovascular, cardiopulmonary.

638
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,240
So you need to get your cardiopulmonary in shape first.

639
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:56,400
If you find yourself going out of breath where you can't do enough of these

640
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,520
negative or just full push ups.

641
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:01,740
Now, someone say I can do the push ups just fine, then do them.

642
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,920
But don't push yourself to where it's painful.

643
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,740
Right. You just do it until you feel like you can just get up and continue.

644
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,540
You don't do it to where you're struggling.

645
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:14,200
In other words, if you can do three push ups and fluid motion

646
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,440
or three pull ups and fluid motion on the fourth one, you kind of get stuck.

647
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,740
Don't force yourself.

648
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:23,540
Do not force yourself, because that will create a different type of situation

649
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,420
in your body. Just stop. Don't worry.

650
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,140
In two days, you'll do that fourth one or whatever it is.

651
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,740
But if you find yourself going out of breath, that's cardiopulmonary,

652
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,340
cardiovascular.

653
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,380
Don't worry about the sit ups, the pull ups or the push ups.

654
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,420
What you do is three times a day.

655
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:42,480
If you can go for a brisk jog, not a run and not a walk, but a brisk jog.

656
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:45,540
It could be when you start getting into shape.

657
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,420
Don't go too far away.

658
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,880
Right. So in other words, instead of running around the block,

659
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,480
you run down the block and back to your where you live.

660
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:59,160
So in case you run out of steam, right, you don't have to walk back. Right.

661
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,120
Slowly. So you just run that right until you find out what test,

662
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,000
what distance you need, because you don't want to waste time either.

663
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:09,400
But you do this three times a day, every day.

664
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,860
There's no rest day when it comes to what I'm saying.

665
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,800
You know, people, when they go to the gym and they do fitness,

666
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,660
they go, oh, I work out. This is my rest day.

667
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:20,400
That's bullshit. That's that's like set up for failure type.

668
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,380
That's like for the typical moron. Right.

669
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,640
They'll give you some reason that they got from some medical book.

670
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,860
That's not how it works at all.

671
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,960
When you get to a high level of physical development.

672
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,620
Yes, there is a rest day because they're working on an extreme level. Right.

673
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,420
And there's many more reasons than just, you know, letting the body heal.

674
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,860
But what you do is every day you do a gentle effort.

675
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:46,520
Actually, it's a concerted effort to do push ups, pull ups and sit ups.

676
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,660
Don't worry about the pull ups if you don't have a bar.

677
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,960
And and if you find yourself going out of your breath.

678
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,800
So let's say you can do nine push ups

679
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,240
fairly in succession where you're not getting stuck. Right.

680
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,000
So so you try to do the tenth one.

681
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,240
It's like, I can't quite do it.

682
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,780
That's right. Just roll over. Get up.

683
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,840
Don't force yourself with the show on TV.

684
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,300
We're going to yell at you. Do it. Do it.

685
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,000
None of that. None of that. No pain, no gain.

686
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,680
None of that's all bullshit. It's all bullshit.

687
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:19,080
Yeah. If you follow that stuff, you'll you'll be like a typical moron

688
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,420
and you'll say, why am I not? It's better at the gym.

689
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:26,180
What I'm telling you is I assure you, if you have a fairly decent constitution

690
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:29,060
where you what they call your God given whatever.

691
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:34,220
And in 30 days, you could be in the best shape of your life. Right.

692
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:38,260
I mean, in 60 days, I can get my body where I'd be on the cover of like,

693
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,820
you know, senior GQ or something. Right.

694
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,900
I'm serious. You can get in that good shape. Very fast.

695
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:48,380
It doesn't matter what your body type is, as long as you have quick recovery.

696
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,200
Like I said, if you're very lean individual,

697
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:56,080
you know, if you get hit with a winter cold or a flu or an injury

698
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,420
and it takes you forever to recover or heal from that, you're

699
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,940
this is not going to work for you. Right.

700
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,820
So this is what I'm saying will work for about 75 percent of the people,

701
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,300
maybe 50 percent of the people.

702
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:11,500
So just doing basic, I would call it basic calisthenics.

703
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,700
Don't worry about the jumping jacks

704
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,980
because the jumping jacks and other stuff that you mentioned earlier.

705
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,320
Yes, I'm not dismissing it, but that's more in between

706
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,020
the cardio and the weight. Right. That's different.

707
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,640
The jumping jacks were called the star exercise back in the days back,

708
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,980
you know, maybe turn of the century.

709
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:30,820
So of the previous century, when I started the century, I'm thinking 20th century.

710
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,880
Now you're talking to someone. They mean this century. Right. Exactly.

711
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:38,200
So, yeah. So basically, don't there's not that like you said,

712
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,540
the no pain, no gain is total rubbish. Right. Don't push yourself.

713
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,640
Focus on the negative side.

714
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,340
So it'll look think about how weird it is.

715
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,640
A lot of these parks have these

716
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:50,200
places where you could do these exercises like a run.

717
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,120
They have different par.

718
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,680
You know, they have bars for doing push ups.

719
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,860
Oh, you're going to do a push up, you know, whatever.

720
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,660
You have different heights. Right. Do the high one.

721
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,520
Get go get some of those push up bars that you hold on to or in a parking lot.

722
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,800
Don't you know, curb where dogs piss or something?

723
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,560
Don't do that. But if there's a curb, you know, where those parking blocks

724
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,440
where the cars pull up to, you could do it on something like that.

725
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,820
You get yourself a four by four, six by six railroad type.

726
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,920
Put it somewhere under your couch or behind the door and use that

727
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,100
for doing push ups is fine.

728
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,780
It's not what is going to get you fit is not how many full push ups you do,

729
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,540
but how many negative push ups you do.

730
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,760
Meaning letting yourself down on the push up is what's going to build

731
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,740
the strength immediately.

732
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:34,000
40 percent faster than just doing the entire push up.

733
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,160
So it looks like imagine I was saying going to a park

734
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,280
where they offer those pull up bars and you bring a little stool with you

735
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,700
and you get up on the stool, you get up in the full closed

736
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,680
pull up position and you just let yourself down.

737
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,960
Then you get back on the stool, pull yourself up on the stool

738
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,460
and just letting yourself down on the pull up.

739
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,220
Don't worry about pulling yourself up.

740
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:56,140
This is actually if you're overweight and your joints aren't that strong,

741
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:59,800
there's no way you're going to pull up 300 pounds or 275. Right. Right.

742
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:05,020
But if you get on the stool and let yourself down gently, right, you can do it.

743
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,960
And that's going to build a tremendous amount of fitness very, very quickly.

744
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,800
Forty percent more.

745
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:13,400
So so don't wait.

746
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,840
I mean, I can see that being on one of these YouTube videos.

747
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,820
Look at this guy doing pull ups.

748
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,840
He gets up on a stool, just lets himself down.

749
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,300
Everyone's going to make fun of that, right?

750
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,940
Oh, definitely. Yeah. Yeah.

751
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,760
So don't worry about work.

752
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,540
And OK, so here's the other way to think about it.

753
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,679
Fighting gravity doesn't make you stronger on the plus.

754
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:30,760
You know, so right.

755
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,159
So once you get down on the push up, you get into the finished position.

756
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,219
Now it's time to push yourself up, fighting gravity in the positive way.

757
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:39,380
Don't bother with that.

758
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:41,380
Just let yourself down.

759
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,420
If you're doing the push ups, you can only let yourself down

760
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,679
and you can't push yourself up. Right.

761
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,600
That's fine. Roll over.

762
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,340
No, no pun intended.

763
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,179
If you're that fat, let's say around.

764
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,080
Roll over. Sit up.

765
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,240
Get back into that position.

766
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,700
Just let yourself down.

767
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,320
You can't push yourself up.

768
00:34:59,340 --> 00:34:59,900
Don't worry about it.

769
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,260
Just flop on flop down on the ground.

770
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,800
Roll over, get up and get back into that position.

771
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,460
Do that three, four or five, six times.

772
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:09,980
As many times you could do it before you start feeling like I can't do another one.

773
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,000
Don't force yourself.

774
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:16,080
What that's doing is that you're adapting your body and your muscles

775
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,220
actually react better to that.

776
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,740
Now, if you study how the professional bodybuilding and power training,

777
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:27,460
when you get to a certain max fitness level, yes, you have to break that wall.

778
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,220
Yes, you do. Right.

779
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,580
That's why they're young. Right.

780
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:34,460
But you're not we're talking about how to get really fit in 30 to 60 days.

781
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,880
Not you've been going to the gym for 10 years.

782
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,360
Now you're going to go for Mr. Universe.

783
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:41,940
You have to break through and lift even heavier.

784
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,240
But that's what people take.

785
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,220
That's what people take with. You know, that's all they have.

786
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,340
So someone's going to get fit.

787
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,480
They're going to look at these regimens that are applied to people

788
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,380
who do it professionally.

789
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,820
It doesn't has nothing to do with you or your physiology.

790
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:59,480
So, again, don't worry about the positive resistance.

791
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,480
The negative resistance is what does it.

792
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,920
I'm not saying don't ever do a push up or a pull up ever.

793
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,620
I'm just saying when you first start.

794
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,540
No, at the very beginning. Right.

795
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,680
When you're just. Yeah, yeah.

796
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:11,020
First, first, two, three, four weeks, first month,

797
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,320
you will get so fit so fast and it will show

798
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,160
that if you if let's say you have two people starting off

799
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,860
on similar appearances and fitnesses, I'll see you in two months.

800
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,020
OK, one guy goes to the gym because all the shit they do at the gym.

801
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:25,760
And you do this.

802
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:26,980
Oh, my gosh.

803
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,360
You compare after one month what the the two look like.

804
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,840
The guy goes to the gym, maybe be a little more broad shoulder

805
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,540
and look a little chunkier or whatever, but you will not have the fitness

806
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,940
that you will perfectly match.

807
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,660
In other words, all your muscles working together,

808
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,480
especially when you're working just on negative resistance.

809
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:48,140
So, again, I'm not I'm not saying just do negative resistance,

810
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:51,240
but just do negative resistance to start out to reward yourself

811
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,360
with a very rapid muscle, you know, muscle growth and development

812
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,620
at the very end and at the very beginning.

813
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:59,100
And the very beginning could be the full 30 days. Right.

814
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,200
So but if you find yourself going out of breath,

815
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,880
whether it's the full positive, you know, the positive movement

816
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,020
and the negative movement of either one of those things,

817
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,520
even just push ups would be fine because push ups does contract

818
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,620
the torso as well.

819
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,300
You're using abdominal muscles and that's how you keep your back straight.

820
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,400
Right back in the abdominals the same. Right.

821
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,960
So you can even just do push ups alone if you were to do anything,

822
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,740
because getting a pull up bar could be tricky in many cases.

823
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,140
And sit ups are not comfortable and they don't do much anyway.

824
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,160
So I'm not just saying do the negative part of the resistance,

825
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,600
I'm saying do both, but don't be dissuaded.

826
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,540
Focus just on the negative and you will see the rewards

827
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:40,920
because no one can tout the rewards of the negative resistance only

828
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,860
because no one goes for it. No one does it.

829
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,260
It's like, oh, I call you three push ups.

830
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,840
What about four? It's really hard, but I still try. No, no, no.

831
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:54,020
Right. So I just want to point this out because it's a some one of the things

832
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,120
it's something you can do to just feel like a more like you're going to

833
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:00,040
feel like you've achieved something because well, as we get into the future,

834
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:03,540
when the whole world falls back into barbarism, your physical strength

835
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:06,900
and physical prowess and physical condition will be very important. Right.

836
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,740
They even show it in horror movies or whatever,

837
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:14,020
whenever a crowd of people are running away and it's the fat kid that gets eaten

838
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:17,960
first. Right. Oh, whatever. Yeah. You see. So you don't want, you know,

839
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,260
but what I'm saying, you know,

840
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:23,220
when you're being chased by a bunch of hoodlums that are now cannibalistic

841
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:26,480
warlord gangs. Right. You know, there's an old saying,

842
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:30,480
you don't have to outrun the, you don't have to outrun a bear,

843
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,400
just need to outrun the other guy.

844
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,480
You don't, yeah. You don't have to outrun a bear.

845
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,400
You just got to outrun the slowest guy in the group.

846
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:40,720
Yeah, that's right. Yeah. So yeah, just I need to have, oh, whatever. Yeah.

847
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:45,580
So I'm bringing this up just because it's been coming up lately in my own

848
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,900
personal life. And, and I just wanted to share this.

849
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,520
Cause I never shared it like this because you're not going to find this anywhere.

850
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,560
It's just so stupid. How, once you do this, right?

851
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,260
Once you figure out what I've just said or employ it,

852
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:00,820
you'll feel like you're cheating. You'll feel like you're cheating.

853
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,080
Cause if you've ever tried to get in shape before with a gym or whatever,

854
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:08,300
and you're like, it's so slow. I have to be so careful. It's so hard to do.

855
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,900
And you do this. And in like two weeks,

856
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:13,740
you look tremendous and you feel great in a month.

857
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:18,180
You'll be completely different human being almost. Um, don't force yourself,

858
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:21,360
do the negative resistance, not only do the positive. You can do 10,

859
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,640
20 pushups, the full pushup. Fine.

860
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:27,140
If it gets to like 20 and he can't do it, stop. And if you want to do more,

861
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,740
do the negative only don't push yourself. Okay.

862
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,860
If enough people learn this,

863
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,660
we'll put all the gyms out of business because you'll end up saying,

864
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,620
you go to the gym for a month and I'll go do this for a month.

865
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,760
And you compare like, what the hell are you?

866
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:44,660
It doesn't look like you did anything. And look at me, I'm ripped, right?

867
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:48,020
In 30 days. So I just wanted to share this.

868
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:51,260
Because it's like, my gosh, you know, this information needs to get out there.

869
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:52,820
There you go.
