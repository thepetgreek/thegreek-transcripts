1
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:16,520
Sonic Event 124 and here we go rated Y. Anyway, Greek, how about this? Let's just hit it hard

2
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,680
right off the bat. What is the meaning of life?

3
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,740
Exactly. That's right. You know, hey, you know, some people anyway, we'll get into it.

4
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:31,500
We will try to nan and then I know the meaning of life and you don't. Yeah, that's true. I do.

5
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:38,840
And this is with little exception. And I've been thinking about this for about 25 years.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,460
Well, more than that. 27 years I've been thinking about this because I started taking notes on this

7
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:50,160
in Greek. I have a notepad that it's kind of a diary or just notes and I always write in Greek.

8
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:54,000
You know, if you would have asked me 27 years ago, though, I would have definitely went with

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,440
the be fruitful and multiply kind of idea. Sure, sure. But I have this black book. I have several

10
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,200
like a graph, you know, and, you know, you go to a coffee shop, you leave something, you know,

11
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,960
that people are going to page through it. Right. You know, if you leave it, you forgot how many

12
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,620
times years ago in coffee shops were more popular for me. I sometimes leave something on the table.

13
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:18,900
Right. Oh, yeah. I leave the notebook. I used to love it. Yeah. No, I'll Greek. I would love

14
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,020
doing that. Look, I left tapes on coffee shop tables. I left business cards on coffee.

15
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:27,800
I think everybody leaves stuff on coffee tables. Right. And I even went security,

16
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,360
even when I was at the border coming in from Mexico and they scared the shit out of them.

17
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:39,480
Someone told me they separated us. And every time when we rejoined each person that rejoined,

18
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,020
what the hell did you write in that book? Greek, you're terrified of it. And the next guy comes

19
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:50,900
quick. What the hell was in that book? That's what kept us so long. They had they scanned each page

20
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:59,360
and sent it to a linguist. Right. Nosy, nosy, nosy. So, yeah. Yeah. So I write these things

21
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:06,000
down. And the first notations I had was about 27 years ago. So then I know the meaning of life and

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,740
you don't. Yeah. OK. And I'll tell you what it is now. So you do. OK. Very simple. This is with

23
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:17,940
very little exception. You are here. You're a spiritual being. You're actually a mind.

24
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,660
What I mean by that, there's an old Star Trek where they go to a planet and they find these

25
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,800
glowing globes, very old beings. They transferred out of their bodies into these machines so they

26
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:33,440
don't need a body. And they wanted a body again. Anyway, you're a mind in a body. And because

27
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:39,220
you don't have memory or know where you're from. And believe me, no one's talking about where

28
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:45,400
you're from. Anyway, that's another discussion. Yeah, because everybody talks about arriving.

29
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,840
Everybody talks about arriving here. And they say all the time, you know,

30
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,920
we're a spiritual being. You are heavily. You're OK. Do you know how back in the days

31
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,120
Apple didn't work on Windows and vice versa? Right. Then they had this intermediary system

32
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,560
where you bought an Apple computer. That's right. And it ran Windows. Right. Yep. Because it has

33
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,960
protocols and things like that to do that. The protocols and all those things that are required

34
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:13,860
to be fully sensory in a human body does not allow you to have senses from where you understand and

35
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,740
remember the senses where you're from. And there's so many YouTube people like, well,

36
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,620
we've got memory. No, you're not. No, you don't have memory. You don't have just like you can't

37
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:28,540
jump from the sidewalk to the top of a four story building. So past lives are all bullshit is what

38
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,880
you're saying. Yeah, well, they're not. Well, here's the thing. There's a idea with past lives

39
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:40,040
where, for example, if you die now, you're reborn in ancient Rome because time isn't linear. So the

40
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,540
past lives is bullshit the way they just you could even be reborn before you die. Then if time

41
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:50,500
isn't linear, I mean, I can be right, but you're not. OK, because it's a cyclical. So my Mandelbrot

42
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:56,640
sets earlier. What's happening is in order for your mind to experience what the body can offer,

43
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,760
you cannot access the ideas and memories and things of where you're from.

44
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:07,940
So this happens because it happens in the physical. You don't remember being born.

45
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:12,900
No, you very few people do, because look, and that's a physiological thing. The brain is not

46
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,560
fully developed at that time. So you don't have all of it's a receiver. Yeah, right. Just like

47
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,460
when you have an old ham radio and the dipole is all wrapped up in the box, you plug it in,

48
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:27,060
doesn't work. You stretch out the dipole six feet or whatever, whatever it is, 40 feet,

49
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:30,180
you know, for whatever frequency. And suddenly it works. You fold up the antenna,

50
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:35,420
stops working. Right. OK. Now, that's not the meaning of life. That's the preface.

51
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:41,580
Now, let me just suggest that the operating system, in other words, the sensory system that

52
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:49,380
retains information. Right. Tesla cars, they can give you the car for free and pay you a hundred

53
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:54,120
bucks every time you get on it. You'll still make money because everything that you do

54
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:02,980
and everything that happens around the car via sensors. Right. Is recorded. So when I say sensory,

55
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,740
it's your sensory. Now, whether you remember it or not, I used to have a joke before digital

56
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:13,160
cameras. Everyone's got photographic memory. It's just most people are out of film. Right.

57
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:19,600
OK, so. So, for example, if someone keys if you have a Tesla and someone keys it, that's like

58
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,740
ghetto. I mean, that's city talk. Keys key. Keying a car means you use your key to scratch

59
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:32,440
the person's car. That's usually a malicious act. Right. Right. The Tesla car will pick up that

60
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:38,260
sensor and follow you as best as all the cameras that go around the car can get your image and all

61
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:44,040
that. Right. People don't know that. Now they do. OK, so all these things put together to make you

62
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:51,020
a body and a mind. Now, jokingly, most people have a mind. They just don't know how to use it.

63
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:56,840
That's not jokingly. But will that allow you to access source materials and things like that?

64
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:01,000
You can't. It would really wouldn't work in the situation that we're in right now.

65
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:04,800
So it's like so that's still not the meaning of life. So it's like having a computer that's got

66
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,380
an operating system, but it's not connected to the Internet. So you can't really get at

67
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:13,920
the information outside or you have a computer that you change the operating system and the

68
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,000
new operating system that you're using can't access anything or remembers anything from the

69
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,380
That would be a better analogy because we're talking about going from one realm to another

70
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,600
and the other realm, which is this one cannot access anything from that other realm.

71
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:33,880
Right. It's a total wipe, but it's not a memory wipe. OK, it's an accessible lack of access.

72
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:42,360
Access denied. Access denied is the easiest, most poignant way to put it. So that's why you

73
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,460
have people that supposedly have breakthroughs and all that. But yeah, it doesn't. You notice

74
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:49,800
that these spiritual people, whether it's true or not, that have all these breakthroughs from

75
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,680
the other side that come here. Does it change anything? Does it make any has really helped

76
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:00,120
anyone? No, because it's a completely different world. So then you don't know the meaning of

77
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,200
life. And I do and you will in about a minute. It's very simple. It sounds really sarcastic.

78
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:09,320
The meaning of life in that condition. I had to preface the condition because in order to have

79
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:16,860
good communication, you have to preface and form and discuss. That's the order. Most if you start

80
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,420
discussing without information or practice, like what the hell is he talking about? Right. So,

81
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,660
OK, so I just preface now and now I'm going to inform you and then we'll discuss it. The meaning

82
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:33,740
of life here, as you can see it through history, is for each individual human to waste the time of

83
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:40,380
the one next to them. So if you are a woman and you have a husband, his purpose is to waste your

84
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:46,000
time. If you're if you're a husband and you have a wife, her purpose in life, meaning in life is to

85
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,200
waste your time. If you are going to school, the purpose of the school is to waste your time.

86
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:56,100
And I literally waste your time. In other words, things that can take a minute, take days,

87
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:03,780
pun, no pun intended. Yeah. So. Husband and wife, get it, take a minute. He's really fast anyway.

88
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:13,620
OK, so the minute they said of the member, the minute men anyway. Man, yeah. Yeah. OK. So by

89
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,700
the way, we'll get into why that happens. But that's just it's like, anyway, anxiety. But anyway,

90
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:24,080
everybody's wasting each other's time. Everyone is wasting each other's time.

91
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:32,039
Constantly. If if how many times have you heard? I can't get that person to understand.

92
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:39,080
Right. Or that person won't change or that person doesn't learn or this person's too much like this

93
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:45,360
and this one's not enough like that. OK, from a stoic perspective, you take it all as it comes

94
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,300
and you deal with it within yourself. You don't openly lash out to people or complain or even

95
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:56,060
give advice unless asked. No, but almost anybody can identify that they're irritated with resistance

96
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:00,580
that they meet when they're dealing with somebody or conversing with somebody because they're not.

97
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,760
OK, let's say you have a hire. Let's say you have a hire. You got a coffee shop. You want

98
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:09,980
someone to just clean, empty, clean the tables, empty the garbage, make sure the supplies are

99
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:15,600
for everybody. Right. The chances of that person doing what they're supposed to do is like 10

100
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,660
percent when they first start, even if they've done it for a long time somewhere else, they have

101
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,680
their own way of doing it. So they're going to waste your time. And even when they're there,

102
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,560
they feel like being there is a waste of time because they'd rather be doing something else.

103
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,540
They have to pay the rent. So I can bring this around and every it's a very it's like Greek.

104
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,760
The meaning of life is just to waste everybody else's time. Yes, absolutely. Without a doubt.

105
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:42,420
With very little exception. Let me give the exception before we discuss this. The exception

106
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,200
of those. I'll give you an example, because I was going to say somebody hearing this might

107
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,840
listen to this and say, well, does that mean that you're intentionally wasting all our time

108
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:55,040
as you're speaking to us? I can't help but not to. Yeah, I'm not intentionally doing it. No,

109
00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:01,820
because I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing if it was just like everybody else. OK. And if you want

110
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:06,120
to know what a waste of time is, it's something called alternative media. There's something

111
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:13,640
called mainstream media, voting, university, school, college. Look, when you're in an American

112
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:18,300
school system from K through 12, let's call it let's not call it 13 years. Let's make the math

113
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:26,220
easy. It's 12 years. Yeah. OK, let's make it easy. All right. So you're in school from, let's say,

114
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:33,300
depending on what part of the country you're in, from September to June. Right. And then you take

115
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,880
three months off and you take June off, July, August off back to school in September.

116
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:44,980
The north. OK, in the south, you go from August to May. But yeah. Yeah. And you finish in May. OK,

117
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:50,320
so very simply, you're in there from the morning, let's say eight thirty nine o'clock,

118
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:55,560
sometimes earlier, and you're out at three, five days a week. OK, everything I just mentioned

119
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:00,980
in terms of hours is a thousand hours a year. You could just pencil it out. I'm telling you

120
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:05,240
where I get the thousand hours a year. I just penciled it out for you. Yeah, it's easy because

121
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,640
one hundred and eighty days. OK. And then if you just imagine that it's a minimum of six hours.

122
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:16,740
Right. No, wait, seven hours. So if you go seven hours. Yeah, no problem. Good. It's about a

123
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:21,480
thousand hours per year. It gets there. Yeah, roughly some less, some more. But that's a good

124
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,500
average because we got rid of. So how many years? Twelve. So how many how many hours of education

125
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:34,200
getting twelve thousand hours? Right. I broke down basically the whole program back in 2008,

126
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:40,600
2009 because I was involved in the homeschooling stuff, different states across the union

127
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:48,360
advising. And I figured out that the core material that's taught within twelve thousand hours,

128
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:56,620
I can teach in less than four hundred. Right. So if you do the math, right, if that's if it's

129
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:02,640
ten times, it's four thousand, it's 30 times faster. So I developed a system where actually

130
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,120
you will remember everything. It'll be more, more, more than the core. You know what I mean

131
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,660
by the core programs, right? Yeah, I could get less than four hundred hours. I could teach

132
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:15,800
everything. As a matter of fact, I've done two and a half hours is what it takes. Yeah. I found

133
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,360
out that I could do it even less. And within the four hundred hours, I could take them up to

134
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:25,520
college level, like almost like a bachelor in any subject. And I show them how to do that.

135
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:32,500
Now, if you don't think your time is wasted by something that should be done a certain way,

136
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,880
it can be done 30 times faster and it's not. And how many people are involved in the public

137
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:44,360
school system? Millions. And how many people are noticing enough to make a little bit of

138
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:50,380
it, but no change? OK, everything is about wasting time, wasting time, wasting time.

139
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:56,200
Now, fortunately, your lives are short. Sixty, seventy, eighty nine, even if you go 100 years.

140
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:01,220
OK, let's say I say the average life span, 70. I'm talking about functional. You know,

141
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:07,660
yeah, I mean, I know I know an 80 year old or did he passed away a long time ago? He said he felt

142
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:12,200
better at 80 than he did at 35, which was true. He was kind of sickly all his life. He discovered

143
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:18,060
he was dying. He fine tuned everything. He was in great shape. OK. Right. So what I say,

144
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:24,340
let's say seventy five. Yeah. Yeah. Most people, they say, let my grandma live to 100. Yeah. What

145
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:29,820
kind of life after 90 she had? Right. Not much. So living, you're wasting each other's time.

146
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:36,120
So what does that mean? It means that the level of inefficiency that's built into the type of

147
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:41,080
mind and spirit we have into the physical body that we exist in every culture

148
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:46,960
is not fully compatible. That's why most related religions and spirituality is like,

149
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:51,180
oh, we're just passing through here. When you leave, you'll have a much better situation.

150
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:57,780
So in other words, the mind and body potential, the mind and spirit potential that we have is

151
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:03,400
much greater. Right. It's kind of like much greater than the body that we're in now.

152
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:10,080
It's what we can tune into. So, for example, you take a VW bug and you put a Corvette engine in it.

153
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,980
Yeah, it's going to be fast, but it's also very dangerous because, you know, what's impressive

154
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:19,180
about a fast car is, can it stop? You know, a lot of people used to soup up cars and they

155
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:23,000
couldn't stop. The brakes were terrible. So they crashed. Right. Yeah. And the steering

156
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,740
couldn't handle. Right. That's what I mean. So we have a very poor setup in terms of this.

157
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:33,260
Now, who put it there? I don't know directly, but I could tell you, basically, you can blame

158
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:38,640
the gods to a certain degree. And there's no blame. It's just things are the way they are,

159
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:43,040
because remember, life is really short at being 70 years old, 80 years old. That's a short lifetime

160
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:49,740
to be put into this. Now, the reason why I said that, OK, because there's no struggle in what

161
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:55,900
I'm saying. Now, you either take it or leave it. What I just said, you know, is it is what I said

162
00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:01,800
about the meaning of life is for everyone to waste everybody else's time and people around you,

163
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:06,780
even yourself. OK, let's not even go waste the other person wasting time and you're wasting

164
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:11,660
how many times have you heard someone? I got to play solitaire. I got to play a video game.

165
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,000
I want to watch a movie. I'm bored. You're wasting your own time. You can't help it.

166
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:23,280
That's all a matter of right. OK, so no one knows anything was very little exception,

167
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:28,300
though, about anything. OK. I mean, doctors don't know anything about the human body.

168
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:33,160
Lawyers don't know anything about law on and on and on and on and on and on. Teachers don't know

169
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:37,880
anything about teaching. It goes on every field. Carpenters don't know anything about wood.

170
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:43,080
Right. The great majority, they do not. Now, when you start to get to more of the things that are

171
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:48,680
tactile, like trades and labor, you do have to know more about it because it's going to show

172
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:53,560
really bad. Right. But the professionals, the people that are doing stuff that is not tangible,

173
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:58,760
they know nothing about their field at all. This has been by design and it's been pressed on

174
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:06,440
society big time since 9-11, the whole world. The decree was that anyone that's doing intangibles

175
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:11,980
like politicians, doctors, lawyers, philosophers, professors, all these people that don't produce

176
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:16,760
the produce, they don't produce tangibles, but they produce a lot of billables. Right.

177
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:23,260
Those people are not supposed to know what's going on because of what's called a Freudian slip.

178
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:28,660
Now, if you remember on 9-11, there was a lot like the 9-11 Commission, a lot of Freudian slips.

179
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,620
One guy's being interviewed on the 9-11 Commission. I was like, I can't talk about it.

180
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,780
It's still going on. But the missile that hit the Pentagon, I'm like, what? What did you say? Oh,

181
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:42,540
no, I meant. Right. Right. OK. On and on. Remember the George W. Bush's thing,

182
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:48,100
the bombs that went off in the towers. Right. In the first speech. Right. OK. You're not supposed

183
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:53,000
to know anything. That's why Biden is perfect. Biden is perfect president. I've got no beef with

184
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,440
because he matches the mindset that is designed perfectly. OK, so and, you know, remember when

185
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,859
a society is going to go through a big change, they always put a president or a leader in that's got

186
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:09,339
Alzheimer's or dementia. I don't know if you remember Boris Yeltsin. He was an alcoholic

187
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:14,220
and had dementia for right before they went out. Right. Right. Before Gorbachev. Right. Right.

188
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:19,819
Well, right before the. Yeah. Well, Yeltsin came in after Gorbachev because Yeltsin.

189
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:25,140
Was it Yeltsin? OK, which one was a total demented? No, it wasn't Yeltsin. It was before

190
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:32,360
Gorbachev. The guy before him also had white hair. Anyway, Brezhnev or whatever. No,

191
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,640
no. That was an old dude. Right. Brezhnev was a Brezhnev. He must have been in power for at

192
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,340
least 30 years. Anyway, one of these things. Anyway, it doesn't matter. Forget about the

193
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:48,380
political scene. The U.S. is a corporation. Title 28, Section 3002, Subsection 15. The United States

194
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:52,200
is a federal corporation. Well, that's what I said when people were complaining about this debate.

195
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,760
And oh, my God, look, this guy is completely out of it. I said, yeah, well, good thing the

196
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:02,880
president isn't really important because. Well, it is for the corporation. If you go to Title 28,

197
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:09,420
Section 3002, Subsection 15A and there's B and all that. It's a federal corporation.

198
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,500
Some idiots might say, well, it's for doing banking. But only that he exists. It doesn't

199
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,660
have to be functional. You know, not really. Yeah. This is for doing banking. Why? Why is

200
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:21,440
government to banking? They're supposed to create, make them. They're supposed to regulate and make

201
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,680
the gold and silver. What do you mean? Anyway. Yeah. Again, I want to go back up and really

202
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:31,940
being big doses, binging on Brandon Williams, Brandon Joe Williams.

203
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,960
And I'm going to interesting to watch him. He's got a couple of flaws. He

204
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:41,060
got a fully automated email list. You email him, you get barraged back, you know, fully automated

205
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:45,100
stuff. I sent him a couple of messages based on the cases that he has what he should watch out for.

206
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:51,880
But it's best to watch and do it on its own. So it's time for that kind of stuff. So

207
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:57,260
like, you know, the I've never got into what's called the revocation of election,

208
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:03,160
but that's in the IRS code. You know, I remember Schultz. Schultz was the guy who drew Charlie

209
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:08,340
Brown. Yeah. Charles Schultz. Charles Schultz. Yeah. He has one from the 70s. Dear IRS,

210
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:14,180
please unsubscribe me. That's exactly what you do. But you do. It's a title 26 something,

211
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:18,360
something, something, or you could do what it's called. And the IRS says that we received your

212
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:24,680
letter of revocation of election as per the U.S. Congress. And when they approve,

213
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:29,460
the IRS will always write back and say as per the U.S. Congress. And when they don't approve,

214
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:35,000
they'll tell you as per the U.S. Congress. That's what runs them. So and I agree with

215
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:43,760
Brandon Joe that the IRS is the most receptive and they're the most, let's say, how would you

216
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,680
say agency in government? In other words, they follow the law. They don't interpret the law,

217
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:53,240
whatever the codes are. That's why Title 12, Section 411 is so powerful with them. They,

218
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,300
you know, they totally understand that you got rogue agents in there that like to chase people

219
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:03,540
down. And there's been plenty of IRS agents that chase people down and said, if you want your IRS

220
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:07,480
problems, go and meet me here. And they demand a bag of cash. They've been caught several times,

221
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:12,880
right? I don't know if you remember that. Yeah. Okay. So just like you got rogues everywhere,

222
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,600
you know, like the biggest, all the drug transports are still done by the law enforcement,

223
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,920
by the way, and the utility companies, you know, when they want to bring a big

224
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:26,780
load into the city. They don't have a police motorcade, but they use the utility.

225
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:32,560
If you see a bunch of electrical and gas utility trucks parked up against the warehouse or

226
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:37,480
whatever, you're like, well, that looks suspicious, right? No, never look suspicious because

227
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:46,600
utility company. Anyway. So let's get back to the meat, because there's, there's a lot of meat

228
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:51,300
before you get out anything that resembles a bone on this matter. And a lot of people might have a

229
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:55,400
bone in it. But yes, you're basically wasting everybody's time and everybody's wasting your

230
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:01,380
time. So what do you know about that? And what do you do about it? No, you just do what you do.

231
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:06,260
But you do it well. So if you're going to embark on something, learn about it, right?

232
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:11,740
It doesn't take much to learn, improve your memory, right? One of the things that got a lot

233
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:17,200
of people attracted to what I was saying, was I said, you know, you guys years ago, I'd make call

234
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,660
in on the internet, I said, everybody is talking about this, but you don't even know what words

235
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:28,160
mean. Look up the word nice. And I have to do that. And someone in the background told me,

236
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,620
you know, I said, look it up in etymology, not a dictionary, because dictionaries for

237
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:35,720
pronounced, that's why you get the phonetic spelling. Right? And people start saying,

238
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:40,240
I never knew it meant. If you look it up right now, it means foolish, stupid, senseless. That's

239
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:47,480
the first. Right? Yeah. So I started to bring a lot of these things up to people. And then another,

240
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:52,560
I brought up like water, and I brought up scientific stuff, and how magnets work,

241
00:21:52,580 --> 00:22:00,020
you know, or how they don't work, as they say, politics, this and that. So how do I know so

242
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:05,440
about so many subjects, you just spend a few minutes looking it up. You know, here's the

243
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,980
thing, if you're an attorney, and you study the law for five minutes a day, and your colleagues

244
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:15,460
find out that you're doing that, and what you're going to be disbarred, guaranteed,

245
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:21,460
you will have disciplinary action, you have to keep it to yourself. The same with a doctor,

246
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:27,180
there's several medical people that I've known, and also heard from others, the same thing.

247
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:31,280
They wanted to make some improvements. And they get a reprimand letter saying, No,

248
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,180
we're not looking for improvements. We just look for you to do it the standard way.

249
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:41,140
Right? I don't know who that guy was in 1912, or 1902, or something that basically,

250
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:47,380
when the AMA first started in a small office, there will be no more medical research,

251
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:51,840
only current standard practices will be used, right? I forget starts with an S.

252
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:58,480
That's not schlotzky. It's nice. Last year was the transistor guy. Anyway, somebody will find it

253
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,280
and put it in chat in the future. He was a guy that wrote a lot of the codes that the medical

254
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:09,840
people follow. So all you have to do is spend a few minutes studying the history of the thing,

255
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:16,560
the functioning of the thing, who's supposed to know about it, of the thing, and don't count on

256
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:21,880
them at all. So if you try to study law, they'll say see an attorney, big, big, what do you call a

257
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:27,000
diversion tactic? attorneys don't know anything about law at all. And the doctors don't anything

258
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,440
about the human body. Now, from the discussions I've had about with doctors, when I pin them down

259
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:39,400
about certain things, and I don't do it as much as I used to, they basically just jump up and say,

260
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,260
you know, the body heals itself, the body heals itself. So they go, How are you going to help

261
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:47,260
that? You know, they don't understand what's going on at all, right? So procedure, which is

262
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:52,480
like a lawyer, it's the lowest form of what happens in the courtroom, which is procedure. It's kind of

263
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:58,340
like the altar boy in the church, you know, he is a procedure, he has to walk a certain way, right?

264
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:04,160
Right. And look a certain way. So you're locked in a world of procedure, because when you're wasting

265
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:10,800
time, you don't need anything that has any form or matter or meaning, you just go through the

266
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:16,800
motions, which is procedures. And that's what's going on. And I've been, I've been looking at

267
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:22,820
this. And I've been talking to say this publicly, and emphatically, emphatically, because I've

268
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:29,060
just kept coming up. And I tell people, you hear this often, not often, but someone will tell

269
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:33,600
someone else, you're wasting my time. You hear that often? Oh, they need to? Yeah, they need?

270
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:39,300
Well, it depends. You need to hang on that a little bit more and figure out how and why. Because if

271
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:44,640
you're criticizing someone, about they're wasting your time, see, I will never give criticism unless

272
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:50,240
I tell you why I'm going to criticizing the criticism and how to fix it. If one of those

273
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:56,120
three parts are missing, I will not criticize. And I'm very critical. In other words, it's so easy

274
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:03,100
and simple to criticize anything because, look, when I any anything that I purchased in the last

275
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:08,540
three decades, anything doesn't matter what is a can opener, a vacuum cleaner, TV,

276
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:13,160
anything, anything, anything, I had to make an improvement on it, like an obvious improvement,

277
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,780
like this needs an improvement, right? And I modify it, so it works better. Everything I have

278
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:24,240
not come in touch contact with anything yet that I've purchased, except for some night, you know,

279
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,780
what what's really high quality clothing, appliances, where all of them need modification,

280
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,500
all of them, you know, to example, I got this like high end toaster, toaster out it has all

281
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,780
these trays and stuff. And it has a little rubber feet under the appliance, you know,

282
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:43,520
the little rubber feet, right? About a half inch tall. Well, if you stack all the trays and extra

283
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,620
racks are about an inch tall. So where do you put them? But what I did was I removed the rubber

284
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:52,300
feet and I put in one inch, inch and a quarter rubber feet. So now I could slide all the rubber

285
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:58,560
trays underneath the toaster. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Brilliant, right? No, no one is paying

286
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:03,600
attention. And whenever I modify like a vacuum cleaner, anything, anything. I'm always like,

287
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,200
who designed this? Are these people out to lunch? All they needed to do was move this thing over an

288
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:15,080
eighth of an inch or add this or whatever. And most people will find that irritating, annoying,

289
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:21,740
but that's the core of Greek speak. In other words, if you're if you have a sense of opposites,

290
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:26,140
right, let's just break it down. You know, there's good and bad, cold and hot, right? The very

291
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:31,840
opposite. So if you can start narrowing down, you know, like if you're going to go to the store,

292
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,120
it's $75 until I'm rounded off to the nearest hundred, he keeps the change, right?

293
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:41,220
If it's $12, you can see rounded up to the nearest hundred, you keep the you keep the

294
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:45,760
whole thing you see. So you can do big I'm talking about big round offs like that.

295
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,520
Most some not most, but some people say you're pissing me off. That's great.

296
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:54,060
That's great. Because I know that person is here to waste other people's time, including mine.

297
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:58,640
So if I'm pissing them off, that means I'm doing the opposite of what they're doing in life,

298
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,280
which is wasting time.
