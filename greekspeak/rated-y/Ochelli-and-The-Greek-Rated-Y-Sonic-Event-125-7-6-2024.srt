1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:14,620
Rated Y, Sonic Event 125, or 125, whatever it is you want to call it, anyway, here it

2
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:14,960
is.

3
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,260
Greek, how are you?

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,480
Yeah, yeah, this is going to be a good one, I think.

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:19,520
I'm doing alright.

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:26,480
We're bringing up a couple of questions before we hit the record button, and one of them

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,840
we just finished off with, we were talking about free phones, you know, or they're not

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,000
really free, whatever, Federal Reserve Notes, whatever country you're in, they're a form

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,900
of Federal Reserve Notes.

10
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:39,120
You know what they're talking about back in the 90s or 80s, they bankrupted the Soviet

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,460
Union, that's why, you know, it fell and all that, that's total, do you know that the Soviet

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,180
Union and the whole, it's not just the Union, let's include the bloc, you know, right, Hungary,

13
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,560
East Germany, keep going on and on, right?

14
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,820
Right, the Eastern Bloc, sure.

15
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,400
Eastern Bloc, yeah, all of that went through the Federal Reserve in Washington, D.C. and

16
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,060
New York.

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,220
You could look that up, it's hard, you know, they didn't have their own money, right?

18
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,020
Well, on their paper money, though, it said, you know, Bank O.D., whatever, right?

19
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:11,660
That's right, all the central banks are part of the, they were part of the International

20
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:17,380
Monetary Fund, and all of that goes through the D.T.C.C., which is in Manhattan.

21
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,580
You could look up the D.T.C.C., and they have a sheet, maybe they don't anymore, but they

22
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:29,140
do 24 quadrillion, quadrillion, a year in transactions.

23
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,340
Now, let me just put that in perspective, that's 2.4, 2,000, that's the one after a

24
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:41,560
trillion, that's 1,000 trillion, 2,400 trillion, 1,000 trillion, all right, now the Earth has

25
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,860
been, you know, when you get an appraiser, right, to appraise how much something, whether

26
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:51,400
it's a ring or a house or a watch, okay, the entire Earth right now is less than 250 trillion

27
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:58,560
appraised, and they're doing 100 times more of that in transactions a year, okay, just

28
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,240
the food for thought, it's a tangent, right, but just how ridiculous this is.

29
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:10,260
By the way, when the shit goes down from cosmic forces, let me just say it this way, do you

30
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:15,880
think the cosmic forces, the ones that we allegedly get proper law from, view this unlawful

31
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,100
activity and the trading and all that as acceptable behavior or unacceptable behavior?

32
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,180
Well, obviously, it's supposed to be unacceptable.

33
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,720
Unacceptable, right, but you're given a chance to do it, to see what it's like, because you

34
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,880
don't want to be totalitarian, and then you let them go, and if you see, they know that's

35
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,180
the wrong thing to do, but if they keep doing it, then you got to come and slap them across

36
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:37,800
the head, right?

37
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:38,280
Okay.

38
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,480
And destroy their entire society as a side effect, right?

39
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:47,060
But the big question comes into play here, if that is all the case, then why, right,

40
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:52,960
here we go with the why, why does this get allowed to occur in the first place?

41
00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:00,640
Well, I just, the reason I mentioned, because if you enforced it, if you did prohibition,

42
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,220
if you prohibited and enforced that prohibition, you would seem tyrannical.

43
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,980
Yeah, but why allow it to even begin, like, in other words, at the inception?

44
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,280
Well, okay, that's a matter of time.

45
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,220
For us, it's been going on more than our lifetime, but from the other side, it's only a few seconds.

46
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,120
I know, for you and me, look, it's impossible, because we got here, this is the way it was,

47
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:19,400
right?

48
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,760
But at a certain point in time-

49
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:21,860
Right.

50
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,200
By choice, though.

51
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:23,460
Yeah.

52
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,420
Okay, but-

53
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:29,020
It's still by choice, but if you choose not to run in this way, you're going to not be

54
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,520
able to get a lot of stuff, let's say.

55
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,740
But this is the condition of things when we arrived, as far as I'm concerned, right?

56
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,900
Right, but what I'm saying, it's a factor of time.

57
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:44,180
Okay, for example, the ancient Greeks had an idea that the meaning of life, which I talked

58
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,300
about last week-

59
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:45,400
Yeah.

60
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:45,660
The last song.

61
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,360
The meaning of life was on the last song, I guess.

62
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,620
Yeah, we're all basically here to waste each other's time, just passing the time.

63
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,040
Right.

64
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,340
And this might add a little more to it.

65
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,680
I don't know if I mentioned it, maybe I did.

66
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,980
The ancient Greeks, there was a school of philosophy that believed that in the world that we came

67
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:05,600
from, we actually died, and this is in the between time, like your whole life flashing

68
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,860
before you, or the time in between, like the Bardo, the time in between going to another

69
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,060
existence is what this life on Earth is.

70
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,620
So you're actually dead, which is actually backed up quite a bit by, if you read what

71
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,120
the Christ allegedly said, let the dead bury the dead, and the walking dead, and all this

72
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,660
stuff, right?

73
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,080
Yeah.

74
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,280
That we're actually all dead, and this is an in-between experience, so how long should

75
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,240
that be, right?

76
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,000
So it's not a matter of time.

77
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:41,240
So you never discuss time as being a, it's a matter of purely, purely observational when

78
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,960
you discuss time, right?

79
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:48,300
You cannot say, well, why is something, when you're speaking on a cosmic level, and even

80
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:53,520
on a societal level, because all societies, as you know, companies usually last 20 years

81
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,080
and they go lose their peak, and you know, countries go two or 300 years, they lose their

82
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,200
peak, right, and all that stuff.

83
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,100
So all that stuff, within those contexts, you could say, why is it happening for so

84
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:03,280
long?

85
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,380
But when you're having a discussion regarding cosmic forces, time is left out, completely

86
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,040
out of the equation.

87
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,260
I was not asking why it's happened for so long.

88
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:18,780
I was asking why it was allowed to begin, is the biggest question, like, why was this

89
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,100
even...

90
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:24,320
Well, that's the rated Y part, and the rated I part, I think, well, I...

91
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,820
But look, just a quick example here, right?

92
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,560
You start noticing your neighborhood going downhill, right?

93
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,120
You got to block...

94
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,080
No, no, no, but let me say, why?

95
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:35,960
Because if they prohibit it, and certain things are prohibitive, by the way, okay, let's just

96
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,280
work it.

97
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,940
What are we not allowed to do?

98
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,700
And this might answer, okay, we cannot see into the spiritual realm on an individual

99
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,840
level at will, full vision, cannot do that.

100
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,400
Not at all, not at will.

101
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,800
At all, not at all at will, yeah, and even little glimpses, you know, a little dark,

102
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,580
you know, seeing through a glass darkly, right?

103
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,760
Glimpses, they occur accidentally, just like the randomness of...

104
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,440
Right, so we're not allowed to do that, okay, there's a prohibition, okay, but we can't

105
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,800
fly, in other words, defeat gravity, you know, and within our box.

106
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,800
We cannot physically fly at will independently, yes.

107
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,500
That's right, yeah, most people can't, as a matter of fact, I'd say no one can, with

108
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,100
the exceptions that we don't know of.

109
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:20,600
So there are many prohibitions, like overcoming gravity, seeing the mind, where the mind comes

110
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,180
from, right?

111
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,040
There are prohibitions.

112
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:27,520
Okay, directly reading, hold on, directly reading someone else's mind is not something...

113
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,400
Yeah, yeah, all that stuff, anything in the mind, the non-physical knowledge and all that,

114
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:31,620
okay.

115
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:37,580
So do we feel that not being able to conquer gravity and go into the spiritual and fully

116
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:42,100
into the intelligence and information realm, if you start dwelling on that, you're going

117
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,340
to feel like you're living in a tyrannical environment.

118
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,300
You will feel like you're living in...

119
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:52,900
There's an interesting book called Etta Darpa, which is, it's actually a true book, it's

120
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,100
Aphrodite spelled backwards.

121
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,100
Okay, but I don't think anybody sees the lack of ability to fly at will as tyrannical,

122
00:06:59,160 --> 00:06:59,300
right?

123
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:05,320
But hold on, Etta Darpa, which is, they have it as a fictional book, but it's actually

124
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:10,420
a true book, because the level of science in there that contradicts the science experiments

125
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,400
of then and now are all true.

126
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,540
Anyone can do simple science experiments in there and show that what we're being taught

127
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,580
is contrary to what it can really be.

128
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:24,820
In that book, towards the last part of the book, he kept repeating on how gravity is tyrannical,

129
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:30,700
because he went to a place where you can make a minimum effort and leap 30 feet across, right?

130
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:37,560
So he started noticing, when you dwell on a subject, for example, we're going to bring

131
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,800
up the Bible also, so when you look at the way people look at what's in the Biblical

132
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,660
text, and when you research it a little bit or have enough Greek speak under your belt,

133
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:53,200
you will view that subject by the populace and the authorities as being under tyranny.

134
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,220
Because there's absolutely no reason why we can't have a translation of it, instead of

135
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,580
versions, there's no reason why anyone should be going to these god-awful religions that

136
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:06,420
are supposedly based on it and are contrary to what's written, there's absolutely no reason

137
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,260
for what's going on.

138
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:12,460
So if you actually study what could be on any subject, I've just brought up gravity,

139
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:18,400
the Bible, mental capacity, and all that, if you focus on certain things, you will see

140
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:25,980
we are under a tyrannical rule of prohibition into these things, yes, you will see, but

141
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:31,320
when we talk about the money system, hold on, the money system is different, and I'll

142
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,200
explain to you why.

143
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:37,140
Because if you read in the Biblical text, it's the love of, a lot of people say, oh

144
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:42,380
yeah, I see it on comments, by the way, the reason I don't do a YouTube channel, I think

145
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,400
I've mentioned this briefly, but I have never given a solid reason why.

146
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:55,800
The reason I am against YouTube is because I've been looking at YouTube often for things,

147
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:00,480
and whenever you go to the comments section, I just want to throw up.

148
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:07,260
In other words, if this is the audience, if you read comments, if this is the audience

149
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,960
of YouTube, I want nothing to do with it, and I still hold that, right?

150
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,980
But that's only a minor representation of who actually...

151
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:19,040
No, no, go look at, for example, a big channel with a million or whatever subscribers, they

152
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,480
have 1,300 comments, go read through the comments.

153
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,360
Yeah, but that's my point right there.

154
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,860
You just want to blow your brains out.

155
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:29,700
But mathematically, right there, it's a simple, provable fact that that is a small fraction

156
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:34,120
of the individuals who actually engage with that material, because if you've got a million

157
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,220
people...

158
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,480
No, it's enough of a fraction to pollute the entire thing.

159
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,660
Okay, so let's go back.

160
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,100
With money, it's very different, Chuck.

161
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,320
Because in the Bible, it doesn't say money is the root of all evil, like a lot of people

162
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:43,940
like to comment.

163
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,340
It says the love of money, right?

164
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:51,460
So what they did was they took money away, and it's very clear that money has to have

165
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,780
intrinsic value, right?

166
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:53,240
Okay.

167
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:53,980
Now, there was...

168
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,040
Let me just give you what this is.

169
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,480
There's a movie called Brazil in the 1980s, it was like this dystopic future, De Niro was

170
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,900
in it, you know, it was like this dystopic futuristic scenario, where if you needed something

171
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:10,960
fixed, like plumbing or electrical, you had these guerrilla type guys would come in, so

172
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,100
you didn't have to wait for the state.

173
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,780
But if the state found out you used one of these guys, they punished you, right?

174
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,580
It was kind of like a 1984...

175
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,340
Anyway, they go to this fancy restaurant, and the menu has pictures of the dishes, what

176
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,740
beautiful prepared presentations, but what you get is a pile of mush, either green mush,

177
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,160
brown mush, or whatever, right?

178
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:37,280
So it's a picture of what this mush supposedly is like, and that's what the money...

179
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:43,440
Right now, you do not have money anywhere in the world, it's all based on promises to

180
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:43,880
pay, right?

181
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,560
Notes, right?

182
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:44,840
Okay.

183
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,940
And they're not redeemable.

184
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,420
So hold on, people still want that.

185
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:53,220
All of the laws in every country basically define money, especially in the US, and what

186
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,540
we use is not money, it's all credit.

187
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,980
Credit is deferring payment, right?

188
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:04,440
So how many people, how many times, okay, an idiocracy, I love money, remember the attorney,

189
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,620
I love money, right?

190
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:12,680
I run into, because I'm less and less and less in many circles, whenever I get into speaking

191
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:17,980
in groups, especially in industry, when you get to know these people privately, you'll

192
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:22,340
bring up something that seems quote-unquote profitable, and they're like, oh, I love money.

193
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,520
I'm like, oh my gosh, it's like these people, there's no money, guys.

194
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,820
There's no money.

195
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,820
And you see, so what it is, there are people that still love money, and there is no money.

196
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:38,880
So what do you call someone who wants and desires something that doesn't exist?

197
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:39,820
Delusional.

198
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:44,600
Yeah, well, it's like masturbating as opposed to actually having sex, look.

199
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,920
Yeah, well, I think masturbating is less delusional, I call that self-service, self-serve, it's

200
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,480
a self-serve aisle of the self-serve, right, the self-checkout, whatever.

201
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,980
Self-checkout would be more like suicide.

202
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,600
Yeah, but you get none of the products.

203
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,120
Yeah, so now here's the thing, it's so easy, like, for example, if you go to the GAO, which

204
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,700
is the Government Accounting Office, and look up the IRS, they have nothing, nothing.

205
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,080
But they have plenty on everybody.

206
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,180
Where does your money go in taxation?

207
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,020
Even on a city and state level, in every country, they cannot report.

208
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,220
Now, if you ask them, they'll send you a letter that says, it goes to the jurisdiction of

209
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,900
the schools, goes to the jurisdiction of the roads, okay, jurisdiction, there's no such

210
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,400
thing as that.

211
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,720
So it has to be done that way, because there's infinite money creation.

212
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,900
Again, I don't endorse him, but Brandon Joe Williams, I've been mentioning him on every

213
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,320
Sonic now for the past four or five times, very impressed with what this young man is

214
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:35,520
doing.

215
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,900
It's funny, when you get to about 60, you call people in their 30s a young man, right?

216
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:47,640
So you go and see how delusional the society is, but is it still working?

217
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,180
It's working to a certain point.

218
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:53,440
Now, this is, by the way, the way the money system, the legal system, and all that other

219
00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:00,040
stuff is set up in the US, was designed to implode when the moment enough people found

220
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,760
out about it.

221
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,800
Where did we find out about that?

222
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,740
Henry Ford is a famous saying that they've been putting out since he said it, allegedly,

223
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,780
if the people ever found out how the money system works, there would be blood in the

224
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,000
streets in a day or 24 hours, right?

225
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,040
You've heard that saying, right?

226
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,360
And that's been out there now.

227
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:22,180
So basically, there is a timed cosmic thing that these systems, whether it's the medical

228
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:28,340
system is the same, it's worse than Dr. Frankenstein, because Dr. Frankenstein was able to piece

229
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,220
dead people together and animate them, which is what Ben Franklin was doing, by the way.

230
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,480
He was buying slaves and chopping them up and putting them back together, trying to

231
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,840
get electricity to revive them.

232
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,980
That's where Mary Shelley got the idea from rumors, right?

233
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:47,480
But anyway, you know, there's enough evidence to collaborate what I said, if you look even

234
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,060
on the Internet.

235
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:53,320
So there was even people experimenting like that lady in Louisiana that they caught where

236
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,640
she was sewing people together and doing all that other stuff.

237
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,300
You know, yeah, whatever it is.

238
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,480
But here's the thing.

239
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:03,340
A lot of these systems, the medical system, the legal system, the money system was set

240
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,640
up to implode.

241
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:10,100
In other words, whoever adopts this system will go down with it once enough people find

242
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,060
out how it works, that have morality or wake up to it.

243
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:18,060
Now, it's so easy to find out that lawyers don't know any law and doctors don't know

244
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,700
anything about the human body and any field.

245
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,020
You know, recently I had a discussion with someone who was very proud that they come

246
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:31,020
from a family of academics and they mentioned all these different industries and fields.

247
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:35,140
And I was like, yeah, between you and me, it sounds between you and me.

248
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,300
Thank you for telling me. And if you go out and tell people, they'll commend you.

249
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,480
But I'll tell you, OK, so let's start here with this person.

250
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,500
What field were they in?

251
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,860
And he mentions this.

252
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,720
I said, you know what? In reality, in reality, they didn't know anything about that.

253
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,280
Right. You could work in a field for 20 or 30 years as a professor and just do what

254
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,980
you're told to say. And they really don't know what they're talking about, but they

255
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,560
sound right.

256
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,920
And I went down to the other one, the medical one definitely didn't know what is the

257
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,700
chances of someone being a doctor for 35 years and not using a blood pressure cuff and

258
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,700
tell it right now is zero.

259
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,700
They know nothing.

260
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,580
I notice that all the time, even.

261
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,900
OK, so I do my broadcasting, you know that.

262
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,520
But when I listen to other broadcasters and I go, it's interesting because they use

263
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,660
the right words, they say the right buzz phrase.

264
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:25,740
But I'll tell you what, the second you try and test to see if they actually have any

265
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:29,400
knowledge of the thing that they're spitting out this stupid phrase about, they know

266
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,940
nothing. They never read the book.

267
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,300
They never actually investigated.

268
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,600
They're sitting there talking about, well, scientifically, I know this.

269
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,980
And meanwhile, what scientific study have they even bothered to partake of or to

270
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,020
participate in?

271
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,660
Did they ever bother to even read somebody else's scientific study?

272
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,960
And you know what the answer is?

273
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,200
No, no, of course.

274
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,560
Well, it's not even that they're OK.

275
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,200
And that's what they're doing.

276
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:58,140
Is they're filling a position and they're asleep and they're sleepwalking.

277
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,120
And meanwhile, that's the most, quote, unquote, successful guys I see and hear.

278
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,080
It's like I listen very carefully and I go, OK, that means.

279
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,420
To make that statement, you would have had to have studied this, this, this very, you

280
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,880
know, you know, the kind of stuff I study and I listen carefully.

281
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,580
And guess what? I discover they know none of it.

282
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,300
Well, here's another example.

283
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,720
I could go another way. No woman.

284
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,720
She's a professor at the University of Arizona.

285
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,980
She has three sons and none of her sons barely graduated from high school.

286
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,380
And they all work in different fields.

287
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,420
One is like a I shouldn't give too many.

288
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,560
One of them is one of these MMF MMA fighters.

289
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,900
OK, that could be one billion people.

290
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,280
But, yeah, I got you. And then, yeah.

291
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,840
And then one is this and one is that.

292
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,020
And they're each one is successful in their field.

293
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,680
And and I'm like, oh, that's so good.

294
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,320
Mom is a professor, tenured.

295
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,940
And it's great that it's like she did the right thing.

296
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,540
She didn't make them go.

297
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:53,160
They, you know, because they could have gotten a free ride, you know, all next to free.

298
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:58,120
And she did, even though she works in a because she's locked into that, but she can't.

299
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,960
You know, she likes the life they give her.

300
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,480
So she's like a working form of welfare.

301
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,940
Sure. And they automatically provide that you can bring some.

302
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,119
Yeah, she doesn't have to do anything, really.

303
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,180
And she gets, you know, twice the salary of all the other professors.

304
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:13,960
So but the children did not get any kind of that stuff at all.

305
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:20,180
And they went off. And so there's an example of a well-done kind of right situation.

306
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:22,079
Right. They went down thing.

307
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,119
Yeah, they went through other thing with no academic, no college, anything like that.

308
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,980
Barely did high school, whatever.

309
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:38,080
And because it shows you that the breakdown, you know, the one of the worst things you'll ever see is run into an attorney or a doctor.

310
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,260
And you find out that their dad was a doctor.

311
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,580
Their granddad was a doctor.

312
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,700
Their uncle was a doctor.

313
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,680
Their mom was a doctor. A family or a family of attorneys right there.

314
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,800
Those people are very dangerous because they're all sleepwalking.

315
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,400
Right. And they're carrying on.

316
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,300
That's that's the culture.

317
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,420
You know, that's the culture that they form.

318
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,600
You know, the Klan.

319
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,680
Right. They come out of a clan.

320
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:18,520
So what you have, because the society, let's say, from the 20th century, let's say World War Two reshaped all of Europe, you know, in a way that, you know, if you're in the US, Canada, Australia, and you wanted a government document or something during the war, you can pretty much get it.

321
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,940
But a lot of places in Europe during the war and after the war, you couldn't get anything official.

322
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,780
It took years to rebuild everything.

323
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,420
Right. Right.

324
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,160
So there's a lot of things were redone and a lot of puppet.

325
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,140
All the puppet governments were finally set up on whatever the agendas were put in.

326
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:44,260
A lot of the agendas that you hear of that are supposedly in place now and were for 10 years, it started with Obama and continue to 2030 were all put in around World War Two, if you research their history.

327
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:54,220
So basically, you had an unfettered continuation of life in the US, Australia, places like that.

328
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:59,120
Right. The continent of Africa, of course, you know, pretty much continuation.

329
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:07,720
But the war and all that stuff, World War Two is a good demarcation line where you could say anything after that is the same society.

330
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:19,880
Right. Generationally, if you take so anyone born or anyone, let's say, acting in society, living after the 40s till now, it's pretty much the same society.

331
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,720
Pretty much. You have some exceptions with the war in Kosovo.

332
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:30,480
Right. And now supposedly the Ukraine, where things were dead because they really remember that there used to be a country called Yugoslavia.

333
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:41,240
Right. Well, I have one minor objection to this, and that is that I, I believe that you're correct up until 2001 because we have a serious change.

334
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,680
Once again, I think the society is actually different.

335
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,500
Again, you can segment it.

336
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,800
Well, no, it didn't break continuity, though.

337
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,020
It didn't break continuity.

338
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,720
You sure about that? Because.

339
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,220
Yeah. How would it break continuity?

340
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:59,500
2001. Because now a different reality emerges where you have a surveillance system.

341
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,100
There is no longer any privacy.

342
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,480
Yeah, but that doesn't continue.

343
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,920
That changes a lot of the behaviors of a society in general.

344
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,780
It was mental. It was a mental mind.

345
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,000
It was a big propaganda mindfuck.

346
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,520
Well, which I see why they did it.

347
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,320
But beyond that, it changed a lot of behavior patterns.

348
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:21,840
A lot of things were eliminated and a lot of new behaviors were introduced into the society, which altered it.

349
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:27,720
Here's how 9-11 was predicted on many fronts.

350
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,180
First of all, you didn't have an enemy anymore.

351
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,220
Cold War was over.

352
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,140
So you need the enemy.

353
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,100
But you got a new one.

354
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,480
Right. The other thing is you want to you know that the end is near.

355
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:45,160
And what in order to control people, you cannot allow them to have free travel, you know, freely travel.

356
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,700
Right. And yet the heightened.

357
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,300
So you have to install that.

358
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,660
Yes, but also the heightened discussions of the apocalypse, the Armageddon, all that.

359
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,360
That's right. You notice which they thought was going to be around 2000.

360
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,040
Yeah. See, that didn't come.

361
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,060
You see that change because you had this time.

362
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,040
The world ending thing was all very big.

363
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:08,100
It was amping up all the way up to 2001 and then culminating with the 2012 deal.

364
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,980
Because my calendar, Greek, you know that my calendar is 2046.

365
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,640
Yes. But back then they were saying what?

366
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,660
2012. And it was what?

367
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,840
December 21st, 2012, I think.

368
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,500
Right. Something like that.

369
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,600
Like the whole world was supposed to end because the Mayan calendar stops.

370
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,660
Well, because the Mayan calendar is based on a 360 day.

371
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,620
Well, I'm not talking about the truth of it.

372
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,620
I'm talking about the way people.

373
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:37,920
But the same thing holds off, you see, because 9-11, you're going to have more 9-11 coming type stuff.

374
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:43,340
But it's going to be, you know, like, you know, what the first 9-11 was was was not Waco.

375
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:47,780
The one in Oklahoma City, that was the first mini 9-11.

376
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:53,560
We know where they declared the domestic terrorism and the buildings being blown up.

377
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,900
Of course, there's your OKC thing, which happens.

378
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:03,980
But there's a huge change there between in that time period from 2000 to 2012 where the world is going to come to an end thing.

379
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,240
That's right. And it wore people out.

380
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,420
It's not coming to an end like they're saying.

381
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,320
But do you hear people talking about the end of the world?

382
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,740
No, that's no longer the big thing that's coming.

383
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,500
Yeah, but there's no change in continuity.

384
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:27,740
What I mean by continuity is when you had families of doing a Klan, like a medical Klan fight or legal Klan or industrial Klan, there was a big interruption around World War Two where they physically didn't follow it.

385
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,840
And just like I gave the example of this professor with her three sons, right?

386
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,460
You don't think because of the change in travel, the change in freedom, the change in the continuity too much?

387
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:41,100
Because if you have to travel somewhere, you're going to travel there, right?

388
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,140
You're going now.

389
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,260
It's a difference between doing on a steamship or a jetliner.

390
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,340
Not necessarily.

391
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,320
No, because it changed a lot of that.

392
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,960
And see, those behaviors were very different.

393
00:22:52,340 --> 00:23:03,420
Well, if you gave me the offer, a Learjet or Skype, which one am I going to take if I had to do business meetings?

394
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,980
Well, I would say, depending on the circumstances, I would do Skype.

395
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:19,840
I would not fuck the Learjet because you can get up to 90 people or 80 people or whatever on Skype anytime of day, anytime, anywhere where Learjet flying around the world to meet them is not right.

396
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:27,020
So if you told people before COVID that they would think you're nuts now, most people would say, yeah, absolutely.

397
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,740
I would do what they call network video conferences and all that.

398
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:41,020
Even a lot of court, you could record what they're not really courts, but what they call court, you could request video conference instead of going in person.

399
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:41,340
Right.

400
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:48,080
Well, if your business meeting is based on something of seriously high significance, I would say that, no, I would not restrict it only to.

401
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:55,960
Well, that's a matter of culture, because if the meeting is to exchange meeting of the minds, of course, the video is superior to the time that you'd expense.

402
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:10,000
But there are certain when I was working with water internationally back in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, if you did any work with people from Asia, they had to come and meet you.

403
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,420
And some did. They would fly over.

404
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,960
They even came over with a Russian guy once.

405
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,040
And I never met the Russian guy because they said he had such a bad hangover.

406
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,660
He drank so much on the plane that he slept the whole time that their time.

407
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,680
Anyway, yeah.

408
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,420
Between that and jet lag, he probably couldn't get himself together.

409
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,560
Yeah, I never met him.

410
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,420
Yeah. He took him.

411
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:32,700
Yeah. So so they had to come over and meet me face to face, which was like a three hour thing.

412
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,560
I'm not going to say hello.

413
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,760
Goodbye. You know, three hours.

414
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,460
And that's it. That's they're from Taiwan.

415
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,020
And they have to do that.

416
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,620
That is a necessity because it's so it's cultural.

417
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,700
It's so it's cultural.

418
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,100
Yeah. So depending on the culture.

419
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,580
But now the culture is more uniform.

420
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:52,460
But if it's a minor thing, right, then you don't necessarily need to see somebody in person.

421
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,540
It's not that big a deal.

422
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,520
It's a small deal.

423
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,140
But it does need to get done.

424
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:00,860
But if you got something of heavy significance, do you want to just take the word of whatever it is you receive?

425
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,680
Yeah, of course. You can do it all digitally.

426
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,980
I would not travel.

427
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:10,260
And as a matter of fact, I don't get on airplanes or anything like that, even though I do have privileges and other paperwork.

428
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,560
But you're clear. I don't.

429
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:15,020
But I have a different type of complete situation, which I've never discussed publicly.

430
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:20,700
The people that know my status and situation and the State Department paperwork I have in this and that.

431
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,120
But that's another story.

432
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,520
But the thing is, you have to admit that you are not typical.

433
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,840
So I'm talking about.

434
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,380
No, no, but this is an atypical sonic event also.

435
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,040
But here, let's just.

436
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:42,360
So the point is that we were discussing the only thing other than 9-11, I would say 9-11 and the Corona pandemic thing was another.

437
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:49,740
Because you're still seeing the repercussions of it four years later, just as much as you saw the repercussions of 9-11 four years up until 2005.

438
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,620
These are what we call watershed events.

439
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,560
OK, and that's fine.

440
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,720
I get exactly. And you're going to have more coming.

441
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,040
Yeah, very similar.

442
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,140
They're going to be religious based, by the way.

443
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,360
Again, coming.

444
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:06,960
So so all these things and continuity were again, all this again leans on what you it's all transactions.

445
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:15,220
Right. And all the transactions right now are being done by in a way that people don't understand that it's even it's even it's OK.

446
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:23,140
Talking about how the money system works in general is like asking people, what are their most secret sexual proclivities?

447
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,340
They will not disclose.

448
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,260
They just don't want to talk about it.

449
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,260
So to me, that shows that there is a strong cosmic veil.

450
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:37,360
Again, that's why I give big kudos to Brandon Joe Williams, because he's putting a lot of his effort properly done.

451
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:45,400
And he's getting thousands and thousands and thousands of people, hopefully to clog up the court system and the State Department system with, you know, using their own paperwork.

452
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:52,700
And he's has experiences where he goes with a form D-11, which is for passport and all that, and fills it out a certain way.

453
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,080
And you can't do that. Like, what do you mean?

454
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,760
And this is the law right here.

455
00:26:55,820 --> 00:27:00,500
And there are people working in the State Department 25, 30 years that don't even know their own paperwork.

456
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,600
And they go look it up and like, oh, shit, you're right.

457
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,020
How can I be here for 30 years and not know this?

458
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:10,240
Right, right. So it's every field is like that, you know, same with the DMV.

459
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,220
So you see, again, look, when you were talking about the love of money and that's what the problem is.

460
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,840
Well, here's the problem altogether.

461
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,560
And we solve it real fast.

462
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,180
How do you have the love of something that doesn't exist?

463
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,800
Right. Well, yeah, it makes you delusional.

464
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,780
There's plenty of people that do that with many things.

465
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:32,640
Right. But, you know, like, for example, I'm delusional in a way that I'd like to live in a more perfect society.

466
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:38,580
And I didn't say perfect, a more perfect society where people can communicate reasonably well.

467
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,260
Right. And they're not annoying.

468
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,520
That would be wonderful.

469
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:49,900
That would be nearly perfect for me just just to be in the presence of someone for more than 10 minutes.

470
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:55,780
Anyone that is not annoying and can communicate reasonably well, not great, reasonably well.

471
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:58,780
That would be my more perfect society.

472
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:05,040
Right now, by the way, when I say annoying first is because that comes second when someone doesn't communicate or noise the hell out of me.

473
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,820
Now, there's no reason for that.

474
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,900
If you can if you want me to learn sign language, I'll learn sign language.

475
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:17,080
But anyway, the whole the whole thing is cosmically ordained to be this way.

476
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:23,980
And that's why on the last Sonic I said it's strictly very simple and strictly that we're here to waste each other's time.

477
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,680
That's basically it.

478
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:33,580
There is no other thing going on, just like there's nothing new going under the sun, nothing new under the sun.

479
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:44,060
If you look, if you don't think that we're here to waste each other's time, go look at the horse and carriage, how long that's been around as a main form of locomotion.

480
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:52,740
Right. Don't think that the automobile and all this stuff that's being used in all the way to whatever you want to call it now, electric cars or whatever.

481
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,600
That form of travel was not known of.

482
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:05,060
And right now, all this stuff, there are things still that if you have a proper library, which I don't even couldn't say, I mean, who knows what's going on?

483
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:14,100
Let's say the big New York City Public Library, because I remember by the late 1990s, they're already packing books and putting them away out of public view.

484
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:30,180
But if you have access to stuff up until 1895, 1896, you will see stuff in there up to the 1920s that still is not discussed by science, that by then was shown to be probable and very possible.

485
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:49,840
As a matter of fact, in one of the Eric Dollard YouTube videos, the National Electric Engineers Society leader stood up and said that pretty soon we're going to have electrical generation without a primary mover.

486
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:57,240
What a primary mover means, you know, when you have a generator, you got to move it with a primary mover like steam or waterfall or wind, right?

487
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,760
You won't need any of that.

488
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:09,500
We'll be able to have something that creates electricity or makes the electrical voltage and current we're looking for without feeding it steam or water or whatever to crank it to move.

489
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,400
It'll be static.

490
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,340
So what happened?

491
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:17,440
Yeah, something that sources from a continuous and just existing thing.

492
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,340
But hold on.

493
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:26,380
What he was referring to more was not like airy fairy stuff, like pulling out of the ether or something.

494
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:33,100
That's what most people would say, because the reason I'm referring to pulling out of the ether is airy fairy is because it's very, very slow.

495
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:39,600
Trying to pull electricity out of the ether is too slow for the demand that's required to even today.

496
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,660
What we can't do is pull out of ether.

497
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,880
Just like solar power.

498
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,400
The problem isn't with the concept.

499
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,420
The problem is with the amount that is required.

500
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,080
Efficiency.

501
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:47,720
Efficiency.

502
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,320
But what he was saying was something different.

503
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,580
Now, the way Tesla was doing it, by the way, most people don't understand it.

504
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:58,300
He was pumping a lot of electricity into the ground and he was getting more back.

505
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,800
There was no free energy there.

506
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:09,600
You still, if you study the Colorado experiments, which are the most widely easy, accessible, actually the only 10% of those papers really made it to the Internet.

507
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,440
I've seen the more elaborate.

508
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,740
I've seen 50% of them.

509
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:21,980
His main problem was to how to generate enough power or create enough power and voltage to send it deep enough into the ground so he could get that return.

510
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:22,380
Right.

511
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,500
So it's it's kind of like what people do on the stock market.

512
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,920
You want to put a dollar in now.

513
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,900
So you get five dollars or two dollars later.

514
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,100
That's what Tesla was doing.

515
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,600
It's not ether stuff.

516
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,580
It's just he explained it as the ether.

517
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:41,600
But power can be the only way to get instant power from the ether is very, very dangerous is what they call nuclear detonation.

518
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,340
Right.

519
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,560
And there's a lot of stuff out there about nukes don't exist.

520
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,320
Yes, they don't exist the way that you're told, just like blood pressure doesn't exist.

521
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,780
And just like, you know, you don't absorb anything.

522
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,200
Right.

523
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,060
But nukes do exist, but they're not.

524
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,360
They're an electrical phenomenon.

525
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,980
They're not nuclear, their own category.

526
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:10,560
So to go back to what this engineer was speaking about, the head of engineers is he was discussing about making a device that would create an impulse that once it starts, it doesn't stop.

527
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:11,680
Right.

528
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,640
It's perpetual motion.

529
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,120
It's got a bad name.

530
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:15,360
Right.

531
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:22,100
Perpetual motion is something that's like a bad term that you tell someone that what you're working on is futile.

532
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:22,360
Right.

533
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:32,040
Just like excuse me, a conspiracy theorist, a conspiracy, calling someone a conspiracy theorist is a bad term that just means that you're not insane.

534
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:39,100
When someone calls you a conspiracy theory theorist, that just means they're telling you in a bad term that you're not crazy like the rest of us.

535
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:39,320
Right.

536
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,700
So right.

537
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,960
So so anyway, these things all existed before.

538
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,020
So what's happening?

539
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,460
There's a cosmic veil that's keeping everything covered.

540
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:52,320
So, again, look how long the horse and carriage was around.

541
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:53,380
Right.

542
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,580
And now we have this.

543
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:58,080
So what were the for all those hundreds and hundreds of the horse and carriage?

544
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,900
Don't you think people are wasting each other's time?

545
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:00,520
Absolutely.

546
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,560
And also there's the timing.

547
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:15,600
So what a better way to limit a society or let a society advance is the limiting component would be just have them waste each other's time.

548
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,400
And they don't know they're doing it.

549
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,720
They just don't know they're doing it.

550
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,560
How long can that go on for as long as you can?

551
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,180
And it's still happening today.

552
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:35,360
What will happen eventually, as perhaps in our lifetime, is there'll be a quickening, which that term is used to apply to extreme measures, by the way.

553
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:43,520
There'll be a quickening where people will realize we cannot waste each other's time anymore, meaning husband and wife, father and son, co-workers, boss.

554
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:49,920
And where all these people, everyone you interact with is wasting everyone else's time to keep things stable.

555
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,880
There's going to be a time where this will be lifted and people will wake up and say, what the fuck?

556
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:55,720
What's going on here?

557
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,940
Why are we doing this this way?

558
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,480
Just OK, I see what you mean.

559
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,580
Right. Not like show me what you mean.

560
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,660
I see what you mean.

561
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:10,620
Right. And everyone starts going into agreement and starts putting things together more properly and more properly to the point you realize that what the hell we've been doing here for all these years.
