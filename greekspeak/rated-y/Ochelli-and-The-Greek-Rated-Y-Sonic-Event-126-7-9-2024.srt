1
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:24,480
Rated Y Sonic event 126 or 126 however it is you want to count it here it is and it's

2
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:33,200
a happening. Greek, how are you? Hey, I'm you. You're me. Now that's kind of a male sheep

3
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,500
right? Is it you? Oh, no. Wait. Yeah. Is it you? I knew it was you. Yeah. What is a ute?

4
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,680
They said in the movie Cousin Vinny, my cousin Vinny, right? Okay. Anyway, did you say you

5
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:51,660
eat? What is a you? What is it? Center? Are you? Yeah, I like that. Because I came from

6
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:57,940
that sort. But my cousin, it's Jersey. That's not Brooklyn. Jersey. Yeah, but I don't know.

7
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:02,340
That's not really they don't really talk like more Brooklyn than Jersey, though. He mixed

8
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,120
it up. It was all a mix of like, you know, New York, New Jersey and some other gutter

9
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:14,360
mix. I mean, some Philly, Philly. That's what it is. You're right. Okay. So tri state area

10
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:21,520
gutter talk. Yeah. Yeah. Vernacular. And of course, a little bit of Italian stereotyping

11
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,740
or not really Italian stereotyping, but Guido stereotyping, because there is a difference.

12
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,080
Anyway, forget about all that, because you could hear that kind of thing. Well, almost

13
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:38,480
anywhere. Let's talk about some messages we've gotten recently from rated Y listeners. Okay.

14
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:44,400
So I got somebody who basically gives a whole long wind up about how he's surrounded by

15
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:50,160
people that are, you know, very Baptist and religious, and he finds himself coming to Greek

16
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,220
speak and a few other things. It's taken him a couple of years, but he's been listening

17
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:01,180
to come around to some of these ideas. Right. Because he's steeped in Baptist stuff. And

18
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:07,600
his friends, his brother, I think girlfriend, too, but he didn't want to admit to it. Altogether

19
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,260
seem to have this idea that there's really a black and white world. It's either things

20
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,720
are godly and good. They're just godly or they're the work of the devil. There's no

21
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:25,060
in between. Okay, no, that's that's a good way to carpetment called part of it. It's

22
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:30,520
a hard word for me to say. compartmentalize your lives. Yes. What you're striving for

23
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:36,860
when in reality, it's not give you an example. This is parallel analogy. So so this is aspirational

24
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:41,200
as opposed to descriptive about the world around you. Yeah. So here's a way to look

25
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,220
at it. So I'm many, I designed something and I decided I want to put it out in the world.

26
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,560
So I start manufacturing, I make them, I have some people help me make them very high

27
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:57,460
quality units. And we idealize we idealize the perfect unit that should be when it's

28
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:03,960
made to perfection. Will we will write so that means that everyone that we make will be exactly

29
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:09,580
the same and perfect. So it's functionality, it's appearance, everything. Everything will

30
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:14,620
be perfect, right? So okay, so just let me let me finish this point. Sure. So we're manufacturing

31
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:20,020
something and I have some helpers and we're working and we're created the perfect of who

32
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,840
this is what we think the perfect device is. Okay, so let me when we're done at the end

33
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,180
of the day, a week, month or year, if they were all perfect, they would all be identical

34
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:34,860
and they would have have a be without flaw on any level of scrutiny. Is that ever going

35
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:42,320
to happen? No. So what we do we strive for that? Yes. Right. So when you strive for a

36
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:49,100
black and white, yes or no, you know, just do just simple duality. That's, that's fine.

37
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,880
But you will find that you won't achieve it. Right? So it's kind of like the thing, if you're

38
00:03:53,880 --> 00:04:00,320
going to go for 100%, the best you'll ever get is 95. Right? So if you want 99%, you have

39
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:08,740
to go for 150%. Right? If you want 99.9%, you got to go for 200%. It's a diminishing returns.

40
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:14,860
So what they're doing is they're getting diminishing returns. If they're looking back at

41
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:20,560
what they're doing, making a change or making any progress or, or, you know, anything like that. But

42
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,320
now this doesn't go for being Baptist or whatever, like this, you know, I understand that I know what

43
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,940
they talk about what they're into, right? But they still don't know. Okay, just all right. Now,

44
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,720
I hope you got that analogy, right? So it's fine to know this is good. And this is bad. And that's

45
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,580
fine. But you can't live that way. But you keep it as a, as a standard as a reference, right?

46
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,680
But reality can never be because it can never be exactly like that. Because no matter what you do,

47
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,260
and you know what, they always say accidents will happen. So even if you do everything, right,

48
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,940
something will be faulty at some point. Nobody is called tolerances. But again,

49
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:03,640
just to comment directly on the, on the, what would you call the, let's say the pedigree,

50
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:10,360
right, which would be Baptists, they are still deceived. So if you were to be

51
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:19,140
an ardent listener of Greek speak, you would know that very simply, the Baptists are works of the

52
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:25,160
devil. Very simple. So that kind of flushes out the whole thing. But within the Baptist sphere,

53
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:35,080
being within the understanding within the using what the through Baptist eyes or whatever eyes,

54
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:40,960
yes, it's fine to see as good and bad. This is the devil. This is not this. That's fine. But I'm

55
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,980
telling you, if he's an ardent, if you really know what's going on that clearly that baptism

56
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:51,480
is the work of the devil. Why? Very simple. They are also deceived by the counterfeit Christ.

57
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:58,360
They believe in a counterfeit Christ. They think he was crucified on a cross, Christmas, Easter,

58
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,500
the law has been done away with, right? So that's 100% work of the devil, right? So yeah, so,

59
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:12,800
so on one end, I was more addressing, is it all right to be black and white, good or bad? You

60
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,560
know, no, no leeway? Yeah, of course, because I do that when I make things. I want them to be perfect.

61
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,780
But are they perfect? No, but everyone else thinks they are. So that's good enough.

62
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,240
Same thing with baptism. Everyone thinks they're, everyone else thinks they're righteous or

63
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,080
whatever. It's good enough, but I'm telling you, it is demonic. So it's like Catholicism,

64
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:35,720
Protestantism and whatever Mormonism, they're all demonic. So it's okay to aspire to having

65
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:41,580
a circumstance where everything is, you need a reference, a base reference point to start your

66
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:46,600
life with. And it absolutely, there's clear cut, good and bad. Absolutely. But you see how I gave

67
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:52,300
you the one was the worm's eye view, then the airplane view, and now like, high up in space view,

68
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,500
when you go away, it's all demonic. Right? The people that know the real spiritual

69
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,600
characters, the ones that you depict in the Bible are on the run on the go, they don't talk about

70
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:09,040
it, in terms of, like, I talk about it, but I'm not gonna, I'm never gonna do a website on it.

71
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,860
Right? I'm never gonna go ahead and write a book about it. And I'm not going to write

72
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:18,980
someone, send someone, I've been on years ago, 20 years ago, or 10 years ago, 15 years ago,

73
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:24,520
call in on these calling groups, 70, 80, 100 people that capture their attention. I just

74
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,180
lead them into showing like, Hey, why are you doing this one? Right? And they all stop right

75
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:34,700
here. Stop right there. I before this guy continues speaking, I need for him to give me a letter of

76
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:40,440
faith, you know, like statement of faith, send me a statement of faith. And then I'll let you talk

77
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,660
here, you know, so they're like running administrative stuff, you know what I mean?

78
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,100
So and I can't even write a statement of faith, because they won't understand damn word in it.

79
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:54,080
Right. So. So when I say they're on the run, whoever knows, that's what I mean. They're not

80
00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:01,340
literally on the run. But they're on the run from avoiding. Let's say, what would you do when you do

81
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,440
a form of public publishing, which is however you're going to publish,

82
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:12,440
you're doing websites publishing, putting these things down about the Bible that you hear in

83
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:17,680
Greek speak is a complete waste of time. So what you do is you do it in passing, like we do on

84
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,480
Sonics. And whoever's meant to hear it, hears it. And even further, whoever hears it, if it's

85
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,900
meant they can tell others and they can and so on and so on. And that's it. That's the maximum

86
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:34,080
within my discretionary ability, using whatever wisdom I have that anyone any of these things

87
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,340
should go. It's like the new whenever you hear about Christian, I think about 911. It's a perfect

88
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:45,100
example. It's exactly the same thing. Okay, what really happened on 911 was a nuclear demolition,

89
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:53,000
not like your day, right? Okay, so the underground boom reaction, everything turns to dust based on

90
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,140
the yield. You know, if it was half the yield, only like, you know, a third of the building would

91
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:01,700
have turned to dust and the other bit would have just fell on top of it. So right. So it's new.

92
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,820
It was 36 2600 degrees for three months underground, you know,

93
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:14,060
just for just FYI 2000 degrees melt steel 2150 depending on the hour, but around 2000 you'll

94
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:18,840
melt iron somewhere. So it was six or 700 degrees higher above the boiling point of

95
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:27,040
melting point of steel. Anyway, very simple. Alright, so you go ahead. Good luck doing a

96
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:33,160
loose change or Alex Jones or mass alternate me on that. First of all, I have people tell you nukes

97
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:39,380
don't even exist. Right? They don't as they as explained, you know, but no one's ever split an

98
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:45,160
atom. I can assure you for sure has nothing to do with splitting out. You see how waste of time you

99
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:50,100
can project with something's gonna be a waste of time or not, right? But you still put it out there

100
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,480
to the people like Dimitri Kalasov. I've had some really good. Well, one really good discussion

101
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,800
with him. He brought up some things he didn't bring up, but he never added them to his repertoire.

102
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:04,140
He doesn't have to because it's already a thing. But there's a lot of people talking about

103
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,740
alternative Christianity and all this stuff. So I'm telling you, they're all wrong. All of them.

104
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:12,680
So why just like with 911, all these alternative theories are all wrong. It's very simple.

105
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,460
What it was and it's textbook one on one. The biblical stuff and all the religions is biblical

106
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:22,800
one on one is real basic. It's it starts off and it ends off exactly the same way.

107
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:29,120
And there's no religion on the planet, or no Christian on the planet that knows what I'm

108
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,840
talking about, unless they, you know, break away. And there are, you know, and there are many that

109
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:38,240
do, but they don't talk about it. They're smart enough, right? No, just like that wave that book

110
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,160
around and they've never even read it. They have no concept. Yeah. And even though I knocked the

111
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:49,480
knock worthy, you'll see that there's no crucifixion, no matter how many times they

112
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:58,900
use the word crucifixion. So and on and on and on. So yeah, so B is Baptist, the same as Muslim is

113
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:05,060
the same as Catholic as the same variation. Yeah. And is it satanic or demonic? Absolutely.

114
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,020
Well, from a certain perspective, it's all just noise distracting you from the reality.

115
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:14,620
Yeah. And the reason if you want to discern anything, it's just like, especially Christians,

116
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,820
very simple. If they show you crucifix, they talk about Christmas. That's the imposter. It's 100%

117
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:27,240
the imposter. So the Satan put puts the Satan, the adversary puts the put something completely

118
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:32,260
false as you're chasing that. And you're done. Have a nice day. Well, that's one of the keys

119
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:37,840
in every single story that repeats as something about the adversary arriving and implementing

120
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:45,320
a plan. What do they always do? They claim to be an agent of peace, of goodness, right? And

121
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:51,840
denying the existence of the adversary, right? For themselves. Of course. Well, a thief would deny,

122
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:56,240
right? You know, someone gets caught stealing. Did you recall? You said, No, I didn't steal

123
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:02,720
denial. That's the legal thing to always deny. The legal thing is in denying and then intimidation.

124
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:08,680
So yeah, speaking of which, I'm getting some feedback from people dealing with attorneys

125
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:13,040
and how they get angry when you ask them questions about law, and how they come back and say,

126
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:17,000
No, that's not the law. And but if you ask them for the law, they don't know anything.

127
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,780
It's very typical, right? So Oh, by the way, the comp one of the common answers by your segue,

128
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,740
with the attorneys is very simple. When you start bringing up certain fundamentals of law,

129
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:32,540
which they cannot answer. They say, Well, I don't do that kind of law. I do this kind of law,

130
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:39,100
right? Or, or the another wiggle room is as if the laws in question, we have a jury trial,

131
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,680
those are the two answers they always always give is that because if they're part of some

132
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,480
pre recorded message, it's it's the funniest thing in the world.

133
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:52,640
It's funny, I love how the grand deception is always preceded by the you go to see the doctor,

134
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,920
you have to deal with law, you have to you know, the government,

135
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,320
grand deception, it's all deception, all of it. Well, what I think I brought up scale, you know,

136
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:08,240
yeah, the ancient Greeks believe we've already died in another world. And this is the in between

137
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:14,520
time here, this life here. Right? So you're already dead, as has been spoken of in many

138
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:19,060
ancient texts, the walking dead and whatever, you know, right? Yeah. Well, did you have another

139
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:24,420
question? Well, yeah, there was this other one. And let me let me just get to my reference here

140
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:31,820
to make sure I got it straight. Let's see. All right. You know, here's, let me boil it down real

141
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:35,700
quick. Okay, because again, it was a long convoluted, like, da, da, da, da, da, da.

142
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,220
Anyway, they're looking at Biden, and they're looking at him being dysfunctional. And they're

143
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,040
looking all around them and seeing other dysfunctional old people. And they're saying

144
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:50,640
Greek, is there a way a fit and proper spiritually, you know, according to the way things should go?

145
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:56,660
Shouldn't we, you know, do something with our elders? How do we treat those that have become

146
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:00,320
old and infirm? What is the fit and proper way to deal?

147
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,840
Well, I before we go, yeah, okay. But But you mentioned Biden twice there. So look,

148
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:12,580
sorry, keep bringing the pieces because Biden is not Biden is a clone. I think they're on like the

149
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:18,000
second or third one right now. Right? Really? Okay. Yeah. And then say, well, this is a clone.

150
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,740
And then another one will emerge. I'm not saying hack of pieces because of the

151
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:27,620
presidential whatever, I couldn't care when a clone is a clone is a clone. It's a copy.

152
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,920
So when you hack a clone to pieces, its consciousness gets transferred immediately back.

153
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:38,200
And they put it in another one or in the original body. The clone is doesn't have any

154
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:45,200
rightful ownership of the body. I don't believe that murder and all that other stuff and torture

155
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:53,200
applies to clones. Okay. Right. But the torture and the murder experience will,

156
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,500
will could damage the mental capacity of the one that's in it.

157
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:03,060
Well, it'll still get carried as an abortion argument, because you need an abortion argument.

158
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:09,140
Well, you need the spirit or whatever to animate Yeah, is it the original spirit,

159
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:13,740
then it would be just like hacking or killing the person. But clones are in my book,

160
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:20,400
if I were to start a religion or an abomination, when they're done secretly. Now you could do it

161
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:26,480
ritualistically, where we have someone that we need to keep around. And when everyone knows,

162
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:32,760
on this day, we're going to transfer him to his clone. And it's approved that you have a synthetic

163
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:40,220
human, right? But then the the original body, what happens to that? It's just a shell. No,

164
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,740
and then the spirit transfers over and then you're just as good as gold, you know,

165
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:49,280
if it's a good enough clone. Yeah, but once you buy it, and whether they're at least on the second,

166
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,880
more than the second, third or fourth one right now,

167
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:55,860
but once the original is gone, you can never redeem and replay it like you can never actually

168
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:02,980
restore then Kenya. You probably could you would use the same DNA to grow the clone.

169
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:10,040
cloning is a very simple process, folks. I'm not going to get into it. But there's secrets,

170
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:15,640
you need certain kinds of salts, and they're on the market. Should I should I disclose that? I

171
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,460
forgot what they're called. But I know I know how to find them. Go ahead and take up this time. I'm

172
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:29,660
going to research right now. Well, the reality, excuse me of salt and water, excuse me, seems

173
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:35,720
to be a constant, right? Where a lot of things and different types of salt. I got it. Good. They're

174
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:42,420
called cell salts, cell salts. Okay. Yeah, they're available. They're expensive as hell. Highlands

175
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:48,440
makes them. They're the homeopathic type salt. Those cell salts here, homeopathic cell salts.

176
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,580
They're started in Europe. I believe that they leaked out from the early

177
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:58,420
boys from Brazil. Right. Okay. Anyone? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. And of course, I don't sell salt.

178
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:03,619
All right. Okay. That's that's what you need. And you need a certain kind of water. So I wouldn't

179
00:17:03,619 --> 00:17:07,819
you would have to use spring water. You know, you wouldn't you wouldn't want to go.

180
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:12,260
If you got distilled water, you have to know what it was distilled from.

181
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,520
Right. You know, you would use spring water. You don't want to just source straight from tap. Yeah.

182
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,440
Right. But you could if the tap was from a spring, but it's tortured already.

183
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:26,599
Speaking of which, let's bounce around here. I got a message today is the follow up six

184
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:32,660
month on a scalarator plus. Okay. Six months plus. Victoria White is her name. And I'll mention her

185
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:37,780
name because she's a public person. She has a Web site. It's called Structured Air and Water

186
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:43,420
dot com. I think. All right. Victoria White. She's outside of Tucson. She got she has a

187
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:47,260
scalarator and I could read it's a long text. Why don't I just read the message?

188
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:53,360
It tends to have better so I could get it on a stupid rectangle. Sure. Why not? I mean,

189
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,600
if you can, you know, if it's OK to disclose, why not just relate it? Yeah. She's a public

190
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:03,120
shows a Web site about water. So, OK, might as well. It would be seen as a promotion.

191
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:09,700
Right. All right. So good to hear from you. Let's see where I'm at. Oh, my gosh. Because

192
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm thinking it's salt, you know, back to the salt. OK, here we go. Yeah. Cell salts would

193
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,480
be C.E.L.L. like like a cell. Yeah, right. Right. Got you. I think there's only. Yeah,

194
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:23,100
there's also S.E.L., which is in commerce, but no cell salts. Right. So there you go.

195
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:28,300
Cell salts. And then you need to move it. Oscillates. OK. Anyway, here's the Victoria

196
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:32,480
White. She has a Web site. I think it's called Structured Air and Water dot com or something.

197
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:40,680
OK. She has she pedals. She traffics mostly in the natural action technology guys. By the way,

198
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:45,940
everybody now that's left in natural action technology is just punching in and punching

199
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:52,660
out. They couldn't make these. I call them and I do mean it a little facetiously.

200
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,640
What's his name? Nolte, the guy who made these balls and all these balls.

201
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:01,860
OK. It's like golf balls in a PVC pipe, supposedly structures water. Nobody there.

202
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:07,980
If they're making that or golf club equipment or condoms or working in a tractor factory,

203
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,240
it doesn't matter. So Jonathan Butts, who was the leader there, passed away,

204
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:18,120
was the last person there knows anything about water. I'm not knocking natural action tech.

205
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:23,080
And if it sounds like I'm knocking them, maybe they deserve it. But I'm not. My intention is

206
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,180
not that I'm just telling you guys what's going on there, because if you call them with a question

207
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,960
about water, they're going to tell you to go watch videos because they don't know anything.

208
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:36,020
But she traffics mostly in their stuff. Structured Water and Air, by the way,

209
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:41,600
does have a Web site, Structured Water and Air dot com. Is that is this the one? Let's see.

210
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,920
Victoria White. Yeah, it's kind of a blue background, Tucson. It's the

211
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,120
address is Tucson, Arizona. It's more close, closer to Ohio, Arizona. But

212
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:54,740
so here's our message. Sure. We also recently had a little talk about animals in the Garden of Eden,

213
00:19:55,060 --> 00:20:00,940
you know, turning into a food forest now. But OK. Yes. Right. We also recently had our well

214
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:07,280
die. It was in the ground almost 20 years, so it was ready to be replaced. When they pulled it out,

215
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,680
they commented on what exceptional water we have, unlike other wells they have seen in the area.

216
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:18,560
And that pump still looks shiny and brand new. No buildup on it at all. It hadn't been if it

217
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:23,560
hadn't been for freezing up. You would think it was new, meaning the motor stopped working.

218
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:27,560
Sure. I'm wondering if our structured water may have been trained all the way back to the

219
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:32,460
source. Interesting, given the fact that this was a family business and decades of working on wells

220
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:38,480
in the Tucson area. We're so blessed to not have a scale problem like many others. I'm so grateful

221
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,940
to you. Thank you again. Wondering if the water had been trained all the way back to the source.

222
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:49,000
Water. That's well, that's what I mentioned with the scale orator works backwards and forward.

223
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:57,080
OK. Yeah. So, right. That's I mean, that's pretty. It's just like a power line. If it's on the ground,

224
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,840
it doesn't matter where you grab it. I got you. I'm just pointing to the word trained,

225
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,280
though. It's interesting because trained and trained and trained. OK. And trained means,

226
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:12,660
you know, infuse or whatever. So now this is a good six month testimonial because I did mention

227
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:22,600
to her. See if you can. If you were in contact with others that are from the same water source

228
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:27,100
and see if they're noticing a change. And she's never responded to that.

229
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:33,740
And the answer will probably be less or no. I mean, less or no. I mean, not that much information.

230
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,680
But I don't know if anybody is familiar with how well pumps work. You know,

231
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,220
they're submerged. You know, they're well pumps that are not submerged.

232
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,820
But any well pump, anything that's been in the ground for 20 years in water,

233
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,820
you pull it up and dry it out. It doesn't look very happy. It doesn't look like a clean machine.

234
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,760
Not at all. No. Yeah. This one looked like it was just in there for a week

235
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,180
and it was just burned out, meaning the froze, she said, meaning that the motor stopped. Right.

236
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:01,200
So it's working constantly because she has that. She's got four acres of apricot trees,

237
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,680
apple trees and all that other stuff, which I enjoyed quite a bit of apricots,

238
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:11,800
a few hundred apricots this year and all that. And but anyway, I just wanted to put that out

239
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:18,300
there because you just keep adding testimonials because this is new. I mean, it's not an airplane

240
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,880
where you have to fly it around for, what, four years before someone, you know, boards it as a

241
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,020
passenger. The sclerator has only been around for a year and two months. Right. Or three months.

242
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:34,560
So you're two months, let's say. So it's still very new. But the predictions that I made based

243
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:40,040
on the early observations are starting to hold hold true, which is pretty good. Pretty good.

244
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:44,800
So she's not offering the sclerator on our website or anything. No,

245
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:50,400
no one really is. And that's by my decision. Also, if someone said I want to do that, I said, no,

246
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:55,780
it's still too soon. I think I need to get even more. You really won't know until you get 100

247
00:22:55,780 --> 00:23:02,180
units out. Right. Or so. But from the what can be surmised. So I just want to put that out there

248
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:07,240
because I did the seminar on the sclerator with over 40 people. And if you're still planning on

249
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,800
building them or whatever, I hope it just adds more confidence to what you in the mix,

250
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,560
let's say, you know, to what you're doing. So, you know, how would it work in a well?

251
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:23,840
Well, water and what would you expect? There you go. So, yeah, I just try to pull up some emails

252
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,060
and I just signed out so I could do that again. But basically the questions, one of them was

253
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:34,640
fellows name is an alternative guy talks about more gallons.

254
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,220
Oh, yeah, that that weird thing that looks like one of those creepy crawlies that flies down a

255
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:45,200
wall file for bio farming, archons and all that stuff. And I did watch a little bit of this stuff

256
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:51,000
once before. And this his name brought it up again. And I'll just tell you what very simply.

257
00:23:53,140 --> 00:24:01,760
It's a Harold Cox Vela cut. That's where the k a u t z Vela transhumanism or gallons,

258
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:08,860
archons, quantum dots, AI, black magic, black goo, money, and healing for the love of truth.

259
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,260
What's his first name?

260
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:19,980
How Harold, Harold, all A's, Harold, all A's, couch Vela, B, L, L, A, and Harold is all A's,

261
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:25,980
a, h, a, r, a, l, d. I saw some of his stuff. He's seen his well intended. He's been

262
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:30,880
doing some a lot of public stuff for quite a while. But he thinks the body absorbs

263
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:38,440
things. So he doesn't show. Okay. I'm not saying he's on the wrong track. But I think his work

264
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:45,220
would be far more refined and far more accurate if he got some Greek speak, right?

265
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,660
And this guy's written a few books, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's been, you know,

266
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,400
it's the alternative, whatever. Yeah. Okay.

267
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,440
Well, no, what you'll do is you'll group all these topics that I just mentioned.

268
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:03,620
But if you have, if you have Greek speak under your belt, you'll be like, dude,

269
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:08,060
I like what you're saying, but you got to get to get, you got to look, you got a dozen points that

270
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:15,340
you need to revisit. So gotcha. It's not impeccable. No, I'm just looking at impeccable,

271
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:19,980
but valid topics, all of them. Right. And I'm just looking over his little Pinterest. Actually,

272
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:25,780
he's got a little Pinterest. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's just, there's no, yeah. Yeah. You know,

273
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:32,300
the whole thing about the relevance of caloric intake for food, the relevance of high blood

274
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:36,300
pressure, the relevance of blood, you know, there's no blood glucose or blood sugar level,

275
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:39,400
you know that, right. There's no such thing, you know, that's created by an algorithm.

276
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:44,300
Right. You don't have to mix your blood. Yeah. They make certain things in with the blood sample

277
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:50,920
and then they measure how much hydrogen peroxide is created in the blood. And that is an analog

278
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:56,820
for how much glucose is in your blood. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Yeah. It's got nothing to do

279
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:01,760
with what you just added. Nothing to do with glucose. Yeah. They'll just make shit up. Like

280
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:07,880
my favorite one is AIDS auto immune, whatever deficient, what immune there is no,

281
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:13,600
I think Harold brought to the immune system. You know, there is no immune system, right?

282
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:20,740
When you ask these morons the doctors to explain the immune system and pretend you're taking notes,

283
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,420
have a notepad there. And when they go through everything in the immune system,

284
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,700
you make some points. So, so you just said it's elimination of this white blood cell elimination,

285
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:33,880
elimination of that elimination. Oh, so you're talking about the eliminated system. You still

286
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:38,240
haven't brought up any evidence of an immune system. It's all elimination. There is no,

287
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:45,360
there is no immune system. It's the elimination system. Okay. The immune system. Okay. You live

288
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:51,700
in a suburb or city. Okay. You know what the immune system is? You take the garbage out for

289
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:56,600
garbage night pickup. You take the trash out and put it out in the can in the alley. And then that

290
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:02,360
goes to the curb to be picked up by the truck. And then the truck takes it to the landfill where

291
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:06,600
it's, does that sound like a new system? Or does this sound like an elimination system?

292
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:11,760
Sounds to me like a filtering system, actually. It's a matter of what you're getting rid of,

293
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:17,060
right? So total elimination filtering would be that you have a mix and agglomerate and you want

294
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:21,460
certain things and you don't want others. Segregation is filtering. Well, that's what it

295
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:26,140
sounds like. You're taking out the garbage. So you're deciding to take contents away.

296
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:32,640
The bad stuff, maybe from the good stuff. Yeah. Right. Sort of. Yeah. No, not even. Well,

297
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:37,640
okay. So no matter how they explain the immune system, it ends up being the eliminative system,

298
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:42,460
which is very well known and discussed for a hundred years prior to the invention of the

299
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:48,760
immune system. I haven't never, I hammered calories. You know, there's no calorie caloric

300
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:54,020
relevance to food at all. Unless you're, unless you're pooping charcoal briquettes. Now, if you

301
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:58,480
go number two and you get charcoal coming out every time, well, you better watch your caloric

302
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:05,120
intake. Yeah. Right. But if you're not pooping charcoal, you know, like black carbon briquettes,

303
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:09,040
you know, that you could go out and put on the fire. If you're not, if you're not pooping that

304
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:15,340
caloric value of food is completely moot. Right. And then if they strap a cuff on your arm and tell

305
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:21,540
you that you have blood pressure problems, that is like tying a string on the end of your finger

306
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:28,980
and saying, you got purpleitis, stupiditis, blueitis. Right. What kind of shit is take the,

307
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:34,600
never put the string on your finger and you don't have any stupiditis. Don't put the cuff on your

308
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:39,440
arm and guess what? Bam. No blood pressure. Go imagine. Right. What I always thought was weird

309
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,920
about the name aid, you know, when they named it AIDS, cause initially it was called grid,

310
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:49,260
but it's acquired. The first word in there is acquired. Yeah. Yeah. You acquire it because

311
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:53,700
you believe that you've been diagnosed. I've seen the stuff, by the way, I've seen it, what they do

312
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,060
ensure it. Life insurance companies, very, very thing. You need a postcard. You put a

313
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:02,720
blot on there. If they tell you, you have a, they go tested. Right. And when you get tested,

314
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:07,540
they said they no one knows. They'd never said anyone had AIDS. You got to read it very carefully,

315
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:14,980
not so carefully. They say that you have been tested and could have a possible diagnosis for

316
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:20,660
a very serious illness, or you might've been diagnosed or you might, the most severe they're

317
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:28,600
going to get is that you show that you have been diagnosed with what could be a possibly severe

318
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:34,340
illness. And then you start getting letters. You should consider treatment. Now, anyone who's

319
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:39,100
gotten that letter that they were diagnosed, not that they have it very carefully,

320
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:46,500
like no one has cancer. You've been diagnosed with cancer. No. Ask any doctor that tells you

321
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:50,880
you're diabetic or high, but you write it down on a piece of paper. I have it. They will not do it.

322
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,340
They know that much. They're not that stupid. They will never write it down and sign it ever.

323
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,180
So it's all presumption. Now, anyone who's gotten those letters who just threw the letters in the

324
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:04,240
garbage is still alive and fine. I'm talking about the eighties and nineties, right? When it

325
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,720
was big promotion, the only time people come down with AIDS is when they put these billboards up,

326
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:13,540
go get tested for AIDS. And then a year later, you got a whole bunch of people dying from it.

327
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:18,520
Isn't it funny? This is, this is by the way, being made what everything I'm telling you is

328
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:25,960
being made fun of by X hospital administrators and doctors. I've heard them are retired. We'll

329
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:30,580
laugh about it. The same with the diabetes, the same with the high blood pressure. They laugh

330
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:38,200
about these things now. Uh, maybe they should be cloned also, but maybe they are ready. I mean,

331
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,260
maybe they are. I think they would be. That's how you have an alien invasion.

332
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:46,280
You have, uh, look human and they do make humans do really stupid stuff.

333
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:52,200
By the way, when you've got treatment for diabetes or AIDS comes down and it gets worse

334
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:58,320
and worse and worse and worse. And then you die, you pass. I've known several people and, uh, like

335
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,160
someone who knows it's all in, they won't get it. And I said, well, they're going to die. Well,

336
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,760
you know, they're like, Oh, really? I'm like, yeah, watch. You know, they're going to get,

337
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:09,260
you know, they're going to kill them. So this is the stuff that I'm talking about. Someone's saying

338
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:14,460
that doesn't make any sense because that sounds like Nazi Germany, concentration camp, doctor type

339
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:19,940
shit. Yeah. Yeah. Fool. That's right. That's right. That's exactly what's going on. You have

340
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:26,500
an open hair concentration camp, Mengele type motherfuckers running at, uh, at, um, they're,

341
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:33,380
they're running about 10 to 50,000 deep, maybe a hundred thousand deep is how they roll. What,

342
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:39,380
what do you mean by that? Dr. Mengele types. Dr. Mengele was a boy scout compared to these people,

343
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:43,760
right? Cause he was, you could say that he was doing valid research. You know, he was cutting

344
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:49,220
people in half and sewing them back together. Right. Right. So, uh, to see how they would heal

345
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:52,700
and to advance that these people just say, come here, take our drugs so you can die.

346
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,440
See Mengele when he did his stuff, he's, I'm not doing this so they could die.

347
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:00,340
I'm doing this weird shit to see if they could live or how to make them live.

348
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:08,240
These doctors are doing it so you can die. Right? So these doctors, they run, they could run up to

349
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,080
half a million deep. They could be running up to half a million deep mean a half a million of

350
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:17,820
these motherfuckers running around. And they're usually put into administrative situations,

351
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:23,060
meaning that they run the whole department of the, what the doctors do. Right. So they

352
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:26,780
get the guy who doesn't know what's going on to do their dirty work. This is the reality

353
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:34,320
of, um, uh, American medicine predominantly. It's also going on in Europe because you can't say

354
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:39,560
there are no cases for AIDS or diabetes in Europe. There are not as many, but the most of it,

355
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,000
you know, just like I mentioned to someone in the medical industry,

356
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,220
is it only countries that have treatment for diabetes? Does the population have diabetes?

357
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:55,360
Only countries that have treatment for AIDS? Does anyone in the population get AIDS? And they're

358
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:02,140
looking at me like, what does that mean? The treatment is the disease, right? So now, yeah,

359
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:07,800
these are like what you call Nazi type, you know, concentration camp people. They're still bragging

360
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:12,420
about how many people they killed over COVID on, on the ventilators would sit, you know,

361
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:17,280
with, uh, they sedate them and starve them to death. Right. And the families come in and thank

362
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:22,860
them. And you got to admit that was efficient, you know, that was pretty efficient. Yeah. So

363
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:26,880
the whole thing is just, it ain't going to get better. I think unless you start seeing, like,

364
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:30,960
they line these doctors up and like, they just clear out, imagine like a big football field.

365
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:35,640
And what are those big machine guns called? Those, uh, 50 caliber or whatever, and just start,

366
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:41,160
you know, make a big ditch Gatling. Yeah, yeah, where they dig the ditch, and they have them

367
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:45,660
stand over the ditch, and then they shoot them all. Then the next run comes in. This is the human

368
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:50,700
history. So when you look at how could they be doing this to all these people, these mass executions

369
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:55,380
and all that, you don't really know the whole story behind that. Right. And you see, so in other

370
00:33:55,380 --> 00:34:00,340
words, if that starts happening, again, don't be surprised, don't be shocked. Right? Give me an

371
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:04,800
example. You know, the whole woke thing that's going, I did some research on this about two

372
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:10,120
years ago, and I was shocked what I could find. It's really hard to find, but you can find

373
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:18,760
literature, what was going on in Germany between the 19 after World War One in the 1920s, early 30s

374
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:23,620
is exactly what's going on with the woke regarding, you know, cutting your dick off,

375
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:30,560
men dressing like women and women dress like men. If you go start looking at the literature and the

376
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:36,179
publications in Berlin, and other parts of Germany, not Germany, mostly not Austria.

377
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:42,000
They were telling you were encouraging young boys to get a sex change or dressed up like girls.

378
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:48,239
They were encouraging women. It was like one out of three women in Berlin were prostitutes.

379
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:54,159
They're encouraged women to get into the sex trade. And remember, this is post World War One,

380
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:59,560
where they got the German Chancellor to agree to reparations and destroyed the country, right? The

381
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:06,200
you know, the story of post World War One. Yeah, the destruction of it. Right. So they were doing

382
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:10,500
all the woke stuff, or all the perverted shit you see going on with the woke stuff,

383
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:16,320
not so much with the racist stuff. But what they were doing was they were making popular all the

384
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:22,920
debauchery in early Germany. And so when the Third Reich came in, when they did the book burnings,

385
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,160
that's what it was. They were burning those publications, telling boys to cut their dick

386
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:32,360
off. And I'm serious, it's pretty harsh. And they were cleaning up like, why is this, you know,

387
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:37,820
woman, three children prostituting herself, you know, because the periodicals and the professors

388
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:43,840
and the academia of the day, were backing all this up. So the the gray shirts who came in,

389
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:51,420
then they became the brown shirts. We got to clean this up. Right. So hint, hint. Right.

390
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:57,480
You know, go try to do some research on you know, you know what the woke movement how it is,

391
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:02,480
well, the sexually or cut your dick off, right? Yeah, all that stuff. Yeah. And or put a dick on

392
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:08,820
if you're a woman. All that stuff was going exactly exactly was going on in Berlin in 1920s

393
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:15,600
and 30s. Very hard to research. I came across some German video might have been on video or

394
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:22,760
something. And very poor translation about prior third. So basically, the prior Third Reich,

395
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:28,460
post World War One prior to Third Reich, what was what was put on Germany was the same stuff

396
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:34,340
that's put on the Western nations right now. And I only I'm bringing this up because,

397
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:39,060
you know, Dr. You know, the the atrocities of the German doctors, you know, what you're

398
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:43,800
actually doing tests for high altitude, you know, right, if you lose atmosphere and a high altitude

399
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,400
airplane, what happens? So they put you in a vacuum chamber, right? Right. You know,

400
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:52,100
prisoners and slaves and, you know, concentration. How long do you stay conscious? How long is

401
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:58,460
Yeah, but but I'm telling you, they're not as bad as these bastards hospital administrators now

402
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:03,320
that are actually, you know, being incentivized by the Department of Health and Human Services.

403
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:08,520
There were letters posted in November, people in the medical industry. Why are why I work in

404
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,540
the administrative hospital? Why are we getting letters that if someone gets put on a ventilator,

405
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:18,480
we get 150,000? Why are we getting letters that if they get a vaccine, you know, and they die,

406
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:22,220
they get 50,000? Why are we getting these letters? This is like six, four months before,

407
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:28,020
five months before the COVID thing, right? You know, memo, right. So the other thing is,

408
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:31,880
when you have a big machine, like the medical system, and the government agencies and all that,

409
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:36,940
they work very slow. So when you're in the system, and you start getting these odd letters,

410
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:42,420
you know, about changing what they call policy and things like that. It's quite a fair warning,

411
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:49,500
you can imagine like four or five, six months ahead. Right? Just like colonels in the in the

412
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:54,280
military, we're getting briefed on a 911 type of event six months before, right?

413
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:00,980
Yeah, two years before, actually, two years before. Yeah. So you have plenty of heads up

414
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:06,760
up to two years. Yeah. Well, if you know, what is it Project Northwoods? You had 4050 years?

415
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:10,720
Well, yeah, that that's the, you know, part of the stuff with the remote planes. And it's like,

416
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,600
oh, gee, they didn't have technology do that. Well, then why did the Pentagon propose doing

417
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:21,120
it in 1962? You know, 61? Because they had the technology to do, you know, the military doesn't

418
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:26,020
volunteer to go do something, if they don't have the equipment to pull it off, is all I'm saying.

419
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:30,340
Right. So, you know, when they said we could take a remote control plane and fake an incident

420
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:34,280
and blow it up over here, we don't even have to actually have the students on it,

421
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,160
we could have them on it. But all we got to do is tell them that after they see a blown up plane,

422
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:42,840
yeah, and you know, they wanted to keep that thing going, where they crashed a small,

423
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:48,760
supposedly a small plane in the IRS building. Remember that? Years up? Yeah, no one saw a

424
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:54,160
plane or anything. They hired people to say that they saw a plane, but no, but they didn't get

425
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,980
their script right. So they didn't include that. No. And at the end of it, it was supposedly one

426
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:03,200
guy decided to commit suicide, right? Yeah, but it wasn't Yeah, it's just bizarre. So it wasn't even

427
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,820
that it was the whole thing was completely staged. I don't know how they staged it. But I'm just

428
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:11,880
saying that was the story they ran with. I'm not Yeah, right, right to cover up the mess. Yeah.

429
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,160
I don't know what else to say that, you know, it's just about covering up a mess somehow.

430
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,280
There you go.
