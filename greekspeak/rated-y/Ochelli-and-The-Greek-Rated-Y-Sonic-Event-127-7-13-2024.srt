1
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,340
Rated Y, Sonic Event 127.

2
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,440
My voice is a little weak today, but that's okay.

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,140
You didn't tune in to really hear from me.

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,520
How you doing, Greek?

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:17,740
All right.

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:18,200
We're doing.

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,680
You messaged me that there was an attempt on Trump.

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,460
You're supposed to bring that up, but I'm bringing it up, and I saw something on YouTube

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,520
right before we came on.

10
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,720
Yeah, they got it on YouTube pretty quick.

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,760
They killed the shooter instantly.

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,280
I was about to say, yeah, this is standard stuff I've talked about.

13
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:41,060
There's going to be either an assassination attempt, a flash economic disaster like 2008,

14
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:45,240
but a flash one with no reason, reasons that didn't make sense, right?

15
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,960
Because they're Ukrainian war.

16
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,220
This is all just showmanship.

17
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,060
How about all of the above, Greek, because I'm thinking, you know, this is still early

18
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,100
before the election.

19
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,320
People's memory holes are big enough that this stuff could disappear by then.

20
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:04,760
Look, there's no economic ... 2008 was an economic crash.

21
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,840
I remember it was an election with Bush, and I think it's when Obama went in, right?

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,080
That's when Obama went in, yes.

23
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:09,580
Yeah.

24
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:09,880
Yeah.

25
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,180
Okay.

26
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:18,220
So all this is the corporation, Title 28, Section 3002, Subsection 15, the United States

27
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,200
defined as?

28
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:20,280
A corporation.

29
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,080
A federal corporation.

30
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:21,400
Yeah.

31
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:21,900
A federal corporation.

32
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,040
Yeah.

33
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,320
Yeah.

34
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,620
So it's all just corporate magic, corporate junk.

35
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,360
It depends on ... watch the movie Founder.

36
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,500
Founder.

37
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:29,980
Okay.

38
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,220
The guy who played Beetlejuice was in it.

39
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,120
Michael Keaton?

40
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,580
Yeah, Michael Keaton.

41
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:35,280
He does a great job.

42
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,760
It was about how McDonald's came about.

43
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:42,760
Two brothers with high integrity, he takes it, steals it from them, he says, you know,

44
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,000
competition, competition.

45
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,020
If I saw my competitor drowning, I would stick a hose in his mouth.

46
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:47,640
Okay.

47
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:53,560
This is the story of corporatism, and that's what you're under ... see, I'm in total, utter

48
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,300
disgust of just about every human around me for a long time.

49
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,320
That seems to be a newly emerging thing.

50
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,860
People are telling me about this all the time, that they're actually sick of everybody around

51
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,060
them.

52
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,740
They're sick of ...

53
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,240
Yeah, but this has been going on for decades for me, and now it's easy to speak.

54
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:10,600
Well, that's an odd question.

55
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,680
Wait a second.

56
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,640
Before you get there, there's an odd question that came in that links to this perfectly,

57
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,420
so let's hit it on your way through.

58
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:24,560
Because somebody asked, were you always like this, with this unique perspective, or was

59
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,660
there an event that caused you to see it, and if so, when did that happen?

60
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,900
In other words, like I'm 12 years old, this changed for me, I realized this, or I'm 20

61
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,320
years old.

62
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,340
Is there an event?

63
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,420
Is there a time period?

64
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:42,520
Is there something in particular that made the guy who was you before the way you are

65
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,780
now, with the kind of perspective you have, is there a difference?

66
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,480
Well, when I was two years old, I was sitting up in the crib, the adults were in the other

67
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,700
room, the room that I was in, the door was ajar, the lights were off in the room that

68
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,020
I'm in.

69
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:02,660
Not two years old, I was probably less than a year, because I remember at two, the other

70
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:07,720
sister came, and I was already running around in sneakers, or shoes.

71
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:14,060
So I was very young, and I realized, why are these people so dumb?

72
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,640
Now there's a difference between being dumb and being stupid, right?

73
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,020
Okay, so toddler you, says, looking at the adults, these people are kind of dumb, but

74
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,660
that doesn't mean that you have your perspective yet, but that means you're...

75
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:33,380
Right, no, yeah, but as I was getting older, I noticed that, why did these adults seem

76
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,160
so juvenile?

77
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:42,040
Okay, so they were more immature than they were dumb, or were they, is there a difference?

78
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,980
Juvenile, just like you, okay, so I was learning that pretty soon I'm going to be going to

79
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,180
school every day, right?

80
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,160
Oh, wow, great, finally, a change.

81
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:58,740
So I go to school, whatever, kindergarten, first grade, and I'm like, why are these people

82
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,520
so fucking juvenile?

83
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,700
So acting really like, you know, why, these are adults, you've got to be joking.

84
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,280
So the adults at home are juvenile, you go, okay, I'm going to go to school, there's going

85
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,220
to be other adults, maybe they won't be as juvenile.

86
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,940
Yeah, maybe they're a little quote, unquote, grown up and got their shit together, they

87
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,940
don't have it either together.

88
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,220
Then I started getting out in the world, and I hear about stealing, and lying, and fighting,

89
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,840
and fraud, and you know, the world is full of that, right?

90
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:24,300
Of course.

91
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,360
Yeah, and I was like, oh, that's what they're into.

92
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,300
That's what I want nothing to do with that.

93
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,920
Okay, so you really have always been from that perspective.

94
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:41,480
Now, I did learn your prime, your prime is like between 15 and 25.

95
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:47,800
Okay, what in age what I mean, that's when you your body recovers very quickly from everything.

96
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:53,960
And anything, usually, we're talking about a fairly healthful individual, myself being

97
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,200
that.

98
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:59,540
And also anyone who is healthful, if you're sickly as a child, you know, it's a different

99
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,060
story.

100
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,520
So, or, you know, whatever.

101
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,560
So I feel like that's the time period where you have a sign.

102
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,120
That's the time.

103
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,780
15 and 30.

104
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,220
Really?

105
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,560
But it's because I like to have endless energy, right?

106
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,460
Because that's right.

107
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,060
You're not easily exhausted.

108
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,320
Isn't that the key to that time period?

109
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,660
And if you happen to be good looking and smart, at the same time, you have more advantages,

110
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:22,600
right?

111
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,200
To a degree.

112
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,180
See, I don't know, good looking people, it seems to me get off easier and don't get challenged

113
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:28,580
as bad.

114
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:28,980
Right.

115
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,680
And you know, like, just like rich people don't pay for anything.

116
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,300
Yeah, right.

117
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:32,840
Exactly.

118
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,640
Like, you know, you go to a restaurant, they won't let you eat for free.

119
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,700
But in comes like, chef Elon Musk, and he gets to eat for free, right?

120
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:43,520
Yeah, the guy who's getting paid $7 million a movie, they give him a free meal.

121
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,860
But yeah, okay.

122
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:45,400
Okay.

123
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,440
All right.

124
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:53,020
So, so I started, I got very social, socializing various aspects of many, many different societies

125
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:57,200
all the way from the basically homeless, I was homeless for about a week.

126
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,980
And I would in the way you do that would staying on the subway is you write it to the end of

127
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,980
the line in New York City.

128
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:07,620
And then what happens the doors open, and the guys come in with brooms and mop and they

129
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,320
clean up, right?

130
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:08,740
Right.

131
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,300
And they kind of ignore you to tell you that I got to get off to get a cop.

132
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,500
They don't they don't have their own security, right?

133
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,520
They have the transit police, basically, which is like a New York City cop.

134
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,900
Yeah, to tell you to go get off, so you can't be here just anywhere, and they make you leave,

135
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,220
so you have to pay another ticket to come in, but it doesn't matter another token or

136
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:25,520
fare.

137
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:30,180
And you go back on the subway, and you keep writing after a while, you know, you get used

138
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:30,480
to it.

139
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,860
You know, you read the end of the line, sometimes they leave you alone.

140
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:37,960
After like three or four days of this, and other places, there are places I could stay,

141
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,640
but I decided to see what it's like to live out in the wilderness, right?

142
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,180
Okay.

143
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:46,520
Just like when you read about lost hidden tribes, you know, sometimes, you know, Native

144
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,720
American and Native tribes all over the world, when they get start to get killed off, there

145
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,400
might be one tribal member left, and they make it on their own for years and years and

146
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:56,620
years.

147
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,780
So totally by themselves living in the wilderness, right?

148
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,440
So that's the idea.

149
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,820
You know, you've heard of, like, the last man of this tribe was, you know, finally encountered

150
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,520
in Australia or whatever, and he's, you know, they said they killed all of his tribe, he's

151
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,140
the only survivor.

152
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,220
And he's been living in the mountains for 30 years by himself, you know, usually preceded

153
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,960
by a bunch of sightings, the legend of the one guy in the wilderness or whatever.

154
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:17,720
Yeah.

155
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:17,940
Yeah.

156
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,060
They seem to be okay.

157
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,160
So I've tried that.

158
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,640
I've gone over to the high society and all that.

159
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,440
I said, wow.

160
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,040
So how old were you when you went out into the urban wilderness, so to speak?

161
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:28,660
How old were you?

162
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:29,820
17.

163
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:30,620
17.

164
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,140
So you're at your peak mentally, you're inexhaustible.

165
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,580
You're in good shape.

166
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,620
And I wanted to try it.

167
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,520
Let me try this.

168
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:37,860
Okay.

169
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,160
Yeah.

170
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:38,760
Give me an example.

171
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:43,300
I had 2000 bucks access to 2000 bucks and what they call a bank account, which in those

172
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,680
days was be like six or seven thousand, eight thousand now.

173
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:46,900
Right.

174
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,280
Well, yeah, that's a lot of money.

175
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,300
I might be more.

176
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,120
Yeah.

177
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,460
Right.

178
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,740
I would have had access to it.

179
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,380
But I didn't.

180
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,780
You know, it's you know, I didn't use it.

181
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,560
It was long.

182
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:56,800
Sorry.

183
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,480
It's a cosign.

184
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,620
You know, you have to get someone else's signature to get the money.

185
00:07:59,760 --> 00:07:59,900
Yeah.

186
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,400
No sweat.

187
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,240
But you could easily access enough money.

188
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:02,980
Yeah.

189
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,440
I didn't have to.

190
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,440
So I tried all of a sudden.

191
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,800
I tried this, tried that, even like some people said they were.

192
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,080
Let's go skydiving.

193
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,060
And like, oh, yeah, this is crazy.

194
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:16,480
And you know, why do I want to do things that make me miserable, like riding a roller coaster

195
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,080
or whatever?

196
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:17,480
Right.

197
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,000
It's just it makes me miserable.

198
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,900
So I started realizing that sometimes you do have to do they call it a compromise, right?

199
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,760
In a relationship, at work, whatever you compromise.

200
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:32,000
But deliberately, when I started seeing people doing things that made me miserable, like riding

201
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,620
a roller coaster, that G-Force is not makes me miserable.

202
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,140
Skydiving makes me miserable.

203
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,480
All the all these thrills.

204
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:39,799
It's like these things are really through.

205
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,460
Why do they seek these things?

206
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:48,080
So, OK, when I say I'm disgusted by the humans around me, all I do and want to do now is

207
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,860
just take notes.

208
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,580
Like I say, I'm just visiting, taking notes.

209
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:57,760
I sit back and I watch how they behave and how they're being ruled, right, which is actually

210
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,660
a very loose hand.

211
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:02,500
Now, I'm for all for Nietzsche, the common man should be ruled with an iron fist.

212
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,440
Like I'm 100 percent for a real war, a good war wipes out 70 percent of the population

213
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:14,100
or a real pandemic, a real one that wipes out 70 to 80 percent of the population.

214
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:20,040
What that'll do, it'll give you some more breathing room, right, and a more organic

215
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:20,960
organization.

216
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:21,480
Right.

217
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,980
Now, these things I'm saying are coming.

218
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,240
But, you know, I'd like to see that, you know, sooner than they are.

219
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:26,480
Right.

220
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:26,920
OK.

221
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:28,660
Right.

222
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,020
So, you remember, you only need two people to survive, to keep things going.

223
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,360
So and there's plenty that will.

224
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,880
But these types of resets are necessary.

225
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:46,360
I believe the last one that happened was when we were shown the orphan trains, civil war.

226
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,380
You know, people don't talk about the the Civil War period starting like in 1840, something

227
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,700
maybe six or seven, the Crimean Wars.

228
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,440
Everybody was at war.

229
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,080
There were revolutions and civil wars and country wars all over the world in the 1800s.

230
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,980
Yeah. In the 1840 to 1870, it was it was rocking.

231
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,600
It was worse than World War Two.

232
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,660
Right. In terms of number of conflicts and even France.

233
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,060
I mean, even France, where they, you know, they just seem to be perpetually protesting.

234
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,780
They even went to war for real.

235
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,600
Sure. And civil wars and revolutions in Central Europe.

236
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,820
Yeah. Just everything going on.

237
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:23,720
Yeah. OK.

238
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,700
So and then what's all we hear about?

239
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:30,860
We just everything's kind of been made minimal and they call it civil wars, civil war

240
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:35,280
here. But, you know, civil war wasn't adopted until 1920s.

241
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,060
Before that, it was called the War of the States.

242
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,320
And before that, it was the War of Northern Aggression.

243
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,480
But and before the Civil War started, there were, quote unquote, terror cells going around

244
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,100
killing people right in the farms.

245
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:46,960
Right. Yeah.

246
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:53,000
So what's interesting is that all that's been downplayed, including the orphan trains.

247
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,500
Where are these children come from to the adults?

248
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,900
A lot of those killings on the farms were actually corporate backed, you know, mercenaries

249
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:04,860
that were sent in to destroy competition, like in the tobacco wars in Kentucky, which

250
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,180
nobody ever talks about. But a whole lot of people were wiped out.

251
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,120
Farms were just, you know, literally taken over physically because they would literally

252
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,120
walk over, beat the farmer to death with a shovel and declare their farm to be part of

253
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,460
this other farm. That actually went on a whole bunch.

254
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,120
And again, they don't call it a war at all.

255
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,920
But that's what the civil the it was about the basically Lincoln, who was a total punk

256
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:32,340
ass. He got visited, you know, OK, you know, the Constitution, this is really hard to

257
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,280
find. Let me just say it and maybe I'll bring it up again if I could find when the

258
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:41,920
Constitution was written, like 1779, 1780, whatever it went to Europe, it went to the

259
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,260
Vatican. It sat there five or six years.

260
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,800
OK, they got it back and then they sat for another year or two and then they did the

261
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,040
U.S. Constitution. Most people don't know that.

262
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,720
Why would you send it to the Vatican for approval?

263
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:59,340
Right. Also, there's some doublespeak because a lot of doublespeak and federal stuff.

264
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:03,500
Right. Is that before or after the Vatican declared every soul on Earth to belong to

265
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:08,300
them? Is it that was that's around that time or actually the Vatican did that about

266
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,740
four or five times since then.

267
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:15,720
But yeah, I actually popple bulls started in the well, you know, people first century,

268
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,700
first millennium and popple bulls.

269
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,160
Right. So anyway, it's a mess.

270
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,680
But let me just go back to what I see.

271
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,620
I just watch people's behavior.

272
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,300
Sure. And then I watch how they're being ruled and how they do self-rule and how they

273
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:35,620
manage themselves, you know, and, you know, and how they catch themselves and how they

274
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,720
inspire themselves.

275
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,440
And it's it's not fascinating.

276
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,800
It's actually boring as hell.

277
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,820
And it's really dumb.

278
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:44,420
And I just watch just anybody, everybody, anybody and everybody.

279
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,980
And I'm like, we are just here to waste our time.

280
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,840
This is just a waste of time.

281
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,500
And it goes on and on and on.

282
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:55,660
Most you're giving example, most people, especially working class Americans, whatever

283
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:59,380
that is, if you say you have a class in America and you have a caste system, right,

284
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,360
they look forward to wasting their time.

285
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:08,060
It's called Super Bowl sports Friday night, Monday night, whatever, going on vacation,

286
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,620
but all these nonproductive things that they look for because they know it's a waste

287
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,160
of time. Everybody's wasting each other's time.

288
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,380
Right. So getting this message out could be a waste of time also.

289
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,620
Well, universally, it just used to be the television.

290
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,080
Everybody would gather around that.

291
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,580
And that was it. Time would disappear.

292
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,800
Well, that yeah.

293
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,260
The television is what rules you.

294
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,660
There's still people, for example, I heard this thing the other day.

295
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,700
Someone being here. He's really upset at the no plane.

296
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,020
The people in the 9-11 conspiracy movement that say there were no planes.

297
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,040
And I wanted to put in the comments section.

298
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,580
You're both right. Meaning whoever saw the event, witnessed it on television, saw

299
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:48,360
planes. But whoever was boots on the ground that day saw no planes.

300
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,880
He just saw the side of the building explode.

301
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,940
So you're both right.

302
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,500
You see, you don't say one is, oh, you're an idiot for believing there's planes or

303
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,400
anything. There's no place. Just say, give the facts.

304
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,880
It's a fact. Right.

305
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,600
So, you know, that's how you move it and move ahead.

306
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:09,220
You know, you know, like I had a neurosurgeon I was speaking to and so many hours.

307
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,320
It's like I kind of told him he doesn't know what he's doing, but he's a neurosurgeon.

308
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,780
He kind of got the message.

309
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:18,080
He's like, well, I guess as long as people get run over by trucks, they'll need a

310
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,660
neurosurgeon. Wow.

311
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,740
You know, so it's just so ridiculous.

312
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:28,960
It is so my favorite thing that, you know, in the movie Idiocracy, watch it again.

313
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:33,160
Yeah. When the lawyer finally starts to turn around because he's declared the

314
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,760
smartest. He says they're in Costco.

315
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,060
This is where I studied law in Costco.

316
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,480
Perfect. This is exactly what's going on.

317
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:47,860
These idiots. What I would suggest is since it's a fact for me and I could

318
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,640
disclose, I would stand on this issue.

319
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,760
Welcome to Costco. I love you.

320
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,100
Yeah, I would stand on the issue that everyone's here to waste each other's time more

321
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,620
than anything else I've ever said.

322
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,220
OK. Ever. It would be the paramount.

323
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:05,880
So what you're telling me is that that Sonic that we did on the meaning of life is the

324
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,480
pinnacle of the pinnacle.

325
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,440
That would be if I had to send that put in a time capsule.

326
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,300
If you had to place to another galaxy, that would be the message.

327
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:18,020
So if you had to boil down Greek speak to one particular sentiment, you would say

328
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,640
that's it. That's it.

329
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,200
Oh, for sure. I've been thinking about this for more than 30 years.

330
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,400
When I started the bike shop in New York City, I was like, you know, the reason I'm

331
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,860
doing this is because I once said I wanted to do it.

332
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,300
I know, you know, it's not what eventually I'm not going to sit in retail.

333
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,120
That's stupid. And you deal with the public.

334
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,620
Oh, my gosh. Whoever comes through your door, you know, it's scary enough.

335
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:43,880
But fortunately, we were blessed with good people most of the time, if not most of all

336
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,940
the time, with few exception.

337
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,940
But I was like, let's just do it.

338
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,620
It's another way to just spend time, you know, do it for two years and then leave or

339
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,600
shut it down or whatever. But so.

340
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:58,800
Yeah, everything you know, the fun you want, here's a real funny thing and it's still

341
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:05,360
perpetual. That's why the insanity university college going after high school is a

342
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,360
waste of time. And everyone other than the people who had good parties and got fairly

343
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,020
good grades would disagree with that.

344
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,700
But pretty much everyone would disagree.

345
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,060
It's a waste of time yet.

346
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,780
They still do it. You know, we can go through the full spectrum, right?

347
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,320
And look at it that way.

348
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,260
Funerals. I was once asked to go to a funeral of a relative and I said, I'm not going.

349
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,540
He says, why not? I said, did you want me to stand up at the eulogy and tell everyone

350
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,660
what a scumbag he was?

351
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,520
Oh, yeah. It's best that you don't come.

352
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,380
No one does that kind of stuff.

353
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,580
Right. You know, everyone said, oh, he was this.

354
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,840
He was that the guy was a scumbag.

355
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,380
We're better off that he's gone.

356
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,660
Everybody lighten up.

357
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,460
You got to go to Italian funerals.

358
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,640
And I'll tell you, because there's always to kick your ass if you say that.

359
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,100
Well, no, there's always two rooms.

360
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,500
And they don't. Yeah, there's one room that boxy.

361
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,060
I know. Yeah, there's always the same with the Middle Eastern stuff.

362
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:57,880
And the second room is always a bunch of guys standing around talking a little more

363
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,660
quiet, usually smoking cigarettes, going, I don't even understand why we're all here.

364
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,840
This guy was a jerk off.

365
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,260
I mean, yeah, exactly.

366
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:06,400
This is the reality of reality.

367
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,740
Now, one thing I didn't talk to us about older people like Biden.

368
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:13,839
Well, Biden is a woodchipper material because he's a clone.

369
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,880
Just like the thing with Trump today.

370
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,720
He's a clone. He's not a good thing.

371
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:21,040
Anyone of notoriety up there is a real human being.

372
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,400
You got something coming for you.

373
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:28,840
Right. For example, when I heard the clone stuff, I knew it was real.

374
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,340
This is how I knew.

375
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,820
I had seen some UFO pictures, you know, people to snap with the thirty five

376
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,400
millimeter pictures of flying disks.

377
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:41,920
Oh, yeah. Well, it was it was taken in nineteen sixty six, nineteen sixty seven.

378
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:46,140
And right. Chasing the flying disk was the what is that?

379
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,520
That's not the stealth bomber, the stealth fighter plane.

380
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,220
What's that one called? The one twenty one or something like that.

381
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,760
Well, you got you talking about the triangle shape that's black.

382
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,160
Yeah. OK. Yeah.

383
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,220
That was chasing exactly that plane was chasing the UFO.

384
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:04,400
And this is twenty five years before they released it to the public.

385
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,980
Right. Right. All right.

386
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,360
So. So, yeah.

387
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,520
So cloning was a big deal in the late 90s, by the way, with Dolly, the sheep and all

388
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,400
that. They can't tell you.

389
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:20,360
Right. So if you think anybody, Elon Musk, anyway, any of these people go listen to

390
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,920
Donald Marshall, you know, and you'll get it.

391
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:28,520
I mean, even if you think that Donald Marshall stuff is off the hook, that's mild.

392
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,900
That's mild compared to what's really going on.

393
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,180
Very mild. It's much, much worse.

394
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:39,120
So you'll never see a political politician being assassinated because it takes the fun

395
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,680
out of it. Right now, he could be it could assassinate the clone and bring another one

396
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:49,400
back. I think I've told you about some security people that I knew that actually they

397
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,780
were high up in the army and they left the U.S.

398
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,040
and they live in other countries.

399
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,860
I'm not going to give up the countries like Colombia or Romania or anything like that.

400
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:01,280
Anyway, and they get involved and they just couldn't stand in the U.S.

401
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:05,580
because they found that these are people that would have first name basis with presidents

402
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,120
like Reagan. Right.

403
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,720
And they left the country because it's just disgusting to them.

404
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,320
They saw what's really going on.

405
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:16,140
Anyone listens to the Brandon Joe material, Brandon Joe Williams, who I've been

406
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:21,380
bringing up serially, you know, just about every sonnet past five sonnets.

407
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,660
I'm very impressed with that young man.

408
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,680
It's much worse than what he's saying.

409
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:32,260
You know, so what they basically mentioned is that from a security point of view,

410
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:38,560
what's going on, the word on the street is when you're an ex special off special ops

411
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:43,700
guy, your name gets pushed around various organizations, drug cartels, industrial,

412
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,840
whatever. You get put on a list and you can get approached for a project.

413
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,700
You've got skills. You know, people will find you a job.

414
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,800
It doesn't. Yeah. And they're all, you know, all the corporations are corporations.

415
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,180
There's no good guys, bad guys.

416
00:19:55,180 --> 00:20:00,580
Right. So so basically he found out there was no more market for kidnappings of

417
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,740
high profile people.

418
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,700
The reason why is because when you kidnap a high profile person and ask for ransom,

419
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,200
someone pushes a button a few miles away and their head explodes.

420
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,580
The person, you know, the rent, the person is being ransomed.

421
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,520
Right. And then you see him on TV the next day.

422
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,520
And you're like, how could that be? Because his head explode.

423
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,440
We had him here in the room and his head exploded.

424
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,080
And how could he be on TV the next day?

425
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,620
They never went around saying they're all clones.

426
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,760
I'm saying they're all clones from that account.

427
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,320
Right. Right. That's why you don't hear about kidnappings were big up until the 70s

428
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,520
and it went away. It's a high profile piece.

429
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,540
Another one. Yeah. Another weird question.

430
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,040
Like they asked somebody asked me not too long ago, how come nobody hijacks planes

431
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:47,240
anymore? Really? You know, and what I learned is that because they can be remote

432
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,260
controlled anyway, there's no point.

433
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,520
You know, it's like if you go and you take over from a pilot, you take over the

434
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,600
cockpit, you've done nothing.

435
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,540
That's what it comes down to.

436
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,600
Rebecca Roth got into that pretty well.

437
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:03,140
Yeah. And they were landing when it's slow at major airports.

438
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,720
They they they test everywhere.

439
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,620
They tested one coming down and one came out a little too hard.

440
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,540
American Airlines back in the 90s.

441
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,340
Right. And yeah.

442
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,900
So this is a by the way, if you want to know what happened to the planes that took

443
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:20,500
off that morning, they landed at Westover Air Force Base, which is 20 minutes from

444
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,000
New York City. It's in Massachusetts.

445
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,860
And if you think not, if you know anyone who was in the Air Force Base, but why

446
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:31,500
Westover? Because it has a like a five mile long runway.

447
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:35,100
Right. I think it's a it's like 15000 feet or something, three mile.

448
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,040
And so you could land big planes back to back.

449
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:42,360
Now, if you don't think you think that's a conspiracy theory, why did they tell

450
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:51,060
everyone, all personnel on the base to stay in a hotel locally on

451
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:57,260
910? The whole base was evacuated a day before and everyone was supposed to be put

452
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:02,540
up a hotel. Since when does an Air Force Base put up everyone in hotels?

453
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,220
Right. The only time the only time that's ever occurred.

454
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,440
And it's funny. It was a chemical spill.

455
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,440
Yeah. Right.

456
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:12,560
Right around that time to remember when they had the anthrax attacks.

457
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,280
They actually did that.

458
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,260
Yeah. You know, and that was a whole event.

459
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,400
This was a day or two before 9-11.

460
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,660
Oh, yes. You don't want people.

461
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,900
So it's so ridiculous.

462
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,220
It's so ridiculous.

463
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:29,420
The whole thing is so absurd, meaning all the way back, you know, talk about the

464
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:33,780
history that we get, which, you know, I say question the history.

465
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,020
No, don't question the history.

466
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,980
Do your do your own restart from scratch.

467
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,420
In other words, don't don't see.

468
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,080
Don't take what they give you and start questioning it.

469
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,720
No, no, no. Put it aside.

470
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,080
You know that. Don't even look at it.

471
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,180
That's the main body of work.

472
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,320
Now let's see what we could find out on our own.

473
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,260
Right. And then then compare notes and then obviously one will completely shred the

474
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:56,960
other. In other words, first construct your own history from stuff that you can prove and

475
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,040
you can find proof of.

476
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,240
Then that's right.

477
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,340
Go and look at what it is they wrote about it after.

478
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,380
Yeah, that's right.

479
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:06,880
Like, for example, I lived through the 70s and the 80s and half of the 60s.

480
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,740
And from what I recall, especially, you know, being a young adult in the early late

481
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:17,180
70s and through the 80s and what I see recounted now about those times is very

482
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:20,260
different, very close, but very a lot of things are left out.

483
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,700
Right. The sentiment and all this.

484
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:27,360
Right. So you can pick up on that, you know, if someone is a good communicator, which is

485
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,260
another thing you brought up, something that I.

486
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,160
Well, but anyway, this is the second time I derailed myself on what you do lawfully for

487
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,460
older people. I jumped to the cloning thing with Biden.

488
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,280
He's a clone. Trump is a. They're all clones.

489
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,020
Yeah. Congress, the whole Senate.

490
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,360
Yeah. There's millions of them.

491
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,520
And we still didn't finish with.

492
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,820
Was there a particular event that turned you over?

493
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,100
You gave us a progression.

494
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,160
We got up to you experimenting with the homeless killer event.

495
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,360
No particular event.

496
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,300
But during that time period, you realize how stupid you are now.

497
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,380
Yeah. It's a series of events doing sonics.

498
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:02,600
Right. That allows me to hear myself, not hear myself speak.

499
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:07,020
But I'm very serious when I say something or I say it.

500
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,660
I thought of it four or five times before I say it.

501
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:13,500
Right. And it allows me not not speaking to hear myself.

502
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,620
I'm speaking to put it out there.

503
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:20,400
And when you put it out there, the power of those words reflect back that when

504
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,400
people think about what I'm saying reflects back, it's like the silver cord, you

505
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,840
know, saying we're all attached with a cord and we could we could break

506
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,200
attachments and create attachments.

507
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:35,420
And the feedback is very, very neutral along those lines.

508
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:40,260
So there is no that I would say doing sonic events has put even more life into

509
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:45,400
these thoughts. And because most people that do

510
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,760
hear the Greek speak are glad for that, that they can hear it.

511
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,740
You know, it's like because I never talk about anything cryptic or anything that's

512
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,160
out of whatever we used to do a Skype group.

513
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:59,400
And this guy, he was an IP intellectual property

514
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,380
agent. He would find cool ideas and market them to big companies.

515
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,760
He always tells us a great thing.

516
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,040
Build this, build that. In order to build this device, you needed like a three

517
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:14,240
million dollar machine. I said, listen, have you got any IP you could share with

518
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,280
us that we could just go down to Ace Hardware or make with things we already have?

519
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,020
Why do I need a three million dollar laser to make this?

520
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,180
This doesn't make any sense.

521
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,700
Don't you have anything practical like putting dish soap in a spray bottle so you

522
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,540
don't use as much dish soap? Come on.

523
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,640
Well, that's a hell of a fact. And I've heard back from people about that.

524
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,380
And quite honestly, I implemented a bunch of those things.

525
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,600
They won't be buying you by dish soap once or twice a year now.

526
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,900
It's a lot on laundry soap, too.

527
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,480
I've got to tell you, laundry soap.

528
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,900
I'm not spending nearly as much at all.

529
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,960
And it's just as clean.

530
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,340
Yeah. So these are very, very simple hints.

531
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,840
I used to do Skype calls and give every every time I did a Skype call, these two or

532
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,480
three different simple things to do.

533
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,560
And I could still do it.

534
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,020
And I still do it.

535
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,080
You know, I'm constantly coming up with stuff.

536
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:01,400
Put it this way. Not a day goes by where I haven't made something improvement on

537
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,620
something or something new.

538
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:07,900
And that would be three hundred and sixty five short YouTube's right a year.

539
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,700
So that would be an interesting way to go.

540
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,740
Like Chris Fix, you know, you don't have to show yourself or give any names.

541
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,620
Just stay anonymous.

542
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:19,780
And a million subs and a million views, you know, type thing.

543
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,480
Yeah, it can easily all this stuff can be used.

544
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,100
Mr. Mr. Hands Practical Fix YouTube channel.

545
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,260
And it's just your hands doing stuff.

546
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:34,020
Yeah. Yeah. How to fix stuff and what stuff is and what's going on with this and

547
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,640
that. I'm talking about just practical stuff.

548
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,860
Just put it on a table.

549
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:42,460
So again, what lawful way to deal with old people is what covenant you live by.

550
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:48,840
For example, if you are an old person, a man, a woman, and you're dying in a

551
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:54,720
remote African village that's in the southern, let's say, areas where

552
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:00,180
cannibalism is still fresh in their minds and acceptable, they ask you permission.

553
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:03,200
You're considered. They say you're an honorable man of society.

554
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,180
Is it OK if we eat you when you die?

555
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,620
OK, this is a common question.

556
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:12,360
I know most Westerners, especially white people, or it doesn't matter what level

557
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:15,340
of melanin you have or whatever in your skin.

558
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:20,200
Most people are not aware of the prevalence of cannibalism in places like Asia and

559
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,320
Africa, those continents.

560
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,720
Right. It's very normal.

561
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,940
That's part of the ancient past.

562
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,260
But yeah. Yeah.

563
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:31,800
Like, for example, if you're in places like Liberia or whatever, all the way

564
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:36,720
across, if you see food vendors, street vendors selling meat, it's probably not

565
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,220
what you know. They don't ask.

566
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:41,100
It's human meat most of the time because people always die.

567
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,460
Right. So is that how you treat old people?

568
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:49,400
Ask them if we eat. You see, depends on what covenant you live by and what laws you

569
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,740
live by. Now, OK, what I see, you're typical American.

570
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,960
They're doing the right thing.

571
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:58,080
They slap some diapers on them, keep them full of drugs and throw them in a nursing

572
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,800
home. Why?

573
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,500
Because I say they're doing the right thing.

574
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:06,880
Usually when you went for many generations to the older people, they were bastions of

575
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,380
wisdom. They can give you good advice, usually based on their education.

576
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,740
They promoted things that would better your life.

577
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,340
Now they have nothing to say at all.

578
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,280
So why not fill them up with drugs?

579
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:22,860
And by the way, I found that most of the senior living starts at 55.

580
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,740
I'm more than four years into that.

581
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,040
Yeah, that's a new thing.

582
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,480
It used to be, you know, the 55 was introduced.

583
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:34,800
Yeah, like Agenda 30, 2030 Agenda introduced that with 15 minute cities.

584
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:39,280
But if you had the 55, it was usually for the spouse of the older person.

585
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:42,460
Right. Like so if you moved into a place and you had a husband or a wife that was a

586
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,760
little older than you, it wasn't directly for 55.

587
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,380
Yeah, that's the way it used to be.

588
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,760
And now you're right, though.

589
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,060
They start going, well, you can start living here at 55.

590
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,280
Not your spouse can come with you if they're close enough to your age.

591
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:58,020
But 55, I don't know when that change happened, but it is fairly recent.

592
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:02,060
Well, I feel I'm going to be 60 pretty in another year or so.

593
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,640
And I feel like I still feel like I did when I was 35.

594
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,940
Yeah. So I'm 52.

595
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,280
I'm probably 10 years older than you in real life.

596
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,380
But yeah. Yeah.

597
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:17,080
And at 35, I looked like I was 25, you know, and that would be easy to get a 21

598
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,940
year old. So at this age, can I still get a 21 year old?

599
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,920
That's the other point. But anyway, I got you.

600
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,640
I hit the wall when I was about 35, though, I think 35 or 40.

601
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,600
I just kind of went, OK, I'm old now.

602
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:34,900
So anyway, what you do with the old people is based on the covenant that you live by

603
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,500
strictly. When you read the biblical stuff, forget it.

604
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,700
That has nothing to do with anybody you know.

605
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:45,960
All that biblical stuff has something that you can ascertain is useful or not and put

606
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,700
it into effect and see what it's like to be live with real law.

607
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:53,780
Right. Which is not about control or motivation by penalty, but how to open up

608
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,860
yourself to a world where things fit the way they're supposed to.

609
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,780
Let's say that does not what you read about that.

610
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:06,800
It does nothing to do with the elders, you know, unless those elders understand what

611
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,880
I'm talking about. Right.

612
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,220
You know, the law also.

613
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,640
Right. So, yeah.

614
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,740
So when it speaks about treating people a certain way in the Bible, it's people that

615
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,120
are in the same covenant with you.

616
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:20,960
It's actually very harsh about those outside of your covenant, like the pagans, like

617
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,660
you don't find if you find an animal that has died of unknown causes, do not eat it,

618
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,100
i.e. roadkill or wake up in the morning.

619
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,240
And it's got what's called in the former funds, a dead cow, you know, supposed to put

620
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,040
it in the food supply. Downer, downer animals.

621
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,400
Right. But it says, but you sell it to the pagan for a profit.

622
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,180
In other words, don't give them a discount and make sure and have them eat it.

623
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:48,720
All right. So all these examples are the people living in the same covenant as you.

624
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,040
Right. So it says respect your parents.

625
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:56,300
Right. You see in the in the spoken commandments, the oral ones, not the written one.

626
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,740
Yeah. Honor them. But father.

627
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:01,680
Yeah. But in other parts, it's like, oh, my gosh, get away from these crazy heads.

628
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,640
Right. In other parts, like Abraham.

629
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:04,820
And it goes on and on and on.

630
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,820
You got to think this guy was an evil.

631
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,460
You know, his son didn't want to be evil like him and whatever.

632
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,100
On and on and on. So it has nothing to do.

633
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,320
With a general, it's not a broad brush application.

634
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:20,780
So what's lawful is based on the laws that you live in.

635
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,920
Right. Or how whatever the covenant that you all agree.

636
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:26,580
So, for example, you can have a different covenant than the people around you.

637
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:31,560
But so then that's where you come in and you do what they do in their own government.

638
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,340
Not for yourself, but allow them to do it to themselves.

639
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,460
If you're, for example, living by a higher covenant.

640
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,320
Yes, there are higher and lower covenants.

641
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,420
And those people live by a low covenant.

642
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:44,120
You cannot go in there and start commingling.

643
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,380
It will not work.

644
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:49,820
You you you either avoid, you know, so not partake in what they're doing

645
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:53,740
or allow them to do what they're doing, but convincing anyone or changing anyone,

646
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,260
especially now, forget it.

647
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,980
It's it's been that time has been over for a very long time.

648
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,900
So anyway, good. We didn't skirt that.

649
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,640
That's what you do.

650
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:05,100
But you see, we did bring in the clone thing again, the clone revival.

651
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,200
And again, if I hear about something,

652
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,880
I tend to poke around and see if it can be validated,

653
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,040
if you can't get validation or verification.

654
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,560
You still keep the material aside.

655
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,580
You don't have to deny it.

656
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,840
That's one of the signs of intelligence, by the way,

657
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:25,100
is being able to entertain a thought without rejecting it. Right.

658
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,440
So you know what?

659
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,920
I saw something in there real quick about something about speed reading.

660
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,360
Like I've done a tangent.

661
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,400
I haven't talked about that.

662
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,560
Let's we want to get into that.

663
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,640
Well, yeah, because, OK, maybe somewhere in the 40s,

664
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,460
it was pointed out to me that you had said

665
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:42,920
you were going to give people a really easy method.

666
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,860
Yeah. Yeah. Whoever. OK.

667
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,440
First of all, you have to be a good observer.

668
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,540
Second of all, you can't allow that voice to dominate in your head. Why?

669
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,780
Because when you have the that.

670
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,740
OK. Why do you have to be a good observer?

671
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:00,140
Well, obviously, you know, this is very mechanical.

672
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:03,900
If you can't read visually, you need glasses or help. Right.

673
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,700
And also be a very good observer of many things,

674
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:09,400
of the setting of the book, the type and all that. Right.

675
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,840
In other words, right.

676
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,280
Is it easy for you to acquire the information? Right.

677
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,240
So and then

678
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,000
the voice in your head, because when you're reading,

679
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:24,760
if you are reading the words aloud in your head, like most people do,

680
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,420
you will never do speed reading ever.

681
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:30,140
When you find yourself alone reading silently

682
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:34,860
and you notice that you're trying to read those words aloud in your head,

683
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,980
you hear them in the voice in your head.

684
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,080
You're not going to be a speed reader. Guaranteed.

685
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,140
That's the voice in your head. Also reading it.

686
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:45,140
That's another proof that you there you're walking around.

687
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,160
You know how there's you and the corporate you.

688
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,460
They call it the straw man. Yeah. It's always denied.

689
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,540
If you're reading something silently and you find yourself voicing

690
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:57,820
that in your head, that's the other being reading also with you, along with you.

691
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,140
Which we've covered in previous sonics where you talk.

692
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:00,600
That's right.

693
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,860
Voice in your head is not actually your voice.

694
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:06,360
Yeah, it's not. It's another being that's, yeah, keeping you along.

695
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,040
You know, just like, you know, you know,

696
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:11,739
capital letters is not you on the government paperwork, right? Right.

697
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:16,940
Yeah. So if you still have that voice in your head when you're

698
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,440
especially when you're reading, it'll jump out.

699
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,480
It'll be pretty obvious that someone else is reading.

700
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,659
You sound like you're voicing it off.

701
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:24,420
You're not going to do speed reading. Put it aside.

702
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:29,179
Now, if you can conquer that and just look at the words as if they're hieroglyph,

703
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,840
forget about what the words, what language it even is.

704
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,580
You can do this with even with a language you don't know.

705
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,260
And start seeing words like for the, you know, all the basic

706
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:43,699
where they go conjunctions, you know, in, out, only in and out might be important

707
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:46,540
because put the clothes in the dryer, put the clothes on the dryer.

708
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:47,760
Is it very important? Right.

709
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:48,960
Positioning logistically.

710
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,600
Yeah, that is all for, you know, all these things here.

711
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,179
You have to group those together.

712
00:34:55,739 --> 00:35:00,540
Right. And start looking for things that add more meaning, more like it was.

713
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:04,400
I've never got to David Wynn Miller stuff, but syntax, proper syntax.

714
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,020
Well, let me ask you this quick question,

715
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,440
because when I get a good pace going reading and I've read a lot,

716
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,820
I get pictures that will go by like a motion.

717
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,840
Like, OK, so let's make a movie of what you just get.

718
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,620
Yeah. Let me stay on this roadside picture.

719
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:22,560
OK, so what you're actually doing is you're when you looking at the page,

720
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:26,040
you're photographing as you're progressing along.

721
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,540
You know, let's say imagine someone's reading

722
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,900
and they're moving their finger along the pages very quickly.

723
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,680
That's another good way, right, to do it.

724
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:36,360
And it's like it's like someone looking down the scope of a rifle

725
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:39,280
when you put your finger or ruler or paper on the page.

726
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:43,220
But OK, so let's say you take a three sentence chunk.

727
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,120
You have a book open, three paragraphs, you know, medium font.

728
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:52,440
You read you take a chunk of the first three or four sentences

729
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,960
or half a paragraph skim through that.

730
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,540
And as you're going to the second chunk,

731
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,420
which is the other second half of that paragraph,

732
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:04,540
you have to also visualize what you just looked at

733
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:07,080
and see if they overlap and if they follow through.

734
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:11,060
So your eyes, your eyes are picking up what you're now seeing.

735
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,240
Now, below, you're still reading

736
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,920
as if you have another window open on your computer, right?

737
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:19,600
Another tab, what you just read

738
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,760
and comparing it and seeing how it ties in.

739
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,380
And the thing that just starts to you start seeing

740
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:29,360
how unnecessary most of the words are.

741
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:30,960
And then you can get through.

742
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:35,360
So, for example, I'll be sitting and we watch informational YouTube's,

743
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,640
you know, in the living room or whatever.

744
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,200
And there'll be a movie, right?

745
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:43,220
And they have a paragraph description, you know, like Star Wars a long time ago.

746
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:46,000
You know, some films open up, give you the setting.

747
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,640
And it's about three or four sentences.

748
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,800
I'll look at it. One, two.

749
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,100
OK, I read that next.

750
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,820
And the other person is still reading and reading and reading and reading

751
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:56,640
and reading and reading and reading and reading and reading and reading

752
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,700
and reading, just look at I read that. Got it.

753
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,640
It reminds me of the infographic shows on YouTube

754
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,740
where they have a very basic, you know, graphic going on

755
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,320
and the words go by on the screen at the same time.

756
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:15,040
And if you do it that way, it gives you a basic understanding of what's happening.

757
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,120
The crawl, you mean like a crawl?

758
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,800
Well, there's a lot of words different.

759
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,780
Well, not on the bottom, like along with it.

760
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,480
In other words, like I said, I create pictures.

761
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,860
So you end up with not a caption, but you're reading the words.

762
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,320
And as you're reading the words, they're sort of being created

763
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,920
in a visual form over here.

764
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,140
OK, so yes, I get you. Yeah, that's very important.

765
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:38,460
OK, so another way to think about this whole thing is very simple.

766
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:44,580
The most simplest, the absolute simplest way is what images are you getting

767
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:49,520
when you see the words that you know, like the Scientologists are big

768
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,880
on definitions, and I give this to them when you're trying to read fast.

769
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,620
You if you understand everything that's there, all the definitions

770
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:02,580
of all the words you start to see pictures and you start to form the story in 3D.

771
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:06,680
The moment you hit a word that you cannot define it, that's it.

772
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,220
You're fucked.

773
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,900
You cannot continue that anymore because it just broke the chain.

774
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,080
It broke the rhythm.

775
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,660
It's kind of like you're going on a run and you slip and fall.

776
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,620
And now you have to get up.

777
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,120
You're not running anymore, right?

778
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,340
You brush yourself off.

779
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,080
You're still not running.

780
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:23,320
And now you start your gate again.

781
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,200
You're still not running.

782
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,180
Takes a few seconds to get up to speed.

783
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,940
So you got to get back into the flow of things.

784
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:28,920
It's a trip.

785
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:32,020
It's an imagine you're running with a group of people and you slip and fall

786
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:32,740
and they keep running.

787
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,200
By the time you get up and start running again, they're way ahead.

788
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,580
You got to catch up. Yeah. OK.

789
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,480
Yeah. So you just killed your entire.

790
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,680
So you're not going to be running from that point on.

791
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,640
The moment you hit a word that you cannot define,

792
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:47,780
even if its definition is in doubt and you're not sure how it's being used,

793
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,240
that will kill that completely.

794
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,180
So what does that mean?

795
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,800
You have to understand also that many people

796
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:58,660
authors, if not all of them, do not know how to use.

797
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,480
And you're reading a book that mentions soul and spirit. Yes.

798
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,180
They do not know what those words mean.

799
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,240
Do you know that most people that write even authors

800
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,300
do not know what the word nice means?

801
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,800
Yeah, I know that. Right.

802
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,580
OK, so once you pick that up, you continue along the context

803
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:19,800
that it's written, but you remind yourself the author is an idiot.

804
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,320
Right. OK. OK.

805
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,240
Now, do you want to speed read through something

806
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,940
that the author is an idiot? Absolutely.

807
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,600
Why waste time?

808
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,080
You want to get the needle out of the haystack.

809
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,620
So that's where the speed reading comes in.

810
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,500
Right. You're already caught.

811
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:41,600
Like, for example, I know an author and he wanted me to read his stuff.

812
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,280
I'm not going to mention his name, Bruce McDonald.

813
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,300
And he started writing about the soul and the spirit.

814
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,740
He wanted to argue what it meant.

815
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,820
I said, listen, your stuff, you keep interchanging these things.

816
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,820
They're totally different things. Yeah.

817
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,360
And, you know, so I'll read through it, but I'll tell you right now,

818
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,720
it's not good, no matter how good you think it is.

819
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:03,640
Bruce, generally, I like Bruce, but I get your I get your point.

820
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,400
Yeah. So, you know, he tried.

821
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,160
So and this goes on.

822
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:12,560
I was interviewed, Dean Romania, the other author, hours and hours.

823
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,720
To write a book together or for me, whoever, about all this kind of stuff

824
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,300
is based in like China, ancient China, some Chinese sage and all that.

825
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:20,860
I said, no, no, no.

826
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:23,860
You first of all, like half the words that come out of your mouth.

827
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,780
You don't even know what the hell you're saying.

828
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,120
You know, so what are we going to build it?

829
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,120
Guess what? We're just wasting each other's time, aren't we?

830
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,440
All right. We're just wasting time.

831
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,360
All right. What else?

832
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,920
The speed reading thing.

833
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,480
Look, there's plenty of classes, just like language.

834
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:42,520
OK, this is a parallel to the language thing. OK.

835
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:45,560
Now, I believe in learning languages organically.

836
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,620
Now, what does that mean?

837
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,260
You know, you run into someone

838
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,240
that looks Asian.

839
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,600
Let's say you find out they're Korean and they speak Korean.

840
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,420
And, you know, you're young and at school.

841
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,700
And the reason why they speak Korean is because their parents

842
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:03,220
immigrated to America and they speak Korean at home.

843
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,360
Right. You get it.

844
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,240
Well, how did they learn that?

845
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,660
Well, the shorthand is you use the words.

846
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,200
Look, if you use those words in action,

847
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,300
you can connect them to those actions.

848
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,520
It becomes a lot more of a natural thing.

849
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,640
OK, that's another language example.

850
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,420
Let's just say you just know one language.

851
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,620
How did you learn that?

852
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,020
They put a coloring book in front of you.

853
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:26,480
If you pretty much grew up past the 1950s,

854
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,760
you had what's called a primer.

855
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,140
Yeah. Where it was a book where there was a letter on each page

856
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,200
and then maybe an object. Yes.

857
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,580
Right. And you studied that.

858
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,100
Apple, so on and so forth. Right. Right. OK.

859
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:40,580
So now you studied that with an inexperienced mind

860
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,760
that was still developing.

861
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:44,520
So this is the way you learn an organic language.

862
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:45,780
And you will learn so fast.

863
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,420
People won't believe it.

864
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,420
Let's say you want to learn Hebrew right now.

865
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,300
Give me an example. You know, absolutely nothing.

866
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:53,160
None of it. Right.

867
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,600
It all looks like whatever.

868
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:59,740
Go online and download from a Jerusalem publisher

869
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:04,160
a coloring book in Hebrew

870
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,600
for ages four and under or five and under.

871
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:09,080
Start downloading those coloring books.

872
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:13,080
Print them out and you will see all of that gumbo.

873
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,920
Right. You'll see all these letters and you'll start coloring them in

874
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,940
and it'll have, you know, like for bet it'll, you know, or this.

875
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,440
You'll have write a house on it. Right.

876
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,100
You go on and on.

877
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,500
So you're going to get the letter you color in.

878
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:29,620
You're going to show they're going to show upper lowercase, let's say.

879
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,800
And they're going to show an object with a short word.

880
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,400
Now, you're an adult.

881
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,940
Don't even force yourself.

882
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:40,820
Right. Even if you did one letter a day,

883
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:45,940
there is no way you will not remember, not not remember any of that.

884
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,520
You will know that you will know it for sure.

885
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:49,700
And you will have a primer.

886
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:54,760
Then you move up to the first grade, second grade stuff for Hebrew.

887
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,960
There is no way you will not not remember it.

888
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,900
In other words, you will learn that shit fast.

889
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,580
Right. You will learn it so fast.

890
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,860
As a matter of fact, you will go through the

891
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:08,820
the primer first and second and third grade in less than a week.

892
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,360
Yeah, no problem, because you'll be working on the boy lives in the house.

893
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,440
There'll be a that's right.

894
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,840
So let me just mention this way.

895
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:19,600
If you're a Hebrew speaking boy and you're five or six or seven

896
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:23,460
and you're left alone, can you communicate enough about who you are,

897
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:27,580
who you are, where you live in this and you're hungry or you got to go to the bath?

898
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,120
Of course.

899
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:32,420
So within a very, very short period of time, you will have

900
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:36,700
the communication skills of a young child. Right.

901
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:42,560
Organically. Now, if you start doing the Rosetta Stone, all that other bullshit,

902
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,800
six months later and a thousand dollars later,

903
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,940
you might think that you can speak like a tourist

904
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,620
and you're going to forget all of it.

905
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:53,580
I assure you, you're going to forget all of it

906
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:56,120
and you're going to be stuck there like a cripple.

907
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,640
Oh, I once could walk, but now I can't walk.

908
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:01,760
When you learn organically, you never forget it.

909
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:05,600
It will always be stuck there organically, meaning the way children do.

910
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:08,260
Because remember, you are conscious.

911
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,900
And as your brain grows, it tunes into different stuff.

912
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:15,380
So as you know, I've always said a superior mindset

913
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:18,080
will always overcome an inferior mindset.

914
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,540
Always. Right.

915
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,920
That's why they are the professional people.

916
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:27,180
Lawyers, doctors, priests, rabbis, accountants,

917
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:31,100
consultants, whatever that deal with the public.

918
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:35,080
They always put inferior characters, their inferior minds.

919
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:38,460
Right. Because two reasons.

920
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:42,300
If people notice that that person, the lawyer, the judge, the doctor

921
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:45,160
is a superior mind, they want to emulate that.

922
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,820
Right. Right. And now what are you doing?

923
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:51,500
So you got to make sure doctors, lawyers, judges, Supreme Court, prejudice,

924
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:57,140
presidents, congressmen, accountants, consultants, business leaders are dummies.

925
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:00,400
Now, this has been certified fact

926
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:05,140
that this is one of the big filters that's been going on for since 9-11,

927
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:09,880
because during they really stepped on this really hard after 9-11

928
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,380
because they had this thing called the 9-11 Commission.

929
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,220
Yeah. And even before it was done or afterwards,

930
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,720
a lot of those people that were part of that were interviewed.

931
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,660
And boy, oh, boy, the Freudian slips or the slips that they have

932
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:24,200
about the bombs in the building and the missiles.

933
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:28,120
And they're like, oh, from now on, we've got to make sure that

934
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:31,820
anyone that interacts with the public does not know.

935
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,660
Ergo, Brendan, Joe Williams keeps saying

936
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:37,660
you go to the State Department, they don't know anything.

937
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,820
I think at one point a long time ago, we had someone in the State Department

938
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,440
in the chat on the hotel.

939
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:46,080
And I kept bragging on the guy, like my brother or whatever

940
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,280
works in the State Department, like everyone's like, oh, wow.

941
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,940
So if he works, the State Department knows nothing about the State Department.

942
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:52,860
Absolutely nothing. Right.

943
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,080
So because someone who has no knowledge

944
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,200
cannot possibly make one of those Freudian slips

945
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,260
because they don't have it in their brain to slip. That's right.

946
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:01,760
And so it's been made the upper.

947
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:05,360
So if you go to the State Department, they know no one there knows anything

948
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,220
about what the State Department is supposed to be doing.

949
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,680
That's been memorialized for 200 years.

950
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:13,120
No one. I assure you that because the moment they find someone

951
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:15,840
who knows what's going on, they're going to pull them in the back room,

952
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:20,120
double his salary and says, shut the fuck up and go work out of your house.

953
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,060
Yeah. Right.

954
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,340
Go put him somewhere where nobody can find him.

955
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:27,020
I know someone who went down to Congress and kept showing all the emergency

956
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:30,060
acts and all the bankruptcy and all this other stuff.

957
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:31,400
No one. None of the car knew.

958
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,340
None of them knew any.

959
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,200
And I'm open to this.

960
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:37,460
And the aid comes out, you know, aid that works with the army.

961
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,600
Right. It's also a congressman.

962
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:41,180
No, no, no. You don't need to look at this stuff.

963
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,060
Right. They're flagged.

964
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,000
So this is the situation you live in right now.

965
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:49,180
So a higher consciousness will always overcome a lower consciousness,

966
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:52,640
whether it's intelligence, spiritual worthiness or anything like that.

967
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:57,820
But the problem with subjecting the common folk to a superior

968
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:02,520
human mind is that they want to emulate it because that's what humans do.

969
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,020
If humans didn't want to emulate, you wouldn't have trends in fashion.

970
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:08,680
You wouldn't have Hello Kitty and tick tock.

971
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,000
And you wouldn't have. Right.

972
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,080
You wouldn't have any of these things.

973
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:14,860
So, yeah. So it goes on and on and on.

974
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,460
And you're really, really stuck.

975
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:20,300
But look, there's nothing you could do to change anything

976
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:22,600
at this point other than within your own sphere.

977
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,740
But just keep in mind that everyone around you is there to waste your time.

978
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:30,500
And they perceive you as you're supposed to waste their time.

979
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:32,060
This is not how they're saying it, because remember,

980
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,300
they have a voice in their head that blocks them from this.

981
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,280
Here's proof.

982
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:38,560
Let's say you go learn about how the human body works

983
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:42,700
or how the quote unquote government works or how this works

984
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:43,980
or the Bible or whatever.

985
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:46,700
Like basically, you've been listening to Greg speak

986
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:50,340
and you go to coworkers, family members, associates.

987
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:53,160
No way, dude.

988
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:57,540
I don't want to hear that because you're supposed to be wasting my time.

989
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:02,400
Why are you going to give me information that actually binds itself to reality?

990
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:07,480
I need stuff that will not bind itself to reality, not bound to reality,

991
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,100
where we just don't know.

992
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:12,640
And we're all just blowing around or maybe even blowing each other,

993
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,740
a circle jerk. Right.

994
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:17,060
So this is what's going on and it's not going to change.

995
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:20,120
And this is it's been this way for a long time by design, by the way.

996
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:25,140
And certain things by design, just like addictions become perpetual. Right.

997
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,800
So you can reach your next level of Candy Crush or Black Ops,

998
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:32,260
you know, Soldier of Fortune, whatever on your PlayStation.

999
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:34,900
You know, that would be interesting.

1000
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:36,200
So anyway, there's a lot more.

1001
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,840
There's someone more to come.

1002
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:41,380
I don't know if we'll do it now, maybe next time we meet.

1003
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:44,200
What are the loose ends of Brandon?

1004
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:48,420
Brandon, Joe Williams or Williams, Joe Brant, whatever.

1005
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:51,340
Brandon, Joe Williams is.

1006
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:56,400
Yeah, Brandon, I keep I'm like he gets a serial mention even more than archaics

1007
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,100
does, because I'm so excited that he put it all together using just the codes.

1008
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:02,500
Right. Right. And I'll just give a preface to that.

1009
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:06,700
It's the title 12, section 411, because in order to succeed.

1010
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:10,820
In other words, you know, the IRS is there to support your faith

1011
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:12,380
in credit, full faith in credit.

1012
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:16,700
The reason you're taxed is because, oh, the money must create scarcity.

1013
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:19,520
They need the taxes. So the money's worth something.

1014
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:20,440
No, they don't need that.

1015
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:24,700
There's no no one has any accounting for where any taxes go anywhere.

1016
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:25,480
No one does.

1017
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:29,120
The building, some of the governments give a little card as well.

1018
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:32,100
It goes some of it goes to the jurisdiction of the schools.

1019
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,880
It goes to the jurisdiction of the roads.

1020
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:36,480
But OK, OK, that's fine.

1021
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,340
All right. But where and how? Show me.

1022
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:40,120
No accounting, zero accounting.

1023
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:44,800
OK, everywhere. So so if people get away from the taxation

1024
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:48,580
legally by, let's say, revocation of election

1025
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:52,040
and doing conditional endorsements in many ways,

1026
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,480
the money system will the faith in the money will collapse

1027
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,560
and they have to do something else, which is happening slowly.

1028
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,800
But Brandon Joe Williams thinks that you have to get rid of all your contracts.

1029
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,960
Right. He does. He endorsed things a certain way.

1030
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,980
But it's shown that even endorsing them without recourse,

1031
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,820
which basically doesn't make you liable for what happens after

1032
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:15,460
is still endorsing it as something of value.

1033
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:20,460
And the IRS wants that's a liability, right, because you're adding value to it.

1034
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:23,280
Right. They basically told it's in the 16th Amendment.

1035
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:27,380
You know, the same verbiage that's in Title 12, Section 411

1036
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,160
is actually in the 16th Amendment.

1037
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:31,260
They pulled it out of there.

1038
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:32,720
And that's your remedy.

1039
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,820
Now, you don't have to do any of the cancellations

1040
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:37,420
or anything like that to use that.

1041
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:43,000
You could be a total citizen slave and do that endorsement.

1042
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:47,240
And that particular instrument that was endorsed.

1043
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:51,380
So he is not does not rise into a liability column ever.

1044
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,360
Right. Unless you want to, of course, you know, then you could say,

1045
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:56,080
well, I'm going to donate it anyway. Right.

1046
00:50:56,740 --> 00:51:00,420
So what he's talking about on and on and on and on is fine.

1047
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:04,580
But if you do his contract killer course and still still endorse

1048
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:07,300
without a demand, yeah, that's a tax liability, dude.

1049
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:12,060
In each individual thing, someone that was once scrutinized by the IRS,

1050
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:14,340
he actually called, says, I want you guys to audit.

1051
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:15,520
He says it doesn't work that way.

1052
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:18,740
But what we look at anyway, he showed all the checks,

1053
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:21,000
all the things everything was endorsed that way, you know,

1054
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:25,900
with a conditional endorsement demand for lawful money, USC 12, 12, USC 411.

1055
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,200
And the IRS guys looking through it.

1056
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,900
And he says, well, do you have anything that's not endorsed this way?

1057
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,360
Is there's no I've been endorsing everything like that for decades.

1058
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:34,740
Well, then, goodbye. Have a good life.

1059
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:35,820
They don't.
