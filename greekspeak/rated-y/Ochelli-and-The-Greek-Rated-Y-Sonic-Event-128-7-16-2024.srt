1
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:15,040
Sonic Event 128? I believe it's 128. Anyway, here we are, Ocelli in the Greek Rated Y,

2
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:22,680
and let's just roll the ball as fast as we can, kind of like bowling for ideas. Interesting

3
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,140
thing, a follow-up question came in after some other questions we didn't get to last

4
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:32,740
time, and it was like this. I'll shorten the whole thing. You know, a lot of people like

5
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:38,220
you, Greek, a guy like you who has original ideas, who's outside of the box, etc., etc.,

6
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:44,860
is often recruited into think tanks, is often recruited into industrial stuff where they

7
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,980
want to develop certain things, but they want to protect their intellectual ideas, so they

8
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:53,220
get somebody with bigger brains than themselves, which is not too difficult, and there are not

9
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,780
that many sheep available, so they go after a guy who actually has the ability to speak

10
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:03,099
English and other languages like you, who might give them new and profitable ideas.

11
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,960
They pay them a good amount of money, and they put them on the shelf to what? Generate

12
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:15,100
ideas and concepts. Have you been approached by? Why are you not working with think tanks

13
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:21,960
or developmental-type agencies like this is one of the big questions, because you've said

14
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,580
stuff about water, you've said stuff about energy, you've talked about weather work,

15
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,660
which makes sense according to them as far as, oh, anti-grav technology and stuff like that.

16
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,440
Now, I don't know why that makes sense, but all of that rolled into a nutshell. How come you're

17
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:42,260
not working for the secret department with ExxonMobil, or you're not one of Elon Musk's

18
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:50,520
people, or etc., etc.? Boy, there's several ways to answer that, but I'm not at the moment.

19
00:01:50,520 --> 00:02:00,340
I was back in 2008 or so I was approached, but no, for whatever reason, I can give you the main

20
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:07,280
reason why. It's not recognizable that already exists. Everything that anyone would be hired

21
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:14,020
to come up with already exists. It's just not known. Here's the point. Let's make a fictional

22
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:19,820
example, wink, wink. You go to a planet, and everyone on the planet is a fucking moron or an

23
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:25,760
idiot, with little exception. You organize the planet to have professional classes that are

24
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,980
trained in universities from the same people, and you have lawyers and doctors and scientists

25
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:35,360
and engineers and all. From the same people, a planet is full of fucking morons, with little

26
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,280
exception. Okay, so the people that know better than the morons turn around and say, you know what

27
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,060
we need? Some king morons. Let's make some morons that'll run things. The people that organize

28
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:50,060
these idiots already knew everything, right? So it's all a show. In other words, you know,

29
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:54,480
it's like the biggest joke on this planet is university doctors, lawyers, what people says,

30
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,740
I had a really good teacher, where they born on this planet, are they human? And they're like,

31
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,280
Yeah, of course, they're I'm like, really? No, far as you're not gonna know. And if they do know

32
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,520
what's going on, they won't want anything to do with any of it, right? They just want to pass their

33
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,760
time, waste their time, whatever. Well, they could waste their time anyway. Yeah, well, they could

34
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,560
choose to waste their time doing something like that. Because it might be amusing to train other

35
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,340
morons. You know, there's people that enjoy training animals, directing animals to run off

36
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,200
the cliffs. I mean, just yeah, but those are animals that humans are not really trainable

37
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:32,220
after a certain point. Everyone, you know, I assure you, this with little exception has stopped

38
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:37,820
developing like nine or 10 or 12 years old, max, everyone. In other words, they're just seem to

39
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:43,720
have a more of an adult appearance or whatever behavior, but they're still stuck. And yeah,

40
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,180
it's very, very difficult to find people that are constantly growing and maturing. And then

41
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:53,300
those people will want nothing to do with what's going on. You see, which which brings me and we

42
00:03:53,300 --> 00:04:00,020
finished off with someone was asking, you know, but tell us about the brand. What would you not

43
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:04,820
do with Brandon Joe Williams is the serial repeat. I keep bringing him up on everything because I'm

44
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:09,940
doing what he's doing. Right. You keep saying there's great stuff there. He's got some great

45
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:15,160
things to also organized. Yeah, but he goes the wrong direction at a certain point. No,

46
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:21,220
the wrong direction. He's going. There's a I don't know if it was jackass the movie.

47
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:27,280
Yeah, there were those stunts that they perform. Sure. That's that's what he's doing. Does it mean

48
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,680
that he won't perform this time? But it's really fucking dangerous and stupid. No way, right?

49
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,100
OK, so because in one word, he's admitting what it is and then he goes to the set. OK,

50
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,140
so by the way, before I get started, it's summertime here, really hot.

51
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,240
And that means that you eat less. By the way, whatever you eat less in the summer.

52
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,100
How hot is it where you are, by the way? I mean, is it getting up? Well, there's two.

53
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,760
There's two where I'm at. There's two places where I'm at. Sure. Where I'm at in the southwest

54
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,500
is the heat wave. But where I'm at within a mile or two mile radius, it's 10 degrees cooler than

55
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,220
everywhere else. So it's not bad at all because I'm doing weather operatives, which is ruining,

56
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,840
creating some really bad weather downwind. But, you know, if they don't want the bad weather,

57
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:14,280
they can move right now or do weather themselves or they can move the weather. Yeah,

58
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,080
they can move. They can move. They can keep bouncing it over until he hits the French.

59
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,800
And the French, if they get screwed, they need to learn to do weatherwork to keep bouncing it

60
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,420
around the potato. Right. When you do weatherwork, it's hot potato. Everyone downwind or downstream

61
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:31,920
of you is going to get the brunt. Right. So, you know, what the fuck do I care? I'm cooling it down

62
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:37,400
10 degrees here. I send a couple of screenshots where the high was one hundred and seven

63
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,600
forecast for the day. The day before was one hundred and eleven two o'clock in the afternoon.

64
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,220
It should have reached one hundred and seven. Right. But it was eighty six. You know,

65
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,900
I can show you the screenshot. And I kept taking, you know, high tomorrow. One eleven.

66
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:58,240
Take a screenshot. Eighty nine. The hottest time of day. How is that possible? But but but if you

67
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,680
go ten miles east, west, north or south, it is one hundred and eleven. How's that?

68
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:09,780
So nobody's mentioning this anomaly, this pocket of coolness. OK, these idiots. No,

69
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,420
I just thought they might try and explain it away, even if they give the wrong explanation,

70
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,980
they might say, you know, big things they do. When I took out Hurricane Lee last year,

71
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,320
they they were bringing up like, look, the hurricane stopped. It's not moving. We've

72
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,100
never seen that before. Has it moved in eight hours? Well, it moved like a mile in eight hours.

73
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:31,400
Right. So we never say, oh, look, it disappeared or it's gone to nothing. And now it came back

74
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,900
again. You know, yeah, yeah, yeah. So the weather's good. Fortunately, I'm trying to get

75
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:43,500
more people on board to do it just for whatever reason, you know. But look, it's one of these

76
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,720
things that you're brought up in life that you shouldn't be do that that can't be changed.

77
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,700
And obviously it can't. So what can't right? We're starting to change something that we're

78
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:55,140
raised to believe cannot be changed or dealt with. And we're doing it on a very small.

79
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,760
It's even less than grassroots level. It's just someone, you know, knowing what,

80
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,940
you know, what some of the techniques are. But anyway, you eat less in the summer

81
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,140
and like a meal in a glass. I just want to share something. I've been talking about food for a

82
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:13,420
while. What I do for like a nutrition blast is I go to Wal-Mart and get all the organic stuff

83
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:18,220
at Wal-Mart. It's much cheaper than the local health food store. That's twice as much for

84
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:24,420
everything. So I get organic peanut butter, organic soy milk, organic bananas. By the way,

85
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:29,760
when you get fruit, always get the organic. Why bother if you buy bananas? Right. Why?

86
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,960
They don't taste like anything. Right. Get the organic. They're 10 cents more pound or whatever.

87
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,400
Yeah. Well, bananas are not a big deal. But I mean, there are some things that it's like,

88
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,080
you know, I know it's not right, but the organic is so much more expensive.

89
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,560
A non-organic apple has no flavor whatsoever. But the worst part about that is,

90
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,580
comparatively speaking, they might also be lying to me as well because they do that,

91
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,260
you know, just because it's organic. It has to be 40 percent or so. Right.

92
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:01,640
Sixty percent organic. And then it could classify. Well, you know, back in the 80s,

93
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,400
when there was a when it started by the 90s, it became popular. I said, ah,

94
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,480
it's not going to be good because anything that the mainstream catches on fucks up. Right. So

95
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:16,620
that's why. Right. So that's why I can't discuss so much in so many places now.

96
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:21,840
A meal and a meal and a glass. What I do is this is when you don't want to cook or where I've been

97
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:28,000
cooking some really good food lately, but basically Greek salads. There's no lettuce in a Greek salad,

98
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,260
by the way. It's garden vegetables. Right. It was a thick slab of feta cheese, olive oil and

99
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:41,120
vinegar and bread. But what I've been doing was a popular drink. I had a whole bunch of apricots.

100
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,900
I did this way, but we're out of apricots. There's a place, a lady that grows apricots,

101
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:50,000
got hundreds of them. Those are done. But what you do is you get your soy milk, put it in the blender

102
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,380
and you throw in a capsule of mineral supplements, you know, like, you know,

103
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,900
the capsule, the gel capsules, right. Like a one a day vitamin kind of thing.

104
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,320
No, no. It's a gel capsule. It's called mineral supplement.

105
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,160
The generic mineral supplement. OK, just minerals. You look on the back and it's got all the various

106
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,520
magnesium minerals and all that selenium, all that stuff. Right. But I get the vegetable gel.

107
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:19,060
If it says gelatin, it's pork. So you want to get the veg cap. Right. So I keep that. I buy one of

108
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:23,640
those bottles every three years. It's worth 30 bucks. And, you know, it's got 500 tablets. It

109
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,800
lasts a long time. I just use them for smoothies. And you always want to have gone over this in

110
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,060
private Skype groups when you make a smoothie. You always want to buffer it. What is that? What

111
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:36,620
is buffer? It means if something's acidic, you make it less acidic. Right. If something's alkaline,

112
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,120
you make it less alkaline with buffering it. Right. So when something's acidic,

113
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,820
you add a little alkaline. So when you're going to make a smoothie with peanut butter, bananas

114
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:51,340
and soy milk, it's not acidic like citrus, but it is acidic. You know, anyone that starts studying

115
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:55,440
nutrition, food and nature, when you start breaking things down and processing them,

116
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,400
the first thing they do is become acidic. That's why, you know, you need salts and things to

117
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:04,740
preserve them. And soy milk doesn't neutralize like cow's milk. No. So it's acidic. Right.

118
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:10,540
It's as cow's milk is acidic. Also, once it's processed, it's something called that people

119
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:17,620
are lactose intolerant. Guess what lactose is? It's lactic acid. Right. So and that's only a

120
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:22,520
problem when you refine cow's milk. But we're talking vegan now. We're talking no animal

121
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:28,200
whatsoever because your gel caps, your gel, your your your mineral supplements are vegetable

122
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,300
gel caps. I don't like the five hundred milligram, the big ones. Right. The horse,

123
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,860
you know, it doesn't have to be anything special. I get some generic brand.

124
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:43,360
And and also when you have a big bottle of pills, vitamins or supplements, don't open that bottle

125
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:49,060
every time you want to get one divvy, divvy like a week or two weeks or a month's worth in a smaller

126
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,760
bottle and put the bigger bottle away. So every time you open it and close it,

127
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,740
you put more air in it that, you know, you'd start degrading it. Right. Yeah. Shaking it around.

128
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:02,040
It's always divvy somehow, you know, into a small container, you know, 20 or 30, whatever you think

129
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,880
you're going to use in a month and then a refill instead of chugging the big container around.

130
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:11,020
It's much better for the storage principle. So anyway, you get your blender, a good blender,

131
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:18,380
and you put your soy milk in there and you turn it on low. You throw in your your mineral cap first.

132
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:22,940
Let the mineral start breaking down as the soy milk spinning. Then you add your peanut butter,

133
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:28,820
teaspoon, tablespoon, organic peanut butter, and then you add your banana. Now, here's the secret

134
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:33,980
with bananas. Anyone can do this experiment and it works every time. OK, that's if you're not

135
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:39,000
dead from the neck up. When you peel a banana, don't do it the way they show on TV, which is

136
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,820
they grab it from the stem end and they pull it and peel it. Now, you always want to peel

137
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:47,900
it from the blossom end, meaning the opposite where the stem is. That's where the blossom forms

138
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:53,780
the flower. Right. And it tastes different. If you peel a banana from the stem and break off a

139
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:58,820
piece and taste it, you could take the peel away, throw it away, do an A, B and X comparison.

140
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:03,480
You know, A, B and then X is you don't know which is which. And you'll always taste the difference.

141
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:09,680
If you peel a banana from the stem and first down and put it on a plate, take another banana and

142
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,740
peel it from the blossom and first put it on a plate, they taste completely different.

143
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:18,940
Doesn't it go doesn't it like turn brown faster, too, if you peel it? No, no. We're just talking

144
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:24,240
about, OK, all things being equal. OK, OK. All things being equal, whether it's how

145
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:30,020
the way you peel is kind of hard to believe. I see you're you're even having a hard time.

146
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:35,560
Well, yeah, I'm reaching. It has nothing to do with the banana. You take two bananas that are

147
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:41,320
on the same bunch, right? Take two off or take four off or whatever. Take two banana,

148
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,540
take one banana, peel it from the stem and first put it on a plate.

149
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:50,280
They take the other banana that's just like it, peel it from the blossom and put it on a plate.

150
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:55,640
They taste completely different. It seems based on how it's peeled away, changes the flavor,

151
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,140
just like the cut we've talked on vegetables, changes the way the vegetable tastes.

152
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:03,980
Well, see, I can understand with a cut, but this one makes less. I mean, I'm not saying

153
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:09,300
it's wrong, but it's less intuitive. Yeah, the banana will be sweeter, have a much more mellow

154
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:14,240
flavor where when you peel it from the stem and down, it doesn't have that sweetness,

155
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,920
doesn't have that rich banana flavor. Do you know why? Do you know why that is or

156
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:25,920
does it matter about the weather work? This is just a technique. See, most techniques.

157
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:31,980
Yeah, it's we can we should be able to give the why. But if you learn the technique and you

158
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:37,360
employ it and you reap the benefits of it, even if you don't know how it works, right,

159
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,140
is the advantage of learning the technique. Right. Of course. I just wanted to stick in

160
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:49,580
people's minds. Well, yeah. Why it works is obviously it's ethereal movement. Motion matters.

161
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:55,700
Right. In other words, the way things are done can change the outcome. Yeah. And this is the

162
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:00,920
energetic consideration. Yeah, exactly. Close to more validation of that. Now, we can't be measured

163
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,500
with their equipment because they don't have equipment fine enough. But you have the best

164
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,720
equipment, just like you can take a fine wine. If you can taste the difference, you have a

165
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,120
measuring. That's right. You know, that's right. Just like any any of the scientists who can't

166
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,020
measure whatever. OK, well, you can analyze chemically any wine that's preferable to a lot

167
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:23,940
of people that like like a 19, let's say a twenty eighteen Bordeaux heavy wine. You know, the heavier

168
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,620
wines are easier to make and then go to a lab and have them copy that with their chemicals.

169
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:33,160
They were it doesn't even taste like wine. It's like that weird wine. Yeah. Like that

170
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,320
weird wine in a box, like the individual box stuff that they can't even copy that.

171
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,760
They can't even do that in the lab. Yeah, they can't even. So it's all energetic.

172
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:46,100
But you should put wine in a box, by the way. Shame on you. But it's the shape that matters,

173
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:51,420
too. So. So here we go. So the soy milk, the mineral goes in, peanut butter goes in next and

174
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:56,260
blend it. Don't be like a white people where they throw everything. They have these slurpy smoothie

175
00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:02,260
shops and malls and they have the thing, all the whatever mix they're going to put in their preset

176
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:07,320
and they put it in. Never do that. OK, so making a smoothie or slurpy, everything has an order

177
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:12,160
which way what goes in first and for how long. Right. So quick recap here. Sorry, but just just

178
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,660
help me out because I got lost and I distracted myself. So what I do is I first put in the mineral

179
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:23,520
channel, the liquid first, the liquid first. So first the soy and started on low. And as it's

180
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:28,320
in, well, you drop your tablet and then I put my tablet and I just put the whole thing in.

181
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,560
Then I put a whole banana in. No, no. See, that's I'm mixed up. So please,

182
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,300
peanut butter. Well, you had your peanut butter and you mix the peanut butter,

183
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,500
the soy milk and the mineral already. So the reason why is because peanut butter,

184
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,960
this is not well known by white people, Westerners, but peanut butter is a thickener,

185
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,220
just like we use cornstarch and things and flour to thicken soups and whatever. Yeah.

186
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:56,120
In Thailand, it's used as a thickener or something called peanut peanut sauce.

187
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:02,380
It's a thickener. So anyone, I mean, I've seen people use that as like a dip. But anyway,

188
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,680
so you put these minerals in the peanut butter. If you ever cook peanut butter,

189
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,620
you'll put a tablespoon of peanut butter and half a cup of water straight around through

190
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:13,580
water as soon as it comes to a simmer, goes completely solid. And you're like,

191
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,700
what the hell happened here? It's a thickener. So. So what you're doing now is, again,

192
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:22,000
we approach the blender, put a given amount of soy milk and you always put less soy milk than you

193
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,520
think you're going to need, because the banana is 75 percent liquid, by the way.

194
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:33,940
You add your mineral, spin it on low. It could be on low and then add your peanut butter. And

195
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:38,400
after you add your peanut butter, give it at least 30 seconds of just with the peanut butter alone.

196
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:42,040
It's smooth peanut butter. But if you have crunchy, it'll break it up.

197
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:49,120
Not as good. All these things are organic, by the way. Right. And then you add your your banana.

198
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,840
Now, when you add the banana, you peel it from the blossom end up and you break off as you're

199
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:58,000
peeling, you break off a piece of banana and use your thumb, forefinger and middle finger,

200
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,240
index finger, let's say, to squeeze the banana. So it crushes slightly,

201
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,460
then drop it into the blender. Don't slice it with a knife and don't put a whole banana

202
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:12,900
in because the little pieces are very slippery. No pun intended. Bananas are slippery and they

203
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:18,560
will never catch the blade. So you want to start it off by bruising or breaking the banana fiber

204
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:23,119
so as you break off a piece of banana, squeeze it between your three fingers.

205
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,099
So it kind of breaks up a little bit, cutting it on a cutting board. Won't do it.

206
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,660
Putting a whole banana won't do it. By the way, again, just to comment,

207
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:35,400
they have these smoothie shops years ago on Skype. Some people started doing smoothies the way I

208
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,160
recommended because they used to bring their family to these smoothie places. You know,

209
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:43,720
they charge an arm and a leg and it's disgusting. I would never drink that stuff. What they do,

210
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,120
it's like, oh, that's like if you're feeding it to animals, you know,

211
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,640
finesse in what these smoothie shops do. You know, there was a point at which they

212
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,020
had these places called Orange Julius in the Northeast. That's different.

213
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:58,740
Which that's what's processed. That's heavily processed. Yeah. And but there but there was

214
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:03,340
a competitor to them that existed for a very short amount of time. It sounded like Orange Julius.

215
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:10,200
Yeah. It was almost the same color and something. Yeah. Something like that. Julian. It was like,

216
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:16,040
maybe, you know, like orange or Julian or something like real close. And the guy used

217
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,200
to break up stuff like you're talking about by hand as opposed to cutting it.

218
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,700
All kinds of stuff he did. And I just recalled this because of the banana. So what you're saying

219
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,560
is you break a piece of the banana off kind of like monkeys do when they're breaking pieces of

220
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:32,960
banana. Right. As as as it's spinning. Remember, it's been spinning for 30 seconds with the peanut

221
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,240
butter, mineral and soil ready. So if you put it. Yeah. In other words, if you don't fight,

222
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,680
if you put all the ingredients together at once and hit the on high, it's not going to be the

223
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:47,280
same at all. You could even don't trust me on that. If you want to experiment, waste a portion,

224
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,640
do one the way I'm saying and do another one where you throw everything bulk in there,

225
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,120
hit the button. You'll see they won't want to taste anything alike. So it sounds to me like

226
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,820
it won't blend right if you do that because. Well, it won't. Yeah. That that also. But it's

227
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:03,180
beyond physical. So. OK. So basically, it's just those three ingredients and you want to blend it.

228
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:08,260
And then what you do is another 30 seconds or so, vary your speeds and then turn it off

229
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:12,660
until everything settles. Count to five and then start from low to high again,

230
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,460
just ascending. And that's good. Reason you do that is if you missed a spot,

231
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,960
if you have a holiday banana that decides to go on holiday and not get mixed, what will happen?

232
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:25,080
It'll drop to the bottom. It'll be right next to the blade. So when you start it again,

233
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,300
it'll get caught. That's how you finesse a smoothie. And this is like a meal in a glass.

234
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:33,240
So you want to let that five, 10 seconds go so that if there's any chunks that are

235
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,580
air, they'll come back to the top, right on top of the blade. So when you restart it,

236
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,140
yep, you'll get them again. This is how you finesse. This is how you make a five star

237
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:51,060
smoothie. Nice Michelin, Michelin three star. I like it. Yeah, it's like so. Anyway, this is how

238
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:56,460
you do it to finesse it and impress people. Now, if you do this for white people, forget I love you.

239
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,360
They'll never because they'll never, they can't do it themselves. They lack finesse when it comes

240
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:06,060
to food. Definitely call you a gourmet. Yeah, they'll never. Yeah. You don't press the ladies.

241
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:11,260
If you're a guy and if you're a gal, don't press the guys. So anyway, this is finesse. This could

242
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:15,480
be a second or third date kind of move when they come to your house to watch Netflix or whatever.

243
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:20,440
Right. I mean, sure. Sure. In Spanish they call it Baja Panty. There we go. But anyway, anyway,

244
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:26,260
so. So it'll spent people in the Spanish would get a kick out of that, hopefully.

245
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:35,180
So, yeah, that's a Baja Panty move. So what what I'm saying is the important part to note here

246
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,440
is use whatever soy milk you think you're going to start out with. Use half of that

247
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,440
because the mixture is going to more than double, almost triple by the time you're done.

248
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,340
Now, what are you looking at? Jack would put half the soy milk in there and the thing would explode.

249
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:52,800
And by the way, for for like six ounces or seven, six ounces or seven ounces of soy milk,

250
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:57,020
I use two bananas and end up with two eight ounce glasses really thick. You know what it's done?

251
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,400
It's like cake mix. You know how delicious cake mix is, right? You know, especially a runny one,

252
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,640
you know, like me. Yeah, it's like a cake mix meal in a glass. Really, really good. Now,

253
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,040
on the old days, kids used to love to lick the beaters because that's right. Yeah,

254
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,560
that's right. And yeah, so I'm not going to touch that one. I know. But anyway,

255
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:18,680
so because, yeah, so the next one is if you're doing a smoothie, what I also do,

256
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:23,060
I call it a fruit bag. I go to get a mixed fruit, which is blackberries, strawberries,

257
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:27,980
blueberries in a bag frozen. OK, so you want one of those berry. They actually have plenty of these

258
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:32,640
things. Yeah, they have them at Walmart. Again, organic, non-organic. Now, a lot of these,

259
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:38,100
it's going to be hard to get organic. But anyway, get that. And I get some OJ and some banana and I

260
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:42,840
mix it in with some ginger slices. And again, I'm not going to give instructions on this,

261
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,000
but guess when you put your OJ, what's the first thing to go in after the OJ? Your mineral,

262
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:51,040
because you're going to buffer. It's very acidic. You know, one thing I remember when people get

263
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:55,720
these to family, go out and get the smoothies. So I spent fifty dollars on three or four smoothies

264
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,520
and the children in my belly hurts because they drink it. It's cold. It's full of acid. It's not

265
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:05,480
filtered. So when you add your mineral, you always add mineral to a smoothie. That's why

266
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,120
first I started. I would go ahead and get one of those big generic mineral supplements.

267
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,760
I don't know which one I use. I don't know. I could go and look if you want. Maybe that'll

268
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,760
help some people. You don't have to be like me. You could just. But don't get the powder. Don't

269
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:23,300
get the compacted tablet. It has to be a capsule. There's a difference, right? You know what I mean?

270
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:27,200
You know what a tablet is like an aspirin tablet. You don't want that. It has to be a capsule to

271
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:33,800
break down. You don't want a solid thing. Right. I got you. This one is. No, this is no. Let me

272
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:39,760
hear it is mega mineral. Yeah, it's a big extra. It's called Mega Minerals. Nature's Life.

273
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:45,780
OK, right. Some food has 13 essential minerals, 250 vegetarian capsules. Thank you very much.

274
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:51,700
Then it goes down the line. Price wise, they're not that dozen or so. Yeah. Price wise,

275
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,200
they're not that bad at Walmart. They got a big old cardboard pull out everywhere in the country

276
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,720
and you can find them in that section. Whatever. Yeah, I think now I think that was one in 10

277
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,180
or 15. But that's a year we've been running that now for a year and a half. Well, if you're

278
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:08,980
going to make it's for 250 smoothies. Right. So right. So how many smoothies are you going to

279
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:12,020
you're going to have one every single day, even if you had one every single day, you got

280
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:17,240
more. Yeah. And you probably won't because you want to break from it. So when you do the mixed

281
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:22,360
food and all that stuff, you should strain it. So what you do is you pour it out and you put it

282
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:29,120
through a colander, a strainer, a fine strainer, like a 30 mesh, even a 20 mesh is fine. You know,

283
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,060
it looks like a window screen. Right. I was just going to say it goes into another container.

284
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,680
Yeah. And then you put it back in the blender a little more. Now, your your mineral goes in

285
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:45,480
first and then your ginger slices and then your fruit slowly and you put a banana in last and you

286
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:50,580
make this delicious. It's almost like a passion fruit. And that, again, is a meal in a glass.

287
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,640
That's for summertime when I say meal in a glass. I mean, you'll have that. It'll hold you most of

288
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,920
the day. And then when you get hungry, you don't have to have a full meal. You can just have a

289
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:02,680
snack and you're good. And just eyeball the amount of mixed berries you want in there.

290
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:09,940
Just kind of OK. Yeah. In the beginning, whatever amount some people I prefer them so sick that

291
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:13,640
they're like a meal in a glass. You almost need a spoon. I like this stuff, really. But that's

292
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:19,160
harder. That's more on the pro smoothie maker level. The center smoothies are more for beginners.

293
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:23,640
They just practice on getting them thicker and thicker. You should always have a spatula,

294
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:29,460
those silicone spatulas to get it out and also for screening it. But you should always strain

295
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:34,100
your smoothies if you have berries. Always. Oh, my gosh. You're charging like twelve dollars for

296
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:38,980
a smoothie is more than 10 years ago. And they didn't even strain us with it. It's like it was

297
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:42,860
like people paying twelve bucks for a smoothie with berries and with all the seeds and everything.

298
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,720
They don't even know. And it's like, my gosh, you throw that in a trough.

299
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,900
Too many damn seeds. Yeah, of course. Yeah. It's like who would want to drink

300
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:55,280
that? And no buffer as you buffer. What? What? It's full of acids anyway. So that's this.

301
00:24:55,420 --> 00:25:01,040
That's pretty much a summer regimen diet. You do need the mineral because of the heat.

302
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,900
See, because this summer, the heat is very young. It's going to make you yin and produce

303
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:12,380
yin in the environment. You just get your energy from the environment. Right. So you're in the

304
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:19,240
winter. The cold is very yin. And that's going to make you very young. Right. That's why when

305
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,500
something is soft, when you put cold, which is very yin, what does it become? It becomes hard.

306
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,380
It freezes. Right. So it's young. You see the yin and yang cold when something is

307
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:33,020
heat is very young. When you put a lot of heat on something, what happens? It melts.

308
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:39,460
Right. So I'm also just curious. It might be a dumb question, but at no point do you

309
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:44,760
add any water to this, huh? No water. You don't have to unless you end up wanting to thin it out

310
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:48,900
for any reason. Sometimes if it gets too thick, it won't spin at the top. Stop the blender

311
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:53,880
because it will burn out the bushing. The bushing on the blade requires for it to be in water or

312
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:59,060
wet. OK, so you might want to add you could add water if it depends on taste again or if you want

313
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:03,700
to minimize on the orange juice. OK, let's say it doesn't have to be orange juice. I've used other

314
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:10,260
juices, whatever. If you if you have fruit like you, you can make an apricot puree using water.

315
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:15,400
If you have really good tasting water, you can puree the apricots, make like a baby food out of

316
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:20,220
them using just water. So it's a lot of apricot. But things like apricot, you don't have to peel.

317
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:25,740
The peel dissolves very readily. Well, somebody somebody who's listening to you about food before

318
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:30,280
them might say, well, look, a lot of this you're not talking about eating locally here, you know?

319
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:37,340
Oh, yes and no. The bananas are kind of odd because they're they harvested in the winter

320
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:42,820
sometimes or they grow all year round. But that's a tropical fruit. Right. It will. OK,

321
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:48,180
so what does a tropical fruit do? Does it adjust? It's grown. What? Tropical means it's warm and

322
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:53,340
hot. Right. Right. So if you eat tropical fruit, it will adjust your body chemistry to what? A

323
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:59,180
warm and hot climate. OK, so that will be easier to get along with. Right. OK, now it's easier to

324
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:03,080
do that for the summer to adopt because, believe it or not, most of the fruit that people partake

325
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:08,560
in and that's popular tend to be of the tropical type, even sugar is tropical. So it's easier to

326
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:15,320
go and sink in the summer than the winter. Now, the thing that'll really mess you up in the summer

327
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:23,000
is something like polar fish, like halibut, salmon. Remember when there was a big popularity

328
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,680
in salmon 20 years ago? That was the thing that people were dying, even with the ACs. I mean,

329
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:33,280
they were felt uncomfortable no matter how cold the room was, because, you know, the polar,

330
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:39,760
you know, the cold weather fish. Right. So and meats also, certain meats, cured meats in the

331
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,740
summer you want to avoid. But you do need the mineral and the salt because your body needs that

332
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:51,020
to process and stay active, you know, because your body produces all the minerals it needs from

333
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:57,360
sodium basically and magnesium. Right. Anyway, we've we've kind of gone into that before,

334
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:02,960
but let's jump off of the food thing. But that's how you make a pro smoothie. I want to go back to

335
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:10,280
the Brandon Joe Williams stuff. Right. OK, what's happening is he's going into a jackass scenario.

336
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:16,520
Now, if you watch the movie Jackass, not every stunt they did was successful, but not everyone

337
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:22,020
failed. It was kind of like some some people did succeed in all the stunts. Right. Yeah. Well,

338
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:26,200
that was part of the you know, that look, that was part of the entertainment value. Like you try this

339
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,340
and now we get to see whether it succeeds or not. Yeah, that's right. So that's what's going to that's

340
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:35,300
what he's going through. So it's fun. It's good that he has pokes fun at everything because he

341
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:40,740
should. Now, what I suggest that he's the last time on last Sonic that he is not doing well

342
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:46,960
is that he's doing blanket and blank endorsements or a nonconditional endorsement he's putting

343
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:52,120
without recourse. But without recourse does not mean that you do not not have a tax liability,

344
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:58,680
could arise a tax liability. The only way to get out of that using the system they set up

345
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:06,340
is titled 12 USC for 11, where you just every country, by the way, has their own thing where

346
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:12,940
they cannot stop you from putting a restrictive endorsement by law, they can refuse to give you

347
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:17,780
service, but they can't stop you see, there's a trick there. But so I know in Europe, if you put

348
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:22,840
lawful money only, right, that helps, right, you could do that here too, but citing the code.

349
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:27,660
So he might get nailed on that. The other thing is regarding signature, there's a lot of stuff

350
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:32,560
about people with traffic stuff, the cop wants you to sign and they don't want to sign because they

351
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:38,860
think if they sign, by the way, you autograph as a human being. But when they ask you for a

352
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:43,100
signature, that's usually like an authorized signature for someone else's signatory.

353
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:48,200
A signatory is someone that represents someone who are you representing the all caps name,

354
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:52,620
right? Because that's a public corporation that was started after you were born. If you look at a

355
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:57,420
birth or long form birth certificate, it has the date and the time when you were born. And then

356
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:02,240
it shows another date and time when they created the all caps public corporation, what they call

357
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:08,880
straw man, right? And then the way you identify that is, is when it says when it made it to a

358
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:14,140
public official's office or hands or whatever, right? So it's usually a week or a few days later,

359
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:20,040
usually some states have codes, it has to be done within 72 hours. So if they really wanted you to

360
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:24,360
make your mark, they'd say I need your autograph. When you go to people, they don't ask for your

361
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:30,060
signature. If you're famous, they ask for what your autograph, right? But corporate and legal

362
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:36,240
and law, they ask for signature because you're a signatory for someone else. So what I've done

363
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,100
in the past, and this created quite a ruckus, and I've been telling people this, you know,

364
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:46,880
this is one way to escape, you know, the binding. You get a traffic ticket once you sign Sure,

365
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:52,440
no problem. Boom, what do you sign void? You sign void and it looks you ever see how doctors sign?

366
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:57,880
Yeah, right. You're right vo ID with a dot but it looks like and they say what's that? You know?

367
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:02,140
Well, that's how I sign and then you send the ticket back and you write a letter

368
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:07,320
that this is no good. I signed it void. Why is it no good? Oh, come on, come on completely

369
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:11,480
illegal what they're doing, right? You can depending on your own way, or I'm returning

370
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,820
it back to you. By the way, it's signed void. I've done that. And then it's an attorney for

371
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:21,640
the city came back. He can't sign his own ticket void. Like it's my ticket. Now. You see how they

372
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:25,720
play around? You know, it's not my ticket at all. That's your property did the hot potato.

373
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,940
But you sign everything void. I mean, people are like, Oh, you sign that? Of course,

374
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:36,000
we're going to sign your stuff, too. I don't care. And but the thing is, if you don't tell them it's

375
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
void, they think it's a signature and they keep moving along. If you want to act on it. You do

376
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,820
this and you send back say, Hey, look, there's your document back. And by the way, it's signed

377
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:51,520
void because it's void. Why is it void? You get some examples. So unilateral contract, meaning

378
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:56,840
the only one signing. So obviously, you're here to defraud. Number two, it's unconscionable

379
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:02,900
because this thing you're bringing up law, legal stuff. And you're asking me to waive

380
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:07,380
all these things. You know, you can go on and on and on and on, however you want to do it.

381
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:14,100
You know, basically, the in order to do this right, you need to do A, B, C and D or whatever.

382
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:19,280
Or I signed it void because I was under a complete panic and I didn't want to do anything legally

383
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:25,520
binding. That's the best one. I was I felt like like my life was threatened and I didn't

384
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:30,240
want anything to do anything, anything legally binding. Oh, you should see that freak out.

385
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:35,820
One of them was like, Oh, we sent your stuff to the Department of Justice. So I'm like, Oh, great.

386
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:42,520
That's great. Thank you. Yeah, that's great. Educate them. Okay, here's the thing about

387
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:46,140
education. And Brandon's mentioned this also, and I've been saying this for 20 years.

388
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:52,740
Do you think people working in any government office, any government office, the IRS or the bank

389
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:59,280
know any of this? No. Do you think you're going to make 20 or 30 bucks an hour sitting in the bank?

390
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:05,020
And the reality of it is you just need to write your name and write out the amount and go to the

391
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:09,800
Federal Reserve and have that given to you in notes or on an account. Do you think you're going to be

392
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:16,000
doing what you're doing like a cop or a lawyer or an accountant or working at the IRS or working

393
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,900
at the DMV or working at the State Department? Do you think if you know the reality of the

394
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:29,220
Bill of Exchange Act and the March the 9th Emergency, 1933 Emergency Banking Act, do you

395
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:34,820
think that if you knew any of the UCC, these people would be sitting there working, trying to

396
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:40,880
quote unquote pay bills? No, nobody knows this. Nobody because let's hearken back. How many times

397
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,060
have you heard me talk about stuff in the Bible that sounds fucking outrageous, and you go and

398
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:49,100
look it up and it's right there and it's contrary to what everyone thinks? Yeah, all the time,

399
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:55,960
right? All the time. This is the same stuff. So basically, endorsement, endorsement, endorsement.

400
00:33:56,020 --> 00:34:01,580
In other words, you are free. Okay. America is the free one of the freest countries in the world.

401
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:05,640
That's why it got so bad. What happens is when you have a free society and open society,

402
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:09,960
a bunch of people over here are going to say, hey, it's real easy to steal from them over there.

403
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,280
We just go over there. How are we going to steal from them? Well, the best thing is you don't have

404
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:19,659
to rob a bank if you own it. The best way to rob a bank is to own a bank, right? Yeah, of course.

405
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:23,340
So that's how they got in. So basically, this is the same ancient group of people.

406
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:29,560
And well, the old saying, right, you can rob a bank with a gun, but with a bank, you can rob the

407
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:35,100
world, right? So yeah, on and on and on. Yeah. And they're not even banks. They're national associations.

408
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:40,620
And we've got all that on older Sonics. So what's going on is no one knows what's going on. And I

409
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:44,659
think anyone who's been into Greek food for a long time is can validate that for sure.

410
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:50,239
When I say no one, I mean, with very little exception, you're not going to be happy. But

411
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:54,600
the thing is, would you rather know what's going on and not be happy or not know what's going on

412
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:58,820
and not be happy? Because believe me, all these people that think they're happy or not happy,

413
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,380
they did these, you know, there's something called the misery index. Yes, right. Yeah. And

414
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:07,920
they found like, what is it, 78 or 87, one of those percentages of people are unhappy.

415
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:13,940
And 100% of those people are 99.99999% don't know what's going on. They're still unhappy.

416
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:20,220
Right? So you're here to waste your time, folks. You know, and one of the most important things

417
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:25,620
other than that, is this is a planet surface dwelling Earth inhabitants are fucking morons,

418
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:30,600
right? That's fucking with a cup capital K. Oh, they're idiots. And it ain't gonna change.

419
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:36,140
Because the children now can change. But the children are being raised by idiots. And it

420
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:41,000
continues and continues and continues. The only way to stop it is to pull when the children are

421
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,700
born to take them away from the parents, by the way, and have them raised in a situation a new

422
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:53,480
society. Somehow. Right? It would look like a big orphanage. Right? Because you will be like one

423
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:58,520
adult for 10 children, no pedophiles. You know, I didn't say pedophile because pedo is feet.

424
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:06,820
Yeah, right. So yeah, and you've raised that way. And then you have to wait for the adults to die

425
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:12,820
off. Because you can't throw them back into society, you have to wait a good 7080 years.

426
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:20,060
Or you can accelerate the process of dying off the the adults with a big war or a real pandemic.

427
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,820
Right? And I'm all for that stuff, but not the bullshit to a real one. You're gonna have a real

428
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:31,000
war, do a real fucking war where you wipe out everybody. That's the opposing side, right?

429
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:34,560
But only after you separate a group of children that can that's right.

430
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:40,160
That's right. This is all bullshit. So so this is proof that there are higher powers that don't

431
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,960
allow this because all this thing has to chug along what has to chug along the era of everybody

432
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:50,480
wasting each other's time, which has been over 5000 years, 6000 plus years, sorry, that everyone

433
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:56,400
is wasting everyone's time. And that's just cosmic. It has to go that way. And fortunately,

434
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,340
you don't live that long. And what I mean, like 70, even if you live 70 8090, you're more fortunate

435
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:06,880
if you die when you're 30. But either way, you don't have to put up with it that long, right?

436
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,980
And your memory isn't that good. And you're emotionally limited, meaning most humans,

437
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:15,100
so they're not going to be that their spirit isn't going to be that negatively affected by

438
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:19,080
being an idiot for the whole life, their whole lives, right? Because you're most they don't know

439
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:23,200
what emotions are for. So they're not going to be right, their spirits can have minimal effect,

440
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:28,480
they got video games, they got porn, they got sports, they got church, they got each other,

441
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:33,580
right? outward appearances, to me is that the most idiotic people seem to be quite pleased,

442
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:38,640
you know, with everything. Yeah, but they're still unhappy. But whether it's 78%, or 87%

443
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:43,740
of the people are none of those people know anything about anything at all. Right? So that's

444
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:48,960
just the thing, because they know something's not right. And they, here's the thing, if anyone ever

445
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,420
tells you you're anti government or anti, you know, you're actually the United the laws of

446
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:58,280
the United States, even the corporation, those beautiful laws ever, just right, if everyone

447
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:05,220
followed the law, think about it, you need to feed your children. How much do you need $42,896.40

448
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:10,000
you write that out, you write it out in words, right, you put the number just like a check,

449
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,820
you go to Federal Reserve, you write down the demand, right, Federal Reserve window, and they

450
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:18,580
have is I put this in my account. And then you say, Okay, 15 minutes, you go to your account,

451
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:24,400
you run your card through and guess what's there? 42,890. Right, go feed your children.

452
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:29,120
That means a gallon of milk will be like 1800 bucks, but that's fine. It doesn't matter. Just

453
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:34,840
numbers. Especially if you can just go back and write another piece of paper out. Well, you know,

454
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:40,380
in the Matrix, when they had Neo tied down, it says we created a world for you where it was a

455
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:45,260
paradise. But it didn't couldn't last, right? Right. That's like, did you remember there was

456
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:53,340
they rejected it was the problem is raised to perfect, right? This was done a starting in the

457
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:58,420
1800s. So the 1930s, the entire world, if you study all the banking laws and all that stuff,

458
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:03,360
that all a we're in a perfect world, but they can't tell the people that certain people who

459
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:08,300
know how it runs, it would be perfect. In other words, there's no need for money. So at all,

460
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:13,660
because you just, you know, eventually, let's say, once it gets to the point where it's $10,000 for

461
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:18,480
a gallon of milk, people say, Wait a second, stop. Why do we even need this ridiculous stuff, right?

462
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,280
And then you move on to the next level. And that's exactly where we are right now. That's

463
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:26,640
why branding and talks about infinite money is 100% correct. Just like I've been saying for

464
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,580
two decades now, on Greek speak, you know, when I go to a checkout, and they said,

465
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:35,460
you want to give the change to charity? And I said, Why? No, no. Why are their fingers broken?

466
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:39,080
They look at me like, what? What do you mean? They just sign their name, right? Go to frozen,

467
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,600
they'll give them whatever, just write your name comes drawn off your signature.

468
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:46,860
been saying this ever since anyone's been listening to Greek speak, and I can give you the details.

469
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:53,040
It's exactly how it's done. So and where and who and what. But no one knows this for a reason. It's

470
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:59,200
part of the cosmic censorship. But it doesn't mean that the time isn't right at any time.

471
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:07,000
When someone jumps forward, it makes a big deal about it. Now, to answer sets a semi answer of the

472
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,700
email I got about what's the negative of Brandon Joe, Joe Williams. The other thing is, if there's

473
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:16,880
if you put in his name on YouTube, most recent their YouTube search where there's some people

474
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,400
that are having successes, and they show you what they write on a gas bill, basically,

475
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,920
you got a gas bill, electric bill, credit card bill, whatever, you know, the voucher that says,

476
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:31,540
cut this off and send it, it says it's a voucher, a coupon says, yeah, no one knows how to fill

477
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:35,460
those out. So what they do is they stack them. And you know, if you have unsigned checks are

478
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:39,320
called non performing instruments, and those are still cashable, as long as they have a number on

479
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:46,420
them, but you get like one or 2%. So the companies keep these, and they still monetize them. But what

480
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:52,040
you're supposed to do is cross out a few things on there. In other words, adjust the address,

481
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:58,480
you write your name, and who it's for, meaning you write your name twice, and you write out the

482
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:03,040
amount with words, just like you know, to check how they have you write it out with words, right?

483
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:08,540
If it's right, yeah, if it's 1000, you write o n e t h o u. That's right. Yeah, that's right.

484
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:14,700
Because in the UCC, the priority is when something is typewritten. It's it has authority. But when

485
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:21,100
something is handwritten, it has an even higher authority than anything printed, right? So that's

486
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:25,260
why they make you write it out, it has nothing to do with it, you know, so what you do, then,

487
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:30,340
is a few more items is a few people that show you could state a couple of codes,

488
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:35,280
and you send it in with a letter with instructions, right? They in other words,

489
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:40,600
their computers are connected with the utility company. So they're part of a network. And that

490
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:44,920
network eventually ends up at the Federal Reserve discount window, you tell them what to do with it,

491
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,740
I'm not gonna, this will have to be, we could spend an hour going step by step, just like we

492
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:53,760
did the smoothie, maybe we should have done this instead of the smoothie, right? How to write a bill

493
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:59,380
of exchange, right? Let's get it next time. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So and you send it in and it works,

494
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:04,180
it does zero out. It's really funny, though, because I remember doing this a long time ago,

495
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:08,860
call started zeroing everything out. After a while, they sent you a bill, but not never for

496
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:14,220
the amount that was zeroed out, just starting new again. And you call around and they're like,

497
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:17,120
well, if we do it for you, basically, the long story, make sure if we do it for you,

498
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:22,000
we have to do it for everyone. You get it, duh. That's how everyone should be doing it.

499
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:28,040
It will collapse the system, it will collapse the system, but the system was set to fail this way.

500
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:32,100
You How many times have you heard that the money collapsed in the country failed the society

501
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:38,320
collapsed, right? In the past 150 years, this happens very often, right? So that this if you

502
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:44,740
have a society like this one, that's based on Christian values, and the money system and the

503
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:49,460
medical system, it deserves to collapse. And it's amazing that it's held on for over 150 years this

504
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:54,260
way. And in earnest over 90 years this way with the fake medical and the fake law and the fake

505
00:42:55,080 --> 00:43:01,040
money, it needs to collapse and it's going to be horrible. But then again, if you have a good

506
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:06,940
pandemic and a war, a real war, you know, and a real pandemic, a real war with real generals,

507
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:11,160
where you take out huge amounts of huge civilian populations and take out the military, everything.

508
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:16,800
That's what I'm about a real war. And a real pandemic where people go to work in the morning,

509
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,060
and then they die on their way to work, right, but coming back home, a real pandemic,

510
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:28,000
the collapse, what will be less people will come together when they're have a real war and a real

511
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:34,000
pandemic, and the money will not be so important. So that's how you buffer out the society solely

512
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:41,160
collapsing, because the money systems falling apart. So fun days, man, fun days. You know,

513
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:46,800
that's that's what that's the absolute necessity. And if you happen to be here, it's going to be

514
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:52,020
rough. But you know, hey, sorry, you know, you ask your parents to be born here, or you dropped

515
00:43:52,020 --> 00:44:00,780
here from a higher power. So the only solution to total mayhem from us money, everybody finding out

516
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:05,620
the money system when the legal system is a complete fraud, and all that and the medical

517
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:11,960
system is a complete fraud is to have the war and a real pandemic. So the chances of all three

518
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:16,720
happening are slim than none, you'll get another fake war another fake pandemic. And will the

519
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,260
people find out how the money system works? No, so it's not going to happen. But I just gave you

520
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:21,700
the solution. Yeah.
