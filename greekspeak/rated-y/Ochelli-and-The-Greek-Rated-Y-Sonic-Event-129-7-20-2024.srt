1
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:17,660
Rated Y, Sonic Event 129, Greek, little noise this time, how are you doing?

2
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:25,160
I'm fine, I just got in, I'm testing a new amp, and it's funny how these things you have to burn them in, all the circuits and all that,

3
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:31,520
that I have to do my upgrades, because believe it or not, these guys don't really understand electricity any more than I do,

4
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:40,420
but I think I'm a little better with it, so basically I use something called doping, doping is like when you coat something with something else,

5
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:49,100
right, to change its qualities, so I have a special doping formula I put on the circuitry, and it really, really improves it.

6
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:55,720
Nice, so do you make sure it's well shielded, because I hate it, I had many experiences with amplifiers as a musician.

7
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:04,260
Yes and no, yes and no, there's a balanced and unbalanced, shielding should only be where you need it,

8
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:09,560
because if you shield too much, you get inductance and it kills the sound.

9
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,480
I just like to block it so it's not picking up radio transmissions, you know what I'm saying, that kind of crap.

10
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:24,280
Well yeah, it also depends on the topography of the circuit, something like an old Krell KSA 150 is so massive,

11
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:33,400
or if you're using, anyway, look up Krell amplifiers from back in the day, Dan D'Agostino, he's a really good guy too,

12
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:38,200
but then you have the valve amps, which are tube amps, and those are so massive,

13
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:46,220
and the only place you'll get noise with those is what they do with the big amps still, is they pot them,

14
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,120
the toroid, the transformer is filled with asphalt bitumen, right, to damp it out.

15
00:01:51,740 --> 00:02:00,060
But anyway, yeah, I'm an audio guy, and pretty soon I'll be doing a seminar on how to make counter space acoustic modules,

16
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:05,740
they work in rooms, they work in speakers, they work in cars, recently sent a pair out to someone,

17
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:10,860
it's a little flat, you know what those cheese cutting boards look like, you know, the small cheese cutting boards?

18
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:11,840
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

19
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:17,520
Yeah, okay, they look like that, and you put it behind the speaker in your car, you take the speaker out,

20
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,060
and it's like the reports I've been getting back, it's amazing how clear the music sounds,

21
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:27,780
and I could be driving at 70 miles an hour, and the noise doesn't bother, and you can hear it right through it,

22
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,500
just more clarity, and how to do it inside of a loudspeaker, how to put it on a headphone,

23
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:38,240
that's a little more technical, because to put it on a headphone, it's a little earbuds, it has to be small,

24
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,560
the device has to be smaller than a grain of rice, and most people are not used to working on that scale.

25
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:49,300
Yeah, I hate that kind of thing anyway, even as I sit here with you, you know, I wear the old style,

26
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,180
you know, headphones like that we would get in the 70s, sort of, you know what I mean?

27
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:58,380
That's fine, those would be the size of a nickel, earbuds would be the size of a grain of rice,

28
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:04,460
for a home loudspeaker, the only problem with this in a home loudspeaker, is this creates a pseudo volume,

29
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:10,440
so now the box is too big, so you have to build a baffle, so let's say you have a cubic foot,

30
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,100
a cubic foot, 12x12x12 speaker, you put a module in there, the box is way too big now,

31
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:21,160
you just need a half of that, so you know what that would do for manufacturing, right?

32
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,000
You use half the material, right, and you have better sound also,

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,160
it's kind of like the scalerators to the water industry, this is what it would be for the audio industry,

34
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:37,040
but that's another discussion, I'm not that naive to think that these things that I've designed

35
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,480
and others have done that are going to help anyone, it's on a mass level.

36
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,000
Well, you never know, musicians might appreciate that though, like for instance,

37
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:50,040
I was just thinking, does it require four of these things if you have a cabinet with four speakers in it?

38
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,920
No, one.

39
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:51,880
You just need one.

40
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:58,960
It does a given volume, so if you have a three-way speaker with, let's say, a tweeter, a squawker,

41
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,160
you know, mid-range and a woofer, you need one for each one of those,

42
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,820
or if you have a cabinet with four, five, six, ten, twelve woofers, you just need one.

43
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,920
You just need one for every enclosure.

44
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:14,080
Now, some loudspeakers have four woofers and the enclosure has four separate sub-enclosures inside,

45
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,140
in that case, you would.

46
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,640
Oh, yeah, well, if you have a PA speaker that has more than one type of projection,

47
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,580
then you would need several, but if you have a singular type.

48
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,180
Sure, yeah, these are acoustic modules.

49
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,480
It also works on anything that vibrates that makes sound.

50
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,460
What it does is it creates a coherent counter-space.

51
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:35,160
It's kind of like, imagine architects design bathtubs with no drains, right?

52
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,340
This is what acoustic engineers are doing, and it's not a physical drain like a vent.

53
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,780
It has to do with counter-space.

54
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,120
Everything in nature recognizes where it has to be and what it has to do in space,

55
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,560
and it always creates or looks for a counter-space, just like when you're doing circuitry.

56
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,300
The ground, you know, the positive and the negative, the ground on a DC circuit,

57
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,080
or even AC circuit, is your counter-space, right?

58
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:10,120
So, anyway, just to take off from where we finished last, a quick segue is about how to turn a—

59
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,100
I'm going to be going over some notes and something else here.

60
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,360
I hope I can pull it up.

61
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:15,920
No problem.

62
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,220
Well, you did the smoothie recipe last time, too.

63
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,280
Yeah, about how to turn a bill into a check.

64
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:30,220
Now, the notes I'm going to be going over, just so anybody can do it, is someone asked that to ChatGPT.

65
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:41,180
A bill of exchange is a check, and I'm going to read what ChatGPT said, because ChatGPT gives you the whole thing.

66
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:50,680
So the question is, just real quick, now, I don't—first of all, going into this, just like I'm going to say now,

67
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:55,120
is like someone thinking they can cook because they heard one or two Greeks speak, and they don't have sharp knives,

68
00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:00,260
they don't know proper kitchen hygiene and all the fine stuff and food combination.

69
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,520
You're not going to be able to cook, right?

70
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,220
Of course not.

71
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,880
You're going to need to prepare first.

72
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,540
You're going to need to have your tools, you know, and your space.

73
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,380
Yeah, so in order to do this, you really have to know about the bankruptcy.

74
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,440
You really have to know about March the 9th, 1933.

75
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:21,440
Google, if you put in March the 9th, 1933 right now, Google will set up a big paragraph for you in bold of what it was.

76
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,560
Would you do that?

77
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:30,260
Put in March the 9th, 1933, just as a date in a Google browser, and it will—you know how it gives you websites, time and date?

78
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:30,980
It won't give you any of that.

79
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,480
It'll give you a big paragraph about the banking holiday.

80
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,480
It's called Federal Reserve Discount and Banking Ordinances or something like that.

81
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:47,760
It says the Emergency Banking Act was a federal law passed in 1933, signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on March 9, 1933.

82
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:48,960
That's right.

83
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,220
But do they give you, like, an excerpt from it in bold?

84
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,740
I did not get an excerpt right away, no.

85
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,480
Oh, okay, just a link.

86
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,160
Is it a link, or they actually make a Google statement?

87
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,480
They give a Google statement.

88
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

89
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,080
See, see, see how important that is?

90
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,900
Yeah, and then you have Ballotpedia.

91
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,660
You can go to Emergency Banking Act on Ballotpedia.

92
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,080
That's the first thing that comes up.

93
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,060
And Federal Reserve History is next, and that's at the—let's see.

94
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,940
Notice that's not a .gov address, by the way, the Federal Reserve, just saying.

95
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,660
No, it's not.

96
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,200
It's not.

97
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,360
Any government entity does not have to use postage.

98
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,940
So if you get a letter from the IRS, it's postage prepaid because it's not government.

99
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,440
Also, the IRS and Federal Reserve, in the telephone book, there's a government section.

100
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,960
They're not in the government section.

101
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,220
Yeah, it's what they call the franking privilege, right?

102
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,240
The ability to not—

103
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,260
Yeah, well, it's really simple.

104
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:46,020
This is for every country by the 1950s lost their—and put up their citizens in the other land.

105
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,260
They lost the country.

106
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,840
Every country's government lost the country in a card game with the central bankers by the 50s.

107
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,120
Canada was lost before the U.S. was lost, by the way.

108
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,240
They experimented there.

109
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,180
Just like, you know, they're experimenting on North Korea, you know, for 60 years.

110
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,640
They're just waiting.

111
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,780
There's no reason to end the experiment, right, because we're still experimenting.

112
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,820
So, you know, it's funny.

113
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,200
Americans are no different than North Koreans.

114
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:17,100
There was someone that went there in 2019, a French journalist, attorney,

115
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,780
and he asked one of the professors there, one of the colleges in North Korea or high school teachers,

116
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,320
said, if the government allowed you to travel, what countries would you like to visit?

117
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,260
This is in 2019.

118
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:31,640
And the North Korean teacher said, I would like to visit East Germany and the Soviet Union.

119
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,020
So he didn't know that those don't exist anymore.

120
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,000
This is how Americans are with this.

121
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,360
Americans do have no idea.

122
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,240
But let's go back to it.

123
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,840
How to turn any bill into a check.

124
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,680
This was asked to ChatGPT.

125
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,060
This is the question.

126
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:51,980
What is the proper way to endorse the back of a bill to legally convert it into a check?

127
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:56,920
Now ChatGPT answers back.

128
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:03,980
Endorsing the back of a bill, parentheses, such as a utility bill or invoice, close parentheses,

129
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:10,120
to convert it into a check involves specific steps to ensure it meets the requirements of negotiable instruments

130
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,180
under the Uniform Commercial Code, UCC.

131
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,900
Here's a detailed guide.

132
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,760
Steps to endorse a bill as a check.

133
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:23,980
Write the payee information, one, which is to the order of, on the back of the bill,

134
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:31,140
and write, in quotes, pay to the order of, name of the payee, usually the person or entity you want to pay.

135
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,500
Then it has number two, endorse the bill, your signature.

136
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:41,520
By the way, when you ever hear signature, it means you're signing your signatory.

137
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,180
It means it's not you.

138
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,020
When someone wants you, they ask for an autograph.

139
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:51,620
So all the governments, all the corporations, all the banks ask for a signature because you're signing for the all-caps name,

140
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,440
which is not a straw man.

141
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,460
It's a public corporation that was started.

142
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,340
You can find when it was started on the long-form birth certificate.

143
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:05,820
The long-form birth certificate application has all the information, when you were born, time and date.

144
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,860
And then it has a date when it was received by a public official.

145
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:15,680
That's when you went, that's when the all-caps public corporation was started.

146
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,720
Isn't the paper thing, it's the date it was reported because it's usually reported by the mother?

147
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,060
No, it was the date it was received by a public official on the form.

148
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,820
And then that's when the all-caps name started, that corporation.

149
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:35,920
So you can actually, if you have that information, you could say all-caps, you could say the public corporation that was started on,

150
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,780
and it's usually three days to two weeks after you were born.

151
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,920
Don't call it the straw man because it's not a straw man.

152
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,560
It's actually a public corporation.

153
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,880
That's why when you understand the back of a social security card has another set of numbers,

154
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,160
you can get a routing number from the treasury.

155
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,500
Just call them and get a routing number and then put those numbers in.

156
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,800
You could pretty much go to a car and buy a car, buy anything you want with it.

157
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,660
It works sometimes.

158
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,880
And later on when they audit it, a couple of years later, some attorney general will say,

159
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,180
that was fraudulent. You were using public funds for that.

160
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,840
You have to go to jail now.

161
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,300
Get it? Public funds.

162
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,180
And people agree, they don't know.

163
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,580
The attorney general doesn't know any law at all.

164
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,660
If he did, he wouldn't be there.

165
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,660
Anyway, so I just wanted to bring up, so your signature, that was okay too.

166
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,500
Endorse the bill.

167
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:29,280
Your signature below the pay-to-the-order-of quote line, sign your name.

168
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:33,200
This signature endorses the bill and makes it payable to the named payee.

169
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,820
Remember, this is all chat GPT now, right?

170
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,840
This is taking, what I'm saying, attorney bill.

171
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:44,240
A gas bill, a phone bill, a mortgage payment, whatever.

172
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,640
They send you those vouchers, coupons.

173
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,780
Detach this and send this in with your payment.

174
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,340
In the negotiable, okay, there's a dunning law.

175
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,300
You know, when you send someone a bill, it's called your dunn.

176
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,360
You dunn them, D-U-N-N-E-D.

177
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,280
It's a dunning.

178
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,340
There used to be something called dunning report,

179
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,240
which is like bills that were sent to the government.

180
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,600
Anyway, this is older language.

181
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,240
They stopped using the language in the 70s.

182
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,080
You know, when I say that, I remember those days.

183
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,460
That's fucking 50 years ago, right?

184
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:11,960
Yeah.

185
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,260
So, 74 is 50 years ago.

186
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,100
Wow, I remember.

187
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,920
Anyway, yeah, so when you get dunned,

188
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:28,420
one of the things in the laws was written that if you, in a credit-based economy,

189
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,620
and you send someone a bill, you also have to give them the voucher

190
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,440
or the check to pay for it.

191
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:38,800
And payment consists of them agreeing, receiving, and signing it,

192
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,180
and then you receiving it back, right?

193
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,240
So anyway, okay, so to endorse the bill,

194
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,420
the next step from CHAT-GPT is restrictive endorsement, optional.

195
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,760
For additional security, you can add a restrictive endorsement,

196
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,280
such as for deposit only to the account.

197
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,600
Use the account number on the bill, quote.

198
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:00,880
This restricts the checks that could only be deposited for that specific account,

199
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,620
which is actually very important because they'll take it and use it.

200
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:09,080
They'll go to Vegas and use it or whatever, and they'll tell you they never got it.

201
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,440
And it won't show on the books that they ever got it

202
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,420
because they didn't apply it to your billing, right?

203
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,380
Number three, include.

204
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,140
Remember, this is all CHAT-GPT now, right?

205
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:26,100
Number three, include important information, which is the date, right?

206
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,760
The date of the endorsement, right?

207
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,220
So you write that next to the endorsement, right?

208
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:29,940
Amount.

209
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,780
If not already clear on the face of the bill, indicate the amount being endorsed.

210
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:39,820
Now, you have to write the amount also in words, just like you do on a regular check.

211
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,040
A lot of people that – if you don't have success –

212
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,020
I've seen people who have not had success, they did not write it out just like you write a check.

213
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,180
So 500 would be F-I-V-E-H-U-N-D-R-E-D, right?

214
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,860
And no cents or whatever cents, right?

215
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
All right, okay.

216
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,440
Example endorsement.

217
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,160
This is still CHAT-GPT.

218
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,840
Suppose you are converting utility bill to a check to pay John Doe.

219
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,860
Let's see.

220
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:08,780
Where am I?

221
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,180
I lost my place here.

222
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:15,990
Okay.

223
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,780
What happened?

224
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,240
It disappeared.

225
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:24,600
Suppose you are converting a utility bill to a check to pay John Doe.

226
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:29,560
Pay to the order of John Doe, your signature, date, and then amount

227
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,240
if you want to add a restrictive endorsement.

228
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,060
Okay.

229
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,160
It ends there.

230
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:33,900
We can keep going.

231
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,040
Did you get that last part?

232
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,340
So, okay.

233
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,260
Suppose you are converting utility bill to a check to pay John Doe.

234
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:46,200
That means that – let's say I get a utility bill for $127.46.

235
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,980
The voucher on the bottom.

236
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,540
I could write all those things on it and write pay to the order of Chuck O'Chelley on it.

237
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,520
You could go and cash that.

238
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,440
My utility bill.

239
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,900
Now that – you really want to flip a normie's head out?

240
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,780
That's a mind-bender.

241
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:02,480
Right.

242
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,580
It's not actually if you understand the negotiable instruments acts.

243
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:13,120
So in other words, Chuck, you could get all your bills, tear off the vouchers on the bottom,

244
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,800
endorse them a certain way, give them to me, and I could go cash them.

245
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,800
Cash them so I could go buy cigarettes and coffee.

246
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:19,060
Right.

247
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,160
With your bills.

248
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:20,980
Yeah.

249
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:21,420
Okay.

250
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:21,760
Yeah.

251
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,160
I get what you're saying.

252
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,440
It's just it's a mind-bender though because that's –

253
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:25,580
Yeah.

254
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,180
It is because you've never heard of it before, but this is what's being done all the time.

255
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:34,420
That's why you don't get – if you have a checking account, you don't get them back in the mail like you used to.

256
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:40,240
And they said it was the Paperwork Reduction Act of 2003 or 2002 after 9-11.

257
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:45,220
No, they're taking all of those and they're bundling them up into funds and they're called NPIs.

258
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,800
NPI stands for non-performing instrument and they still have a value.

259
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:55,160
So all those vouchers that people are sending in unendorsed from their gas bills, phone bills or whatever, they're unendorsed.

260
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,160
So they're NPIs, non-performing instruments.

261
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,560
They stack them up until they get 100 million of them.

262
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,600
Now, the number sounds impressive.

263
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,360
I got 100 million of NPIs.

264
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,000
How much can we put them on the market for?

265
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,260
I could put them on the market for 1.5 million.

266
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,060
Okay.

267
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,320
One and a half percent.

268
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:13,540
Okay.

269
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,160
Do you see where I'm going?

270
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:14,800
Do you see?

271
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,380
Yeah.

272
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:19,760
It's like the old days when they told you that coupons had like a two-cent value.

273
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:20,680
Oh, yeah.

274
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,020
Well, look.

275
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:25,520
I remember in the 80s I had some coupons and something – it was an old coupon.

276
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,440
Because some coupons can go six months, usually no more than three months.

277
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,320
And something had gone on sale.

278
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,900
It was a coupon for $5 off.

279
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,400
It went on sale for $4.79.

280
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,340
I gave them the coupon.

281
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,800
They gave me 29 cents, 31 cents change.

282
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,020
Because it's – right?

283
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,100
It's actually – right.

284
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:51,620
Also what I suggest if you're going to get more into this, what you put on the bill, if you're going to endorse it, use it as a check.

285
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,180
I had a few more phraseology.

286
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,820
I'll just throw some of it in right now.

287
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,120
One thing you should put on there is void war prohibited by law.

288
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,960
Write that on there too.

289
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,180
Right?

290
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,500
That makes sense, right?

291
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:09,140
So let's say some scumbag attorney wants to come after you for it and he says it's the law.

292
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:13,940
Well, it's void if you say it's against the law because it says it right there and without recourse.

293
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:15,819
And also Title 12.

294
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,839
You write 12 U.S.C. 411, demand for lawful money.

295
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,900
That takes you out of there too.

296
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,460
Now, remember, the attorneys do not know this.

297
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:25,180
You know how I say attorneys do not know it.

298
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:25,400
OK.

299
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:28,260
Segway.

300
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,160
Utility bills.

301
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:36,100
Everyone's utility bills have gone up anywhere between 30% and 80% if you're talking about insurance, fire insurance and all that other stuff, right?

302
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,120
Why?

303
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:44,520
Because all these companies have now put their billings – they've sold them to financial companies under what's called a CTO.

304
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,920
I've talked about this before.

305
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:53,660
A CTO is a rule from the SEC that CTO stands for a confidential treatment order.

306
00:17:54,120 --> 00:18:03,240
That means if you have, like, money coming in, you can make a secret deal with someone that they get all the money coming in and they kick you a certain percentage up front.

307
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,980
And that's what all the utility companies – not all, but most utility companies are doing with private investment firms.

308
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:15,120
And if you go to them, they will – no matter what you do, they will not disclose that they're doing it because it's under CTO protection.

309
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:23,340
So the only way to fix that is by getting about 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% of the people to boycott paying their bills and give a reason why.

310
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:28,420
So now the people that they sold the future billings to will say, hey, wait a second.

311
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,220
How come no one's paying their bill?

312
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,160
We don't want this anymore.

313
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:41,940
They kick it back to the utility companies and all the prices come down to how they were being even cheaper because right now with automation and efficiencies and new equipment, your utility bills should be coming down.

314
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:42,500
Right.

315
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,560
Because they're using – right?

316
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:53,020
They're using things automated where a power plant that needed a staff of 30 people now just needs one or two because it's automated.

317
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,020
And also they have more efficient equipment.

318
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,760
So the bills should be coming down, but they're going up because of this reason.

319
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:05,760
So the reason I mention this is there is absolutely no hope in any of this getting better because of the reasons I'm mentioning out here.

320
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:15,040
There was a bunch of well-dressed guys walking around the neighborhood the other day and I saw them pass by the bay window and the picture window in the living room.

321
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,860
I said, oh, I'll get that before you get knocked on the door.

322
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,120
And he wanted to just basically talk to me about billing.

323
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:25,900
Now, they're doing a survey like how people feel about billing and if your billing is too high, maybe we can do assistance.

324
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,120
I said, wait a second.

325
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:28,640
Wait a second.

326
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,760
I said, do you know about – I gave him the CTO thing.

327
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,900
I said lawyers don't know the law.

328
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,260
He pulls out this thing.

329
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:34,840
He's a lawyer.

330
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,140
He used to be a lawyer.

331
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:36,680
Not anymore.

332
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,960
A young guy who worked as a lawyer for ten years.

333
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:43,020
And I gave him the Greek-speak law and he was just like laughing in his office.

334
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:43,580
Exactly.

335
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,640
So this is the first time I've met someone who's an ex-lawyer that's not selling cars.

336
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,740
I just wanted to bring this up.

337
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,780
That's right because you said they're always the ones that are selling cars.

338
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,100
They're always selling cars, yeah.

339
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,980
And that doesn't mean used car salesmen.

340
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,440
New or used.

341
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:02,060
This is the first time I've ever met a lawyer, ex-lawyer that is now doing surveys, but it's still financial stuff.

342
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,440
He worked for judges.

343
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:09,280
I said judges, all judges are failed attorneys and he's laughing and he's like, oh my gosh, exactly right.

344
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:18,900
And all that he just confirmed – most lawyers, especially ones that I know that are no longer in the field, it's a sore spot.

345
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,220
If I bring it up with them around, they'll say, oh, that's an evil organization.

346
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,680
I don't want to talk about it.

347
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:28,300
This guy was fresh out and he – anyway.

348
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,740
I just wanted to bring that up.

349
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,240
It was fun.

350
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:30,800
OK.

351
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,120
I do the same with doctors, by the way.

352
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,420
They all flip out.

353
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:40,660
If a doctor or a lawyer wants to debate me, you're going to have to get all the lawyers and all the doctors, not just you,

354
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,700
and all their friends and they're still going to lose.

355
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,000
That's how bad it is.

356
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:44,380
Right.

357
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:49,560
As a matter of fact, I've had a professor that wanted to debate me once and my friend was there with his daughter who was in the eighth grade.

358
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,460
He said, I'm not going to debate you.

359
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,340
She's going to debate you.

360
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:55,160
I'm going to coach her for 10 minutes on the subject and she'll still win.

361
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,340
Oh my gosh, the guy was so infuriated.

362
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:57,860
It was true.

363
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,360
The guy was a no-wade and didn't know anything about anything.

364
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:07,180
So now everything we just mentioned now, let's go back to the negotiable instruments, how to turn a bill.

365
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,240
Now when I say a bill, it's the voucher.

366
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:09,700
Yeah.

367
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,080
When they send a bill, it's a thing.

368
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:11,960
It's a cutaway.

369
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,240
Sometimes it has a dotted line.

370
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,460
It even has a little picture of a scissor.

371
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,600
Detach this and send it in with your payment.

372
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,520
That is the payment.

373
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,420
Well, it's not the payment until you make it a payment.

374
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,060
OK, that's what we're talking about.

375
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:29,640
Now when this is received at the envelope openers that open this, whether it's machine or human, they don't know anything.

376
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,520
And their supervisor doesn't know anything.

377
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:44,600
And their supervisor, I assure you, if you have 1,000 or 2,000 people working in that company, maybe on a good day, one or two people might be available that know what's going on.

378
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,600
That's how bad it is.

379
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:53,960
Like if you go down to the court building, there's maybe one or two people out of all the hundreds of employees that know what's going on.

380
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,800
Then we've talked about this, especially since 9-11.

381
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:02,760
They've been really stomping on making people that deal with the public to not know anything about things work.

382
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:13,580
So if you're going to have success, you can't call up or go down, let's say, to places where you can pay in person and talk to that person about anything, anything.

383
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:18,160
They are no different than what someone ate for dinner last night.

384
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:26,720
In other words, if they're working in a government office or you chop them up and serve them for dinner, there's no – they're not much smarter than what someone ate for dinner last night.

385
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,080
That's the level of mentality they have, right?

386
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:29,540
OK.

387
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,560
So you cannot – it's like going and arguing with a hamburger.

388
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,900
They don't know anything.

389
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,300
There's nothing there.

390
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,020
There's absolutely nothing there.

391
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:37,400
OK.

392
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:46,780
Because look, do you think they're going to be working for $18 to $20 an hour or even $30 an hour to pay whatever they're doing if they knew this?

393
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:47,380
No.

394
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,260
No way, right?

395
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,360
That's your giveaway, right?

396
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:50,900
Yeah.

397
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:51,520
OK.

398
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:58,120
That's what Brandon Joe Williams, again, the serial mention, he keeps bringing this up too.

399
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,200
That's why he's on the right track.

400
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:02,700
But they're going to show him his hat and they're going to show him his ass soon enough.

401
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,320
Not soon enough.

402
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:09,580
They usually give you about a year or two because they want to see who's going to follow.

403
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,680
So he needs to get his following going.

404
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,360
So go ahead and support him however you can by subscribing.

405
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,700
All his stuff is for free, by the way.

406
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,100
He gives everything away for free.

407
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,740
So go ahead and whatever.

408
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,620
Use his stuff.

409
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:27,600
I absolutely – I don't endorse it because he's leaving out some pretty like soft white underbelly stuff, right?

410
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:35,080
But I think that if you do what he does and the stuff that I've said about signing things void, void were prohibited by law.

411
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,300
You've all heard that void were prohibited by law.

412
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,500
They even put it in ads, right?

413
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:39,760
Yeah.

414
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,220
You put that on an instrument also without recourse.

415
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,200
So they try to come back with you and they say, well, that doesn't matter that you wrote that.

416
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,160
Of course it does.

417
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:51,740
Remember, attorneys are there to make people's lives miserable.

418
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:52,800
That's all they're there for.

419
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,980
They don't know – they're like worms and fleas and parasites.

420
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,880
They do exist.

421
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,160
Cockroaches or – cockroaches are not that bad.

422
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:02,840
They clean up.

423
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,960
But there are things in mosquitoes.

424
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,260
There are things here to pester humanity.

425
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,520
An attorney, that's all they do.

426
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:09,840
That's all they do.

427
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:16,420
You should see – you can have fun if you have competence in the law and legal, which is not hard to do.

428
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:22,780
You could study for five minutes a day and be more competent than all the attorneys in the country because let's say you're a lawyer.

429
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:25,020
You study law for five minutes a day for a month.

430
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,920
You'll know a certain amount of law, which is more than all the attorneys in the country put together.

431
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,740
So let's say you have a country with three million attorneys.

432
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:32,980
What's three million times zero?

433
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,280
It's still zero.

434
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,420
So they don't know anything.

435
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,480
It doesn't matter how many attorneys there are or which one.

436
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,040
They don't know anything.

437
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,940
By the way, I tell even this attorney.

438
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,520
I said ten years ago I started saying I'll give any attorney $1,000 for each law that they could cite.

439
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,820
It's context and define all the terms in that particular law.

440
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,860
I'll give them $1,000 for each law they can cite.

441
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,840
I still have the $1,000.

442
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,680
I've told this to every attorney I've ever met.

443
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,220
They try to cite laws and they won't even take the challenge because they know.

444
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,020
So if anyone says they're studying law, I said, oh, in Costco, right?

445
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,260
So this is how bad it is.

446
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,240
Now are people going to clean it up?

447
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:12,600
No.

448
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:17,760
But am I going to go down in history hopefully as one who said it should be cleaned up and this is exactly how and why?

449
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,460
Yes.

450
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:21,000
That would be nice, right?

451
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:24,720
And I mean it in the foolish, stupid, and senseless way.

452
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:31,680
Now the medical people are just as bad because talking to someone, neurosurgeon, young guy, quick.

453
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:39,840
And the whole thing was they always have these older doctors in there to kind of guide the younger guys before they go into residency and further training.

454
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:46,080
And they constantly remind them you're becoming a doctor to ease the suffering and pain of people.

455
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,420
Not to heal them or fix or give them help, right?

456
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,080
You see what I mean?

457
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,820
Do you see the difference?

458
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:52,220
Yeah.

459
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,100
Yeah.

460
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:53,480
Okay.

461
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,440
So it's very, very important.

462
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,620
They're just as bad.

463
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:05,300
Now the other thing about the doctors, I've never had one argue with me when I bring up induction and there's no absorption and the heart is not a pump.

464
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,920
No arguments there at all.

465
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:11,080
They just sit there like a three – like a four-year-old listening.

466
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,280
So that's not so bad.

467
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,260
But it is bad.

468
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:22,820
You don't want to – and also, by the way, another thing that doctors do when they're trying to learn, they ask their patients various questions.

469
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:37,680
Let's say you're an osteopath or whatever and you do all these surgeries on the body and you ask – you do your own personal surveys on what the people's lifestyle is like.

470
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,940
And you think you're amassing a group, a body of information that you could use.

471
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:51,220
And I'm saying you can't because the species of human that goes to a doctor and relies on is completely different species than those that don't.

472
00:26:52,000 --> 00:27:05,840
So if a doctor keeps asking his patients broad general questions to develop a body of knowledge, that is not going to be a good body of knowledge because the first thing is these people that go to these guys for their health are not complete humans.

473
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,240
In other words, you're not going to get anything.

474
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:14,260
You need to go to those that do not go to doctors and survey them, right?

475
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,880
Do you see the point?

476
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,840
The same with attorneys.

477
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,040
Surveying people, why they go to – it's too late.

478
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:25,660
I mean those are not – the people that go and use attorneys or doctors are a completely different species.

479
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:29,440
Their opinions and how they live has nothing to do with reality.

480
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,240
They are a subdued, almost second or third class type human.

481
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:40,540
I do everything I can to absolutely avoid doctors and attorneys or lawyers in any way, shape or form.

482
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:40,760
Yeah.

483
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:47,360
The false – so the level of falsehood you're going to get – so you're already dealing with an inferior mindset is what I'm saying.

484
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:47,660
Right.

485
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,000
So forget – there used to be a commercial.

486
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,940
It's four out of – three out of five doctors surveyed recommend dentine.

487
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,700
I see it on TV or something like that.

488
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,220
Trident.

489
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,840
Trident maybe, yeah.

490
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:00,540
Yeah.

491
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,440
Oh my gosh.

492
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,640
So that kind of bullshit is still going on.

493
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:06,080
Yeah.

494
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:13,400
Anyway, there was something else I wanted to continue from last week that was kind of critical and if it was that critical, why did I not remember?

495
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,440
It had to do with what we brought up.

496
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:22,920
The bill of exchange thing, guys – by the way, it's on the same subject.

497
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:28,460
The bill of exchange thing, you really got to know, especially we have an international crowd.

498
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:37,740
Find out when the central banks started monetizing – collateralizing – the government started collateralizing the birth certificate.

499
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,340
When did the social security numbers start to be issued to people?

500
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:51,240
Because they issued them in the US in the early 20s and they didn't become collateralized officially by 1935.

501
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:57,880
By the way, you can go look at old tattoo shops from the 20s and 30s.

502
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,800
They have little signs on menus, what kind of tattoos they do, how much.

503
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,520
They do say in these old tattoo shops, we'll tattoo the social security number on your arm.

504
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:16,080
So when you hear about people having numbers tattooed on their arms, certain type of people, that was a fashion call.

505
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,400
Oh, I met someone who was in a concentration camp.

506
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,760
They even had the tattoo on their arm.

507
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:26,820
Well, people did that all over the place because they needed that number to get stuff, right?

508
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,160
Anyway, so you could look this up.

509
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:34,900
You could look up old tattoo shops and you'll see – try it if you could zoom in on the background.

510
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,260
It says we even tattoo social security numbers on your arm.

511
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,960
This is in New York, a New York tattoo shop.

512
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,140
We're not talking Germany, Hitler's Germany, right?

513
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,400
It's amazing what you learn when you look.

514
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,720
No, it's actually amazing what you learn even when you're not looking.

515
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,700
New York outlawed tattoos too.

516
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:51,420
That was another thing.

517
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,180
Even though there were tattoo shops that still existed, they were outlawed.

518
00:29:54,180 --> 00:30:00,360
Yeah, that's why if you had a tattoo up until the 1970s, you were considered a biker, an outlaw, or a sailor.

519
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,820
Yeah, so – yeah.

520
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,880
Anyway, I just wanted to bring that up.

521
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,520
The tattoo on the arm thing was vogue.

522
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:14,420
It wasn't a prison war camp that the Nazis did.

523
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,080
You know what they called them, the Nazis.

524
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,620
So –

525
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,560
It couldn't have been both though?

526
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,180
It couldn't have been both things true or –

527
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:22,900
Yeah, yeah.

528
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:32,380
But anyway, find out when the social number, whatever they call it, social welfare number, social benefits number became official.

529
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,540
And that's when they finally bankrupted the country you're in.

530
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,100
So – and then they have a set of laws.

531
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:46,420
But the Bill of Exchange Act of 1882, which was, I believe, done in England or – let me look it up.

532
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,000
It wasn't England.

533
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,880
It was another international – that applied to the whole world.

534
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,180
Bill of Exchange, Bill of Exchange –

535
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:59,300
At some point in England, they were calling that stuff gold checks or whatever, and then they started –

536
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,000
Certificates, yeah.

537
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,300
Yeah, and that was like your welfare check pretty much in England.

538
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,200
And then they started calling it council –

539
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:06,360
In the UK, yeah.

540
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,160
Council payments, right?

541
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:11,880
Because they were handled all by the local councils, they said.

542
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:17,660
So that was the idea, but that was like your public assistance, your public support was from that.

543
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,860
And they changed those terms a few times.

544
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,480
But in the 70s, there was weird terminology for that in the UK.

545
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,100
Well, the thing is – OK, there's two things happening.

546
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:35,940
Just like I mentioned, the French journalist in North Korea asked one of the professors in North Korea in 2019 if he got permission to leave the country where he would go.

547
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,960
He said, I'd go to East Germany and the Soviet Union.

548
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,520
East Germany, which doesn't exist anymore, yeah.

549
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,820
Yeah, I think it was like 1992, 1993, right?

550
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,080
Yeah, so it's gone by then.

551
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,700
And he doesn't know.

552
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:49,720
Well, for him, it would have been 29 years, and he still didn't know.

553
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,340
So this is exactly what's going on with people asking.

554
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,880
But there's something that's – OK, the cosmic censorship.

555
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,900
These guys are doing some serious voodoo.

556
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:12,040
Asking people to discuss money, their competency of it or their interest in it is like asking them about their wildest sexual proclivity or sexual fantasy in public.

557
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:12,900
They will not say.

558
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,920
They just don't want to talk about it.

559
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,960
And this is because of the voodoo, the magic that's been done on them, right?

560
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:23,000
Come to think of it, I think people are more likely to talk to you about their sexual proclivities than they are about money.

561
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,320
I think they're more likely to do that.

562
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,580
Yeah, because there's more magic being done on the money subject than on the sexual subject.

563
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,140
Yeah, I agree.

564
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,180
Yeah, OK.

565
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,420
So, yeah, go ahead.

566
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,420
It's really bad.

567
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:32,900
It is.

568
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,720
That's how you really want to know if someone is censored.

569
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,620
Ask them if they know how the money system works, like bills of exchange.

570
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:42,900
And if they don't, if they want to learn about it, they want to know about it.

571
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:50,080
If you get one of these really dull, like, no, I don't care about that or whatever, you see the cosmic censorship because it's very important.

572
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,840
You know, it's just we live in a society that relies on money, unfortunately.

573
00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:08,120
You know, so and it would be fine because if we had real money, you could work at the post office and have, you know, buy a house, pay a mortgage off or, you know, satisfy a mortgage in less than 10 years, have a family of five and support them.

574
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:08,380
Right?

575
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:08,760
Right.

576
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:09,900
If you're on.

577
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:14,540
That's why, you know, they warned every country not to let paper money come in.

578
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,880
And it's going to get worse and worse.

579
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:16,800
It's not going to get better.

580
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:25,220
What's happening is the understanding of anything, the human body, money, religion, all that is going down less and less.

581
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:37,000
The more TV there is, of course, and the more media there is and the the negative aspects of those things that I mentioned, you know, the human body, medical money and religion is going to get worse and worse.

582
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,200
Like what people don't know, for example, is segwaying through religion.

583
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,940
You know, like you have the access of evil.

584
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:43,520
What is it?

585
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,300
Iran and North Korea right now.

586
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,480
I think Syria is part of it.

587
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:49,800
Yeah.

588
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,040
And probably.

589
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:51,620
Yeah.

590
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,580
Iran, Syria, North Korea.

591
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,260
There's one more, though, right?

592
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,460
Washington, D.C.

593
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,400
Anyway.

594
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,800
Hey, look, you got to count the real access of evil.

595
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,020
Let's go with the Vatican City.

596
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:03,500
Let's go.

597
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,080
Yeah, it would be the real city of London.

598
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,679
Most of the underground.

599
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:08,200
Yeah.

600
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:09,100
That's on the surface.

601
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:09,440
Yeah.

602
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,219
All the things that people consider holy.

603
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,199
Even the Bible says that all the stuff you consider holy is like vomit.

604
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:15,960
You know.

605
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:31,659
So anyway, most people think that the vision that they've got, it's kind of like if you were in the Soviet Russia in the 1970s, anyone off the street to describe Americans, they would say, oh, they wear cowboy hats.

606
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:32,000
Right.

607
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:39,699
And if you asked any American in the 70s to describe someone who lived in the Soviet Russia, they'd say, oh, they drink vodka all the time.

608
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:40,120
Yeah.

609
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:40,540
Right.

610
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:47,620
So now if you ask anyone, describe people in the Middle East that they're radical Muslims, that they're Muslim, and actually they don't want to be Muslim.

611
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:51,360
That was put on them by a series of acts.

612
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,980
And you know the movie Lawrence of Arabia, you know, all that stuff, right?

613
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,420
Which was true.

614
00:34:56,420 --> 00:35:00,280
There was a Lawrence of – Lawrence Thompson, I think his name was.

615
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,960
And he was a guy that united all these tribes.

616
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:08,000
They needed to unite the people and then they took the worst people and put them up, you know, as puppet governments.

617
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,720
And I give them reasons why you always want to pick the worst people, right?

618
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,540
Like a puppet government, right?

619
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:20,800
Because they'll do whatever you tell them to the people and they'll make sure they maintain power because if they lose the power, people will tear them to pieces.

620
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:33,720
So they always have in these Muslim countries the worst camel thieves, the worst, most atrocious families were put in power by the British, the Americans, whoever was responsible for whatever zone.

621
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,540
That's why they all have – all the countries in the Middle East have a red, yellow and green flag, right?

622
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,680
They're actually going to give them numbers and all that.

623
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,240
And they did have numbers of which one came in.

624
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:51,040
But what they did was they wanted to really put on this caliphate kind of concept that everyone has to be Muslim.

625
00:35:51,300 --> 00:36:02,500
Now, if you live in Iran or know people from Iran, and even recently this has been going on more and more, they're burning – the Iranian people are burning the mosques themselves because they don't want that.

626
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:13,080
Each country doesn't want Islam, the flavor of Islam especially that's being put on them by the Vatican, City of London, Washington, D.C., CIA.

627
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,900
They don't want that at all.

628
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:20,900
All those mullahs and all these guys that you see wherever, they're not – they're the worst of the worst.

629
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,220
And the West thinks that the people want them there.

630
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:24,840
They don't.

631
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:34,120
So what you're going to see is the burning and destruction of Muslim-type mosques and symbols by the people in the Middle East.

632
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:34,920
They don't want that.

633
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,180
That was put on them by the foreign powers.

634
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,240
So this is something – I'm saying this to dispel a myth.

635
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:48,900
Just like I mentioned what Americans thought of Soviets and vice versa in the 70s.

636
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,280
This is still going on in America.

637
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,320
They think that the Iranians are radically Muslim.

638
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:53,700
They're not.

639
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,280
They hate it.

640
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,680
They absolutely hate it.

641
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,620
Their national religion is Zoroastrianism.

642
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,860
So it's not Islam at all.

643
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:11,880
And now out of fear, most people, just like Americans, they'll say anything to sound patriotic or de jour, like what's the flavor of the day.

644
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,480
They won't speak out against it.

645
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,420
But they hate it, right?

646
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:20,880
So just like if you speak to people in Israel, they hate that orthodox Judaism.

647
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,620
And everyone has a reason why they hate it.

648
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:27,800
It's like there's no bus lines running on Saturdays, right?

649
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:28,900
They hate that.

650
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,560
So that doesn't make any sense, right?

651
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:40,440
So you could have a bus line running on a Saturday even during the Sabbath as long as it doesn't leave town and no one's driving it.

652
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:46,840
And that sounds crazy, but, yeah, there's a reason for automated machines, self-driving buses.

653
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,520
Why not a self-driving bus, right?

654
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,640
I mean nobody's doing the work.

655
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,720
You're just riding on a vehicle.

656
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,720
You're not doing anything.

657
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,720
And you're not leaving town.

658
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,120
So, yeah, buses usually don't leave town.

659
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,760
Ninety percent of all bus riders don't – they're not riding the dog.

660
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,120
They're not going across country.

661
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,920
It's very local, right?

662
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,920
Just to save walking for half an hour.

663
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,020
You take a five- or ten-minute bus ride.

664
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:08,800
Exactly.

665
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,060
It's to avoid walking an hour to get from one side of the town to the other.

666
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,480
You just take a bus for five minutes.

667
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,440
But everyone has their own reason for whatever.

668
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,080
They don't like Judaism, what's put on them.

669
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:24,620
And the Catholics have the jokes about being raised Catholic and all this stuff.

670
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:32,240
So there's going to be a big turnaround against this stuff, which is going to help out with the collapse of this horrible society.

671
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,860
And one thing I commented on –

672
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:41,380
Is that why we have the big push to make America the Christian nation now, like so that we have –

673
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:41,600
Oh, yeah.

674
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,780
Jason talked about that.

675
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:47,320
I talked about it, but not in the detail that he has years ago.

676
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:51,500
You're going to see a very radical right adopting religion, religiosity.

677
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,380
Jason of Archaics calls it the Christian Reich.

678
00:38:55,340 --> 00:39:06,220
And when you have people killing other people in the name of God, meaning that they say they have God on their side, they'll do the most heinous shit in the world, right?

679
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:11,820
I tried to make that point recently, like in an open discussion with a bunch of people.

680
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,760
Boy, did I get attacked from every side.

681
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,820
Yeah, because it has nothing to do with the rationale.

682
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,080
No, it doesn't.

683
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,060
We're taking advantage of the times.

684
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:33,180
My point is that if you create a system where you point to people and you say they are literally on the side of everything that is evil, the absolute adversary, and you've decided to target those people, you can expect that somebody might take you seriously.

685
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:33,760
Sure.

686
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,720
And here's the other thing.

687
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:44,040
Anyone who knows any scripture at all will know that the true God of the heaven and the one that's in power has no showing here whatsoever right now.

688
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:49,940
It's the God of this world that does all the religions and the churches and the moralities and all this other stuff, right?

689
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:50,560
The adversary.

690
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,220
But anyway, Archaics talks about that.

691
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,020
He's been leaning on it very heavily.

692
00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:02,640
I haven't listened to him in a while because his narrative – I've given the value of his narrative.

693
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,760
And everybody's narrative sort of peters out after a while.

694
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:10,640
If you say the same – research the same stuff or say the same stuff over and over, I got it.

695
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,940
But one thing you'll find with Greek-speak, it's extremely wide.

696
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:22,100
We can talk about many subjects and we can go very deep and give you sense – add sense to it.

697
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,820
Sense means that you can use it.

698
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,120
That's where you get senses from, let's say.

699
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,180
So these things are going to be coming around.

700
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,680
I would avoid all of it.

701
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:41,140
The problem with understanding what I'm saying here, as in the Greek-speak, what we do, is you have no one to talk to about it, right?

702
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:41,800
Very rare.

703
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:44,700
I'm talking about even where you live or where you work, anywhere.

704
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
This is tough, yeah.

705
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:50,420
Because you won't be here if you're cosmically censored, right?

706
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:59,200
So if you want to know more about cosmic censorship, ask yourself why you're listening to Greek-speak and how much you've integrated it and whatever.

707
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:05,460
Recently, I was speaking to someone and he wanted me to recommend some people regarding a certain topic.

708
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:10,100
And he also asked me to recommend someone who knows Greek-speak because it's very hard.

709
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:21,300
If you want to take someone who knows Greek-speak and start working with someone who knows nothing about these things we've gone over over the years, it's very hard because they're living in a complete fantasy, right?

710
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,420
About everything, any topic.

711
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:29,840
Imagine working with someone and they say, I've got to go to the doctor right now and get some blood pressure medication.

712
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,640
Oh my gosh, where do you start?

713
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,360
Where do you start?

714
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,020
Do I have diabetes?

715
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,660
Where do you start?

716
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:47,200
There's a guy online, I'm not going to mention his name, Jerry Marzinski, who is like this alternative psychology guy.

717
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,560
I've spoken to him and he says, oh, I can't eat that.

718
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,800
I have type 2 diabetes.

719
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,040
I'm like, oh my gosh.

720
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,300
Oh my gosh.

721
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,220
I'm not even going to start with this old dummy.

722
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,980
There's no way I'm going to start.

723
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:57,640
No way.

724
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,500
But it doesn't discount stuff that he talks about.

725
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:05,660
But imagine being around someone like that on a working – you can't.

726
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:20,080
It's very difficult because if you bought it – once you buy into this stuff, right, and you start suffering the consequences because if you're – give an example of the diabetes.

727
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:24,420
Most people are perfectly fine and they get a thing that says you have diabetes.

728
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,960
I feel good.

729
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:31,180
Actually, maybe you should start treatment soon before it gets worse.

730
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:31,960
Well, guess what?

731
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,020
When you start treatment, you get worse.

732
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,120
You get worse and worse.

733
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,260
It's a scam, right?

734
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,620
So where do you – so it depends.

735
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:42,220
If you ask someone how long you've been getting treatment for diabetes, yes.

736
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:42,600
How long?

737
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,100
Five years.

738
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,800
That's really – that's already done enough damage.

739
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,300
Your kidneys are going to fail, right, and then you're going to get all the bad circulation.

740
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,840
That's the standard protocol.

741
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,360
They're the drugs that destroy it.

742
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,500
I'll tell you a terrible truth.

743
00:42:54,660 --> 00:43:02,880
My second wife, I met her and she was telling me that she had thought for years that she was a diabetic but she wasn't doing anything with it.

744
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:03,320
Not at all.

745
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:03,740
Oh, my gosh.

746
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:07,780
And I said, OK, well – and I didn't know all this stuff back then at all.

747
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:08,380
Not at all.

748
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:11,380
But I knew that most of what she was talking about made no sense.

749
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:13,580
She weighed 95 pounds soaking wet.

750
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:17,580
Yeah, they don't have – by the way, they do have demographics.

751
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,420
They like to go to certain neighborhoods.

752
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:26,420
But it doesn't mean if you go to a very wealthy neighborhood, you have to – people are not on – they are.

753
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:32,300
I know the Golden Ghetto up here where the houses are four or five million and above and all of them are on diabetes medication.

754
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:37,640
But then you go down to the ghetto or whatever, they're all on diabetes medication if they can get it.

755
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:41,200
So there's no – there's a certain demographic but is there?

756
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:46,500
But she was 48 years old and within 18 months of starting to get this treatment, she was gone.

757
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:47,680
Yeah, exactly.

758
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:48,380
That's the idea.

759
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,300
That's what they're supposed to do.

760
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,560
That was the horror of it.

761
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,180
Yeah, it sucks.

762
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:52,980
Ignorance.

763
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,120
My people will be destroyed through that lack of knowledge.

764
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:56,800
Yeah.

765
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:57,580
Yeah.

766
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:58,540
So, yeah.
