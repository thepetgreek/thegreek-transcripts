1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,880
The sonic entity known as Ocelli and the Greek.

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:12,660
Sonic event 13, Ocelli and the Greek rated Y. You know, I'm not even sure why I announce that

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:18,080
every single time. I guess I'm forming a pattern. I'm going to have to snap that one.

4
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,720
Anyway, enough out of my head. Greek, how are you doing today?

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,640
Hey, okay. Yeah, we were talking about trouble brewing in the Middle East and

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,640
important part first. I don't think much is going to happen because we're well into spring,

7
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,560
but let's bring up the topic. Let's just get right into it.

8
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:43,740
Yeah, let's do that because obviously, I'm somebody who monitors the news and all that.

9
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:50,960
And here's what's going on. Essentially, there was a rocket fire on the place that we call Israel

10
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:58,880
at this moment. I don't know about the exact point on the map. I think that that may or may

11
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,239
not be debatable depending. Maybe you can explain that a little bit, but I've always had a bit of

12
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,420
confusion about it. But either way, allegedly, and I say allegedly, because all I have are

13
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:13,680
reports to go on, I haven't seen it with my own eyes. Someone in Lebanon who was connected to

14
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,280
one of the two major groups that are supposed to be Palestinian freedom fighters of sorts

15
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,160
had launched some rockets into Israel. Israel responded after an Iron Dome and all that.

16
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:35,320
And then counterstrikes on Gaza, on the West Bank, I think. And well, now it appears as though maybe

17
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:40,760
things are calming down. But of course, all of this is occurring during this convergence of,

18
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,540
oh boy, here we go. I know I'm opening up a can of worms with the Greek.

19
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:51,840
A bunch of high holidays, right? You have Easter, you have Passover, you have Ramadan,

20
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:58,580
which is a month-long thing, going on all at the same time, all converging. And of course,

21
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:05,160
this is amid troubles and people learning of a bit of unrest on the Temple Mount or

22
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:11,180
the Al-Aqsa, what is it, the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the Temple Mount, the Golden, whatever it is,

23
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:18,480
this one place, which is sacred to three different derivations of a similar religion.

24
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:24,420
Yeah, there were people being beaten that were praying and all this kind of stuff because there

25
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:29,420
was stuff going on. This allegedly set the whole thing off. And by the way, there was something

26
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:34,740
that went on not too long ago called the 11-Day War. And people are saying that perhaps this is

27
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:40,620
something that's starting. Well, it is the right time of year to start a war. But what do you think

28
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:47,420
is happening, Rick? Not much unless it's, I predict, well, this year or next year, Israel's

29
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:53,020
going to go down. And I mean it, like down, down, like no aid, no help, and they're not going to

30
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:59,080
prevail. I wouldn't even say this year or next year, but that's the next major move that's going

31
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:06,780
to be happening there. Anyway, but in terms of what's happening, yeah, the spring is to start a

32
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:14,400
war, but for what? See, the wars start for gain in the springtime, and for loss or to break things

33
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,320
down, they start in the fall, or the purpose of starting the war is in the fall. You know, spring

34
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:26,660
is building up, fall is breaking down, the harvest, right? So if a war—well, here's my question

35
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:33,640
immediately, is if a war were to take place that was going to be fairly sudden destruction or a

36
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:39,100
serious heavy loss for Israel, a breaking down of it, that would have to begin in the fall then?

37
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,900
To break down, right, right, right. Okay, no, I'm just making sure I'm tracking with what you're

38
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:50,980
saying. Which is odd. Usually the wars start in the springtime to build up, to take advantage or

39
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:58,400
gain ground or have a successful campaign. Let me just preface, there are no national enemies,

40
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:06,240
right? Okay, give me an example. The Mossad that works in Japan works with the Persian

41
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:11,340
underworld. They work very well together. In other words, Israel's best friend behind the

42
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:17,860
scenes is Iran, who is supposed to be their biggest threat. All of the leaders that call

43
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:23,840
the shots behind the scenes are all buddy-buddy, all of them. So the U.S., Russia, North Korea,

44
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,140
China, Iran, everybody's buddy-buddy, buddy-buddy, buddy-buddy. But publicly what they do is very

45
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:34,420
different. It's not like gang wars—well, first of all, it's nothing like we're told,

46
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,340
and it's not like we also hear about when there are gang wars or factions that fight.

47
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,660
Is it a show? Yeah, it's kind of a show. It's blood sport. People, you know, when you say that

48
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:50,140
they're all friends and thousands of people die on either side, yeah, it's a blood show. It's just a

49
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:57,760
game, right, in essence. So the missiles going from Lebanon or from Gaza, from the Palestinians

50
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:05,980
or from wherever else, it's all very well known and accepted. But the people don't know it.

51
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:15,520
Now, here's the other thing. Well, when Israel goes down, it's not going to be like a fair fight

52
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,340
the Israeli-powered or the dominance. And they have a dominance because of their alliance with

53
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:28,200
the U.S. mainly, okay? And that's very well known, right? All of the leaders that call the shots

54
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:34,160
behind the scenes are all buddy-buddy, all of them. So the U.S., Russia, North Korea, China,

55
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,660
Iran, everybody's buddy-buddy, buddy-buddy, buddy-buddy. But publicly what they do is

56
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:44,160
very different. It's not like gang wars—well, first of all, it's nothing like we're told,

57
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,100
and it's not like we also hear about when there are gang wars or factions that fight.

58
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,720
Is it a show? Yeah, it's kind of a show. It's blood sport. When you say that they're all

59
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:01,000
friends and thousands of people die on either side that are supposed to be rivals, yeah,

60
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:08,360
it's a blood show. It's just a game, right, in essence. So the missiles going from Lebanon or

61
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:16,340
from Gaza, from the Palestinians or from wherever else, it's all very well known and accepted.

62
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,600
But the people don't know it. Now, here's the other thing.

63
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:28,620
Well, when Israel goes down, it's not going to be like a fair fight and they took out the

64
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,980
Israeli-powered or the dominance. And they have a dominance because of their alliance with the U.S.

65
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:39,260
Okay. And that's very well known, right? I mean, you've heard about the congressman having dual

66
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:47,620
citizenships with Israel and this and that, right? So when Israel goes down, it's not going to be

67
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:53,440
because of a fair fight or let's say whoever attacks them prevailed. No, it's because the

68
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:59,180
people, the leadership in Israel abandoned it. And one of the things I've discussed,

69
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:05,980
I think recently, one of the Sonics recently, two or three Sonics ago, is your tell on this

70
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:14,780
is going to be when things get hot and popping on the surface and the IDF, the Israeli military has

71
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:21,580
to defend, they're going to be given orders to like stand down or move into an area where they

72
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:26,400
shouldn't be, bad strategy. So they're going to be getting like really bad orders or stand down

73
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:32,100
orders from their own superiors. And one of the results, most of the people in the military there

74
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,640
in the Israeli military don't know what I'm saying. So they're going to say, what the hell

75
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,500
is he telling us to do? We need to go here. We need to go right. Our commander is telling us

76
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:46,380
to go left. So you'll have these little mutinies and confusion. You'll also see the, what they

77
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:54,740
call the Knesset or the main body of the Israeli leadership abroad or missing, like probably

78
00:07:54,740 --> 00:08:00,540
underground. And then when I say underground, it doesn't mean that you go into a spider hole

79
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:05,060
or something and stay there. When you go down to a certain point, you have access to anywhere

80
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:13,360
on earth. So underground railroad kind of thing and other things. Like I'll give you an example,

81
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:20,060
any city that has a population of a million or more, especially with a military base near the city,

82
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:30,020
the capital of the city or the city's main building, or if it's a state capital or whatever,

83
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:37,280
or the city's main buildings, court buildings, police buildings, and military are all interconnected

84
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:44,280
underground. And I know this not firsthand from working on it, but secondhand from an HV, a company

85
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:51,620
that does air conditioners, HVAC contractor. And part of their stuff was to, when you build these

86
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:56,320
underground tunnels that access buildings to each other, they need air, right?

87
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,160
Well, you need air circulation for sure.

88
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:04,000
Yeah. So he was doing all that and he can't talk about the details, but he says they do exist.

89
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:12,980
And usually the city centers where the city, county or whatever is, they're usually called

90
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:18,420
the dome, usually call them that building. And they always do have a dome, right? If you

91
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:24,220
listen to Jordan Maxwell or even look at architecture, a minor city, their municipal

92
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:30,180
center or main building will have a dome on it, right? The White House or the capital building

93
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:30,960
has a dome, right?

94
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,680
Oh, yeah. A lot of state houses have them, a bunch of things. Yeah, a dome.

95
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,680
And that's part of the nicknames. They call it the dome and there's tunnels from the dome

96
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:47,320
and to the dome. So if you've ever heard that. So this is not just a segue back or not.

97
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:54,880
This is sort of a segue. But just to give more of how I'm viewing it is this is going to be

98
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:01,500
very obvious. In other words, the takedown of Israel, if you know what I'm saying,

99
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,920
and if you're watching very closely.

100
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,260
Well, because here's a question quickly, because you're talking about, you know,

101
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:10,760
the leadership going underground. Okay, fine. But what do we do? Well, what if the public

102
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,220
doesn't observe it because of something that you brought up in an earlier sonic

103
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,140
due to the fact that there are clones, right?

104
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:23,140
Or doubles. Yeah. But right now, it's just if you haven't heard that, you'll be scared is

105
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:27,180
Greek. What's he talking about clones? Yes, they are. There's cloning is a very

106
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:31,860
just to throw something in here, because it's also been in the chat recently. Again,

107
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:38,920
cloning technology has always been around. I think I mentioned a few years ago, I was reading

108
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:45,260
an article on the DNA of a mummy in Egypt, right? And the outcome was that this DNA is a clone DNA.

109
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:50,520
And I told people that they said, Oh, they're cloning a mummy. I'm like, No, no, no, what

110
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:57,500
they're saying is they discovered an ancient buried corpse. That was a clone ancient times.

111
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:02,860
Exactly. Yeah. I mean, it's so hard for people to mix up what you're easy for people to mix up what

112
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:07,340
you're saying. But it's weird, because if it's a mummy, look, if something is mummified, I mean,

113
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:13,220
again, I'm trying to listen to 2500 2500 year old. Yeah. And 20 cloning is something ahead of us.

114
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:17,680
Well, yes, but you could mummify something now, right? You could mummify something from a couple

115
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,160
of years ago, you could end up with a mummy. But the thing is, if you're talking about something

116
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:30,520
that has been mummified and been there for 2000 years, last dynasty, yeah. This means that if it

117
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:35,440
is a clone, and it's not a fake, okay, because that that's another thing. Let's say somebody

118
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:41,160
went in there took the original and then cloned it and then put a fake mummy there. Okay. But

119
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:46,200
otherwise, yeah, yeah. Well, the whole thing is was was, you know, if there's algorithms and

120
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,460
search the internet, the article was written, and it was not a conspiracy theory. It was mainstream

121
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:57,580
that well, not Fox News. But it was like a science magazine kind of article. I remember that too,

122
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:02,600
and going, okay, but I didn't know what to make of it. Where it was like, well, it was Yeah,

123
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,580
yeah, it was pretty. Yeah, it did. The hints are out there. It's very also the same technology

124
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:12,540
they use for skin grafting, they take skin tissue, and they grow your own skin tissue.

125
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:18,900
And you go to the lab, and they scrape off the excess and they bond it to the body. And it grows

126
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:25,960
back. And there was a short newscast about some newscast in Minnesota visiting, you could just

127
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:31,800
look it up on YouTube, visiting a lab that did that. And it's basically the tissue is in these

128
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:37,460
glass jars that basically slightly agitating, slightly moving back and forth in like a saline

129
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:42,640
solution with some other nutrients and the tissue grows. It's a very simple process. It's not

130
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,000
technical at all. It's just that you have to have certain subtleties accounted for, right?

131
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,860
Well, right. And you start off with some. Now look, I had a stepfather who had a motorcycle

132
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:58,220
accident. I might have mentioned this to you like years ago, where they took skin off of like, say,

133
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:02,180
parts of them that weren't burned, because he suffered severe burns throughout his body, right?

134
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:08,060
So they grafted skin on from places that weren't burned. And it looked like literally, you know,

135
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,800
those cheese knives he used where he kind of glided along and it creates a very thin slice of

136
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,600
Okay, so it looked to me as though the scarring on the healthy parts of his skin

137
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,020
were removed with a cheese knife. Okay. I mean, I know it sounds ridiculous. But yeah,

138
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:26,480
that's what it looked like. And they took those pieces grew them bigger, brought them back and

139
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,320
grafted them on to the damaged parts of his body, right? To replace the destroyed or the dead skin.

140
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:36,940
And they went through a process of removing the dead. This all sounds very real to you,

141
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:42,200
because you've heard of this kind of thing. I'm sure it's, it's kind of barbaric. If anyone is

142
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:49,160
interested in this technology or skill level, research didn't show God, the chromotherapy,

143
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:57,840
okay, in the 20s, he would show up with his lamps, very 1000 watt light bulb with colored lenses,

144
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:06,520
the yellow, very bright yellow builds the tissue, the very bright blue is a whole chart.

145
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:12,560
restores the tissue. And they would give him burn victims that all they could do for them was

146
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,980
morphine, because they were going to be dead in less than a week. And after two weeks of his therapy

147
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:23,480
or three weeks, they had no scars on their body whatsoever. I have personal I have firsthand

148
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:30,880
experience with the blue light therapy with burns. And if anyone lives in a place where they get

149
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:37,720
sunburn easily, or sunburns, you know, sometimes like here's a situation where the Can you watch

150
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,160
the children for an afternoon? Yeah, sure. And you know, the sun is burning hot, and they're

151
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:47,560
out there for three hours, and they come inside. And then an hour later, they're all complaining,

152
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:53,060
because their skin feels like it's on fire, you know, very red sunburn. So you put them in a room,

153
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,260
give them some sunglasses or goggles to protect their eyes with an extremely bright blue light

154
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:04,320
for an hour. And then an hour after they leave the room, the sunburn is completely gone.

155
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,400
I wish I had known about that. Because I had sun poisoning and lost a bunch of skin at one point

156
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,020
and all kinds of stuff. Yeah, being in the sun. Well, that's why that's why we're doing this

157
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:18,440
didn't show God reality. Now, if you're using blue like LEDs, or blue light you get from the

158
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:24,780
hardware store doesn't work because it needs to be very high intensity. So these are things like,

159
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,880
you know, people have a medicine cabinet, you know, they invest in bandages, band aids, whatever.

160
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:34,680
This is something that requires somewhat of an investment right now, because of the way the

161
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:41,080
industry is going, it's very hard to find incandescent light bulbs. So silver sodium works

162
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:48,480
okay, it gives off radiation. But you're gonna need a very powerful, incandescent type bulb that has

163
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:57,940
a filament, right? Yeah, and very pure color lenses. You could do it with blue LEDs, but you're

164
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:07,300
it's too much UV. I had I've had success with using the LEDs with several blue colored light

165
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:12,980
bulbs that whatever you could get your hands on and you will have some success. Didn't show God

166
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:19,460
reality chromotherapy. Yeah, that's for rebuilding tissue and all that I have first hand experience

167
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:25,320
and so do you if you need it, try it. But some people that have done low intensity stuff, it

168
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:30,380
doesn't really work that much, you know, that well. But we went from that to cloning to burning

169
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:35,880
to tissue development back to the stuff going on in the Middle East. Well, yeah, well, let's go back

170
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:40,980
to that. Because what I just I thought that was a good aside. But yeah, it's gonna have to tie

171
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:46,380
together with things that I've talked about a long time ago. I have gotten, by the way,

172
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:53,300
some pretty good response from people that have reached out on the uncommon radio, uncommon

173
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:59,900
sense radio one at gmail.com, the email about Greek, I can't believe it, you know, I was listening

174
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:04,740
back in 2016, with Ocelli in the Greek or other stuff, and everything you said is coming true,

175
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:11,800
meaning the West, what you're going to see after 2018, between 2018 and 2021 and a half

176
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,660
is a very concerted, purposeful effort to bring the Western society down, like all your values,

177
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:25,800
your morals, your entertainment, your judicial, scientific, I went specifically through a list,

178
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:31,340
what's going to come down, right? So if you look between 2018 and 2021 and a half for the judicial

179
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:35,960
come down, the entertainment industries come down, right? Education has come down,

180
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:42,660
economics downturn, society is downturned, morality is downturned, right? It's right.

181
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,640
So even the promotion of the ancient goddess religion, which you mentioned briefly back then

182
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:53,560
has come to fruition, I mean, entirely, as far as I'm concerned. Well, the thing, the highlight of the

183
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:59,560
ancient goddess religion is started in the 50s. It really came on the scene really, really big.

184
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:05,700
If you know what you're looking for, you'll find it. It came on the scene really big, and it started

185
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:11,520
manifesting in the 60s with the women's lip. And then at the same time, scientifically, it was

186
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:18,400
manifesting with fertility, drugs and fertility techniques and medicine, right? And then the

187
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,400
civil rights movement on and on and on that led to where we are today. But one thing that I've

188
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:30,880
mentioned is that in the foreground, keep in mind that you anything you see going on in the Middle

189
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,520
East, whether it's a war or not, or whatever, and the West coming down is to lead to focus on the

190
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,520
Middle East as a world power, right? And that's how we actually got to cloning. Because I asked you,

191
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,340
you said, Look, you'll see the leaders go underground. And I said, Well, but would we

192
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:50,720
directly because wouldn't they put doubles out? And yes, the real people will go somewhere

193
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,420
underground. And maybe that's not observable from a distance, right? Because you are I,

194
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,520
it's okay to shoot, it's okay to kill the clone. But think about it from a psychological point of

195
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:06,640
view, you can't have a dignitary laying dead on the street with enough witnesses, right? And then

196
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,460
him showing up three hours later, right, like Hillary Clinton does a speech in Norway. And

197
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:15,800
four hours later, she's doing a speech in Australia. Yeah, but in a time in a time where

198
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:22,580
you have things like like going a bit crazy, why not? See, this is the thing. Why not disrupt that

199
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:27,220
and have something like that happen where literally, let's just say, theoretically,

200
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:33,820
the the current Prime Minister of Israel is reportedly killed, they have some evidence of

201
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:39,860
it, you have to do that. And then he shows up again, anyway, I'm willing to bet that the majority

202
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:44,480
of the public wouldn't even flinch at it at this point, because of their their weird cognitive

203
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:52,900
disconnect. So I'll pick up on it. So it'll be that Yahoo effect, right? But that's what I'm

204
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,480
saying. Like, all of a sudden, if that happened, okay, you and I would say, Look, we just saw this

205
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,620
guy dead, because we might observe it from a distance. Or maybe you wouldn't, because you

206
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:04,400
don't watch this stuff. But I do. And a lot of other people do. And some of us would say, Hey,

207
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:09,080
there's a problem here. There's a discontinuity in what's happening, because a dead man just gave a

208
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:15,140
speech. And I think the majority of people in the world, the overwhelming majority, in fact,

209
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:19,380
would not flinch at that and would just Oh, well, that must have been wrong the first time,

210
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,080
even though we saw it happen on live TV. But it's all

211
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,760
But look, if you're going to spend time anytime at all discontinuities, you'll never have time

212
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,540
to do anything else. Well, that's the thing, because everything is discontinued. Here,

213
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:34,840
give you an example. Someone gave me a video, which I didn't watch. It was an analyst,

214
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:38,840
an economist, and he was quite serious. He says, Well, if money is fake, why is debt real?

215
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:46,560
I didn't watch the video, but that's a fair question. Because, well, legally, every well,

216
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:53,040
here's the thing in every court, the amount is never disputed. It's whether you owe it or not,

217
00:20:53,040 --> 00:21:00,440
and then after the trial, which is summed up that you owe it, then a separate completely

218
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:05,760
separate action is a judge order to pay that much. Well, right, which has nothing. It's whether

219
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:11,160
you have a contract or not. That's why, well, every lawsuit, every headline lawsuit, like here's

220
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:15,260
the easily observable way, right? You put it your way. But I would say if you're looking at any

221
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:20,120
lawsuit where there's some kind of damage, first, they figure out if there's a damage. And if this

222
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:25,380
individual who was brought before the court, or if this group or the corporation doesn't matter,

223
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:32,420
if this defendant is liable for this, that's the first determination. The next thing is,

224
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:38,100
well, let's figure out what we're going to actually give to the person who has won here, right? I mean,

225
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,460
that's the simplest way to look at it, isn't it? Yeah, the amounts, well, they cannot discuss

226
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:46,380
amounts while it's in an active court case, because there is no money, no way to pay it.

227
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:52,300
It's always done afterwards. Unless you're like a TV, you're watching something on TV, but-

228
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:56,840
Well, the other thing is satisfaction too, because it's not just necessarily money. Sometimes it's,

229
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:02,860
well, I want an apology. I want a statement. I'll settle for this. I'll settle for,

230
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:08,240
you'll also agree in the future to never do this again. Stuff like that also comes into consideration,

231
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,840
but it's always after you determine who's actually responsible, liable, whatever.

232
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:19,540
So that's the way that works, right? Sort of, because there's a lot of metric,

233
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:25,540
there's a lot of language you have to cut through real quick. A court is where two adversaries meet

234
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:32,820
to come to a decision that's going to finalize their adversarial actions, so they don't have

235
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:37,000
to duke it out or kill each other, right? It's a place where they could go where there's non-violent

236
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:44,820
and they basically negotiate or find culpability, so the issue could be settled, right? That's all

237
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:49,900
a court is, so that's why you have two adversaries show up with rackets and a yellow ball. It's

238
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:56,360
called a tennis court, right? Golf course is a course, but you have courts in sports, adversaries

239
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:00,660
and for a winning position. Orange ball is a basketball court, but yeah.

240
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,480
It's kind of like when I hear people say, I went to the doctor.

241
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,220
You went to a doctor. I didn't know there was the doctor, like the doctor. Have you ever heard of

242
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:15,580
the doctor? Who is the doctor that everyone's going to? That is odd because you are going to

243
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:24,240
a doctor. Yeah, I called the police. Oh, really? Okay. These are metrics in language. You listen

244
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,540
to people. You know how they say listen more and talk less, but most people don't know what that

245
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:35,320
means. What it does is it allows you to assess what's going on and the quality of the,

246
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:43,140
should we say dialogue? Here's the thing. There's something people don't like,

247
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,000
the normies, they think this is passive aggressive, but if you go into a situation

248
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:56,000
and you don't take, let's say a group of people, whether it's work or play or whatever, even a

249
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,620
sonic, let's say, but this is just you and I, who is a group. If you don't take control,

250
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:08,520
guess what? It's out of control because you see, even the, very often someone who's supposed to

251
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,860
be leading the group doesn't know what the hell they're talking about, right? Right.

252
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:17,660
So whoever is listening, if someone's listening, that could rub two gray cells together. He's

253
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:21,160
going to walk away. What's the takeaway? I listened to this for an hour. I didn't get

254
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:26,340
anything out of it. So I tell people, whenever you get into a situation, take, in business,

255
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:30,160
this works very well. It doesn't mean you're obvious about it, but just make sure that

256
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:37,500
think of it on a skill level. You could never do it starting out, but it takes practice.

257
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:45,580
Think of it on a skill level. You're on a powered boat, right? It has a keel and all that. It has a

258
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:53,120
steer it and a rudder. Like you're walking up to the bridge of an airplane or a boat and you're

259
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,920
holding onto the rudder and the power, basically. That's what I mean by taking control. It doesn't

260
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:02,100
mean you're going to rock the boat, right? Well, right. I always look at it as steering

261
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:10,380
a conversation, which is what I often do in order to direct it so that it is a bit more coherent,

262
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:15,920
gets to the point, etc., and also to assure that we don't leave things out.

263
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:21,780
But on occasion, I also like to shake that dynamic a little so that it doesn't become

264
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:32,840
a boring sort of pattern. Well, give an example. If you start to measure the metrics that you hear

265
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:39,120
around you, they're shown to you also. Look at the billboards where it's on the side of a bus or

266
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,920
billboard on the street and it doesn't make any sense at all. For example,

267
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,660
years ago, there was a credit union that opened up here in Tucson. It says,

268
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:57,220
we lend money. Right away, I drove by. I got home. I called the controller of currency

269
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,260
and I said, you have a bank, a national association doing business as a bank

270
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,860
that has a billboard on this street. I got the billboard number. You know,

271
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,200
they all have numbers on them, right? Right. They're all numbered. Yeah.

272
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:16,620
Yeah. And they said that they're lending money and I think there's a problem with accuracy here.

273
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:23,600
It was a message, actually. They bumped me up to someone and said he's away from his desk.

274
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,860
If you're a bar member or an attorney, you have to give a certain amount of hours to the public

275
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,060
every year. Are you aware of that? Yeah.

276
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,440
I think they still have it going. Yeah.

277
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,160
Okay. Free time or whatever. Okay. Well, so they bumped me up to someone like that at the

278
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:44,340
controller of currency in Arizona. So, I left a very well thought out message. I thought of it

279
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:49,580
immediately as I called. I was trying to be very accurate. Within two days, that billboard was

280
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:55,260
down. They usually stay up for a week or two or three or a month, right? In two days, it was

281
00:26:55,260 --> 00:27:02,140
painted white or covered with white paper. Right. Right. Sorry, Buster. Buster just chimed in. I

282
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:10,340
apologize. Oh, that's fine. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah. Another example of taking control of a

283
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:15,560
situation instead of just looking at it. And I'm not saying being... I was basically not snitching

284
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:23,440
on the bank. I was basically trying to do a public service because the last thing you want

285
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:30,980
the public to be misled that banks lend money. Right. An inaccurate statement is being shared

286
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:37,840
with the public. So, you were in the public's interest. Yeah. Right. There's personal interests

287
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:43,460
as well. When I was out in LA, I was doing a water project and I needed some parts. So,

288
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:48,400
we went to a hardware store. And it was around 10 a.m. on a weekday. And there was a line

289
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,780
from the cashier area going out to the front door and bending around the front door

290
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:59,820
to where the point of sales to the paint department. I'm like, wow, 30 people online to

291
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:04,680
check out. And then I went to the counter and there was five or 10 people on that counter,

292
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:10,920
another counter, five or 10 people waiting. And I'm like, oh, man, I really need to get what I

293
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:16,440
need to get here. But it's insane. Right. So, I peered all the way into the back in the stock room

294
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:24,020
and there's a clerk with a vest on, the corporate vest. He was loading some things.

295
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:29,060
I said, hey, you, you, you, yeah, you back there. Come here. I need this, this and that.

296
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:34,580
And he says, OK. And he got everything ready. I said, yo, don't leave me. Take me to the register.

297
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,360
Take me to the register. And he took me to the register, rang me up.

298
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:45,040
And I was out of there. And it was a neighborhood, Ukrainian neighborhood. I got some stuffed

299
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:51,400
cabbage, beef and rice stuffed cabbage. And as we had lunch and as I was leaving, one of the ladies

300
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:59,720
that had a dog and a small dog in her bag was just leaving. She was like midway online. And I

301
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:03,260
pointed out to the person I was with, remember the lady with the dog in her bag? She's leaving

302
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:08,480
the hardware store now. We went in, left, got what we needed, had lunch, drove by the hardware store

303
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,780
again, and she's just leaving the hardware store right now. How's that for time? You see?

304
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,800
Yeah, that's pretty wild.

305
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,640
Taking control.

306
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,560
Yeah. Wow.

307
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:23,300
So, but you can't, you have to do it like you own the place, though. Right? So, when I was calling,

308
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:27,000
just to go back, when I was calling out to the clerk all the way in the back, stalking,

309
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:32,060
it was as if I owned the place. Not like, oh, excuse me. No, please. No. It was, hey, you,

310
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:38,260
need you here right now. And just like, you know, you said you worked in retail and stuff when you

311
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:46,300
have an authoritative position. It's a battlefield, right? So, if you're a call, let's say, an

312
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:51,000
employee, you don't ask them, please come here. You tell them to come here. I need you, right?

313
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:57,000
So, you have to understand, you know, what energy you put out also. I just wanted to put that out

314
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,720
because it's very important. And this, by the way, can also be done in a courtroom when you're

315
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:06,780
dealing with these idiots, you know, the legal society. But you have to do it in a way that

316
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:11,760
they find acceptable because they will accept a lot if you know their language and their tactics.

317
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,380
One of the things, by the way, in a courtroom is any time the prosecutor opens his mouth,

318
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:24,260
you object. And literally. Any time, well, the, any time, well, not the prosecutor,

319
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:29,860
any, your opponent, or when they finish a sentence, just before they finish a sentence,

320
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:34,980
say objection. It doesn't matter if you're going to say objection 300 times.

321
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:40,440
Just so it goes on the record and there's someone there that, because what they use against you

322
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:49,000
is that real trashy stuff. Well, you know, you didn't object, right? Or you agreed to it. So,

323
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:54,600
you object to everything they say. Good morning, I object. Why is it, how can it be a good morning

324
00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:01,420
if I'm in here with your ugly ass, right? So, anyway, these are things that are so simple.

325
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:07,020
So, I don't know about takeaways, but hey, speaking of takeaways, people have been investing

326
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:13,460
the chat, in the chat, in the ONG chat. By the way, wait, wait, wait. Before we go away from

327
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:19,740
what's going on in the Middle East, it's, can I say it's a nothing burger? Really,

328
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:27,020
completely nothing on this, you think? It's more than typical. It's more than the typical

329
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:32,340
stuff that you see, right? It looks like it's more than typical, but yeah, go ahead.

330
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:36,820
If I'm incorrect in the assessment, it'll go into what we just talked about a few months ago.

331
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:44,000
You know, a full out, right? Against Israel. Right. Here's one way to see when this is going

332
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,140
to happen with Israel, by the way. Where are all the dignitaries? You know, Israel,

333
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:52,540
you know, countries that have prime ministers, they still have a president. Every country that

334
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:57,720
has a credit-based economy has a president, right? In America, a lot of countries just,

335
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,660
that are very federalist, just happen to make the president, the chief executive officer,

336
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:06,060
the one to look at. But Israel is supposedly run by a prime minister, but they also have a

337
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:11,600
president, right? There's a president in the parliament, right? There's a president in

338
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,040
whatever, there's a president in North Korea, there's a president, right? Because you, if you

339
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:22,500
have a credit-based economy, it's all based on drafts and bills. You need an executive signer,

340
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:27,580
right? So the president of Israel, which is not talked about, there's a president of Russia,

341
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:32,820
right? Anyway, they all have presidents and look at, look where he, what he's doing. So if he's

342
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:38,740
in Belgium, right? And Netanyahu's in France, or I doubt it'd be in France, but you see,

343
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,960
and if this guy is here, the head judge is there, they're all out of the country,

344
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:52,160
right? And they just appointed some like a 32-year-old weak-chin guy as the head of the

345
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:56,400
military, right? You know, like someone deliberately has no experience, it looks like,

346
00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:00,160
right? Like they're telling you, look, we're putting someone here that has no experience,

347
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:04,720
guess what? It's next, right? They do that very often, right? Like when they put Biden here,

348
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,780
you know, they're trying to tell you, like, you guys are really dumb. We're making it so obvious,

349
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:12,840
and you still don't get it, right? But anyway, if you put somebody who has no idea what they're

350
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:19,560
doing in charge, then you're obviously setting things up for failure. Well, it's so obvious

351
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:26,500
that they have no, that they're not, yeah, it's just kind of like when Caligula brought a donkey

352
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:30,560
into the Senate, and he made him a senator kind of thing, because the Senate wasn't quite getting

353
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:38,440
it. But either way, look at what the itinerary for the dignitaries in Israel are. If you start

354
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:44,660
to see them all being reported all over, and you have a very weak military leadership,

355
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:49,260
and this is happening, what you brought up, you know, the stuff going on right now.

356
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:57,240
Yeah, here we go. This is it. So this is the beginnings, this is like the groundwork,

357
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:01,940
if you will, for what's coming next, but it's not significant in and of itself, maybe.

358
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:07,400
I think it's going to be in an odd time, because when they did the seven day war,

359
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:13,940
six day war, that was in Yom Kippur, that was in seventh month, right? The Yom Kippur war,

360
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:17,739
which by the way, you know, was very heavy Russian, that was,

361
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:24,679
how do you say it? Let's just say that war was based, a lot of those planes, you know,

362
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:29,699
the MiGs and all that, they were not Egyptian pilots, they were Russian pilots, aces,

363
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:34,360
because one of the things was to take out the Dimona nuclear power plant,

364
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:42,260
right? And they didn't want to show the Russians doing it, right? Because they didn't want overt,

365
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:47,719
but at the time, Israel already had a few dozen nukes, they were pushing them around in taxicabs

366
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:54,860
and train cars and trucks and had them on, you know, right? Now, I said this several times

367
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:59,600
regarding, you know, what what nuclear status they had at the time. See, some people have tried

368
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:04,540
to say part of the Cold War, in other words, six day war was part of the Cold War. Right? I mean,

369
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,680
and they did have nukes, they weren't going to use them then, but they did have them.

370
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:13,920
There, there, there's been some odd accusations about what Egypt was thinking about doing.

371
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:20,020
But but or what they were thinking about doing with Egypt at that time. And only very recently,

372
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:25,800
have people talked about that. But it's very incongruous with the normal story about the

373
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,560
six day war. But that's why I found it odd that they're referencing this thing they called the

374
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:37,120
11 day war not long ago. Which war with Lebanon, right? Yeah, again, right. Yeah. Again, with

375
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:40,620
Lebanon. See, but that's why I thought it was significant. Because, you know, they're saying,

376
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:45,620
look, it's not the Lebanese government or the Lebanese military that's doing this. But it's

377
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:52,220
either. What is it Hamas? And then the other? Oh, wow, I can't remember the name of the other one.

378
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:57,300
But the two major, you know what I'm talking about? Hezbollah, Hezbollah. Thank you. So it's,

379
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:01,360
you know, it's either one of them that is doing this, but they were being very specific about

380
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:08,340
which one. And, and all that. So they struck back on the territory. And of course, the government

381
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:13,220
of Lebanon came out and said, we were not we didn't do this. We didn't do this. People did

382
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:18,460
this from our territory, but we didn't do it. And they're all they're all the power group that you

383
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:23,060
mentioned may or may not be in it, the Hezbollah and Hamas, right. But those that are above them,

384
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,360
are absolute friends with Israeli, right? Everybody's a buddy, buddy, everyone.

385
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:31,520
There are some countries that don't want to be a part of it, but they're still

386
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:37,820
not adversarial. How many times have I said this in the past 20 years, there are no national

387
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:44,980
adversaries at period, everyone is one big behind the scenes, all of the nations, when I say nations,

388
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:53,980
are one big happy group. And one of your main site, the two main signs are 911. No one came out,

389
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:58,760
no country came out. And you could say the moon landings to to a certain degree.

390
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:05,000
No one came out and said the Americans are fake, you know, did this is what really happened. And

391
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,300
the other one was the the panic, the pandemic thing. Everyone was in all the nations were

392
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:16,240
in lockstep, not a one protested. Right? So right, except China didn't want to be blamed. But other

393
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:23,040
than that, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, there was some of the, the one, the ones that didn't want to do

394
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:29,660
like this is so obviously not, not a pandemic that we don't want to put a stain on our reputation by

395
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:37,940
going along with it, really. But they're all Yeah, I think I've talked enough about viruses

396
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:43,460
and disease since the 1980s. And I haven't changed what I'm saying. It's just added to it a little

397
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:48,740
bit more. Actually, I'm taking away from it, because in the 80s, I was very vocal about it.

398
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:53,880
But unless you see as long as you have running water and a steady food supply, you're not going

399
00:37:53,880 --> 00:38:00,420
to have a pandemic period. Unless it's unless it's a unless it's a real pandemic, like the

400
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:07,020
Spanish flu, or the what's the American Army flu. And no one experienced anything like that. So

401
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:12,300
well, that leads to a logical discussion about what is always brought up, you know, especially by

402
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:19,000
people like myself who object to the concept of vaccinations as they are being sold to people

403
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,960
right now, right? Is they always, you know, the typical argument is, well, it's the vaccines that

404
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:30,440
put an end to various diseases. And I'm like, No, no, what put an end they read? Yeah, there was

405
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:35,620
the you know, when the biggest anti vax push was, believe it or not, in history, you could look this

406
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:42,880
up 1880s. Okay, they killed a lot of people with the vaccine, right? It's, it's, it's a particular

407
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:50,020
group that took power that's doing this. It was official, well, official within the medical

408
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:57,680
community paperwork by the late 1950s, that their immunization is not a rat, it can't be done.

409
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:02,200
There's no such thing as immunization other than natural immunity. But in other words, you cannot

410
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:09,820
give anyone anything, injection pill, inoculation, anything that will improve their immunity other

411
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:16,220
than hygiene and diet, right? This was in the established in the conventional paperwork.

412
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:20,820
By the I think it was 1958. There was a convention on that. And he said, Oh, there's no more

413
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:26,120
vaccines. That's it. Well, in the 1880s, I think what they were doing was doing these limited

414
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:32,840
exposures, where they were exposing people to some part of the disease, but not a full blown

415
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:38,560
exposure to get sick so that their immunity could deal with it. That's what I thought the concept

416
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:45,240
was. Well, it doesn't work that way. Because in order to get the disease, you have to be induced,

417
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:51,100
you have body has to create it. And if you do have something that enters the body, it there's

418
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:55,860
it's not an immune system. It's an elimination system. Can your body eliminate it, there actually

419
00:39:55,860 --> 00:40:01,700
is no immunity. immune system was something I'm not harping on you for using that term. But it

420
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:07,640
is a metric, by the way. In other words, there is no immune system in the body. Because if you look

421
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:14,420
at all of the immune functions that they state under the immune genre, those are not immunity

422
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:20,060
functions, not a one. All those functions are eliminated functions. Well, right, because an

423
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:24,680
antibody literally goes in to get rid of something that's in there. So there you go. And

424
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:30,800
then get it through the ductwork and organs to get it out of the body by induction again. Well,

425
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:35,660
but the thing was, they were crudely introducing this into the body. And I do say introducing,

426
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:40,600
because what they were doing is literally cutting people at certain points, right? And scabs of

427
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:46,680
corpses and things under it. Yeah. And then putting some infected tissue in Yeah, an open wound. That

428
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:52,300
was good. It was the end of the Victoria era where they were telling people it was called corpse

429
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:56,780
medicine, where they would take corpses and dehydrate them. And little pieces of the

430
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:04,040
corpses we would either be coated in chocolate, or sugar and given to people for as a health

431
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:08,800
promoter. Yeah, that was you could look this up. I think I brought it up with the old ong before.

432
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:12,720
Yeah, I don't. Yeah. And you could find it. Well, when you put in corpse medicine,

433
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:19,700
they direct you now towards autopsies. Yeah, they show you about how it was illegal to,

434
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:25,420
to obtain corpses, but somehow, the medical studies would get ahold of them. And sometimes

435
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:30,120
people were literally stealing dead bodies. And they go into all that with you if you ask for

436
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:36,540
corpse medicine, right? Yeah. But if you look at Victorian era, corpses as medicine, you get savvy,

437
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:43,740
you'll find it and it's pretty nasty. Now that's this is very well known. Okay. This is 150 years

438
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:48,860
ago or so this practice was have very heavily promoted by who what kind of a sick mind?

439
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:54,960
You know, I've looked at societies from hundreds of years back to 1000s of years back. And I

440
00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:00,500
on the surface with any convention, I've never seen anything that sick and disturbing, right?

441
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:05,100
Well, right. But, you know, some people found it completely sacrilegious to study a dead body at

442
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:11,200
all. That was, I mean, I learned that with through the, you know, medical autopsy textbooks, right?

443
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:16,980
Where they presented this history, and I don't know if it was a true history or not. But the

444
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:22,500
way it was presented was, it was all about, you know, look, medical schools were kind of allowed,

445
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:28,920
but not really legally supposed to be getting ahold of these bodies, unless they were donated

446
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:33,660
by the person while they were still alive, pretty much, you know, what sort of themselves? Yeah.

447
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,900
Well, now it's about synthesizing, right? You don't need the body, you make it synthetics,

448
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:45,360
and they would be just as bad. Right? That's what people are saying these MNR, MNRA shots and all

449
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:49,740
that. I said, that's just a revival. I've never really gotten into it. Unless there's a call for

450
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:56,260
it. But since World War One, it was all about making synthetics, right? synthetic ink, synthetic

451
00:42:56,260 --> 00:43:01,760
oil, right? All these things, instead of getting them from nature directly, what the MNRA injections

452
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:06,280
are, and the graphene and all that stuff, people aren't putting it together, because they

453
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:11,120
are still drinking the Kool-Aid. Those are they're synthesizing corpse medicine,

454
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:16,340
basically, right? That's why people are getting sick and dying. But here's the thing, there,

455
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:22,540
there is no immune system, there is no inoculation or vaccine. So it cracks me up is you have the

456
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:28,520
alternative idiots. By the way, if you know anyone who has a family member who's a doctor,

457
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,420
mom, usually not mom, dad, they won't say but brother, sister.

458
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:39,020
They'll usually say about, I'll talk about doctors. Yeah, my sister is a doctor, someone

459
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:44,160
will say this happened recently. Right? She's smart. And she goes, No, she's an idiot. Right?

460
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:49,960
I ran into someone recently, again, and he says, Yeah, my brother is a doctor. Is he smart? No,

461
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,820
he's he's a dummy ass. I'm like, so. So if you have any relatives that are in the medical field,

462
00:43:55,820 --> 00:44:04,020
and I, they're dumb asses, guys. And you know that. So anyway, it's it's one of these things,

463
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:09,040
because they really, really have to beat you up. You don't have to be a dumb ass to be in the

464
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:15,520
medical field. Absolutely. Because it is rigorous. And it's not bad to go through it if you can do it

465
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:21,180
quickly. But to stay within convention with it. Yeah, you're a dumb ass. Because obviously,

466
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:26,240
what you're doing is fictional, you know, like an attorney, if I know people who are getting

467
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:30,680
attorneys, is he smart? No, he's a dumb ass. Well, but just like I said, with the news,

468
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,400
and you said with the news, where we talked about, you know, there's this TV show with the news,

469
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:40,660
they don't fabricate things completely out of thin air. They use things and twist it around. So

470
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:46,900
there's real information that is in there. Even with the medical practice, right? There is some

471
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:55,620
information. In other words, you know what it really is? It's the, the equipment for the practice.

472
00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:03,140
Here's the thing, when society starts to downturn, which is not yet, it's won't be for till the end

473
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:09,600
of this decade. You're going to need someone to take on, if let's say your neighborhood,

474
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,660
where you live right now, let's say it's suburban, not rural, where you don't have any neighbors.

475
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:19,840
If you were enclosed, or it wasn't safe to go a mile away, you would have to get to know the

476
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:24,900
people that live immediately around you and get to know what they're good at doing. Hopefully,

477
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:30,740
they're not good at bullshitting, because that's not going to go very far. What I mean is, oh,

478
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,660
he's good with cars. So he's going to fix he's mechanical, right? He's good with cooking. So

479
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:41,320
he's going to make our meals or advise us on food. And this guy's good with fixing the body, right?

480
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:45,960
So if you need some minor, someone needs a medical emergency, what they call it, right?

481
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:52,820
Right. You go to him. Now, here's the thing. You can go into a neighborhood, and you could just

482
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:58,240
survey around. There's usually someone that takes the position of a mayor, right? The go-to guy on

483
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:04,160
the block or whatever. And he'll tell you, this guy's really good with cars. Or this guy's good

484
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:09,540
with construction, right? Or this guy is good with plants and garden, but ask him who's good

485
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:16,120
with fixing the human body. We don't know. I'm not talking about going to the hospital or the

486
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:22,960
doctor, right? Right. Is there anyone that you know in your neighborhood that would, if you had

487
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:27,500
something you couldn't handle in an emergency, let's say in a car accident or something that

488
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:32,640
could hit, do you see where I'm going with this? Or how about someone that's, he's good with cars,

489
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,900
he's good with plants, he's good. You got anyone who could pull a tooth who knows how to do it

490
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:42,300
safely so you don't get jaundice or something? Hepatitis, right? Do you see where I'm going with

491
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:46,880
this? Yes. Very few. Where do they say, oh, no, you got to go to the dentist. Like there's one,

492
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:52,440
you know, the dentist. You mean a dentist, not the dentist, right? A doc. Do you see what's going

493
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:58,340
on here? There's a tremendous need for that. So when you, just to tie this back to what you were

494
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:04,140
saying earlier, what they have are the toys and the tools that you need, usually, right?

495
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:10,860
Not the practices. I can give many examples. A quick one would be the emergency room. They

496
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:17,180
have people waiting in an emergency room, which is deliberate, I believe. I believe that on the

497
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:23,360
upper end they do know how the body works. For example, when someone is of health, good health,

498
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:27,860
good circulation and vitality, if a tooth is knocked out, if you put it back into the socket

499
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:32,800
immediately, it usually, it can take. Have you heard of that happening? Absolutely. It'll take

500
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:37,060
hold again. Yes. It'll take hold again. Okay. But if you go to the emergency room with it,

501
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:40,460
they'll have you sitting there for three, four hours and it won't take because the

502
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:47,080
periodontal ligament will retract. The gum will retract. The gingival line will

503
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:54,780
recede. You'll have a mucus plug build. Right. The hole begins to take care of itself. Yeah.

504
00:47:54,820 --> 00:48:00,720
So that it basically tries to seal itself back up. It changes form. It will not accept it.

505
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,720
Right. Yeah. It will not accept the socket. We'll start changing form. The periodontal ligament,

506
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:10,600
the tooth sits on, it's like a shock absorber. Okay. So when you, someone is in an emergency

507
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:18,100
situation, okay. Just like a wound, a laceration. If you make that tight or tighten it up and line

508
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:23,960
up the, line it up how it should be like doing wallpaper, right? The seams and it's clean.

509
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:30,480
You don't always have to wash a wound, but if it's clean, you make it really tight and you go

510
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,960
through a procedure of very tight for 15 minutes, a few minutes to let circulate and keep that going

511
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:42,000
for a few hours and then very firm for the next few days, you guess what? It'll be completely

512
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,960
healed in a few days where normally it would take weeks with sutures. Sutures are not needed. Those

513
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:56,440
are a very recent thing. Well, look, on occasion, they can be helpful, but majority of situations

514
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:00,320
where people, Oh, you need stitches. You need stitches. I have taken care of that kind of

515
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:05,100
stuff myself and just said, look, you know, basically what I was taught about it was to

516
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:11,780
call it a butterfly stitch, which is all you're doing really is aligning the wound. Like you said,

517
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:16,200
make sure it's clean. You know, make sure that you don't have like hair going inside of it.

518
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:21,600
This kind of thing, depending on where it is on the body, you put it back together and it will

519
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:28,480
repair itself if you allow it to. Well, the way, well, actually you don't, what you need to do,

520
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:36,400
this is the, this is the trick. I did this on the back of Frankie's head once. Frankie's my

521
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,000
young child. It has to be tight, but it has to be tight. It has to have pressure. It does have

522
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,700
to have a lot of pressure. Well, a lot, a lot of pressure. And the reason the right amount of

523
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:50,700
pressure, the right amount of pressure, because too much is too much, but it has to be. It's not,

524
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:54,580
it's not just kind of, you know, loosely, you can't loosely put it back together. It won't set.

525
00:49:55,540 --> 00:50:00,260
No, it depends on where it is. If it's on a flat surface, like the face or the head,

526
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:05,280
you, when you do bandage it, you want to implement, you have something in a block,

527
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:12,360
like a blocking, literally a blocking, a box of cigarettes filled with sand. So they're firm

528
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:18,680
and heavy. And you tie that really, really tight. So tight that it's, you can only take 15 minutes

529
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:24,060
of it. And then at 15 minutes, you loosen the bandage and then make it really, really tight.

530
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:29,540
What you want to do is put a negative pressure because what happens is when there's an injury,

531
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:34,700
when the interstitial spaces, which are the very tight spaces between the cells, decide to fill

532
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:41,140
the lymphatic fluid, it will block all of the, what people call the stem cell technology that

533
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:46,060
rebuilds, you know, the body, right? Your body develops that naturally, new cells to close it up

534
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:51,040
if there's any swelling. So if you have a negative swelling, meaning if you go the other way,

535
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:56,680
where it's completely, completely even tighter than it would be normal, the area is under

536
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:04,740
compression, extreme compression. The healing process, especially the induction, the recreation,

537
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,000
because the cells are not really coming from somewhere else, right?

538
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:09,340
Well, I've done this.

539
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:12,820
There's no place in the body that says add new cells here.

540
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:18,900
Yeah, to give somebody a really basic relatable illustration, I used a sealed deck of playing

541
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:21,660
cards and an ace of spades to accomplish this.

542
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:23,000
Okay, there you go.

543
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:30,800
But this technique, you need to mention that. What I mean is when you're explaining this,

544
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:36,720
it's good to mention it, everything that's needed, like line up all your ducks in a row. Because if

545
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:40,980
you tell most people, for example, not just you, but anyone, you just need to put it together and

546
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:45,260
wrap it, they don't get the idea that there's an exception here, that this is something extra

547
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:52,820
that has to be considered. I don't know if anyone rides a bike and there's a patch kit,

548
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:57,300
you can patch your inner tube, right? You put some glue on it and you put the patch.

549
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:01,620
One of the most important parts is it has a little piece of sandpaper. If you don't roughen up that

550
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:05,900
rubber before you put the glue, the patch will just peel off. You need something for it to key

551
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:13,540
and bite. In other words, I give it as an example because there's a misnomer, which I see in

552
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:19,700
emergency medicine, is they have people sit there and wait, and when they do treat them,

553
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:24,980
they have no regard for the compression aspect at all. You'll have someone with an open wound

554
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:28,660
and they'll have them sit with it and then they'll irrigate it. They'll wash it out and

555
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:34,600
stitch it up and just go away. By the way, every time they suture it, it's a new wound.

556
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:37,300
Every stitch they put through there is a new wound.

557
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:38,900
Well, of course, you're puncturing the skin.

558
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:42,620
You're puncturing the skin. Of course, it's a new wound. You're putting the needle through.

559
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:51,800
Right, so suturing is never acceptable. I can't see a situation where it is because you have

560
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:59,860
situations now where you can bond to the skin and literally, just like you have eyelets on a

561
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:09,000
shoe for shoelaces, you can bond eyelets around the wound and use something to pull it closed

562
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:15,900
together that way. There was a movie called Young Frankenstein, and they had a zipper in his neck.

563
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:17,340
I don't know if you remember that film.

564
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:19,180
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, no.

565
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:25,900
There was a zipper, okay? I always use that as a reference because there's so many techniques.

566
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:31,460
Here's the thing. Every field is completely wide open. Even nuclear energy is completely wide

567
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:35,300
open. It doesn't work. There's no such thing. But there's a way to use the string, actually.

568
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:38,640
It's very interesting. You just put it... I don't know. Maybe that went by really quickly,

569
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:44,080
but the eyelets idea... Yeah, basically, if you create an adhesive on either side of the wound...

570
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:44,380
Crazy glue.

571
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,960
Still... Well, that's the easiest thing.

572
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:55,160
Cryoacrylic glue, yeah. These things can be...

573
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:58,940
In a pinch, you can use crazy glue, though. You can actually use that if you need to in a pinch.

574
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:04,840
Yeah, there are people in the medical profession I do speak with, long conversations with,

575
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:12,020
and I keep bringing up what they can do that's new, and very often they shy away from it because

576
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:14,080
they would be dealt with harshly, right?

577
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:18,020
Well, the idiocy that they use there, by the way, I just want to point out something because

578
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:22,580
I saw this only a couple of years ago, is they take that glue concept, which somebody explained

579
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:26,820
to them at some point, and they misuse it because they'll turn around and try to glue the wound

580
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:29,260
together, you know? And I go, whoa, whoa, whoa.

581
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:32,440
Right, but they don't... No, you can do that, but the thing is...

582
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:37,180
You can, but that's not the wisest way to do it. What you just pointed out...

583
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:40,980
No, because the glue will act as a bond breaker and it will not heal.

584
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:42,960
Right, so that's the problem.

585
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:47,940
So, if you literally just imagine an open wound and you put just glue on either side,

586
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:52,460
you glue it together, that's great, but it's not going to heal because it doesn't allow the bonding.

587
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:53,800
Yeah, sorry, go ahead.

588
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:57,920
The point without turning into... No, it's fine, don't be sorry. The takeaway with this

589
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:04,700
is that there is no cohesive, single narrative that people are aware of that

590
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:11,520
when the body is breached or injured, even internally, that vacuum is lost,

591
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:17,260
there's swelling, and that's what prevents rapid healing, and how rapid the healing could be,

592
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:24,580
24 hours, 72 hours. Any injury, for example, that I've ever treated myself or anyone else,

593
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:31,260
if it's not 90% or 95% completely healed in three days, it doesn't matter what it is.

594
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,080
We didn't do something right.

595
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:39,060
Okay, we're talking about severe stuff that would be more than emergency medicine.

596
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:45,100
And here's my bragging thing. One day, from coaching women in cycling, when you coach in

597
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:52,000
cycling, you get that fateful call. That fateful call is, you know, who can you call, right?

598
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:58,860
You get a call, and this is so-and-so hospital. So-and-so is here in ICU,

599
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:06,880
right? You know, intensive care unit. That's a fateful call. You're like, oh my gosh, right?

600
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:16,720
Well, I have had gone into ICU, and the next day, that person was home. Within 24, let's say 36

601
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:23,340
hours. When you go to ICU, you're in there for a day or two, or maybe less, or sometimes more,

602
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:28,480
and they move you to a hospital bed for no less than three, four days, always. They're not going

603
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:33,600
to let you go. In this case, I went over there, I did my little thing that I've talked about,

604
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:38,360
which we will probably do something more about how to treat. It's all about compression.

605
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:43,240
And the head of the hospital, which I could give the giveaway, he was pretty famous when...

606
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:50,400
Anyway, he looked at me, and he says, I need you here. I need you here in the hospital. I said,

607
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:53,640
no, no, no, no. This is like, you know, I didn't tell him it's the devil's playground.

608
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:59,560
But he had to, when I was demanding this person leave the hospital, because they were so much

609
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:03,240
better, they didn't need to be there, they all freaked out. I said, I need to speak to the head

610
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:06,980
of the hospital. And he came and checked it all out. And he says, yeah, this person can go home.

611
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:12,600
And it all had to do with what I'm talking about is restore the body's vacuum

612
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:18,760
and prevent swelling. And the way that's done is you could be creative with it.

613
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:22,920
So how do you, when you have something that has a vacuum and it loses vacuum,

614
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:27,300
how do you restore the vacuum? It doesn't have to be just squeezing, but typically is.

615
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:33,940
So here's the thing. When they don't know what they're, no, they don't know what they're doing.

616
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:40,540
They don't. And those that do leave the profession. Here's the point. The point is,

617
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:47,840
the field is completely wide open. And it's not like there's some imaginary research that needs

618
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:53,020
to be done to develop a new way. They just need to acknowledge how the body really works. It's

619
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:57,980
internal biological vacuum and nothing goes through any tissue. It's all by induction.

620
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:04,880
Right. When you use that as a premise, then use your do your research. And it is so simple.

621
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:10,940
It's like making mashed potatoes or boiling eggs. It's so what's the complicated or making toast?

622
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:15,180
Actually, toast can be complicated for some people, by the way, because the toaster has

623
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:21,720
to be working very well. It's so simple. Right. And what you do, it's I have a dentist acquaintance

624
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:26,940
when I want to get dental work done, I'll call him up and he'll say, Oh, yeah, okay. I'm playing

625
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:30,740
basketball on Thursday night. And I'll meet you at the office at 830. How's that? I'm like, great.

626
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:36,200
I'll see you then. Right. And he has dental when he has extra dental equipment and stuff. He'll

627
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:44,340
put a bag of sizes. Can you use these? Right. So because so in other words, if the society went

628
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:50,700
down, the Greek is your dentist, right? You get it. I get it. And other stuff. Yeah. Other things.

629
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:55,340
So the thing is, there's a big shortage in this. But the amount of research that needs to be done

630
00:58:55,340 --> 00:59:00,940
is no and minimal. What I'm trying to say, I brought up the dentist is this. When I bring this

631
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:07,260
up to him, I don't really understand what you're saying. It doesn't sound wrong. I can't say it's

632
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:12,320
right because I don't have experience. Listen, do you ever notice that sometimes, you know,

633
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:15,700
when you go to a dentist, not just for teeth, you know, the gum needs to be cut open to remove

634
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:20,880
something. Right. If someone has a tumor in their mouth, usually go to a dentist. They could go to

635
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:26,040
a dentist to have removed. Right. And I said, do you notice how wet tissue in the mouth heals

636
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:31,780
extremely fast? Yeah, it does. You know, if you if you've known anyone who's had a bad cut on

637
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:36,480
their tongue or the inside of their mouth in two or three days, it's it's pretty much healed up

638
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:41,540
90 percent. Right. Usually we're not talking about anything that's, quote unquote, infection.

639
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:47,000
Yeah. So that principle is demonstrated where you have wet tissue in the mouth.

640
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:53,000
You know what? You see what's going on, right? Yes. Yes. Anyway. Yeah. This is the field is

641
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:58,540
wide open. And I've I've been I've gone ad nauseum. I've spoken for very, very long periods

642
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:02,700
at length with people in the medical field and people not on the medical field. And still,

643
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:08,560
it's not enough to inspire a group of people to get together and say, hey,

644
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:13,820
you know, let's get this together and get this information out. You know, there is plenty.

645
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:20,940
If you want the best medical, let's say, from an academic or a literary point of view,

646
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:31,240
try to get a nurse's handbook pre 1899. Well, try is the operative word. There might be something

647
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:36,340
online. I think I had success finding one years ago. Either I didn't save it or I can't find it

648
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:44,320
anymore. You have a handbook pre 1899. Sorry, go ahead. Oh, no, I was just saying you had one at

649
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:51,180
one point, but I haven't seen it. There was a link for it, I think, on archive.org, where they

650
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:57,260
had it saved. Yeah. Yeah. No. And I don't I don't see it on the shelf here. But I have access to

651
01:00:57,260 --> 01:01:03,800
it. But the thing is, I don't like to volunteer things that I have, because if I get requests,

652
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:10,040
then I'm obliged to scan it. Right. You know what I mean? I want to make less work for myself.

653
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:18,200
Of course, because I'm up to my eyebrows and stuff. So but the whole thing is, you know,

654
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:22,780
this is not I'm not the only one that that has this. There's many other ways to get one and just

655
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:29,300
put your eyes and ears out for it. But everything that was known could have been known by the late

656
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:36,020
1800s, by the way, even nuclear stuff and high technology and all this other stuff. The vacuum

657
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:42,060
tubes, by the way, can handle more current than any transistor. So the transistor, right, is just

658
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:49,600
a different form of the same concept of the semiconductor. So it's, you know, so here's

659
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:54,060
the other thing. We didn't go back to the chat. I wanted to bring this up because there was some

660
01:01:54,060 --> 01:02:00,300
some stuff about tattoos and some requests about what do we do or how do we do or what's you know,

661
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:06,060
what's going on. And one thing that I mentioned is, to keep it short on this end of it,

662
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:13,100
there's going to come a time in history that's to come that biblical what's biblical law is

663
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:17,400
going to be implemented as worldwide law, and it's going to be very harsh. Okay.

664
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:23,740
Mm hmm. So one of the things that that are in there is that piercing and marking skin.

665
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:29,100
Now, the interesting thing about piercings is they tend to heal if you don't maintain it. Right.

666
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:37,200
Right. But the marking of skin is is not is doesn't really it does fade. It can't fade.

667
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:41,440
So there is a concern from people that I've spoken. Some people have taken

668
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:49,240
what I've said seriously and had tattoo removals from going to there will be a time where I don't

669
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:53,460
know if everyone's going to be asked to take off their clothes and investigated for tattoos. That

670
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:58,400
is possible in certain cases. But there are many people that wear them prominently. Right.

671
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:07,140
And they are to be removed. Now, what that means is to wear. Well, I can't be specific enough. But

672
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:14,860
the in the ordinance is to be removed outside of your society. Okay. So because they had a border

673
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:18,960
in an area. So you let's say you're in Israel with a tattoo as you can't come to Israel. You

674
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:25,780
got to stay in Lebanon or Egypt. Right. But my my question here is, if the entire world is under

675
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:31,720
this law, where do they remove you to the moon? There's a hotel on the moon. Unless they unless

676
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:35,980
they actually colonize Mars. Right. Where are you going? Yeah. Right. You're not going. So you're

677
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:41,140
but there's no reason to fear this, because then that means, you know, you're going to have to be

678
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:48,960
everyone's going to have to be inspected. But keep this in mind. Right. Just this is a moral reversal.

679
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:56,320
Like years ago, for example, if you were in a city and you were openly gay, you were probably killed

680
01:03:56,320 --> 01:04:02,900
within a certain amount of time. Right. Usually, not always like places like New York, not really,

681
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:08,380
or maybe whatever, but usually you were hunted down eventually. Right. And it was a shameful

682
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:15,120
death. Right. So now you have a reversal of that, where you have people that are openly gay are

683
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:23,800
praised. Right. So to have so get used to these moral reversals. So you have this thing where

684
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:27,960
everyone says, Oh, I think I'm going to get this. I really like this. The flavor of this milkshake,

685
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:32,060
I'm going to get it tattooed on my arm. Right. That's how ridiculous it's gotten. Right. Oh,

686
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:36,820
I really like this song. I'm going to get this tattooed on my arm, the lyrics to that song. I

687
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:40,840
actually heard someone saying that once I was waiting somewhere. Right. So this is how trivial

688
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:48,120
it is. So they can have a reversal. Right. Okay. So the concern of having them removed the laser

689
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:57,180
tat thing removal is, is probably the best way better than chemical than the old way is to cut

690
01:04:57,180 --> 01:05:02,340
it out. Right. Right. And pieces or the whole thing and have it grafted. Okay, the laser thing

691
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:06,980
I've, I have secondhand experience with someone who had that done with a tattoo on their leg,

692
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:13,020
a small one. It took two or three months with several appointments, and it was a red and green.

693
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:20,840
And it was completely removed. And I think they charge you $1 per pulse. Well, here's the thing,

694
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:26,900
I've investigated not deeply technical manuals, but it's a post. It's not the laser that removes

695
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:32,580
it alone. It's the pulse of the laser. Okay. So you need something that delivers a high energy

696
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:39,260
pulse, which is something like there's a ring ring maker or something. It's a post arc welder.

697
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:43,720
You can get them for 200 bucks. It's the power supply, the pedal, the frequency adjustment and

698
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:49,580
all that. And then you get a laser figure out the nanometer wavelength that you need. Usually it's

699
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:53,640
not going to be visible to the eye. So if you put it on the skin and it's red or green, it's not

700
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:59,740
the right laser. So you put the two together, the post arc welder with the laser, obviously the

701
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:05,440
post arc, you're going to have to change the voltage, right? You transformer. This stuff is,

702
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:09,960
you know, very rudimentary for if you're not afraid or intimidated by working with electronics,

703
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:16,160
you can learn it very, very quickly, right? You put the two together for less than 500 bucks,

704
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:22,500
you use the damn thing, and you build a nice hard case for it, right? So the next person in the

705
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:26,860
chat that might want one, you ship it to them. Hopefully they're not in New Zealand, right?

706
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:31,220
Because shipping anything to New Zealand is absurd, right? Anything that's not an envelope.

707
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:32,200
Australia too.

708
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:38,500
Right. Yeah, Australia is a little better, but yeah, yeah. Okay. So this is something,

709
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:44,600
there's equipment that's done that way. They ship it to you, you leave a deposit, right?

710
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:48,080
And you use it and then you ship it back to the company, right? You've heard of that. I mean,

711
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:53,260
I can't give too many specifics. I don't recall. I've never done it, but I hear it very often.

712
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:57,140
We ship it to you. It's like renting a tool, but instead of going down to the store

713
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:03,840
that in the neighborhood, it's done through the mail. So if you have a concerned, let's say a

714
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:07,620
quote, I don't like to use the word community, but let's say a community, let's say specifically in

715
01:07:07,620 --> 01:07:12,920
the chat or whatever that is concerned about this, someone needs to get back in the days,

716
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:18,180
the smart, when you, how smart someone was, was how many pencil, sharp pencils they had in their

717
01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:23,660
pocket protector, right? Right. I suppose. You know, like the nerd. Yeah. They had the pocket

718
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:28,900
protector and lots of, they had a lead pencil, a pen, right. It's a slide rule. Right. Right.

719
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:33,140
Okay. Right. The nerds, right. They lean over all the stuff falls out of their pocket. Okay.

720
01:07:33,380 --> 01:07:38,780
So you need someone that has at least two or three sharpened pencils in their pocket to put this

721
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:45,120
together. I can do it, but I'm not, I'm up to my eyebrows with projects like that, technical

722
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:51,320
projects, which I could get into. And I think the project that I'm mainly focused on, I've many

723
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:57,120
people, well, some people even, I know that someone that listens to us has speakers that I've

724
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:04,620
built for them and modified and other people I've heard demos, but moving basically a coherent loud

725
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:10,480
speaker, the first and only coherent loud speaker in the world where you play it and it sounds like

726
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:14,660
music, which is also something that's in the chat with that. I'm going to take a break and you,

727
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:25,910
so are you Chuck. And we'll continue this. Continuing with a sonic event 13 on Ocelli

728
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:31,229
and the Greek rated Y did take a little break there, but let's just get back to where the Greek

729
01:08:31,229 --> 01:08:36,590
was. Let's, let's build what we need. Here's the thing. One of the things that I tell people

730
01:08:37,149 --> 01:08:44,189
is to stop buying things, fix what you got. If it's broken or buy it pre-owned or thrifted

731
01:08:44,189 --> 01:08:50,450
or whatever, what that'll do is it'll take the demand out of the manufacturing, right?

732
01:08:51,729 --> 01:08:56,710
And when the demand comes out of the manufacturing, then the prices of things should change,

733
01:08:56,710 --> 01:09:00,229
even though it doesn't, we don't work on supply and demand, right? Cause it's credit, right?

734
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:07,870
That's why tip the hat off to Volkswagen. They still have a sign and drive. I think on their

735
01:09:07,870 --> 01:09:12,569
commercials, they've been doing this for 15 years, sign and drive. Well, if you could sign,

736
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:18,010
you can get a Volkswagen. I mean, I mean, they can't tell you more than that. You know, legally

737
01:09:18,010 --> 01:09:22,970
they'll get in trouble by the scumbag bar association, right? Right. So, cause they're

738
01:09:22,970 --> 01:09:26,930
the administrators, right? It's not the presidents. It's not the guard, the guard, you know, you,

739
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:33,010
I think this one's something I haven't really driven home. The bar association has been charged

740
01:09:33,010 --> 01:09:41,550
with administrating all of the countries, right? That's why you can be a president or ex-president

741
01:09:41,550 --> 01:09:50,450
and you go and you get indicted, right? If you look at the new constitution of the, of Russia,

742
01:09:51,290 --> 01:09:55,410
actually, or if you are not the new constitution, yeah, that one's good to look at

743
01:09:56,050 --> 01:09:59,630
how much they disclose there. They discern the difference between a man and a person

744
01:09:59,630 --> 01:10:05,850
in the constitution, by the way. Really? Yeah. Yeah. So should anyone, right? Well,

745
01:10:05,870 --> 01:10:11,090
they should, but I've never seen that in a constitution myself. So yeah. Well, it's fairly

746
01:10:11,090 --> 01:10:17,150
new. It's not, it's not from, you know, it's recent, but if you go to the president of Russia,

747
01:10:17,390 --> 01:10:23,250
his webpage, Putin on the front page or somewhere, it says, do not contact him regarding legal

748
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:29,150
matters. Cause basically the government has nothing to do with legal matters is what, get it?

749
01:10:29,330 --> 01:10:36,030
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cause they're not legal. I mean, how much more, they're not a legal thing.

750
01:10:36,750 --> 01:10:41,510
They do have this thing where the president can issue a pardon. That just means the discharge.

751
01:10:42,050 --> 01:10:46,430
They do give a few things like that to give the illusion to some people.

752
01:10:47,210 --> 01:10:52,550
But if you think that the legal society in your country, wherever you are, has anything to do

753
01:10:52,550 --> 01:11:00,090
with your country, you're an idiot. It is a, it is a, a world-based concern that is to

754
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:06,050
administer the, the bankrupt, all the bankrupt societies. Basically they don't speak about it

755
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:10,190
this way. I think up to the seventies, that word bankruptcy is a bad word or bankrupt.

756
01:11:10,450 --> 01:11:15,230
I don't know if people are here old enough to remember, but up until the seventies, early

757
01:11:15,230 --> 01:11:20,070
eighties, that word was commonly used, not referring to the government so much, but not anymore

758
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:26,170
because there's, there's no need for it because it's all credit. So, but anyway, start building

759
01:11:26,170 --> 01:11:34,250
things and fixing things. I always tell people, fix it, you know, and, and buy or buy a quote

760
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:39,990
unquote, use thrifted or pre-owned. Don't stay away from the primary market. Get out of it.

761
01:11:40,450 --> 01:11:46,510
The other thing that I'm not going to lean much on, but as we go down into the future,

762
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:49,910
sonic events, I think it will help people because I'll get very specific.

763
01:11:51,590 --> 01:11:55,930
I'm saying this with, I don't know how to say it, but I'll just say it.

764
01:11:57,070 --> 01:12:01,830
I am disappointed. Well, you know, I've said I'm embarrassed to be human, right?

765
01:12:02,590 --> 01:12:08,970
But the more I interact with people, the more dismayed and disappointed I am at how

766
01:12:08,970 --> 01:12:13,990
lack of skill people have, right? And meaning,

767
01:12:16,230 --> 01:12:22,330
most people that I've met in the past decade, I'm not super well-traveled, but I've traveled,

768
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:29,630
don't have the skills that I would expect an average human in a society that we live in right

769
01:12:29,630 --> 01:12:37,190
now to have, right? An example of that, someone who has what they call a engine driven wagon,

770
01:12:37,190 --> 01:12:42,370
which is called an automobile or a car. Most people still, when something goes wrong,

771
01:12:42,830 --> 01:12:46,850
it's customary to pop the hood and try to start it again. And then they throw their hands up

772
01:12:46,850 --> 01:12:53,510
in the air, right? Most of the time, right? Or check the gauges. You know, am I out of gas?

773
01:12:53,790 --> 01:13:01,290
But they don't know what's what, you see? Not only that, but can they fix it? Most people still

774
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:10,430
cannot. It's a small minority that does even maintenance, right? Someone's listening to me.

775
01:13:10,450 --> 01:13:15,410
I know someone's listening to me that can pretty much take an engine apart, put it back together,

776
01:13:15,530 --> 01:13:21,890
get all the valve timing correct, right? And all that. Yes, I hope there is, by the way.

777
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:27,650
But there's a lot of people, I'm sure, that change their spark plugs and change the oil

778
01:13:27,650 --> 01:13:34,950
and the coolant if it's water cooled, right? Can do that kind of stuff besides washing the car,

779
01:13:35,330 --> 01:13:40,210
you see? Giving that as an example. This has to do with cooking, has to do with just fixing

780
01:13:40,210 --> 01:13:49,610
shit in general, right? I had something go through a new laptop. It's a Lenovo ThinkPad

781
01:13:50,270 --> 01:13:57,430
E15, right? It's like right down from the top of the line. Anyway, I had a drywall screw gun go

782
01:13:57,430 --> 01:14:04,070
right through the laptop screen, right? It just happened to be in the bad spot and the screw gun

783
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:12,450
fell over. Okay, so my wife says, oh, that's too bad. It's a new laptop and we'll have that

784
01:14:12,450 --> 01:14:18,090
professionally done. I'm like, yeah. So I go and order a screen for like 40 bucks and I put it in.

785
01:14:19,570 --> 01:14:23,570
Do I know anything? If you ask me how many laptop screens I've changed in

786
01:14:24,650 --> 01:14:30,050
recent lifetimes, none, never, right? But you go to YouTube University,

787
01:14:31,690 --> 01:14:37,650
right? There's two YouTubes, right? Actually, I call it YouTube University. It's great for like

788
01:14:37,650 --> 01:14:41,470
if you want to change. I think I gave an example about changing a water pump in a car video.

789
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:45,730
Right. And the guy says, I'm not going to do it. My girlfriend's going to do it. I think that was

790
01:14:45,730 --> 01:14:50,810
great, right? And she did. It was easy, right? Okay. So I went to YouTube University, didn't

791
01:14:50,810 --> 01:14:55,970
find the exact one, but I got a hang of it. Okay. Changed the screen. Called around, they wanted

792
01:14:55,970 --> 01:15:02,730
250 or 300 bucks. Okay. It's not the money. It's not the money, right? It's not the funds or the

793
01:15:02,730 --> 01:15:09,890
credits. Can you do it, right? And it builds character. So what I recommend to people to do

794
01:15:09,890 --> 01:15:15,390
is try to pick up a new skill every week. Well, not completely or entirely, but try to do something

795
01:15:15,390 --> 01:15:20,670
that, but don't be foolish, but try to do something that you haven't done that you wish you

796
01:15:20,670 --> 01:15:25,670
can do or wanted it to do and attempt it. And sometimes it might mean getting the tools for it,

797
01:15:26,010 --> 01:15:34,410
right? Okay. And improvise and just try it out. But because of YouTube University, you can educate

798
01:15:34,410 --> 01:15:40,930
yourself by actually sharing. If someone says, I have no experience doing, I have no experience

799
01:15:40,930 --> 01:15:48,170
changing laptop screens, but if I see a few being changed, I see what they have in common. And you

800
01:15:48,170 --> 01:15:55,350
do have like a virtual experience, right? You don't have the tactile feeling. You don't know

801
01:15:55,350 --> 01:16:01,610
what it feels like. No, you can get an idea. Yeah. You don't smell it either. No. Right.

802
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:08,770
So here's the thing. I really would like to see people building up their skill level and especially

803
01:16:08,770 --> 01:16:14,390
in the medical side. I hate to use that word medical, physiotherapy,

804
01:16:16,910 --> 01:16:22,850
or physiotherapy, the physical terrain, learning about dentistry, learning about...

805
01:16:23,870 --> 01:16:29,190
Here's the thing. To go back and learn about the human body, you know how they say, I just

806
01:16:29,190 --> 01:16:34,530
look at the pictures? That's what you should be doing unless the book is more than 100 years old.

807
01:16:36,170 --> 01:16:41,210
The minute you see immune system absorption and this and that,

808
01:16:43,330 --> 01:16:47,690
delete, right? It doesn't exist. Right in front of you, it's like saying jet fuel brought down

809
01:16:47,690 --> 01:16:53,030
the towers, right? Oh my gosh. It doesn't work. You know, if you had a swimming pool full of jet fuel

810
01:16:54,290 --> 01:17:00,010
or diesel fuel and went into the house, tore out a sheet of aluminum foil, the kind that you

811
01:17:00,010 --> 01:17:07,750
wrap baked potatoes on to put in the barbecue, right? Throw the aluminum foil in the swimming

812
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:12,890
pool full of diesel fuel and light the swimming pool diesel fuel on fire. And after about two

813
01:17:12,890 --> 01:17:17,910
weeks, it'll be completely burned, right? All the diesel. Well, at the bottom, you're going to see

814
01:17:17,910 --> 01:17:23,250
the aluminum foil still be all charred, but you take the aluminum foil out and you just go inside

815
01:17:23,250 --> 01:17:28,570
with the sink and a sponge and just wash it off. It'll be nice and shiny and you could use it to

816
01:17:28,570 --> 01:17:34,150
wrap your baked potatoes. Yep. So this fuel that's burning for a week or two weeks or a month

817
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:40,370
doesn't melt. Aluminum is going to melt four inch thick steel. Now, in order to put out a story like

818
01:17:40,370 --> 01:17:49,050
that, you have had to conditioned the society to be so idiotic and moronic that they count as

819
01:17:49,050 --> 01:17:56,730
zero, right? Okay. This is what's going on with the medical stuff also, right? Science. What was

820
01:17:56,730 --> 01:18:02,970
the thing they're pushing with the pen? Oh, let's trust the science. Ah, trust the science,

821
01:18:03,090 --> 01:18:08,230
not trust science. Trust the science. That's like the doctor. Everybody says, I went to the doctor.

822
01:18:08,670 --> 01:18:13,490
I want to find out who this is. Is it like Santa Claus who goes on everyone's chimney? You know,

823
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:19,630
Santa Claus is told to children that brings all the toys and all that, right? So it's the same

824
01:18:19,630 --> 01:18:25,890
Santa Claus, right? For everyone, isn't it? I guess so. Yeah. Well, it's like I never heard it

825
01:18:25,890 --> 01:18:30,030
mentioned that there was Santa Claus A, Santa Claus B, one in the North Pole, one in the South

826
01:18:30,030 --> 01:18:35,710
Pole, right? So it's the Santa Claus. So I hear people saying, I went to the doctor here and that

827
01:18:35,710 --> 01:18:40,070
person over here, maybe on a video says, I went to the doctor. A person down the street here says,

828
01:18:40,110 --> 01:18:43,850
he went to the doctor. I said, oh my gosh, is this the same doctor? This guy gets around like

829
01:18:43,850 --> 01:18:52,150
Santa Claus. Anyway. I got you. Yeah. See, this is a metric. So now you know, look, if you want

830
01:18:52,150 --> 01:18:57,550
to know what I'm thinking about, listen to what I'm saying. Okay. It's exactly what's going through

831
01:18:57,550 --> 01:19:01,970
the mind. One thing that going back to the chat, by the way, I get very, before we went on this

832
01:19:01,970 --> 01:19:07,450
short break, if it's still in there, we talked about making your own laser pulse, uh, pulsing.

833
01:19:07,730 --> 01:19:12,510
One thing I did for removing tattoos. One thing I didn't mention is that nitrogen in the air,

834
01:19:12,550 --> 01:19:18,490
which is more than 70% doesn't like high energy. It turns into nitrates and things like that. And

835
01:19:18,490 --> 01:19:26,790
it could cause problems. So purging, if you purging the area with a gas that's inert helps

836
01:19:27,810 --> 01:19:32,810
CO2 maybe, and which is also cooling. I just want to throw that in there. Um,

837
01:19:33,990 --> 01:19:38,470
going back to the chat, someone says, Hey, uh, uh, I think it was ed. What do we talk about?

838
01:19:38,570 --> 01:19:43,830
What do you think about music or whatever? Uh, and someone second that I think phase shifter

839
01:19:44,350 --> 01:19:50,270
second, that idea. It's very simple. What is music, right? Right. I know Chuck. Go ahead.

840
01:19:50,430 --> 01:19:56,190
What go ahead. Cause you, you did, uh, some genre of rock or something maybe beyond tell us.

841
01:19:56,350 --> 01:20:01,030
Well, I did, I did, uh, lots of different stuff actually, uh, musically. And I mean,

842
01:20:01,030 --> 01:20:05,150
I would just, uh, I would create mostly original material, but sometimes we would,

843
01:20:05,210 --> 01:20:08,210
you know, play, uh, cover tunes, this kind of thing. I mean,

844
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:12,310
I did all sorts of different work in the music business, uh, and then wound up,

845
01:20:12,310 --> 01:20:17,670
you know, making money actually, uh, by, or, you know, making a living for a bit anyway.

846
01:20:18,350 --> 01:20:22,990
Uh, being a bouncer, a booker, et cetera, as a vocation. Yeah. I mean, I worked in studios.

847
01:20:23,210 --> 01:20:31,110
Here, here go the dogs again. Uh, all that, but, um, yeah, uh, no music is something that's very

848
01:20:31,110 --> 01:20:39,210
interesting to me though, because it is often a cultural vehicle. It's often a very spiritual

849
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:43,770
feeling thing one way or another, whether you're expressing, you know, an emotion,

850
01:20:44,310 --> 01:20:48,330
see, it's also very emotional. It just seems to cross into so many different things

851
01:20:48,890 --> 01:20:55,890
that are part of our experience that I, I find it to be, you know, one of these unique pieces of art

852
01:20:55,890 --> 01:21:01,090
that is out there, you know, uh, it is, it is similar to replicating an image, you know,

853
01:21:01,110 --> 01:21:07,090
because you're replicating an emotion sometimes, and you can transmit that, uh, through these

854
01:21:07,090 --> 01:21:11,770
different, you know, people tell me, oh, it's about the frequencies and so on. And in some ways

855
01:21:11,770 --> 01:21:16,770
it is, but in other ways that there's, there's kind of intangible things to it. I think, uh,

856
01:21:16,770 --> 01:21:21,230
you know, you know, the idea of like, I don't know necessarily how to tell you how to write a hit,

857
01:21:21,270 --> 01:21:24,870
but I know one when I hear it, you know, you've heard that a lot from these guys who were

858
01:21:24,870 --> 01:21:30,290
successful producers and stuff. There is a, there's an element that I think there's not even

859
01:21:30,290 --> 01:21:36,990
language for outside of it. It is a language in and of itself. Now, maybe that's a silly notion,

860
01:21:37,210 --> 01:21:41,250
but yeah, go ahead. No, when you say a hit that the whole industry has been in lockdown since Clive

861
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:49,390
Davis, uh, uh, you know, since the 60s, since Motown it's in lockdown, unless you know how to

862
01:21:49,390 --> 01:21:55,130
work the system and then, then you'll get sucked up by it. But what I wanted to say is, you know,

863
01:21:55,130 --> 01:22:01,350
you could ask a thousand people that they're, that is into music on whether they're playing

864
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:06,370
an instrument or whatever involved in the music business. And they'll all, all thousand people

865
01:22:06,370 --> 01:22:11,650
will say something different, but the commonality is pretty much the same. It's, you know, it's

866
01:22:11,650 --> 01:22:17,070
something that, uh, is, uh, people need and want and they produce it and they make it because people

867
01:22:17,070 --> 01:22:21,770
need and want it. Right. And it's been around in history. What, what I want to give about that

868
01:22:22,170 --> 01:22:26,270
is, um, it's kind of like a name, you know, when you ask someone, what's your name?

869
01:22:27,590 --> 01:22:32,490
And, uh, if they don't hear you, right. They're like, what? I'm like, uh, what sound do you

870
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:37,370
answer to? Right. What is the name? It's a sound that you answer to, right. It doesn't have to be,

871
01:22:37,550 --> 01:22:42,050
it could be like something like the Greek, right. Which is like a nickname kind of thing. I answer

872
01:22:42,050 --> 01:22:47,530
to that. Right, right. So it's a sound that you answer to. So what's happening is, uh, this music,

873
01:22:47,530 --> 01:22:52,610
we answer to it in a contemplative way. We hear it and we either like it or we don't like it. And

874
01:22:52,610 --> 01:22:59,910
if we like it, we accept it and we try to take in something. Right. What I say about music also is

875
01:22:59,910 --> 01:23:04,070
that, you know, people think they see with their eyes and they hear with their ears. We actually,

876
01:23:04,290 --> 01:23:10,530
you see with your brain and you hear with your brain and magicians know this. That's why they

877
01:23:10,530 --> 01:23:15,910
can distract you and do what they do in a ledger domain or press the digitation,

878
01:23:16,650 --> 01:23:21,190
because they know that it's not your eyes that you see with, it's with your brain. So if they

879
01:23:21,190 --> 01:23:27,390
can occupy enough of your brain, the, uh, you will see what's going on, but you will not acknowledge

880
01:23:27,390 --> 01:23:33,150
it. So when someone hears a certain kind of music, they don't like, they acknowledge enough

881
01:23:33,150 --> 01:23:39,090
of the parts that they don't like, and they turn it off. Someone hears enough of the music that

882
01:23:39,090 --> 01:23:43,710
they acknowledge that they do like, then they open themselves up more to it. So that's where

883
01:23:43,710 --> 01:23:48,890
you have, you know, I like it or I don't like it. Um, this is where, this is the point I want to

884
01:23:48,890 --> 01:23:54,430
make that I'm sure many people or no one has heard because this is a very unique, as far as I know,

885
01:23:54,450 --> 01:24:00,850
I was the only one involved in a small group of people back in 2009. There's a company called

886
01:24:02,610 --> 01:24:08,270
ProSonic Formosa, ProSonic, they're in Malaysia. They're a very large, um, they make all your Sony

887
01:24:08,270 --> 01:24:15,370
stuff and speakers, uh, home theaters, all kinds, they're involved in all kinds of stuff, right?

888
01:24:16,210 --> 01:24:21,470
Well, we came up even back then with a counter space, this, this module that you put in an

889
01:24:21,470 --> 01:24:26,790
audio dynamic speaker and it makes it coherent. So there's no distortion. What I mean is, you know,

890
01:24:26,790 --> 01:24:31,050
you go to a drive-thru and you sound like this, right? Right. Okay. That's because of the

891
01:24:31,050 --> 01:24:37,110
enclosure of the driver. There is forcing a driver to move in it, in an enclosure, a box, a speaker

892
01:24:37,110 --> 01:24:41,690
box. And if you cut anything open in nature, you're going to see there's a secondary geometry

893
01:24:42,230 --> 01:24:47,310
inside of a piece of fruit, right? You don't cut an apple open and just see apple flesh. There's

894
01:24:47,310 --> 01:24:52,990
actually a geometry inside, right? The core and the seeds, uh, a watermelon, any, anything in

895
01:24:52,990 --> 01:24:59,010
nature, an egg, the human, but anything in nature that grows or is alive, when you open it up, it has

896
01:24:59,010 --> 01:25:03,870
a secondary geometric layout inside, right? It doesn't resemble what's on the outside at all,

897
01:25:03,930 --> 01:25:09,030
right? Like when you cut open an orange and you see eight pieces, you know, the eight sections inside,

898
01:25:09,090 --> 01:25:13,610
you don't see that one. It's hanging on a tree. You have to open it, right? So you have a

899
01:25:15,290 --> 01:25:18,810
complimentary geometry. So we made these modules, you put them in a speaker and suddenly it sounds

900
01:25:18,810 --> 01:25:23,490
clear, right? Because we're, we're just completing the project, right? We're completing the

901
01:25:23,490 --> 01:25:34,290
manifestation of reproducing sound. Okay. So the idea was, uh, when the module is in the loud

902
01:25:34,290 --> 01:25:38,750
speaker, it sounds really coherent and clear. And when it's not in the loud speaker, it sounds like

903
01:25:38,750 --> 01:25:46,130
this, right? Okay. So we found what we did was, um, uh, I did this remotely. I was still in the

904
01:25:46,610 --> 01:25:52,230
experiment. This was in 2009. It took about six months and there was about 75 people involved.

905
01:25:52,330 --> 01:25:57,790
Half the people worked at prosonic and the other half didn't. What they did is they set them up

906
01:25:57,790 --> 01:26:05,370
with various EKG and ECG equipment, you know, where they scan the, um, what people that have

907
01:26:05,370 --> 01:26:11,870
equipment were brought in, let's say that scan the stress levels in the body, right? They have things

908
01:26:11,870 --> 01:26:18,150
that they stick on your skin and they have various factors that they look at, including brainwaves.

909
01:26:18,950 --> 01:26:24,210
And when, uh, they, these people are there to tell, it's kind of like lie detector kind of

910
01:26:24,210 --> 01:26:28,210
equipment, right? But what they do is they developed an algorithm which shows someone

911
01:26:28,210 --> 01:26:35,330
is experiencing a higher, uh, stress or normal or reduced stress relaxation, right? Points.

912
01:26:35,810 --> 01:26:40,490
So what they did was they played the speakers without the module and they had a certain

913
01:26:40,490 --> 01:26:46,190
stress level. Then they played the speakers with headphones and speakers in the room, both

914
01:26:46,810 --> 01:26:52,830
with the module and the stress was reduced, right? But here's the thing. Okay. Why is he saying this?

915
01:26:52,910 --> 01:26:58,850
What is he? Why? Okay. That's good. Okay. But here's the thing. It didn't matter what kind of

916
01:26:58,850 --> 01:27:05,090
music it was. They had heavy metal, right? Like I call it love songs. They're really, you know,

917
01:27:05,090 --> 01:27:11,670
really strong, heavy metal. It sounds like a Viking battle cry, right? Okay. Right. They had

918
01:27:11,670 --> 01:27:19,450
acid, heavy metal. They had heavy disco. They had classical music. They had a funky jazz and

919
01:27:19,450 --> 01:27:26,490
mellow jazz elevator music, right? And just vocals. So they had all the like five, six genres.

920
01:27:27,730 --> 01:27:33,730
So they played, um, all the different genres. So you would think that most people would have,

921
01:27:33,730 --> 01:27:39,370
that people would have a higher stress level with the acid metal or whatever, right? Or the

922
01:27:39,370 --> 01:27:44,630
hard disco than the classical. And they found out that it wasn't the type of music.

923
01:27:45,910 --> 01:27:54,330
It was this, how coherent it was to them. So the stress level for the elevator music was the same

924
01:27:54,330 --> 01:28:00,030
with the heavy metal. Ultimately, when they're listening just for stress levels,

925
01:28:00,030 --> 01:28:03,810
they told people to relax and they would measure the stress with the module or without the model.

926
01:28:03,970 --> 01:28:08,350
So without the module, the stress levels were higher with all the music equally.

927
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:14,090
And with the module, the stress levels, you know, with the speaker sounding clear,

928
01:28:14,670 --> 01:28:21,990
were lower. So when I found that study out, it took me like a few days to digest it. Because

929
01:28:21,990 --> 01:28:26,450
let's say I don't like heavy metal. I'm not saying I don't, but let's say I don't, or I don't like

930
01:28:26,450 --> 01:28:31,610
disco, which I did that for a few years, by the way, specifically, I did heavy metal stuff. But yeah,

931
01:28:31,750 --> 01:28:36,670
good. Yeah. But what I'm trying to say is, let's say, let's just take as a given, I don't like

932
01:28:36,670 --> 01:28:40,530
disco and heavy metal. Let's say I'm not, that's not true. Well, but let's just say you did. Right.

933
01:28:40,570 --> 01:28:46,010
Okay. Let's say, right. So I, if I'm in doing a test and I'm listening and I agree to be part of

934
01:28:46,010 --> 01:28:52,730
this, I'm expecting myself to have elevated levels of stress listening to those genres, right?

935
01:28:52,730 --> 01:28:58,010
Simply because you don't like it. Right. But the test shows that was not the case. And these

936
01:28:58,010 --> 01:29:03,950
were people between 18 and 80. Right. So they found out that it was not the type of music,

937
01:29:04,330 --> 01:29:08,230
but it was whether it was coherent. In other words, the more clear it sounded

938
01:29:08,930 --> 01:29:13,390
and more coherent and less distortion, the less stress the organism

939
01:29:15,010 --> 01:29:19,490
experienced. And when I say organism, you know how they say, these are like the crazy

940
01:29:19,490 --> 01:29:24,650
rich people on park Avenue. Make sure I know a lady has a duplex on park Avenue,

941
01:29:26,210 --> 01:29:29,770
penthouse. Make sure I watching the apartment a long time ago.

942
01:29:30,770 --> 01:29:35,170
Make sure you play the classical music when you're not here because the plants like it.

943
01:29:35,290 --> 01:29:37,990
Have you ever heard? Yes, I have heard that kind of thing.

944
01:29:38,190 --> 01:29:43,550
Okay. All right. Very important. Okay. So that's why I said organism. It is true. There are plants,

945
01:29:43,630 --> 01:29:49,210
there's the secret life of plants, right? It's true that plants do react to these things also.

946
01:29:49,210 --> 01:29:54,290
Now this, but this whole study, it has nothing to do whether it's classical music or not. It's

947
01:29:54,290 --> 01:29:59,710
whether it's coherent. Okay. Here's the other thing. People say, uh, Greek, let's go listen

948
01:29:59,710 --> 01:30:04,070
to some live music. And I know what's going on, but I don't want to be an asshole. So I go with

949
01:30:04,070 --> 01:30:08,070
them and I know what's going on. Meaning we're going to go to a venue where there's a live

950
01:30:08,070 --> 01:30:12,750
band playing, but it's going to be amplified with these stage speakers, right. Which is

951
01:30:12,750 --> 01:30:17,810
or the PA system in conjunction with stage speakers. And it sounds like crap, right?

952
01:30:17,810 --> 01:30:24,110
A lot of times. So I show up and I know what's going on when they invite me. I know I, you know,

953
01:30:24,150 --> 01:30:28,470
I show up and after a few minutes, I'm like, guys, I'm going to be outside having a smoke

954
01:30:28,470 --> 01:30:33,070
or something. Cause this is too loud. And it sounds, doesn't sound good to me, but it's live.

955
01:30:33,090 --> 01:30:39,630
I'm like, yeah, I know it's live, but it sounds like crap. Right. So usually people that enjoy

956
01:30:39,630 --> 01:30:44,210
that kind of thing in a venue just want something different. They don't even care if it's good or

957
01:30:44,210 --> 01:30:48,610
anything. They just want something different. Exactly. But what I'm saying is even though

958
01:30:48,610 --> 01:30:53,470
they think they're liking, they will have an elevated stress level because it sounds like crap.

959
01:30:53,990 --> 01:30:58,870
So when this music thing was brought up in the chat, I wanted to interject what I'm saying,

960
01:30:58,990 --> 01:31:03,310
because most of the time we go around within a, from a cultural perspective,

961
01:31:04,050 --> 01:31:08,110
from a heretic or heresy, meaning like, what do you, heresy means to prefer something,

962
01:31:08,770 --> 01:31:13,230
what you prefer preference. And because something is not of someone's preference,

963
01:31:13,230 --> 01:31:16,970
we feel that that will inconvenience them to the point where they will be stressed, right?

964
01:31:17,810 --> 01:31:26,930
Okay. So, but we found out objectively, that's not true. So it's the incoherent sound that stresses

965
01:31:26,930 --> 01:31:32,630
people out, not the genre of music. And I just wanted to share this with everyone because I

966
01:31:32,630 --> 01:31:38,070
know this is not public because right now you can go around and ask pretty much everyone on this

967
01:31:38,070 --> 01:31:43,530
planet, what do you think happens to people who are listening to music of a genre that they don't

968
01:31:43,530 --> 01:31:49,450
prefer? Oh, they get stressed, right? No, the answer is no, they don't. It's the way that they,

969
01:31:49,630 --> 01:31:56,630
the quality that comes to them, if it's incoherent, right? Listening to a shower radio would be the

970
01:31:56,630 --> 01:32:01,430
least incoherent, right? Or a cheap radio, right? Oh, yeah. No, yeah. Think about that for a second.

971
01:32:01,510 --> 01:32:06,070
The little tiny, like old transistor radios that had the terrible speakers in them.

972
01:32:06,790 --> 01:32:12,770
Well, it's such, yeah, it's the whole system was, but even now, if you look even in high end audio,

973
01:32:12,770 --> 01:32:16,510
a lot of people say this is too fatiguing, even though it sounds crystal clear, because

974
01:32:16,510 --> 01:32:21,230
it's not coherent. So I just wanted to throw that in there about music, because that's something

975
01:32:21,230 --> 01:32:30,230
that is completely wide open. It's like food, right? And I feel really good to be a part of

976
01:32:30,230 --> 01:32:37,010
something that is, for the first time, other than live music, can be reproduced and be coherent.

977
01:32:37,150 --> 01:32:41,890
I think I sent you a video sample of the loudspeaker, right, on a bench. Right. And

978
01:32:41,890 --> 01:32:46,910
then I sent you the source that you could listen to directly from the file. And there was no

979
01:32:46,910 --> 01:32:51,570
difference, very little, if not any noticeable between the speaker playing in the room and the

980
01:32:51,570 --> 01:32:55,950
file being played on whatever you listen to on the headphones. Right, right, right. That's not

981
01:32:55,950 --> 01:33:06,030
possible, because you're right. Okay, so what I'm trying to say is we can go, okay, let me put it

982
01:33:06,030 --> 01:33:10,090
this way, in a general sense, we could spend most of our lives with preconceived notions of things

983
01:33:10,090 --> 01:33:14,810
that we've borrowed from academia, culture, TV, or listening to other people. And it's just not true

984
01:33:14,810 --> 01:33:20,130
when you find out by objectifying what's really going on. And I just wanted to bring that up with

985
01:33:20,130 --> 01:33:24,170
the music, because it's not the type of music, it's whether it's coherent or not. In other words,

986
01:33:24,730 --> 01:33:30,210
is it natural? Another example of that would be bird song. You know, birds communicate really,

987
01:33:30,350 --> 01:33:35,530
really from great distances and echoes and sound reflections, and they still get the message,

988
01:33:35,630 --> 01:33:43,050
right? And our hearing is more sensitive than our eyesight. Give an example. You're walking through

989
01:33:43,050 --> 01:33:47,190
the forest with a group of people, and it's really late at night, and it's really dark. It's a dark

990
01:33:47,190 --> 01:33:55,350
moon. You can't see much. And you hear something unusual. What happens? Immediately, you want to

991
01:33:55,350 --> 01:34:03,810
run the opposite direction, right? Let's imagine we're making a bee horror movie, okay? And you

992
01:34:03,810 --> 01:34:08,850
hear a growl and a screech. Behind you, everyone starts speeding up, going in the opposite direction.

993
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:13,590
So your ears are more important for your survival than your eyes.

994
01:34:14,670 --> 01:34:20,170
Well, they can be, but there's other things going on there outside of your ears. That's just the

995
01:34:20,170 --> 01:34:24,870
one that's easy to interpret, right? Yeah. Well, the thing is, you'll pick it up with your skin

996
01:34:24,870 --> 01:34:30,790
also. That's why headphones don't really give you... When you're listening to music that's

997
01:34:30,790 --> 01:34:37,270
reproduced, let's say, with a hi-fi system or live, the tactile sensation, it's almost haptic

998
01:34:37,270 --> 01:34:44,450
through the entire body and the ears, right? I know people that are into headphones.

999
01:34:44,650 --> 01:34:49,970
Yeah, I hate listening to music on headphones because it feels like a half an experience at

1000
01:34:49,970 --> 01:34:56,330
best. That's right. And I wanted to say something, but maybe I won't be lascivious in this,

1001
01:34:56,570 --> 01:35:01,590
because it's pretty lascivious. So anyway... Well, why not? We're all adults here.

1002
01:35:02,170 --> 01:35:08,450
Yeah, well, we'll skip it. Yeah. So what I've suggested to people that have invested in

1003
01:35:08,450 --> 01:35:12,450
headphones and especially high-end system, I said, well, why do you listen to headphones? Because I

1004
01:35:12,450 --> 01:35:17,230
don't want to disturb anyone else. I said, well, okay, how about you put the headphones on the

1005
01:35:17,230 --> 01:35:23,530
jack and have the main amp put the loudspeakers on very, very, very low. You could test that for

1006
01:35:23,530 --> 01:35:28,890
yourself. Just close the door and go outside of the room if it's a closed room or whatever.

1007
01:35:28,890 --> 01:35:33,530
Some cases you can't do it, but still have the loudspeakers on in the room, very, very low with

1008
01:35:33,530 --> 01:35:37,090
the headphones on, and then tell me how the experience. They're like, much, much better,

1009
01:35:37,190 --> 01:35:41,150
not disturbing anyone because it's too low of a level to disturb anyone. And I could turn up the

1010
01:35:41,150 --> 01:35:47,070
headphones, but I still get that ambient perturbation in the room. You see? Yeah. That's

1011
01:35:47,070 --> 01:35:53,050
actually a really good idea. Yeah. And that brought to life because I've had people, I said,

1012
01:35:53,110 --> 01:35:56,370
yeah, man, I'm trying to get into this headphone experience. I started off with some $100

1013
01:35:56,370 --> 01:36:02,590
headphones, another up to $3,500 headphones, electrostatics. And they thought if they got

1014
01:36:02,590 --> 01:36:05,810
those that they were more... I said, no, no, it's just in your head. You're just putting your head

1015
01:36:05,810 --> 01:36:10,830
in a vise. Was there a movie that put the guy's head in a vise? Casino.

1016
01:36:11,730 --> 01:36:16,130
Yeah, or something. So it's like putting your head in a vise. Think about it. What is a headphone?

1017
01:36:16,470 --> 01:36:20,830
And you're trying to get an entire emotional experience out of that. No, it's not going to

1018
01:36:20,830 --> 01:36:26,090
happen. You need... Right. Okay. So I just suggest to people, if you do listen to headphones and it's

1019
01:36:26,090 --> 01:36:32,490
an inconvenience, have a system in the room also playing very, very low. Because I have actually

1020
01:36:33,990 --> 01:36:37,750
experienced where, let's say I'm sleeping in one room and someone else is sleeping in another room

1021
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:41,650
and I want to hear something. I could put it on so low that you don't hear it outside the room at

1022
01:36:41,650 --> 01:36:46,010
all. Right? Even with the door open. You know what I mean? Right. You just got to play around with

1023
01:36:46,010 --> 01:36:52,950
it. It's very important. The headphone thing, I think is... That's why the incidences of hear loss

1024
01:36:52,950 --> 01:36:58,510
have gone up since the 80s with the Walkman, you know? Yeah. In the 80s, the earbuds. Well,

1025
01:36:58,610 --> 01:37:02,610
it was by the end of the 80s, they were sticking the earbuds all the way down the ear canal and

1026
01:37:02,610 --> 01:37:07,210
you were pressurizing the ear canal where... See, with the over-the-ear headphones, you have some

1027
01:37:07,210 --> 01:37:14,370
airspace around the lobe, right? Right. You're not directly pressurizing. Oh, that's why I refuse to

1028
01:37:14,370 --> 01:37:18,790
use those. And still, people think I'm nuts. They're like, why are you using a big old pair

1029
01:37:18,790 --> 01:37:22,250
of headphones when you do your radio stuff? I'm like, because I don't want to damage my ears.

1030
01:37:23,150 --> 01:37:26,270
And you guys are sticking these things in your ears. I don't want to do that.

1031
01:37:27,310 --> 01:37:30,290
It does something. I don't know how to explain it, but I know...

1032
01:37:31,070 --> 01:37:36,350
Well, what it does is you're vented. The ear canals are vented in the rest of the head,

1033
01:37:36,410 --> 01:37:39,770
right? Yeah. That's why when you go up in an airplane, they tell you to swallow or chew gum

1034
01:37:39,770 --> 01:37:45,530
so your ears don't... Your ears pop, altitude change. You have vents that go into the throat

1035
01:37:45,530 --> 01:37:50,470
mouth area, right? Right. So it's not totally pressurized. It's almost like a reflex system.

1036
01:37:50,470 --> 01:37:55,510
But when you close off... You see, when you have the over the ear headphones, the shape of the lobe

1037
01:37:55,510 --> 01:38:00,550
offers a valleys and peaks for air to move around in there. You're not directly pressurizing.

1038
01:38:01,090 --> 01:38:04,650
It's kind of like if you want to blow up a balloon, you put it tight on your lips. That would

1039
01:38:04,650 --> 01:38:12,870
be the high pressure situation of the earbud. Where imagine trying to blow up a balloon with

1040
01:38:12,870 --> 01:38:16,810
one inch away from your mouth. You're not getting that pressure in the ear, you see?

1041
01:38:16,810 --> 01:38:20,250
Right. You're not going to blow up a balloon. So the over the ear would be

1042
01:38:21,110 --> 01:38:26,150
the way to go. And also the larger the diaphragm, the safer it is because the larger the diaphragm,

1043
01:38:26,210 --> 01:38:31,330
it doesn't have to move as much. The smaller the diaphragm, it has to move more to produce the same

1044
01:38:31,330 --> 01:38:37,990
volume and that creates distortion. You notice it sounded like when asked about music, I went

1045
01:38:37,990 --> 01:38:43,510
away from directly discussing music from a romantic point of view to a more, let's say,

1046
01:38:44,070 --> 01:38:50,930
technical point of view. I wanted to show how it's not what you like that makes you feel good

1047
01:38:50,930 --> 01:38:54,850
or don't like that doesn't make you feel good, but it's the quality of the music,

1048
01:38:54,970 --> 01:38:58,110
how it's being received, that makes you feel good ultimately.

1049
01:38:58,570 --> 01:39:07,110
Ultimately, I appreciate lots of different types of music. I've always found it interesting. It is

1050
01:39:07,110 --> 01:39:11,250
about the quality. It's what's good is good. All the different types of music, when it's

1051
01:39:11,250 --> 01:39:16,330
objectified, one shouldn't make you feel stressed and the other one doesn't. That's what I'm trying

1052
01:39:16,330 --> 01:39:20,290
to say from this study. See, but that's what's weird. I want to ask you a question about that

1053
01:39:20,290 --> 01:39:26,050
though, because I'll tell you that I get a stress level from this like pop crap that is just like

1054
01:39:26,050 --> 01:39:32,750
really very artificial sounding. And I know I get stressed from hearing that nonsense. I'm sorry

1055
01:39:32,750 --> 01:39:39,590
about the chair noise there. By the way, I need a new chair. But the thing is that there is,

1056
01:39:39,590 --> 01:39:42,950
I don't know, there's something to that where it's like the,

1057
01:39:43,550 --> 01:39:50,950
oh, who's even really popular now like a Cardi B, right? It is coherent. The sound appears to be

1058
01:39:50,950 --> 01:39:58,970
coherent. But I am absolutely disturbed by it. I it's just annoying to me. I don't find it.

1059
01:39:59,230 --> 01:40:04,090
And it's super popular. It's like, oh, it's but it's very, you know, it's very consistent. A lot

1060
01:40:04,090 --> 01:40:07,570
of people basically are saying it's very consistent. They like the beat. They like this.

1061
01:40:07,570 --> 01:40:11,410
And I go, I don't know, for some reason, it's very disturbing to me.

1062
01:40:11,630 --> 01:40:16,430
Well, I'm going to have to lean. That's preferential. But I'm saying that the organism

1063
01:40:17,890 --> 01:40:22,750
from what I mentioned earlier, we'll accept it just like music that you like. And then we

1064
01:40:23,250 --> 01:40:28,110
rationalize it that, you know, I don't want to play that again. Or I won't buy that CD. What

1065
01:40:28,110 --> 01:40:34,850
is it? Was it Cardi? Cardigan? Cardi B or whatever. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. All right. Oh,

1066
01:40:34,850 --> 01:40:38,990
you won't buy the CD, right? You're not going to go to a concert. And if it's on the radio,

1067
01:40:39,030 --> 01:40:42,930
you might find something else. Right. Right. Right. So that's that's so maybe

1068
01:40:43,850 --> 01:40:49,190
if you're enterprising away from it, that could cause stress. But what I'm saying is I.

1069
01:40:49,630 --> 01:40:55,110
So this secondary study, it's a secondary action, though. It's a secondary action.

1070
01:40:55,590 --> 01:40:59,590
Yeah, it's a secondary action, right? It's like you're going to make a move to get away from it

1071
01:40:59,590 --> 01:41:08,330
or critique it. But see, that enlightened me to the point where there is a genre of music

1072
01:41:08,330 --> 01:41:14,490
called lo-fi. I see it sometimes coming up on YouTube where they add distortions and things

1073
01:41:14,490 --> 01:41:18,750
like that. And I don't know what that does, but I still think if it's being reproduced coherently.

1074
01:41:19,470 --> 01:41:24,510
But I don't think it is because there's an attempt to make it lo-fi. You know what I mean?

1075
01:41:24,510 --> 01:41:29,730
Right. So I just wanted to throw that in. But, you know, there's a lot of sayings about music.

1076
01:41:30,230 --> 01:41:35,470
Soot soothes the savage beast. And it's the silence between the notes that makes the music.

1077
01:41:36,050 --> 01:41:43,230
People talk about frequency. Frequency is a vibration per unit of time. That is

1078
01:41:44,130 --> 01:41:48,510
almost like blood pressure. It doesn't exist, you know, only for a certain it can only be

1079
01:41:48,510 --> 01:41:51,870
used for a certain parameter, which is the time between heartbeats. Right.

1080
01:41:51,870 --> 01:41:56,210
Or when the heart's expanding and contracting, there's no pressure. So what I'm saying,

1081
01:41:56,510 --> 01:42:00,610
the frequency is irrelevant. It's the vibration that's relevant. And when you're listening to

1082
01:42:00,610 --> 01:42:06,890
music, it's not just a frequency. It's many vibrations in time. Right. So that needs to

1083
01:42:06,890 --> 01:42:13,050
be considered as a whole. It's kind of like when you I had a bowl of soup for lunch. Do you think

1084
01:42:13,050 --> 01:42:18,570
it was just hot water or it had other ingredients in it? Right. Otherwise, it wouldn't be I wouldn't

1085
01:42:18,570 --> 01:42:25,350
call it a bowl of soup. Right. Right. So when you say you're hearing music, it's it's it's

1086
01:42:25,350 --> 01:42:32,250
a vibratory effect of many frequencies in time. No pun intended, because when you're learning to

1087
01:42:32,250 --> 01:42:37,850
make music, it's timing, isn't it? It's all about in time, right? Timing. Yeah, exactly.

1088
01:42:38,170 --> 01:42:43,010
So the frequency part, it maybe is important there. There's an aspect of the four thirty

1089
01:42:43,010 --> 01:42:50,010
two and four forty. Yeah. People talk about more needs to be it's kind of narrow. That's

1090
01:42:50,010 --> 01:42:59,330
for the tuning of a K. Whenever I see something being brought forward as a cure all, I'm leery of

1091
01:42:59,330 --> 01:43:04,370
it. You ever that's been going on now for more than 10 or 15 years. Oh, they went from this to

1092
01:43:04,370 --> 01:43:10,190
that. Well, they're not talking about that. It's the tuning of a and have they mucked about with

1093
01:43:10,190 --> 01:43:17,990
the tuning of C and D. Right. And they have there is. So to me, that's like a lot of the flat

1094
01:43:17,990 --> 01:43:23,550
earth stuff. The flat earth stuff, by the way, I was going around and like I remember from like

1095
01:43:23,550 --> 01:43:31,590
1986, 1987, talking about talking to people, you know, the earth is flat logically and rationally.

1096
01:43:32,050 --> 01:43:37,570
But when I do surveying, it's round. So it must be both depending on what you're focusing on. Right.

1097
01:43:37,570 --> 01:43:43,310
And I would bring up the earth is flat often. There was also in the 80s, the concave earth

1098
01:43:43,310 --> 01:43:48,870
that we're actually in a concave section. Now, that's like the plate issue, right? Where like

1099
01:43:48,870 --> 01:43:54,290
it's almost like a plate where there's a. Well, no, it's kind of like imagine we're not on the

1100
01:43:54,290 --> 01:43:58,610
inside or not on the outside of the globe of the basketball, but we're on the inside.

1101
01:43:59,070 --> 01:44:01,910
And when we're looking up, we're actually looking at the center.

1102
01:44:02,630 --> 01:44:08,290
Oh, so these are all different perspectives. That one was brought up because when you dig

1103
01:44:08,290 --> 01:44:12,990
two parallel holes, they start to diverge. They don't converge. They go further apart,

1104
01:44:13,110 --> 01:44:21,390
which means we're right. So anyway, because they're actually tangents. But here's the thing.

1105
01:44:23,030 --> 01:44:27,150
Talking about all this stuff for many, many years and seeing it come up again.

1106
01:44:27,570 --> 01:44:33,410
Right. Like most people, the flatter thing is a new thing. Right. And I'm like, oh, my gosh,

1107
01:44:33,490 --> 01:44:37,070
I don't know if you remember me addressing this a long time ago as a flatter thing. I was doing

1108
01:44:37,070 --> 01:44:41,810
that. Everybody's doing that. Not everybody, but I was amongst people that made it a serious point

1109
01:44:41,810 --> 01:44:46,990
of research. Right. Right. So these things are revived over and over and over. All these

1110
01:44:46,990 --> 01:44:54,930
things are brought back. And I think the the a. Tuning. Yes, most people I went forth,

1111
01:44:54,930 --> 01:44:58,890
they don't even know what they're talking. They don't even you know, I've heard the difference.

1112
01:44:58,970 --> 01:45:03,030
I could hear the difference slightly. I'm not I'm not into the fine tuning of instruments.

1113
01:45:03,330 --> 01:45:10,310
There is a slight difference. But I think I think you need to be if these points are brought up,

1114
01:45:10,430 --> 01:45:16,010
they need to be more well rounded, because most people, when they argue the 432 and 440,

1115
01:45:16,090 --> 01:45:20,790
they don't even know of what tuning of what what's tuned. They don't know it's a right.

1116
01:45:21,210 --> 01:45:24,690
Most people, they just say preferred, because this is like, what do you say,

1117
01:45:24,850 --> 01:45:28,950
tell people what to think, what to say, what to be a part of, right, what to have interest in,

1118
01:45:28,990 --> 01:45:35,310
they don't know. So what I suggest is a more well rounded approach to anything. So when you see the

1119
01:45:35,310 --> 01:45:41,150
next new thing, which is actually an old thing, brought up as a controversy or whatever, learn

1120
01:45:41,150 --> 01:45:45,090
more about the subject more well rounded, and you'll see if you're being played or not, you

1121
01:45:45,090 --> 01:45:49,070
know, or it's a what do you call it when they just distract your take your attention away?

1122
01:45:49,670 --> 01:45:55,690
Just that right? Distraction. Distraction. True. Yeah. Because I found most of the things that

1123
01:45:55,690 --> 01:45:59,810
the majority and I'm talking about even alternative, which is still part of the majority.

1124
01:46:00,730 --> 01:46:06,310
When I say the majority of the mainstream, I'm including 99.9999% of the alternative also,

1125
01:46:06,850 --> 01:46:15,410
of course, right? Yeah. Essentially, what I suggest like recently, I saw someone I haven't seen in a

1126
01:46:15,410 --> 01:46:19,610
while. And they said, What are you doing? I said, I'm doing this thing called a Shelley in the

1127
01:46:19,610 --> 01:46:26,350
Greek. And it's basically an audio guidebook for anyone visiting Earth. Because if you're from

1128
01:46:26,350 --> 01:46:30,590
Earth, you won't understand anything I'm saying, and it won't make any sense to you. But if you're

1129
01:46:30,590 --> 01:46:34,830
not from Earth, you'll get a pretty good idea of what's going on here. I know what to watch out

1130
01:46:34,830 --> 01:46:41,870
for. And they're like, that's freaking cool. I like that. Yeah, well, you still often say,

1131
01:46:41,870 --> 01:46:48,190
look, I'm just here taking notes, which I thought was, was a great way to explain it. And just

1132
01:46:48,190 --> 01:46:54,090
there you go. Not really claiming, although you are here, you're, you're, you're among us,

1133
01:46:54,090 --> 01:46:58,850
you're not claiming to be another species or anything. Well, you're neutral. When you're

1134
01:46:58,850 --> 01:47:03,990
taking notes, if the situation is going bad, your interest is to just write it down, right?

1135
01:47:04,070 --> 01:47:09,270
If the situation not to take part of it. And if your situation is going the situation Jones going

1136
01:47:09,270 --> 01:47:15,990
good, you're just to take notes. Well, much like what a reporter or a journalist was supposed to

1137
01:47:15,990 --> 01:47:22,330
do, they were supposed to journal what was going on, not interject their opinion, not interject,

1138
01:47:22,610 --> 01:47:27,790
you know, a certain slant. It was a matter of journaling. In other words, just recording

1139
01:47:28,390 --> 01:47:33,190
what is happening. They were in turn supposed to relate that to other people. But still,

1140
01:47:33,190 --> 01:47:38,730
the idea was to journal it, not to influence the information, but just to,

1141
01:47:38,890 --> 01:47:44,790
again, take notes or censor it. Yeah. And unfortunately, I am embedded still here.

1142
01:47:46,810 --> 01:47:50,770
You know, there was an odd question that came up just really fast before we,

1143
01:47:51,050 --> 01:47:57,910
because I have this feeling we're about to come to an end here for this sonic 13. But there was

1144
01:47:57,910 --> 01:48:05,890
this odd question from somebody that I don't know if they're going to keep their subscription. But

1145
01:48:06,490 --> 01:48:12,950
they asked me something that about something you said elsewhere. And it just came to my mind,

1146
01:48:13,170 --> 01:48:16,770
for some odd reason here. Well, I know what the odd reason is, but nevermind.

1147
01:48:18,130 --> 01:48:22,210
They said that you had said something about being from another time.

1148
01:48:23,610 --> 01:48:34,910
Absolutely. Yeah. Now, another time. Do you mean that your ethical construct is out of place in

1149
01:48:34,910 --> 01:48:41,170
this time period? Or do you mean literally, from another time out of no ethical, moral, intellectual,

1150
01:48:41,710 --> 01:48:46,970
social, all of that? Okay. Well, I just in other words, the way it happens is I keep

1151
01:48:46,970 --> 01:48:54,610
explaining how it works. I think the concept of time, you know, everything that's happened

1152
01:48:55,530 --> 01:49:00,590
is happening still, but it's in fade, a very faded wave, like water hitting.

1153
01:49:01,350 --> 01:49:05,850
You see the surfers that try to catch the waves behind the freight ships, and they're like two

1154
01:49:05,850 --> 01:49:10,750
miles away, and they still catch the wave, right? And it gets smaller and smaller. And if something

1155
01:49:10,750 --> 01:49:17,850
to happen in the future, there has to be a primer or the possibility of it happening already set up.

1156
01:49:17,930 --> 01:49:23,190
Otherwise, it would not happen, right? In other words, the allowances, all of the physical,

1157
01:49:23,370 --> 01:49:29,090
spiritual, energetic allowances have to be there for it to happen, even if it's way down the future.

1158
01:49:29,990 --> 01:49:38,990
So, what I am doing here is I am in resonance, literally, just like CB radio's message to each

1159
01:49:38,990 --> 01:49:44,350
other, or walkie talkies, you know, you could have, you know, just like cell phones that work

1160
01:49:44,350 --> 01:49:49,150
on independent frequency, right? The SIM card, right? You can have 100 people in a neighborhood

1161
01:49:49,150 --> 01:49:54,150
will have walkie talkies, but only the ones that are tuned in, right? Only the ones that are tuned

1162
01:49:54,150 --> 01:49:59,850
into the same channel, actually hear what's happening on that channel. Yeah. Right. So I found

1163
01:49:59,850 --> 01:50:07,030
out a long time ago, that what I am interested in and what I am most effective in communicating

1164
01:50:07,030 --> 01:50:13,990
are things that are not of this time. Meaning time, meaning the way things, the events,

1165
01:50:14,530 --> 01:50:21,390
of these events. Now, what makes it even more absurd is the absurdity of it. Not what I am,

1166
01:50:21,510 --> 01:50:28,590
my position here is, but what I see going on around me. I see people wondering about things

1167
01:50:28,590 --> 01:50:34,970
that are already been referenced, right? And provable. People hoping for things that are

1168
01:50:34,970 --> 01:50:44,130
been shown don't exist and cannot exist, right? People asking about, or thinking things are a

1169
01:50:44,130 --> 01:50:50,190
certain way, when in their references, it's already shown that it's the opposite, right?

1170
01:50:50,370 --> 01:50:58,410
So you have a society that is living in this imaginary dream state, right? And that's why

1171
01:50:58,410 --> 01:51:02,950
things are the way they are. I mean, how easy would it be to take control of a million people

1172
01:51:02,950 --> 01:51:08,170
that are all asleep? You've heard that term, and I mean literally. If you went into a hospital

1173
01:51:08,170 --> 01:51:14,390
where they have all the beds open, or a military place, if you have, let's say, a hundred, a

1174
01:51:14,390 --> 01:51:18,370
thousand, a million people, and they're all in their bed, sound asleep, and you're walking around

1175
01:51:19,090 --> 01:51:25,130
through them, it's like, you feel like, what the hell's going on? I'm the only one here, right?

1176
01:51:25,450 --> 01:51:26,190
You see? Might as well be.

1177
01:51:26,190 --> 01:51:31,570
Because they're all asleep. Yeah, might as well be. And you have more control than they do,

1178
01:51:31,570 --> 01:51:37,170
because they're asleep. So in essence, I am definitely not from this time. Not at all.

1179
01:51:37,890 --> 01:51:45,590
Can't be. Just like the resonant and the frequency and all that, with two CB radios, two walkie

1180
01:51:45,590 --> 01:51:49,610
talkies, or two cell phones, right, on the tower, they click into the same frequency. No, I'm

1181
01:51:49,610 --> 01:51:55,670
definitely not from here. Can't be. That's from a rational thought. It cannot be shown directly,

1182
01:51:55,830 --> 01:52:01,010
but just like the poles in a magnet cannot be shown. You know, the magnets don't attract or

1183
01:52:01,010 --> 01:52:08,930
repel, right? It's like a screw. The top, one side of the magnet is clockwise, and it's clockwise

1184
01:52:08,930 --> 01:52:13,350
through the magnet, but if you flip it upside down, it looks counterclockwise, right? Or when

1185
01:52:13,350 --> 01:52:17,750
you have a right-hand screw, it has to go in a right-hand nut, a left-hand, and a left-hand

1186
01:52:17,750 --> 01:52:22,130
nut, right? Left-hand thread, right-hand thread, right? We can't see a lot of these things.

1187
01:52:23,090 --> 01:52:27,450
Yep. But it's a rational way that I used to express it. Absolutely.

1188
01:52:28,290 --> 01:52:35,870
Okay, fair enough. I thought that would be a great question, and I meant to get to it last

1189
01:52:35,870 --> 01:52:39,910
time we got together, and I forgot, actually, because we wound up on a different path.

1190
01:52:40,550 --> 01:52:47,570
Yeah, and time is events, right? So in other words, I am not from these events, and I've met

1191
01:52:47,570 --> 01:52:52,870
very few people in that sense. So time, from this time, would be events, right?

1192
01:52:52,870 --> 01:52:53,930
Mm-hmm.

1193
01:52:54,010 --> 01:53:01,750
Right? It just doesn't make any sense at all. So how can, if you see something, by the way,

1194
01:53:02,850 --> 01:53:07,210
that makes no sense at all, and it shouldn't make sense, but it's still continuing,

1195
01:53:07,310 --> 01:53:09,970
how can you be from there, right?

1196
01:53:10,410 --> 01:53:16,130
Well, in that case, I got to say that although I'm not seeing the same things you are,

1197
01:53:17,930 --> 01:53:23,990
I concur with you. I see things all the time that make absolutely no sense. I hear people speaking

1198
01:53:24,730 --> 01:53:28,850
where the language, I think I understand the language, but apparently I don't,

1199
01:53:29,030 --> 01:53:34,090
because it doesn't make sense what I'm hearing said. This is a constant for me.

1200
01:53:34,630 --> 01:53:39,810
Well, look, it goes beyond that, because if you ask, for example, someone who's religious,

1201
01:53:39,810 --> 01:53:45,350
it's a feeling they have from belief, right? I don't even, I don't understand,

1202
01:53:45,390 --> 01:53:48,130
I can't sympathize or empathize or feel that at all.

1203
01:53:48,170 --> 01:53:53,450
No, it's not about belief. It's just about what doesn't seem to make, it's just incongruous. Look,

1204
01:53:54,190 --> 01:54:01,010
if you tell me that there is an order, right? And I say, okay, look, I understand, let's count one,

1205
01:54:01,090 --> 01:54:05,450
two, three, four. And somebody says, look, one and three and five, they don't really matter.

1206
01:54:05,450 --> 01:54:10,450
Just use the even numbers. And this I'll go, okay, your system makes sense, you know,

1207
01:54:10,870 --> 01:54:15,690
because at least we can incrementally count by twos instead of one, two, three, four, right?

1208
01:54:16,090 --> 01:54:20,690
And I can say, all right, well, we can count by fives, whatever. I can look at that objectively

1209
01:54:20,690 --> 01:54:24,730
and say, well, this is a way of accounting and we can do it that way. And that's faster.

1210
01:54:25,310 --> 01:54:29,490
All right. I don't have to count one, two, three, four, five. You know what I mean?

1211
01:54:29,490 --> 01:54:36,610
That's okay. But when you have something where you say, look, you can go one and then six and

1212
01:54:36,610 --> 01:54:42,630
then two, and then I go, whoa, whoa, whoa. Well, that's actually sympathetic. And I

1213
01:54:42,630 --> 01:54:47,150
mean that in many levels. You have the word sympathetic that we use socially and culturally,

1214
01:54:47,570 --> 01:54:53,650
but then there's sympathetic and vibrations, right? That are harmonics that are formed.

1215
01:54:53,790 --> 01:54:57,810
And there are odd harmonics, but here's the thing with harmonics, they all have use.

1216
01:54:57,810 --> 01:55:02,430
Because if you understand odd harmonics enough, you could knock a wall down with sound, right?

1217
01:55:03,030 --> 01:55:09,550
Right. It's true, but there is always an order to it. Even when somebody explains something

1218
01:55:09,550 --> 01:55:15,290
odd like that, like, you know, the sonic weapons and things. I say, look, generally speaking,

1219
01:55:15,370 --> 01:55:19,130
most of my experiences don't line up with this, but that's not what it's about. It's not about

1220
01:55:19,130 --> 01:55:26,050
my recognition. It's about, at least you can provide me with an objective sort of sense of

1221
01:55:26,050 --> 01:55:31,370
how the order goes with things, right? Well, that's why it's beyond rationale,

1222
01:55:31,770 --> 01:55:36,830
Chuck. It's beyond what you're saying. Like if you ask someone how many cats are in the room

1223
01:55:36,830 --> 01:55:41,130
and there's three cats and they count three cats, or maybe they don't know how to count,

1224
01:55:41,230 --> 01:55:47,430
but if they insist that there are only two or one, is that what you mean? Like there's a problem

1225
01:55:47,430 --> 01:55:53,970
there? Yeah. I look at it and I go, well, how do you not see that this is happening? Look,

1226
01:55:53,970 --> 01:55:57,330
even if you and I don't understand it the same way, how do you not see that something is

1227
01:55:57,330 --> 01:56:02,910
happening? I'm telling you that it's almost like somebody sets off firecrackers in your living

1228
01:56:02,910 --> 01:56:08,050
room. You're in your kitchen, okay? And look, I didn't see it happen, but I know something

1229
01:56:08,050 --> 01:56:12,530
happened in that other room because I heard a noise. Something is observable here. We should

1230
01:56:12,530 --> 01:56:17,250
have all heard it if we all were able to hear. Okay? And you go to that room and they say,

1231
01:56:17,350 --> 01:56:23,330
no, nothing happened. No, no, I get you. Well, there's a lot of sayings about that,

1232
01:56:23,330 --> 01:56:29,970
the 800 pound gorilla in the room and all that too, right? But what I'm saying is it's very deep.

1233
01:56:30,910 --> 01:56:35,190
If you read, for example, there's stuff in what they call the biblical texts and there's stuff

1234
01:56:35,190 --> 01:56:41,850
that Socrates and other people wrote that I used to take out and show as a quote to someone. And

1235
01:56:41,850 --> 01:56:47,670
I would say, when was this written about society? And they said, oh, this sounds like what's going

1236
01:56:47,670 --> 01:56:54,070
on right now, meaning past month or two weeks. I'm like, no, this was written 2,500 years ago,

1237
01:56:54,310 --> 01:56:59,290
or this is from the book of Numbers, or this is from Psalms, or this is from Socrates,

1238
01:56:59,850 --> 01:57:04,130
right? And I'm like, wow, how can it be so accurate about what's going on right now?

1239
01:57:05,530 --> 01:57:11,130
Right? Because what it's doing is it's not shining a lot. This is a mistake people make.

1240
01:57:12,030 --> 01:57:15,450
It's not about, you know, they say we've got to shine a light on it, put it, take it out of the

1241
01:57:15,450 --> 01:57:22,730
dark, put light on it. No, that doesn't necessarily do it. Right? Putting something in the light

1242
01:57:22,730 --> 01:57:28,290
doesn't, I mean, they have cookers that work with light. It doesn't do it. There's an underlying

1243
01:57:28,290 --> 01:57:34,170
substrate. Although we did learn earlier that a particular type of light can be advantageous,

1244
01:57:34,170 --> 01:57:38,790
depending on the effect that you wish to create, right? Yeah, it can. But that's, again,

1245
01:57:38,870 --> 01:57:43,730
it's sympathetic. If the light has to be incandescent, it has to have a very pure color filter

1246
01:57:43,730 --> 01:57:48,870
also. By the way, we'll just recap that Dinshaw-Gaudi-Aldi chromotherapy,

1247
01:57:50,170 --> 01:57:54,810
there's other people doing it, but the thing is, you don't have to get complicated about it.

1248
01:57:54,970 --> 01:57:59,050
Theatrical gels work, and you have to have a very strong incandescent bulb. Incandescence is

1249
01:57:59,050 --> 01:58:04,190
important. But what I'm saying is that there is a very, very deep, call it spiritual, it's a

1250
01:58:04,190 --> 01:58:10,070
non-material thing, like magnetism is non-material. It's the quality of a thing, right? If you look

1251
01:58:10,070 --> 01:58:13,790
at a hunk of iron, that's just a hunk of iron, and a hunk of iron that's magnetized, they're

1252
01:58:13,790 --> 01:58:19,230
exactly the same, except one is magnetic, the other one's not. That's not a material difference

1253
01:58:19,230 --> 01:58:25,810
or something. It's immeasurable from a material sense. It's energetic. It's a quality. One has a

1254
01:58:25,810 --> 01:58:28,950
magnetic quality, the other one doesn't. Same exact piece of iron, right? Right.

1255
01:58:29,590 --> 01:58:38,110
It's the same thing. There's a level where I'm telling people on the emo stuff, especially,

1256
01:58:38,110 --> 01:58:44,770
very important, that this time concept of events is all connected, all the way through,

1257
01:58:45,570 --> 01:58:52,270
backwards and forwards, just like the example of when you're in a bad situation and you hear a

1258
01:58:52,270 --> 01:58:56,490
little voice say, is it going to be okay? That's you recalling, I'm suggesting, that is you

1259
01:58:56,490 --> 01:59:02,490
recalling the event. If you don't hear that little voice, it's probably the last time you're going to

1260
01:59:02,490 --> 01:59:08,830
have a bad event or any event, or you forgot that event. You didn't recall it. It doesn't mean

1261
01:59:09,370 --> 01:59:12,750
that it's the end when you don't hear that little voice saying everything's going to be okay,

1262
01:59:12,790 --> 01:59:16,810
if it's a really bad, you're in a tight spot. It just means that you won't recall it. It'll

1263
01:59:16,810 --> 01:59:22,130
be forgotten. This is an explanation, again, just another thing on the list. Consider this,

1264
01:59:22,210 --> 01:59:27,350
because that gives you, okay, some people will say to me about that, great, that's really

1265
01:59:27,350 --> 01:59:31,950
introspective. I like the ways, yeah, okay, so you like that analogy that I gave, because it still

1266
01:59:31,950 --> 01:59:35,470
leaves you two possible things. One is, it's the last time you're going to be in a tight spot.

1267
01:59:35,750 --> 01:59:40,430
It means that you're done, or you're going to forget it. Okay, so let's take that and go to

1268
01:59:40,430 --> 01:59:45,670
the next level with how we operate in time with our consciousness, backward and forward, you see?

1269
01:59:46,330 --> 01:59:49,030
That's what I'm talking about. I'm not from this time, for sure.

1270
01:59:49,830 --> 01:59:54,090
I don't think many of the people listening and continue to listen to this

1271
01:59:54,090 --> 01:59:57,050
and enjoy it and actually use it are either.
