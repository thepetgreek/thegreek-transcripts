1
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,040
130 Sonic Event rated Y, Ocelli in the Greek.

2
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,420
So why not?

3
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,800
Yes, here we are.

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,660
Should we start with the emails, Greek?

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,120
Yeah, go for it.

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:19,380
Yes.

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,960
Somebody new or something.

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:21,560
Yeah.

9
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,420
A brand new.

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,080
Now, this is unusual because most Greek speak people, you know, tell me they've been listening

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,500
for years or they used to listen.

12
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,160
Then they came back around, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

13
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,460
Everybody likes to tell me that.

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,280
Also quick shout out to somebody who actually, you know, sent me a friendly message recently.

15
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,480
It was a long time Greek speak listener and had not reached out to me until recently.

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,700
Thank you for that.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,600
But a brand new one who said that they were just recommended by somebody and they said

18
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,400
that they found a couple of things that the person said to be fascinating, but didn't

19
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,260
make entirely enough sense for them to follow.

20
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,040
So they wanted to find out what was going on.

21
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,960
It means they heard it right.

22
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:58,740
Yeah.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,380
So because it didn't make sense in the world around them.

24
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:06,600
So they came to us and said, look, I'm just catching up and maybe you guys have already

25
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,760
covered these two interesting things.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,380
But curious, based on the Greeks presentation of the laws, morality, things like that, I

27
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,880
was wondering what his views were on the use of drugs.

28
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,380
You know, does the Greek have a position on that?

29
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,140
Because I'm told by my friend who has listened for a long time that he doesn't recall if

30
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:34,720
the Greek has ever addressed drugs in his discussion and don't know why that is.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,340
Secondly, he wanted to know if you had anything to say about the pyramids, which he finds

32
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:45,820
quite fascinating, the Egyptian pyramids and also the Aztec and all those all of the pyramids

33
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,980
that people talk about.

34
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:51,160
He finds them fascinating and wonders if you have any views on those as well.

35
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,720
But he also said he might have missed some stuff because he's just catching up to Rated

36
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,380
Y, just being told about the old archives.

37
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,880
And he's got a lot to catch up on.

38
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,160
But he was curious about those things right away.

39
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,040
All right.

40
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,600
Well, make sure you keep an outline because there's some things there.

41
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,380
So you mentioned the drug thing, right?

42
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:10,840
Yeah.

43
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,340
Morality and drugs.

44
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,440
How does that fit in?

45
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,540
Well, they're different.

46
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:22,100
Morality is what if you think of it this way, and it's very hard to answer anything regarding

47
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,640
morality simply because what if you were raised in a society of cannibals, which do exist

48
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,800
still in the African continent, Asia Pacific Rim?

49
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,880
Well, going with the general Western society, right, there's a pill for everything.

50
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,700
And so there's drugs for everything.

51
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,360
Yes or no.

52
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:39,860
That's right.

53
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,280
Well, the drug thing.

54
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,780
I got to I got to go to Rick James for that.

55
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,220
And here, I could take this.

56
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:46,980
Okay.

57
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,020
Absolutely.

58
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,820
That's all I can say about that.

59
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,500
And if you're going to do anything else, why bother?

60
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,480
Right.

61
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,880
But here's the thing.

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,260
Drugs have always been used.

63
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,220
The whole thing.

64
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,660
Drugs.

65
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:04,880
Okay.

66
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:05,380
The.

67
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,500
How do you say this?

68
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:13,620
From a biblical way, in all ancient languages, drugs are the word for drugs is poison.

69
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,700
Like pharmakia.

70
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,520
Pharmacy means poison.

71
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:16,820
Right.

72
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,660
On and on and on.

73
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:23,300
So when you extract something from its natural state, refine it, especially make it commercial

74
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,920
for purposes, which degrades it, you know, like eating out is never going to be as eating

75
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,820
as good as eating at home unless you're white.

76
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,020
But that's different.

77
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,900
But by the way, I just got to say this.

78
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,940
I feel sorry for these little white children come from white families.

79
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,580
They always look forward to eat out.

80
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,440
And I don't ask why, because, you know, mom can't cook.

81
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:40,640
Right.

82
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,560
And it shouldn't be that way.

83
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,780
But it just is.

84
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,420
It's very sad.

85
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,900
So making these things commercially viable degrades them.

86
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,920
There's a certain group of people, a class system of drug users, right?

87
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,120
The recreational, the hardcore, the addicts, then the ones that die of it.

88
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:58,360
Right.

89
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:58,840
So this.

90
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,480
So when you say drugs, it's a subculture.

91
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,120
Right.

92
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:07,740
You can you can go down that route or you could go down the actual physical mental aspect

93
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,260
of it.

94
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:15,980
And I would say that even LSD or any drug you could take, even heroin is 50 percent

95
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,079
mental. There is the idea you've seen in movies where they shoot someone with a tranquil

96
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,740
gun, tranquilizer and they fall out.

97
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,320
Yeah. And they don't want to fall out, but they still do.

98
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,520
Right. Right.

99
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,480
Well, actually, there are some people that you could shoot them with a tranquilizer and

100
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,380
they won't go down, just like there's some, you know, the fentanyl crisis, you know, as

101
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,060
it feels like what, 20, 30, 40 times stronger than heroin.

102
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:42,160
Right. So there are a couple of people I've heard of that can pop them, pop as many as

103
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,920
they want. It has almost no effect on them.

104
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,220
Right. And so there's that aspect.

105
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,160
But I would, as a general rule of thumb, avoid it.

106
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,880
Like give you an example from my personal experience is years ago, back in the 90s,

107
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:02,880
before I'd wake up and I was doing a restoration of plaster, wood and stone and like

108
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,160
all the mansions and theaters, you know, bringing back stuff that looked like 100 years

109
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,340
ago, no one knew how to do that.

110
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,560
And it was kind of trippy to do that kind of work, you know, casting plaster, gold

111
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,600
gilding and stone carving and all that to restore stuff.

112
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:21,500
But I had gotten to the point where to make it more interesting, I had a really good

113
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,340
connection for weed and whatever you want to call it, cannabis, whatever.

114
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,980
And when I would wake up in the morning before my feet touched the floor, I already took

115
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,300
three puffs off or something.

116
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,980
Right. And my whole day was being high.

117
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:39,400
So I stopped that and I recognize that it does have a negative effect if you do that

118
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,420
much. But the other thing now, I haven't touched this stuff in maybe 15 years, 20.

119
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,860
And the last time I did, I was like, oh, I don't like this high stuff.

120
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,040
I'd rather I'm more I'm having more of a good time being sober.

121
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,940
Right. So that OK, where's the morality in that?

122
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,740
You know, some people are not having a good time and they want to they want to take

123
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,260
something. And when they take that something, they feel better.

124
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,860
Right. For me, it's the opposite.

125
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,780
When I take that something, I'm like, oh, what the hell did I do that for?

126
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,880
Right. There's no one size fits all.

127
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,380
Look, I could tell you that, you know, no less.

128
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,700
Sorry. That's the morality aspect of it.

129
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,660
Right. What's right. Morality, by the way, is what society accepts.

130
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,620
Right. Well, there's ethics that mixes in with it.

131
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,600
So. Well, this is true.

132
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:30,200
But I'll give you a mixed morality situation right where I go to back in the day when I

133
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:35,060
did still go to the doctor, you know, I go to a doctor because I'm having chronic

134
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,900
pain in my back. And it's because I had broken some bones in the past and it was

135
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,900
hurting. Right. So they gave me something.

136
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,740
So it wouldn't hurt. I felt pretty good.

137
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:50,120
Not only did I feel good, you know, physically, but mentally I felt better and did

138
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,240
not realize really as stupid as this sounds, didn't realize that eventually I was hooked

139
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,520
on the pills, you know, painkillers.

140
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,680
Now, there's a big difference between just drying something and smoking it that comes

141
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,500
out of the ground and taking the pharmacia of the day, which was common at that point.

142
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,880
Right. I started taking that stuff.

143
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,360
Here's the thing. When they refine it, it has more.

144
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,420
It's more. Right. Yeah, definitely.

145
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,920
So that that. All right.

146
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,320
Remember, we discussed brain tumors a while back.

147
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:21,660
That's the most lean condition you can have because it goes to the most young part of

148
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,900
the body. So that means it's the most lean.

149
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,740
So guess what?

150
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,420
The more refined and processed, whatever you want to call it, away from its natural

151
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,680
state, it is the more it's going to go to the brain.

152
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,800
That's a very easy thing to surmise.

153
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,660
Right. And they tell you that it targets the receptors better.

154
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,920
It actually, you know, even if without that science side, if you understand the mean and

155
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,540
young, the more refined it is away from its natural state, the more lean it is.

156
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,100
And guess what? Part of the body.

157
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,520
Right. Right.

158
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,280
So if it's something that's extremely young.

159
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:59,160
Right, like a mineral or a dried meat product, it's going to go boom right down to

160
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,480
the most young part of the body, which is the feet, the ankles and all that.

161
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,320
Right. Right. OK, so.

162
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,880
Yeah. OK. That's why you'll see a lot of Americans with poor diets when they wear

163
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,520
shorts. They have swollen ankles as very reddish rash around it.

164
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,340
Oh, yeah. That's from really bad meat products and bad salt.

165
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,240
Because you got to have iodized salt, by the way.

166
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,660
Whatever this is, a tangent might sound like it.

167
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,260
Fluoride, fluoride, fluoride or iodine.

168
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,120
No one in order to put fluoride into it wouldn't work.

169
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,400
You can't put fluoride toothpaste.

170
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,700
You can't put iodine in salt.

171
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,059
You can't. It's always in a compound form.

172
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:39,080
So if you're making sodas, let's say carbonated beverages.

173
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:44,340
Right. OK. We can put carbon dioxide or we can put carbon monoxide in it.

174
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47,580
Now, if you drink the one with carbon monoxide, you'll still be OK.

175
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,960
But it's toxic. It's known to be a toxin.

176
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,280
Right. Right. Now, with fluoride, it's sodium fluoride

177
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,800
or calcium fluoride.

178
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,700
Now, calcium fluoride you'll find in tissue in the body.

179
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,280
But sodium fluoride is a toxin, just like carbon monoxide.

180
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,980
And that's what they deliberately put in toothpaste.

181
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,040
So when someone says a fluoride or not, the calcium isn't right.

182
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,960
Is that carbonated with what dioxide or monoxide?

183
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:21,260
So defining definitions, understanding how ridiculously stupid

184
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:25,640
this society is and the pitfalls of taking a broad brush.

185
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,440
For example, the fluoride thing, if you don't specify

186
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:36,620
what kind of fluoride compound, it's either fluoride in general is good or bad.

187
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,440
And yet enough people believe it's good, even though it's overtly a poison.

188
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,500
They'll think it's good, you see, because they're not defining it.

189
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:44,740
How simple?

190
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,100
You know, there's many people that say I'm a believer in fluoride.

191
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,060
I said, yes, all mine.

192
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,500
I mean, I don't have an idol of fluoride to worship,

193
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,400
but it's not elemental fluoride.

194
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,160
It's it's not and it's not calcium fluoride.

195
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,880
And they're like, well, what is it?

196
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,380
I mean, it's sodium fluoride, which is a toxin.

197
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,960
I give the carbonated beverage analogy with the monoxide and dioxide.

198
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,040
Then they rethink it instead of getting in someone's face and arguing about it.

199
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,920
See, if I meet you and you want to talk to me, right, you're you're an idiot.

200
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,380
Until I'm like Napoleonic law, you're guilty until proven innocent.

201
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,020
Napoleonic law. Right, right.

202
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,020
In other words, you wouldn't be in court. Right.

203
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,700
Why would they bring an innocent person here?

204
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,760
So you're an idiot and a complete moron unless you prove otherwise.

205
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,680
So when I'm around doing my day, waving hello, whatever people I don't know.

206
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,380
That's why I'll just say casually, hey, you know, if you ask me, like,

207
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,080
when I was, you know, anybody, I met three morons today.

208
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,320
I didn't know they're morons.

209
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,860
I didn't speak to them or anything.

210
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,800
But to say that they're not morons is actually a very bad bet.

211
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,520
So even though I didn't really speak to these three people that I met to call

212
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,040
the morons and then show me to go back and investigate,

213
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,040
they'll probably prove to be very quickly.

214
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,640
You see. Right. So there's it's easy to have stereotypes. Right.

215
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,360
But I go beyond stereotype.

216
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,480
It's like you're all fucking idiots until you prove otherwise.

217
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,620
And now what are my chances of being let down?

218
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,660
Like slim than not minimal.

219
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,800
You're typecasting instead of stereotyping.

220
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,940
Yeah. So it's like everyone's an idiot.

221
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,140
You know, someone said, well, he said something upsetting.

222
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,380
Yeah, he's a fucking moron. Right.

223
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,000
Why would you like why would you?

224
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,400
You know. So, yeah.

225
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:21,260
So this is my moral code that I have within my society of one, let's say.

226
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,700
Right. So you see, morality is based on what society you're in. Right.

227
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,920
So so I would just say from a long

228
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,500
shot to even a focal short shot on drugs. Yeah.

229
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,400
Uh, if if it can help you, like pain relief, if you're in pain,

230
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,400
you know, if to wake you up, if you're sleepy, to put you to sleep,

231
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,460
if you're awake by necessity, you know, all these things out of necessity.

232
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,440
Absolutely. Use it. It's a tool. Right.

233
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,200
So if it's being used as a tool to have a positive effect,

234
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,640
then you don't believe that.

235
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,420
In other words, if you have a plan and you can't carry through,

236
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,640
carry out that plan and you can take a drug that will help you do it, do it.

237
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,620
But not recreationally. No.

238
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:08,160
OK, so in other words, the trucker who takes speed to stay awake

239
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,380
so he doesn't crash his truck, you don't object to that.

240
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,900
No, not at all. As long as he knows what's going on.

241
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,840
If you take enough of it, it won't work as well.

242
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,540
Right. Because your body will start compensating.

243
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,840
It's not that you get used to the drugs.

244
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,540
Your body compensates, adds more of the other stuff,

245
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,520
and then you'll have physical degradation, eyesight and all this other stuff.

246
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:31,820
And if you're if you're getting high on no dose as a trucker,

247
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:37,040
the chances of you falling asleep or eventually if you do it a lot is actually

248
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,540
while you're driving is actually higher than those who never did it.

249
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,140
Believe it or not.

250
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,160
So so it's also the way it's used as well.

251
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,940
So I mean, that's the repercussions like meth.

252
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,020
It's nothing wrong with.

253
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,140
I went to his party once and this guy had some grayish beige

254
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,560
looking crystals in a bag.

255
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,140
So a very wealthy household.

256
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,980
I'm like, what the hell is that crack?

257
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:57,580
He says no.

258
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,440
And he goes up to the bathroom vanity light, you know,

259
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,960
where they have those big light bulbs, the vanity glow bulbs.

260
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:03,880
Right. Yeah, right.

261
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,760
Takes the bulb off and he breaks the the end off where the filament

262
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,200
and the screw in part is.

263
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,040
And he puts the crystals in the now we have this globe. Right. Right.

264
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,000
He puts the crystals in there and lights it.

265
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,720
And he says, take a puff of that, you know, and he's passing it around.

266
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,360
I'm like, holy shit.

267
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,880
So he says he's eating up the glass.

268
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,300
He's eating up the glass from the bulb in order to sort of.

269
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:27,000
Yeah. And you get this dark greenish yellow smoke.

270
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,500
And you take a hit of that.

271
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,180
It's kind of like crack, believe it or not.

272
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,120
Very much like crack.

273
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,600
It even smells like crack.

274
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,820
Well, not really. But so this is I've seen stuff like that.

275
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,240
No, it definitely smells different than crack.

276
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,620
Yeah, I mean, I mean, you'll be high for like you.

277
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,080
You won't sleep for two days or three days when you're on that.

278
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,440
Well, I manufactured crack before and crack is a very short term thing.

279
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,560
It doesn't last very long.

280
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,480
Oh, no. Yeah, that's right.

281
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,740
What gets people hooked when you first do crack?

282
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,320
It's like, oh, it's actually even better than heroin,

283
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,020
believe it or not, on the first shot.

284
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,240
And all you he's like, this is the best high.

285
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,800
Let's get some more and get some more.

286
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,640
And it's not like the first time you're always searching for that first time.

287
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:04,920
You'll never.

288
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,960
And then what happens is you get a headache and you start blaming.

289
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,340
Well, it was a we got a bum source wasn't a good source.

290
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,460
No, no. That's what happens.

291
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,120
You get one good high on crack and that's it.

292
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,240
It's like a virgin drug.

293
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,060
You know, you lose you can only lose your virginity once. Right.

294
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,680
That's true. We used to call chasing the dragon, actually.

295
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,680
Yeah. And after you smoke enough of it, you think you want some more.

296
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,320
And you think you drop some and you're looking on the ground.

297
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,080
Maybe you dropped one. It's called ghost busting. Oh, yeah.

298
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,880
Right. It's like, oh, you could always tell looking at the ground,

299
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,380
picking up things. I know we have more.

300
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,040
That's it's a spirit behind.

301
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,660
There's a spirit behind all this stuff.

302
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,220
But these spirits are indifferent to us.

303
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,920
Well, see, that's one thing I got a hold of you.

304
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,300
Yeah, I was going to ask you that.

305
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,060
I was going to try to let you finish through this entire rant.

306
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,500
But I got to ask you, because it does seem to me as though.

307
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,980
And I got to tell you, I object that there's nothing wrong with meth

308
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:56,600
because the spiritual entity that seems to be involved with meth

309
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,020
is really insidious.

310
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,140
I mean, more insidious than cocaine, more insidious than heroin.

311
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:06,180
Actually, the heroin entity seems to be benevolent to me.

312
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,920
So does the cannabis.

313
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,700
Well, the opiate, the opium, mostly

314
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,220
the heroin, remember, was done by created by Bayer.

315
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,620
It was more refined, right?

316
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,000
Yeah. No, it was processed with dry cleaning material.

317
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:22,960
It was a refinement to get people off of off of what was the thing before it.

318
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,560
Like methadone is to get people off of heroin.

319
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,160
Yeah, it was a synthetic. Right.

320
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,200
It was the synthetic to get people off of the thing.

321
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,740
It was partly synthetic. Yeah.

322
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,580
But the opium was initially.

323
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,360
And, you know, that's a painkiller, right?

324
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,480
Very effective.

325
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,860
And so places that opium to morphine, morphine.

326
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,980
Yeah. And the heroin was to get heroin was literally created

327
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,320
like and like a thing to get you off of morphine.

328
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,860
That was the truth of it, because there was a lot of morphine addicts.

329
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,440
Everybody was high on morphine in the 1800s.

330
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:57,540
If you were, quote unquote, middle class, blue collar or whatever, you got morphine.

331
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,200
That's what that was the drug to get.

332
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,500
Well, you had some around.

333
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,680
And also they did. There were studies done.

334
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,040
Even women used to get what he called morphine, basically

335
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,520
morphine and opium in liquid form for menstrual cramps.

336
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,660
That's a true story.

337
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,280
And suppositories. Yeah. Yeah.

338
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,700
That's the. Yeah.

339
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:19,280
So they did a study, though, that medical services, places that had,

340
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,620
you know, trauma, medical and whatever, that kind of stuff.

341
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,000
They noticed that where morphine was available,

342
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,760
there were fewer fatalities for the obvious reason.

343
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,980
Right. You know, not going into shock. Right.

344
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,260
Well, less stress and less shock from the pain.

345
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,000
Right. Well, if anyone that works in trauma,

346
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,140
the first thing they do, if you're conscious and you're not,

347
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,360
I mean, you want to morphine, they ask you that, you know,

348
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,240
they'll put a bag, drip bag with it or whatever.

349
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,560
However, I'll sit in the street.

350
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,240
It's very popular in hospitals today.

351
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,520
If they ask you, are you in a lot of pain?

352
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,820
If you say, well, maybe this is it.

353
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,520
Well, you know, you're what we've got.

354
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,180
You classify it as you can get.

355
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,360
And we can give you a shot of morphine if you want it. Right.

356
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,520
And any times I was on the phone once with someone,

357
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,540
this nurse says, well, give me a shot more.

358
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,940
I said, take it. Take it. Yeah. Take it. Take it.

359
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,800
And so have someone sneak in a cocktail with you to like a beer or pina colada.

360
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,540
Because that enhances the effect.

361
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:10,900
Oh, my gosh. Yeah. And it's like tripping.

362
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,880
You'll trip for a few minutes and when it first hits you.

363
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,800
But a little extra. This is a good.

364
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,920
This is all part of the experience.

365
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:20,819
I think that the drugs take off some of the filtering effect

366
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:25,380
that we have, you know, normally, you know, the common senses. Right.

367
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,660
So but morality is where you come from. Right.

368
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,260
Like, for example, people don't know this today.

369
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,600
But if you get cut, maybe not.

370
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,440
But I know 20 years ago, if you were caught with any amount

371
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,000
of what they call cannabis or marijuana in Malaysia, it was the death penalty.

372
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,480
Right. Right. Right.

373
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,700
So, I mean, think about that for a minute.

374
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,040
And they were still doing it a couple of years ago in the Philippines.

375
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,260
There was a guy that rather famously was was executing drug traffickers. Right.

376
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,300
Well, I'm not talking drug traffickers.

377
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,780
We're talking about you in your luggage, you know?

378
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,120
Oh, no. That's what they were saying they were.

379
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,780
But it was somebody who had a bag of dope.

380
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,340
Basically, you were caught with it.

381
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,720
You were a trafficker. Done.

382
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,560
Oh, yeah. Well, they could tell.

383
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,940
Their morality there is that you're going to we don't mess with that

384
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,720
because, you know, you'll right.

385
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,140
Suffer capital punishment.

386
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,940
But you'll suffer a capital punishment because you're messing with their capital.

387
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,020
I mean, they're the only ones allowed.

388
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,980
Oh, yeah. What's the golden triangle? Right.

389
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,040
Well, or thereabouts. Yes.

390
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,360
I think there are more people living in the Muslims in Malaysia

391
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,480
and Philippines and one other place than there are all of all of Middle East.

392
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,020
I think so. I think Malaysia.

393
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,880
Yeah. Yeah. And people think all the Muslims are in the Middle East.

394
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:36,100
They're not. It's like two to one, twice as many Muslims in Asia

395
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,220
than there are in East Asia.

396
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:40,320
Yeah. Malaysia and Morocco is another place, too,

397
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,220
where there's a lot anyway.

398
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,780
Well, I'm talking about that end of the world.

399
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,500
You Morocco, most people would still consider to be Middle East

400
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,220
or, you know, Arabian sort of a real northern Africa.

401
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,740
OK, but more Muslims live in the Pacific Rim.

402
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,680
Yeah. Than anywhere else. Yeah.

403
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,640
So, OK, what was the other question?

404
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,700
Well, let's see the other question.

405
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,140
Besides, oh, the pyramids. Right.

406
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,440
Yeah. You want to know if you had any thoughts about that?

407
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,880
Yeah. What I do know about the pyramids is from people that have been there.

408
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,120
I've never taken an interest in them

409
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,340
because it's just a big pile of stones and we don't have any history for it.

410
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,860
So first, and I have met some people, interestingly,

411
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,320
that came over here in 2003 that visited the pyramids with some.

412
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,960
We're not going to give any names like Ivy West or Jordan Maxwell,

413
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,240
but they had visited the pyramid and they had

414
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,560
saw what they call ground penetrating radar.

415
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:35,840
There's an entire city below the pyramids that was being drained

416
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,360
and they've been draining it for a very long time.

417
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,360
And then many years later, 2010, there was a site report that the government's

418
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,840
been draining this place for 10 years to go under there.

419
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,460
And I think it was spoken of

420
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,440
by ancient Greek people.

421
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:52,820
But I would I would direct, you know, archaics for the pyramid.

422
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,140
His stuff is seems to be pretty tight on that.

423
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,720
Yeah. And the archaics, though, just this year's on the pyramid.

424
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,120
Yeah. Though Jordan visited the pyramids, he didn't actually talk about it too much.

425
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,780
It was on his manager.

426
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,600
Well, I just mentioned I wasn't going to mention

427
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,680
his manager was the person I mentioned.

428
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:13,620
She stayed here in the house in Tucson until until they parted company,

429
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,200
because, you know, but anyway, yeah, no, I know about that.

430
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,680
And then I was one of the people that came in after they parted company

431
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,180
that was, you know, got more friendly with them after that.

432
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:26,720
But anyway, so but all right.

433
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,640
So pyramids, not much to say about it.

434
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,700
It's not that big a deal.

435
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,480
So you don't see a spiritual aspect to that.

436
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,200
Yeah, there is. It's a few.

437
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:39,440
Again, if you go back to what he says about it, it's a major deal.

438
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,160
It's probably one of the most important structures on the planet.

439
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,860
OK, but the great the great pyramid.

440
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,560
But you would defer to him then.

441
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,400
Oh, absolutely. I know all that. Why bother?

442
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,460
Fair enough. Yeah, I'm not even going to get into it.

443
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,400
I would I give it.

444
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:55,540
I don't endorse him, but he gets a seal of approval on his pyramid research.

445
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,120
OK, so his pyramids and his chronological history, he's compiled everything

446
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,560
that was sensibly and rationally compiled from before.

447
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,360
You know, from decades and centuries.

448
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,800
And he's put it together to show, hey, not only is it

449
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,140
rational and legitimate to say this, this and that about the pyramid,

450
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,220
but it also ties in with what he's talking about, which is the phoenix.

451
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,000
So he gets a seal of approval on the pyramid subject.

452
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,600
Well, you know, it's super rare for anybody actually to do any original work

453
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,660
of their own. At best, people have collected other people's work

454
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:29,180
that is of useful, you know, abuse.

455
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,680
That's the truth of it anymore.

456
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,480
I don't see people doing original work at best.

457
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,900
They collect, you know, the stuff that doesn't need to be discarded.

458
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,540
And they collect it together and present it to you again.

459
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:44,540
Well, you can get a notion and then put it together in original form.

460
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,040
And he's done that with the pyramid.

461
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,500
No one else has discussed it the way it was like.

462
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,880
I know you won't find biological vacuum at anywhere.

463
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:55,220
Right. And the full moon is the first day of the month.

464
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,400
And the day starts at noon.

465
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,560
You use those together and you get a 30 day a month.

466
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,920
You get a 30 day lunar.

467
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,840
Anyway, there are some things

468
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,560
that are extremely original to what we're doing here.

469
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,960
Well, there is one, by the way, by others also.

470
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,180
But generally, the no topic is original.

471
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,840
Now, the topic itself on everything is.

472
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,940
Right now, I've only ever heard one other person talk about solar noon

473
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,040
being the beginning of the day.

474
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,840
One other person.

475
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,920
He's got a weird accent and I have no idea how to get ahold of him.

476
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,880
He's got like a YouTube channel. Yeah.

477
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,080
OK, well, there's solar.

478
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,540
And it was academia acknowledges it to be solar.

479
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,020
And I think you might have run into that right when I say, go look it up.

480
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,400
Oh, yeah. And yeah.

481
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:38,860
And we know from being children of the 60s, 70s or whatever,

482
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,620
you know, you get a check in the mail when you're really young or whatever.

483
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,360
You go, right. Counted as the next day.

484
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,680
So I mean, it goes on and on and on.

485
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,980
So, yeah, no, that was the proof of it is that if you showed up at the bank

486
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:52,760
after lunch, it was the next day, even though they didn't change.

487
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,440
They would change their calendar.

488
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,020
The rest of the world didn't yet,

489
00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:00,460
which I always found funny is like, you know, if today was the first

490
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:05,640
and you show up there at noon everywhere else except at the bank, it's the first.

491
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,820
Yeah, they didn't number it as a second, but they just say it's tomorrow.

492
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,760
So even though it's the first, that was yesterday to them.

493
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,300
Yeah. Yeah.

494
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,360
Because it's an old convention.

495
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,940
But now with the electronic convention, paperwork reduction acts and all that.

496
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:22,000
Right. But it still holds true on many other aspects of culture.

497
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,960
That reminds me, it's true with agriculture as well.

498
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,340
Yeah, there was a couple of things in chat, actually,

499
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,180
that you just triggered a thought of somebody asked about something else

500
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,120
because it goes along with the.

501
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,060
Oh, yeah. With the last time.

502
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,680
Yeah. Is this is this all on this email?

503
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,320
Yeah, it's the. OK, yeah, I see.

504
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,900
There's one that you remember when I was explaining the shake,

505
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,940
you got through the shake.

506
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,980
Thanks to all the interruptions, Chuck.

507
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,320
Thanks a lot. But no, I'm just.

508
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:53,180
Yeah, it's usually when I give something new, it's something new.

509
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:57,540
And I think that I'm not griping about it.

510
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,700
But when I was describing that shake, I was just expecting to be three minutes,

511
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,760
but it turned into 20.

512
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,040
Well, I wanted to make sure I understood exactly what you're saying.

513
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,820
Well, you can go back and re-listen to it.

514
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,380
Yeah. Yeah. So when I have a discussion,

515
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,960
this is what we're like behind the scenes, folks.

516
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:15,540
Yeah. If I'm going to bring up something new, I'll just tell you, sit back.

517
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,660
Give me two minutes.

518
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,420
And and and and you know what?

519
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,240
Because all this is recorded, there's no Q&A, right?

520
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,880
Yeah. There's no Q&A.

521
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,440
So very often I'll bring it.

522
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,940
I mean, I've got a bunch of stuff, more stuff with food that's very original.

523
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,860
And of course, when they start the subject,

524
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,100
you know, first thing in your mind is, yeah, I know what that is.

525
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:34,880
But no, you don't.

526
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,600
You don't know what this is because, you know, I've actually

527
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,220
it's just like with their cakes, with the pyramids.

528
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,300
If I'm going to bring up, try something, go look at this recipe.

529
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:43,920
Yeah, it's out there.

530
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,140
But when I start to get into a process with food, it's

531
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,500
because it's totally original to what I'm doing.

532
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,480
But so that was another thing that would be.

533
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,600
You remember Mr. Rogers?

534
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,260
He comes in and he changes his sweater, puts his different shoes on.

535
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,800
I remember. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

536
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,840
Well, we could. I was thinking the other day,

537
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,800
every time we start a sonic, start out with a food tip, right?

538
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,900
Like who doesn't want to make delicious things to eat, right?

539
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:10,340
That'd be great. But but yeah, I want to keep it down to just two or three minutes

540
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,360
and not make it a part of the show.

541
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,240
And you just listen where the sonic event.

542
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,980
Oh, did I say show? I never say that.

543
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,020
You did. I know.

544
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,640
Hey, maybe. Yeah, I need some drugs.

545
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,000
I had to sit back and say nothing.

546
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,660
I just I was trying to ask questions.

547
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,520
I know what it just sounded very familiar, right?

548
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,260
A smoothie, right?

549
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,880
Like who the fuck doesn't know how to make a smoothie?

550
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,280
But you don't like this.

551
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,400
You may be like this is five star.

552
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,520
Yeah. You know, or three star if you're Michelin.

553
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,740
So anyway. Yeah.

554
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,800
So yeah, this person here sat through.

555
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,460
I'll just read a little bit. I got the gist of it.

556
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,000
It's Greek. I sat through the shake to get the booty.

557
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:49,560
But we do a verbal dissertation on how the signature or signatory

558
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,240
plays in the digital realm.

559
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,920
Yes. Let's just take that part first.

560
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,200
OK. And OK.

561
00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:00,400
So the digital realm is really about

562
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,600
whatever. OK, we spoke about the banking convention

563
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,140
previous to electronics, right?

564
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,080
How it was all paper. OK.

565
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,600
When digital came in, you could multiply that times

566
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,460
500 or 1000 times more transactions, right?

567
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,880
Possible. Right.

568
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,100
OK, so what they're doing, which was much harder to do

569
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,220
and not in the digital realm, is they take your blank endorsement.

570
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,080
Here's what you sign for the right.

571
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,020
Remember, you you sign it.

572
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,580
You write your name as an autograph.

573
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:30,640
But when someone asks you to sign, you're signing as a signatory

574
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,120
to represent someone else.

575
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,300
You're always an agent, right?

576
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,460
And don't call it a straw man.

577
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,100
This is one part where Brendan Joe Williams, I agree with him.

578
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,880
It's a public corporation.

579
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,280
And when it was created a few days after,

580
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,860
you get the long form birth certificate.

581
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,340
And you'll see when that name came into being.

582
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,320
So you could actually say your birthday is this day,

583
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,660
but the public corporation's birthday is this day.

584
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,500
Disalignate them.

585
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,860
If you make a big deal about your name and all caps in a legal setting,

586
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,940
they don't they'll they'll make that as a distraction.

587
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,440
Focus on that, that you're crazy.

588
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:04,580
So if anyone tries to object to that, you just you ignore what they're saying

589
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,020
and just object to their comment.

590
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,360
But either way,

591
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,620
what happens with the digital stuff?

592
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,500
I'll give you an example.

593
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,860
A few years ago, there was a few reports about Wells Fargo's in trouble

594
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,840
because they opened a quarter of a million credit card accounts

595
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,760
without people knowing about it. Correct.

596
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,160
Well, all they did was take their ace hardware.

597
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:28,280
OK, you know, when you go to a big store like Autozone's hardware,

598
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,960
you return an item, you say sign for it, you know, that you return.

599
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,700
I'm like, oh, my gosh, how much credit do you guys want?

600
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,580
I always make a stink.

601
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,280
And they hate, you know, that most part.

602
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,220
They call me the professor.

603
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,740
But they're like, oh, yeah, yeah.

604
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,280
With the credit stuff. Yeah, we don't care.

605
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,060
You should be very insulted by that.

606
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,920
Yeah. Yeah, I know. But I'm not.

607
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,620
But I understand where from their point of view. Right. Right.

608
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,640
So, you know, I mean, it's I should be more insulted

609
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,680
when a dog wants to hump my leg to a degree.

610
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,200
But either way, I'm not. Right.

611
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,280
Because it's a dog. Right.

612
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,000
And then that's for domination. It's not sexual. Exactly. Yeah.

613
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:07,600
So in a similar way, what Autozone, they take those.

614
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,780
It's digital. It's an image of the signature, the signature.

615
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,480
And they can put it anywhere they want.

616
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,520
They can do an in-house memorandum that they did a survey

617
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,960
and people signed it for, you know, whatever.

618
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,620
And they could put the signature on it.

619
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:24,620
It's theirs. Right. And it's their pixels.

620
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,580
They won't say it's your signature, but they control that image. Right.

621
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,640
And Wells Fargo took people's images of their signature

622
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,800
and put them in all kinds of contracts and stuff to show that, hey,

623
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,200
this new credit department that creative came up with

624
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,660
and financial said wouldn't work.

625
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,840
Well, look how great it's doing.

626
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:44,120
And it all copied, fakes it, you know, copied images.

627
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,560
Right. That's what the digital is.

628
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:49,080
Now, the problem with digital is that you cannot

629
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,640
control those conditions. Right.

630
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,580
Now, I'll give you another thing.

631
00:28:54,760 --> 00:29:00,260
I was working with someone who was getting 36 million dollars

632
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,540
on an oil and gas deal. Right.

633
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:06,120
And the bank I was at, we were having lunch and he gets a call

634
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,720
and he says, we got to go. I said, I got it.

635
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,600
I said, why do you have to go?

636
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,560
I said, come, I'll come with you.

637
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,500
I have to go to the bank.

638
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,500
They want me to sign a check. OK.

639
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,360
And I'm like, wait a second, you're selling it.

640
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,800
They're supposed to give you a check. Right.

641
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,760
Why do they want you to?

642
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,840
So he walks in, sits down.

643
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,220
They bring this corporate checkbook.

644
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,240
They're real long ones, big checks. Of course.

645
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,540
And there's two people there and they're covering everything with white paper.

646
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,960
And they tell him, sign here's a check.

647
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,600
So actually signed a check.

648
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,400
And I was like, well, I don't want to make a big deal.

649
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,820
It's not my business, really. It's his business. Right.

650
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,160
I said, why are they making use the second time?

651
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,080
He said, after you said you're taking your signature and there,

652
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,580
you know, how many checks are you going to how many times? Right.

653
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:45,040
So he doesn't know. He doesn't care. Right.

654
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:48,780
So and then then we almost get back to his house.

655
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:51,120
And he's like, this is the second time they had me do this.

656
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,040
I'm like, oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

657
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:56,080
So they have some kind of transaction thing going

658
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,440
to show that he's writing checks. Right.

659
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,460
Right. It's just a signature.

660
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,300
And someone else is signing. Oh, my gosh.

661
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,460
So let's say a bank does a thirty six million dollar deal.

662
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,240
They're probably getting two, three, four hundred, five hundred million.

663
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,620
They're creating all this stuff. Right.

664
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,840
Running it to the Federal Reserve.

665
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:16,220
Now, imagine, Chuck, that I'm going to buy, let's say, your car

666
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,800
for a thousand dollars, five thousand, ten thousand.

667
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,820
And we're going to use this bank.

668
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:25,120
And you get a call from your bank saying, all right, the Greek, whatever.

669
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,840
Chuck, you need to come to the bank to sign a check.

670
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,020
I'm like, wait a second.

671
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,520
Well, why am I signing checks?

672
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,020
Yeah. Why am I signing a check?

673
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,000
Yeah, I can endorse it on the back.

674
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,020
So, yeah. But why? And then walk out.

675
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,160
What the hell are you doing?

676
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:42,980
So this kind of the point here is that, yeah, digital seems like a wild west

677
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,920
to the 10th power.

678
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,500
But also they've done that even without digital, having people come in and sign

679
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:53,920
checks for one and they cover, you know, they cover the check with a piece of paper.

680
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:57,600
They like two people, one guy's holding the book, the checkbook.

681
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,020
It's one of the big corporate checkbooks.

682
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:02,860
And another person, you know, clenching the white paper over.

683
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,540
You can't see anything on the check.

684
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,800
This is like a book where each page is actually a script of either three to five

685
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,900
large checks. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

686
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,260
There's really, yeah, bank checks.

687
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:17,440
Yeah. So I'm like, holy shit, this is not my I'm not involved in this at all.

688
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,260
So who am I to say to the banker, what the fuck are you doing?

689
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,020
I know what you're doing.

690
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:25,120
You know, show us, you know, actually we're going to litigate, you know, whatever.

691
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,040
No, I wasn't. I was just sitting back watching.

692
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,300
So I can someday I got a thrill.

693
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,580
I felt really bad. I was going to throw up. Right.

694
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,780
But at the same time, I was like, great, I can tell this story.

695
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,040
This is what I saw someday in the future.

696
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:42,340
And no one can tell me otherwise, because I saw it right.

697
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:42,880
I was there.

698
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,360
So you can't tell me that banks don't make you do that bullshit.

699
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,260
They do. Oh, let's.

700
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,360
Oh, how about this?

701
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:52,280
This is the only bank in the world that makes people that ask people to do that.

702
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,300
Right. What are the chances of that?

703
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,060
No, no.

704
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:01,080
What are the chances of someone argues this for against it and says, well,

705
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,780
that was the only bank in the world that did such a thing.

706
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,340
That's like saying, that's the only politician I've ever seen.

707
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,960
Why? Come on.

708
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,320
Yeah. Yeah. So this is.

709
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,100
So that's why when you know something really well

710
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:19,240
and someone is wants to debate you or counter you, where you're going to find.

711
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,100
I know what I know. I know.

712
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,980
I know how if you don't want. I'm not going.

713
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,100
What am I getting to convince you?

714
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,400
Right. Nothing. This is just right.

715
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,480
So anyway, this is how.

716
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,600
So is it is it any is the digital made it worse than the non-digital?

717
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,420
No, I just gave the example. Right.

718
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,800
Maybe. All right. If you want to be naive.

719
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,180
Yeah, maybe this is his.

720
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,920
The bank in Houston was the only bank that makes people come in and sign checks

721
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,040
and not show them for what? Let's say still.

722
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:49,020
Well, hasn't it made things happen faster and at a higher volume or no?

723
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:53,080
Yes. At a higher volume also creates more confusion.

724
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,960
So when you ask for records,

725
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,560
those things can be changed with a keystroke. Right.

726
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:06,000
Right. You can write when you ask for subpoena records, if they're all digital.

727
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:09,720
Right. I mean, look at the birth certificate, Obama birth certificate.

728
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,500
Right. By the way, you know, there are programs that can show you

729
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,060
if something's been photoshopped. Right.

730
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,300
Yeah, of course. Right.

731
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:19,000
And now there's programs to show you if it's an AI voice.

732
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,140
Mm hmm. Right. So I just wanted to put that out there.

733
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,980
Yes, there is. There have been for a little bit.

734
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:28,040
There have been. It's funny because those really leave signatures.

735
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,320
Yeah, so it does.

736
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,960
They're digital signatures.

737
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,540
OK. You know, I say humans are fucked.

738
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,720
OK, so here's the thing.

739
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:37,520
The stance that I take. Avoid it. Don't do any banking.

740
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,900
By the way. Well, do it the long way.

741
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,740
Right. You cash money orders in person.

742
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,260
You know, this way you'll make, you know, like, quote unquote,

743
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:51,100
paying a bill becomes a big deal.

744
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,160
Right. So you have a little more excitement in your life. Right.

745
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,920
And so I don't have time to do that.

746
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,720
Well, watch what happens if you don't do any banking.

747
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,860
How much more time you will have because you won't be doing the shit

748
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,220
that you're doing because you have banking.

749
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,400
You get it. Right.

750
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:07,500
Cable goes away. Internet goes away.

751
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,719
Right. Your subscriptions go away.

752
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,840
You got plenty of time now.

753
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,780
Right. Mm hmm.

754
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:17,100
It sounds kind of crazy.

755
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,900
Yeah. I'm thinking to myself, there's a whole lot of people

756
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,300
that would not know what to do with themselves.

757
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:23,460
Well, you have plenty of time.

758
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,639
You could spend a whole day just going down a quote unquote pay the gas bill.

759
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,580
Yeah. But, you know, if the meaning of life is to have your time

760
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:32,139
wasted and to waste other people's time mutually.

761
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,280
Exactly. They're wasting your time.

762
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,300
You have two ways to waste.

763
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,100
Well, two ways is you just give so much to someone.

764
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:42,159
They can't get anything done or you throw so little at them

765
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,540
that even if they get it done, little little got done. Right.

766
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:48,840
So you need to make it so they're ineffective because they can't do anything

767
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,300
or you give them so much to do.

768
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,580
They're overwhelmed that they can't possibly accomplish anything.

769
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,760
It's never made for the right. Right.

770
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,440
Never moderated. Exactly.

771
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:02,820
Never would be the Greek, which would be everything in moderation.

772
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,540
It's actually ancient Greek.

773
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,420
It's the actual translation of fun.

774
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,360
Metro Ariston would be all middle

775
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:13,540
Irish or the best, which we would make more sense

776
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,640
to translate it as all things in moderation.

777
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,840
But OK, so continuing most places no longer require a signature

778
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:24,200
and credit card receipts, and many banks no longer require deposit slips.

779
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,440
Yeah, that's done by conditions, innovations and things like that. Right.

780
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,200
I know the old system is dead.

781
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,300
Not really. But what replaces it?

782
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,040
Now, how can you avoid the traps and be free while here?

783
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,920
Well, I just set me to get a million.

784
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,040
Thank you, Natalia.

785
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:44,060
But what what what I would suggest is you I answered that already.

786
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,060
So would you agree?

787
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,580
But what let me just look at those places no longer.

788
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:54,860
OK, they don't require a signature, because at some point I've seen this.

789
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,300
If you have a bank account or whatever, you'll get a letter says

790
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,740
our terms and conditions have changed.

791
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,520
This is a letter to notify you.

792
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:01,440
Yeah. Right.

793
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:04,780
And in there, it'll say that if you've made your marks here

794
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:08,120
and you make your marks there, it's kind of like if you continue,

795
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,940
you agree to the terms. Right.

796
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,000
Kind of thing.

797
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,640
And they can also have terms that they don't disclose there.

798
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,740
And they said for more terms or whatever, contact this department.

799
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,440
Most people don't.

800
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:22,020
You'll see it's 170 pages, not just one letter or three pages. Right.

801
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:25,760
So there's some there's an innovation or something done

802
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,500
to change the terms and conditions.

803
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,740
Well, besides that, I had a guy tell me the other day

804
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:32,380
that he got a renewal on his driver's license or whatever.

805
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,700
And he looked down and realized

806
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:37,040
that he had not signed this thing in probably 20 years.

807
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,420
And they had a copy of his signature that they just added to the document.

808
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,780
So, you know, that's right.

809
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:44,340
Now, to get rid of the driver's license, which I have done.

810
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,360
You need a form.

811
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,860
You just don't give it back to them like Brandon, Joe Williams.

812
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,720
They still show him as having a driver's license.

813
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,040
He's one in giving you send it back in the mail, registered mail.

814
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,280
There is a form.

815
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,340
But when you you know how they have forms for everything.

816
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,600
None of the DMV motor vehicle places have the form.

817
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,720
You have to find out the form number

818
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:06,240
and print it off a PDF online and then send that in.

819
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,360
And then you got a threatening letter.

820
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,040
You know, if we catch you on the road, I'm always confiscate your vehicle.

821
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,880
You could vote. Right.

822
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,120
So there is a cancellation.

823
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,760
There's that I know many, many people,

824
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,780
there's thousands of people that sent the driver's license in.

825
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,980
It'll just be suspended or still active.

826
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:28,620
But I once I had it checked out and it showed on the main computer canceled.

827
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,980
Right. So to cancel it, it's a special form.

828
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,520
I don't have the number of the form,

829
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:38,380
but you can actually some things are easy to find on Google.

830
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,980
And you know, you think might be hard.

831
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:45,520
Like there's a form the IRS has for to unsubscribe from their service.

832
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,240
It's forty six ninety eight or forty six.

833
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,360
Thirty nine something or sixty four, whatever.

834
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,540
It's called revocation of election.

835
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:58,060
But you want to read that carefully and maybe, you know, all IRS paperwork,

836
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:03,280
by the way, you look at 1040, you know, it says this is a 1040 return for this

837
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,000
or you can make your own statement, which is or make a statement,

838
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,820
make a statement statement. Yeah.

839
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,600
Yeah. Make a state says you don't have to use those forms.

840
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:16,600
I suggest, you know, what's on the form and make your statement short and sweet.

841
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,480
Don't give whatever you don't want to give and punch where you want it.

842
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:23,200
You know, you're talking about twenty six CFR

843
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,960
fifteen point one dash to the revocation of election to the.

844
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,100
Yeah, there's a form for that's not the form.

845
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:33,120
That's by the way, if you find the title twenty six, it's somewhere in there.

846
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:37,760
It says that let it not be construed that anything in this title

847
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,580
has any legal effect, by the way.

848
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,780
Are you familiar with that one?

849
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,860
I haven't read it yet. I just happen to.

850
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,200
Yeah, there's you could put in like the title.

851
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,860
Twenty six has no legal effect.

852
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,620
Basically, it tells you if you copy anything from this title

853
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:52,420
or use anything from this title, it has no effect.

854
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,360
That's a basically telling you the indirect way that it has no effect. Right.

855
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:01,100
Yeah. So but it does for certain people.

856
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:04,380
If you're a federal citizen, they always.

857
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,100
But anyway, it has to do.

858
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:10,540
And by the way, Congress is one of the, you know, the 16th Amendment.

859
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,020
We're just going on a tangent here.

860
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:16,220
It does give the lawful money clause in the 16th Amendment itself.

861
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,420
And they also codified it,

862
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,480
which is in 12 U.S.C.

863
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,380
411, the demand for lawful money.

864
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,560
It's codified that the other.

865
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,860
That's a remedy, by the way.

866
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,380
The other remedy is Congress.

867
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,820
If you do a revocation of election with the IRS, they send you back a letter

868
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,200
saying we've got your revocation of election via U.S.

869
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:37,740
Congress.

870
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:39,320
In other words, the U.S.

871
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,660
Congress backs that up. Yeah. Right.

872
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,380
Now, I remember Schultz, who does Charlie Brown.

873
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:45,620
Yeah, Charles Schultz.

874
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,120
Charles, he published this a long time ago.

875
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,640
He is Charlie Brown and the typewriter.

876
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,740
Right. He's saying, Dear IRS, please, I'd like to unsubscribe.

877
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,240
He's telling you there is an unsubscription form for it.

878
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,460
Charles Schultz.

879
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,020
You could actually wonder if you do a.

880
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,000
You might find the card.

881
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:03,580
You might show up.

882
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:04,520
Yeah. OK, let me see.

883
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:08,560
Schultz, a cartoonist, unsubscribed from the IRS.

884
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,640
You'll see. You'll see what I'm talking about.

885
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,740
It's an old car. It was in the newspapers, too, right?

886
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,540
I do these little disclosures.

887
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,840
Yeah, I'm thinking it was in the 70s, wasn't it?

888
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,860
Yeah, yeah, probably.

889
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,260
Yeah, that's that's what it was.

890
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:22,680
They even did an animation with Charlie Brown.

891
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,120
Well, they did. Yeah, actually, I think they might have made it.

892
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,620
OK, so they had little shorts in between the main story for Charlie Brown

893
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,060
when they were running him on TV a lot.

894
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,780
And I think they put it in one of those.

895
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:32,660
It just probably was.

896
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,120
They even did commercials, ads based around them.

897
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,880
But anyway, let's see if you pull up the cartoon.

898
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,180
Well, let's see if you've seen it or.

899
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,680
Yeah, no, I absolutely.

900
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,500
But it's Snoopy typing, I think.

901
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,740
It might be Snoopy. Yeah, let me see.

902
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,260
I've got a picture.

903
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,960
Dear IRS, hold on, hold on.

904
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,860
There's images.

905
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,440
And let's see.

906
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,900
Hang on just a second, because anyway, that's.

907
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:58,340
Yeah, you know, there was a lot of what we're saying has been popularized

908
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,520
because there are people in prison, supposedly.

909
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,480
No one's in prison for not paying taxes.

910
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,860
You're in there for giving false information or conspiracy.

911
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:08,560
Right. I actually have a comic strip which was printed in black and white,

912
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,680
which is not the TV.

913
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,560
But I know I saw this on TV as well.

914
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,100
And it says, Dear IRS.

915
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,620
And then he's still at the typewriter.

916
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,160
He's at the top of his doghouse there.

917
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:19,480
Snoopy says, I'm writing to you to cancel my subscription.

918
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,720
Please remove my name from your mailing list.

919
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,780
That's right. Yeah, literally.

920
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:25,780
That's and that's it.

921
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:27,520
Yeah. Four panels.

922
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,200
Yeah. There you go.

923
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:31,420
Yeah. If you like it, that's the revocation of election.

924
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,980
There is a form they have that.

925
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:37,560
OK, I'll grab the screenshot for you and I'll give it to you.

926
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,440
But no, it's fine.

927
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:41,800
Yeah, I just because I remember I remember reading that

928
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,960
when it was in vogue at the time.

929
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,360
I remember, you know, that what was that done?

930
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,500
Does it give a date for that?

931
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,380
Was it 74, 75 or something?

932
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,280
Hang on. I'll grab it in a sec.

933
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,560
I was just trying to throw it.

934
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,960
I don't know. We're being we're kind of hanging on the slot.

935
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,800
But this is important to me personally, because I remember

936
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:01,240
actually reading it in the paper where it was published or the book or whatever.

937
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:05,140
Well, I remember seeing it on TV as well, which is really odd because.

938
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,000
Yeah, I know. That's why I know it was.

939
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:07,980
So, yeah. You know.

940
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:11,360
So right before it gets really bad, they tell you they give you the remedy.

941
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,680
Like, you know, before 9-11, they called a lot of people

942
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,860
in certain offices and said, don't show up, don't fly in an airplane.

943
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,640
And don't you know. Right. Right.

944
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,960
And now they've made it into a meme where Snoopy's holding the letter,

945
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,440
by the way, and standing there with a smirk on his face.

946
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,620
Let's see. Unfortunately, they're not giving you the form.

947
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,220
No, I'm taking it. No, I'm taking it.

948
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,500
No, they're not giving you the form number.

949
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,180
I'm taking a look for 56, right?

950
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,160
Form 56, 56.

951
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,520
Yeah, no, they don't show that.

952
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,440
And I don't see the date.

953
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,240
They have a Facebook page about it.

954
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,600
They got all kinds of things about it.

955
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,580
Yeah, but they're not telling.

956
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,220
Yeah, it's it's still it's skirting around the issue.

957
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:46,160
It's skirting around.

958
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,920
You know, are there birds in that bush? Right. Right.

959
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,460
As long as there are no crabs in that bush.

960
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:53,460
But anyway, yeah, no birds in that bush.

961
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,860
Are there birds in that bush?

962
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,880
That shit gets itchy.

963
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,740
But anyway. Yeah. OK, gotcha.

964
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,420
At least that's what I'm told. That's what I'm told.

965
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,880
And scabies. Oh, my gosh.

966
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,560
I've heard of those things. Those things.

967
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:07,160
By the way, if you live in a college dorm, it's not unusual to get that,

968
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:10,520
by the way, if you live in a college dorm or military.

969
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,460
It's very used to be famous.

970
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,140
I've read a couple of, you know, fictional kind of.

971
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:18,200
Yeah, everything's great here, except we all got the crabs. Right.

972
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,260
So you get it from the bathroom or whatever conditions they have.

973
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,700
You know, bedbugs are worse.

974
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,300
Got to be honest with you.

975
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,340
Yeah, I've never had bedbugs.

976
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,540
I did get the crabs from being in a dorm situation.

977
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:33,260
I was at a guy's house for a couple of hours and I started itching and found out

978
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:36,300
that the reason why is because I was actually bitten by these bedbugs.

979
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,220
And I took a look at what they're supposed to look like.

980
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,760
And they're pretty hideous looking things. Yeah.

981
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,660
They got a big old shit.

982
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,080
They shouldn't call them bedbugs because that sounds too.

983
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,260
Yeah, they're not. Yeah, that's right.

984
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:47,800
You know, they should have another name for them.

985
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:50,700
They should call them syringe bugs because it looks like they got a giant needle

986
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:54,560
on the tip of their head shape, a company that accompanies it.

987
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,580
Yeah, it looks like a shock absorber boot.

988
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,380
Yeah. With a needle on the end. Yeah. Yeah.

989
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:05,000
OK, another email we've got is something about the, you know,

990
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:09,400
the voter's registration, which is something I also learned from someone

991
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,540
who was doing that.

992
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,020
Just to recap, this is in Los Lunos,

993
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,560
Mexico. I'm not going to mention names.

994
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,700
Carl Meyer's son basically grew up in a trailer.

995
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,680
And he's the only one out of four or five siblings

996
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:27,600
that had a quarter million dollar house and $100,000 BMW

997
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:31,000
because he was like the second guy or third guy in charge of New Mexico

998
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,600
for collecting voter registration and get a percentage.

999
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:36,060
And I knew what was going on.

1000
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:39,460
And I said, you know, these things are monetized, you know, for 10, 20 grand.

1001
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:42,720
He puts his thumb up like, you know, up much higher, you know.

1002
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,820
So he knew about the money system and stuff.

1003
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:49,200
It's like being it's like being a toll collector, but the pay is much better.

1004
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:51,000
Yeah. OK. Yeah. So he was.

1005
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,760
Yeah. So it was in the 50, 55.

1006
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,780
I couldn't give you a number thousand.

1007
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,200
This is back in 2007.

1008
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,200
So someone's if we put a signature on it, does it change it?

1009
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:04,460
No, because again, these things are not scrutinized that way.

1010
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,360
If you're doing a voter registration, they're not going to scrutinize

1011
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,700
the signature because this is a stack of suckers.

1012
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:13,520
But I think the voters registration thing started out for prison inmates.

1013
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,440
Right. A while back.

1014
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,460
Don't hold me on this.

1015
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:20,680
I may have been in the US, but they started the whole voter

1016
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:23,800
registration for prison inmates that didn't have a felonious crime

1017
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,780
that they could still eligible to vote.

1018
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,380
But because they're in the prison, they had to register.

1019
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,560
So essentially, if you're registering to vote with that,

1020
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:32,540
you're considered a felon, let's say indirectly.

1021
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:33,980
Yeah, this is how bad it is.

1022
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:36,440
Well, because technically speaking, you're not supposed to be voting

1023
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,080
in national elections, are you?

1024
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,400
No, the whole thing is really bad.

1025
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,300
It's not even a government.

1026
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,620
You can't vote for who's the CEO of McDonald's.

1027
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,720
But even according to their laws, it's not legal for you to vote

1028
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,660
in an election.

1029
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:50,320
No, it's actually an act of insurgency.

1030
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:54,800
Right. Take it if you take it in law because you're not part of that group.

1031
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:55,920
But especially not anymore.

1032
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,420
You're three times removed. Right.

1033
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,420
By the way, all this stuff we're talking about the system.

1034
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:04,920
If all the laws were followed and everyone we would we would be

1035
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,700
in a paradise right now.

1036
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:10,080
In other words, if you wanted to, you know, Social Security card

1037
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,020
is a credit card, right?

1038
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:13,840
And they give the Social Security number.

1039
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:18,620
So when so people find out the the their government lost

1040
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:22,620
everything in a card game to the banks, take your number, you'll get what you need.

1041
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,800
So everyone knew that they had a credit card.

1042
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:27,580
You know, you don't get a bill at the end of the month.

1043
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:28,800
In other words, it is the bill.

1044
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:31,040
You just give them the number and get what you want.

1045
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:33,900
Where would the poverty and homelessness and all that be?

1046
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,900
Or where would the wondering how I'm going to pay for tuition to be?

1047
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,500
No, no, none of that.

1048
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:39,200
Well, that's the thing.

1049
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:42,500
I mean, I can't even imagine what it would be like to not have to stress over.

1050
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:43,400
Where am I going to get?

1051
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:45,220
You know, that's right. Yeah.

1052
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:48,580
But how are people going to act with this current?

1053
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,280
I mean, that's why I say the people here cannot have you.

1054
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:53,920
If you want to create that society, you have to eliminate ninety nine point

1055
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,500
nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine.

1056
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:58,340
Let's see what may well maybe a little less than around there

1057
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:01,600
because nine percent of the population, too small of a percentage of people

1058
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,760
that would seek self-improvement afterwards and just, you know, say,

1059
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,840
you know what, since I don't have to struggle with that anymore.

1060
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:10,740
Now, let me do something really useful and, you know, make things better,

1061
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:12,740
even better. Right.

1062
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:17,040
I mean, you know, that's what a very small percentage would try to do.

1063
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:18,520
That's what the issue is.

1064
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,420
You know, it's sort of like a Jacque Fresco thing

1065
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:23,960
where he had the image about the managed cities and all that.

1066
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,920
It's a great idea if people would, you know, actually do it, isn't it?

1067
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:30,600
Yeah, but it's not for this.

1068
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:34,740
We were genetically modified and groomed to be this way.

1069
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,020
So it is really if you don't.

1070
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:41,700
In other words, if you know, as I know, I know 100 percent

1071
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:46,360
if people got together and just followed all the rules and all the laws,

1072
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:48,540
we'd be in a in a, you know, utopia.

1073
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:50,280
But just like in the Matrix,

1074
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:54,100
you know, it was too perfectly it doesn't work out.

1075
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:55,940
So they rejected it. Yes.

1076
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,120
Yeah. All you got to do, by the way, whether it's police, bankers, lawyers,

1077
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:02,740
doctors, hold them to the rules, hold them to the rules and everything's fine.

1078
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,920
But no one knows or follows the rules.

1079
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:07,280
And we've gone through that before.

1080
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:10,100
But again, OK, let's go back to the voters registration.

1081
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:10,760
It didn't answer.

1082
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:12,440
No, they're not going to look at the signature

1083
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:17,220
because they're stacking these things up a mile high and they're monetizing them.

1084
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:18,480
And it could take a long time.

1085
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,000
They have four years to monetize them. Right.

1086
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:24,620
So for whatever, two years, depending on how the what's part of the cycle

1087
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:27,640
and what which being, you know, because some places that you can have elections

1088
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:30,820
every two years, it's like even checks are only supposed to be valid for what?

1089
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:31,740
Up to two years. Right.

1090
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,460
Isn't that the case with checks?

1091
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,460
I think it's one hundred and eighty days, six months.

1092
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:36,720
Oh, is that what what?

1093
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,580
OK, I thought that up to two.

1094
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,980
Yeah. So so no, the voters registration, I would definitely cancel that shit.

1095
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:47,620
I mean, cancel everything that you can if you want to, you know, be more.

1096
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:49,200
Now, here's the thing.

1097
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,760
Brandon Joe Williams talks about just the passport.

1098
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,420
But I know they'll use that against you,

1099
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:57,400
because when you go to court, the clerk sees what kind of contracts you have.

1100
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:03,620
And I, by the way, they when you you know, the judge is up there at the whatever

1101
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:06,580
and you just come in and they have a clerk, they type in the name

1102
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:10,660
and she just kind of moves the monitor or he has the code of how many contracts

1103
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:14,040
you have and if someone shows up like no contracts, the judge sits up

1104
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:16,140
and he's like, how can I help you today?

1105
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:17,760
He kind of is really different. Right.

1106
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:21,700
Well, if you have a lot of contracts, it's like the you know, you're fucking dickhead.

1107
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:24,280
You're going to come over here and argue, you know, so.

1108
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:27,580
But they will use the passport against you.

1109
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:30,640
I don't think they show much of a difference on that.

1110
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:34,240
But at this point, I have pretty much nothing.

1111
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:39,640
But anyway, and also I'm one of the few people that has actually legally

1112
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,840
expatriated legally, not the way, you know, send in mail.

1113
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:46,000
I mean, I you know, one day we'll get into that.

1114
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:47,160
I have the document here

1115
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:49,740
that I'm not a citizen.

1116
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:53,120
So that's that's what I thought it was important.

1117
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:57,340
And that was in the middle of my heightened spiritual sussing out like

1118
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:59,840
you know, if God, quote unquote, is so good,

1119
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,980
why would he put us in a situation like this?

1120
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:02,780
And I was in between.

1121
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:05,480
Well, it's to learn or be punished one or the other. Right.

1122
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:09,960
So I was like, let me just get out of anything that I see is unfit to get out of.

1123
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:13,520
But I would suggest that

1124
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,780
it doesn't really matter that much

1125
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:21,220
unless you find yourself to be very active in many things

1126
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:25,480
where you increase the chances of interacting with agencies and these whatever.

1127
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,220
Then you might want to minimize it and get out. Right.

1128
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:31,580
But even if you're not interacting, if they're going around

1129
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:34,080
just doing a sweep, checking people,

1130
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,340
do you want to be listed in their system as, you know, fish in a barrel? Right.

1131
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:42,680
So but I don't think there's enough time left to argue,

1132
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,920
you know, for the future. Right.

1133
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:49,420
Because, you know, whether you look at the early part of 2030s

1134
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:52,160
or the 2040, 2046, 2052

1135
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:56,020
as a major demise of the current system, that's really close.

1136
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:57,640
Really, really close.

1137
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:01,800
So so less than a decade left until we have a major, major shift.

1138
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,840
Yeah. All the systems go away, but it's going to be really nasty

1139
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:09,780
where the utility companies, let's say, OK, I'm near Tucson, Arizona, right?

1140
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:14,300
The the water, gas, electric utility power plants,

1141
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:16,980
they're going to be told don't show up to work.

1142
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:18,680
All right. OK.

1143
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,060
And the people will go home and they're like, wait a second.

1144
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:22,880
I love my city.

1145
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:24,400
I love my job.

1146
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,360
And tell me not to show up for work.

1147
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,320
You're not going to get paid.

1148
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:32,860
But I know by the way things run, if no one shows up, we'll lose power.

1149
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,020
We'll lose water. We'll lose gas. Right.

1150
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,240
So I'm going to show up to work anyway.

1151
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:40,900
Well, when you show up to work, you're going to see somewhere there

1152
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:44,700
with a Wackenhut badge and they'll blow your freaking head off.

1153
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,320
They'll give you one warning and they'll kill you.

1154
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,540
That's how desperate they are about shutting everything down.

1155
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:51,780
Not now, but in the future.

1156
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:56,860
So we'll have people, obviously, that say, hey, I'll go do it for no money

1157
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:58,640
as a social responsibility.

1158
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,260
Maybe I'll get a medal one day.

1159
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:02,460
So there'll be people there, you know, black.

1160
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,960
The black, what do you call them?

1161
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:07,200
Black ops type or SOG people.

1162
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:08,340
You're Wackenhut, right?

1163
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,460
To kill you. Yeah. Yeah.

1164
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,440
To make sure the utilities go down.

1165
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:15,800
Guys who are dressed entirely in black and have some sort of badge on them.

1166
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:20,260
Some or not a Wackenhut guy also could have could be 50, 60 years old.

1167
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:24,840
We've really bad hair, kind of like what was

1168
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:27,060
with a big potbelly.

1169
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:30,540
What was the Rocky Horror Picture show?

1170
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,880
The guy who played Igor with the stringy hair like that?

1171
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:34,140
Whatever anyone's name.

1172
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,960
Well, Meatloaf was in it with stringy hair, which.

1173
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:38,380
Yeah. Yeah. Something like this.

1174
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:40,740
Just like something you see in a horror movie would be a Wackenhut.

1175
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,860
That is what they have.

1176
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:43,100
They hire people like that.

1177
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:47,260
Also, you wouldn't have the top of the barrel or whatever, even moderately

1178
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:48,820
looking. They're not like the Nazis.

1179
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:50,280
Like the crazy guy in Friday.

1180
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:53,800
Like the crazy guy in Friday, the 13th, who says you're all doomed.

1181
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,360
Yeah. Yeah. You know, lackey there or whatever.

1182
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:58,240
You know, he'll do it.

1183
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:00,100
They don't know what you know. They don't care.

1184
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:01,480
This is really, really bad.

1185
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:03,720
Just like JP Morgan said.

1186
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:06,160
Well, what this is allegedly.

1187
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:08,920
What do you what were you what are you prepared to do

1188
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:11,020
if the people find out how the money system works?

1189
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,280
It was all easy.

1190
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:16,260
I'll just print enough money to get half the people to kill the other half.

1191
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:18,400
Right. So, yeah.

1192
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:22,640
Memorialized in the was at the gangs of New York, where the the rich people say,

1193
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:25,160
well, what we'll do is we'll just hire half of the poor to kill

1194
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,120
the other half of the poor.

1195
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:27,260
There you go.

1196
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:29,340
Precisely.
