1
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,360
Rated Y 131.

2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,380
That's the number.

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,580
That's the time.

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,620
I guess.

5
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:15,760
Anyway, what?

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:16,960
You know what?

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,800
What time is it?

8
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:18,060
Greg?

9
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,980
What is the proper day?

10
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:25,060
Oh, well, the time, the day, you know, I'd have to I'm kind of losing count.

11
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,820
We're into the first week already past it, I believe.

12
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,780
So I could I could do my I could show you my account right now.

13
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,500
That's fifth month.

14
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:33,960
Fifth.

15
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:34,360
Right.

16
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,020
Right.

17
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:35,460
Yeah.

18
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,980
What do you think it is?

19
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,740
I shouldn't hold you to it.

20
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,300
You don't.

21
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,860
I believe it's too much.

22
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:41,420
Let's see.

23
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,940
I think it's the fourth day, but I could be wrong because it's the sixth.

24
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,260
It's the sixth day.

25
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,100
See, I'm wrong.

26
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:48,820
OK.

27
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,220
Yeah.

28
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:49,920
So rough.

29
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,020
No, it's not the wrong.

30
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,140
It's a matter of observation.

31
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:59,680
Who has a better observation and not knowing is fine, it's just basically that's how it

32
00:00:59,680 --> 00:00:59,920
rolls.

33
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:09,700
I reckon the the full moon was the last full moon was Saturday, Sunday.

34
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,400
Right.

35
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:11,980
Night.

36
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:12,620
So.

37
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:13,960
So basically the.

38
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:14,720
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:15,860
Yeah.

40
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,540
So Saturday noon was the first day of the month.

41
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,840
So it is still the sixth day.

42
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,220
It's so it's the sixth day or seventh day.

43
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,240
I really do give you a count right now.

44
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,260
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

45
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,040
Actually, we're in the eighth.

46
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,900
We're in the eighth day right now because it starts at noon.

47
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,320
Sorry.

48
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,440
So it's the eighth day.

49
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,020
Wow.

50
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,780
I was way off.

51
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:41,180
OK.

52
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:47,080
And I went and I was a day or two off because I was I wasn't, you know, it's what they call

53
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,480
the weekend.

54
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,860
And I thought it was Wednesday.

55
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:49,860
Oh, wow.

56
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,300
And I went to go to some industrial supply places.

57
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,480
They're just Monday through Friday, like the real hardcore places.

58
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,240
They open at six and close at four.

59
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,760
You know, it's just for.

60
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,160
So I'm like, oh, my gosh, what are they going out of business?

61
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,360
Why are they closed?

62
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,400
It's like it's Saturday.

63
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,060
Yeah.

64
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,039
Yeah.

65
00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:08,720
I had no idea.

66
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,280
It was Wednesday.

67
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,120
I'm like, oh, my gosh, this place didn't go out of business.

68
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,280
It's only nine a.m.

69
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,200
They should be kicking.

70
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,200
Now, you know, they've been open for three hours.

71
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,400
Why are they going out of business?

72
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,600
And I asked him, are they out of business?

73
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,100
He says, no, they were open yesterday.

74
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:26,120
So, you know, what they started doing is determining if they weren't making enough business.

75
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,760
They didn't want to keep the overhead there.

76
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,740
So they started cutting down on employees being present.

77
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,000
And then therefore, the hours have to come down.

78
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,860
So, yeah, these these places that I go, they supply to the trade.

79
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,480
So let's say it's a welding shop that supplies welders and ironwork.

80
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,100
Not too many people go there to browse.

81
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,100
If you're there, you know exactly what you want.

82
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:52,020
And the other thing is a lot of that's going to be, you know, phone orders or over the, you know, over the internet.

83
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,240
Exactly.

84
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,540
When you want to check out, you go to the service desk.

85
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,020
It's called.

86
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,140
Not the checkout, right?

87
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:57,580
Yeah.

88
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,300
But I mean, you go there and you can call them up and then pick up your stuff.

89
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,620
You know, which is something if you're in the area.

90
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,100
So, yeah.

91
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:05,680
So, yeah.

92
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,440
And, you know, this stuff.

93
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,240
Here's the thing.

94
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,280
Living in Tucson is way better than any place.

95
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,300
It's the biggest little city I've ever lived in.

96
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,040
In other words, I'll give you a quick story.

97
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,420
When I was doing Spring 2.

98
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,620
Oh, actually, I found the Twitter and Facebook stuff that someone else set up back in 2011.

99
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,580
So we're hanging around Spring 2.

100
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,520
Oh, yeah.

101
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,160
And it is a water bottling.

102
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,880
We were selling an arrow one and a whole bunch of other places.

103
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,500
Rossum.

104
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,100
And then I stayed out there almost half a year.

105
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,400
And that's when you were like the $20 bottles of water.

106
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:36,700
Right.

107
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,340
Yeah.

108
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:37,840
Yeah.

109
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,380
I was at an apartment off of Romaine and Santa Monica Boulevard.

110
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,020
Nice.

111
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,220
But, anyway.

112
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:44,820
It's too bad.

113
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,360
It's too bad.

114
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,000
But, yeah.

115
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:55,980
So, what was interesting with all this is we needed what's called a diaphragm pump.

116
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:00,120
A Flotec one liter per minute high pressure diaphragm pump.

117
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,820
So, a guy I was working with.

118
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,380
Anyway.

119
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,680
He's like, yeah, I've got one.

120
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,480
I did my research.

121
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,100
Found it on the phone.

122
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:07,820
So, we get in the car.

123
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,620
We get on I-5 for like a half an hour.

124
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,780
And I'm like, where the fuck are we going to get this pump?

125
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,160
You know?

126
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,300
And he's like, oh, we'll be there in another 20 minutes.

127
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,399
I'm like, where are we going?

128
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,779
Why does it take so long to get anything here in L.A.?

129
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:20,120
You know?

130
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,420
And I finally end up near Pasadena.

131
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,120
And you walk into the place.

132
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,840
And the guy wants $300 for it.

133
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,720
We're like $275.

134
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,880
I'm like, you've got to be kidding me.

135
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,020
And he says, let me show you.

136
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:31,320
You know.

137
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,940
I said, no, no, no.

138
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,000
I get that for $90.

139
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,140
There's no way.

140
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,400
It's more than my cost.

141
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,060
So, go check your cost.

142
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,420
So, he goes and he brings his wholesale book forward.

143
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,660
And on the cover of the wholesale book, it's Tucson Wholesale Pumps.

144
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,380
Which is the place I go to and get it for $90.

145
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,140
So, I understand.

146
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,380
He says it costs $150.

147
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,780
I understand he has to cover.

148
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,500
It will cost him that much with the shipping and all that other stuff.

149
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,900
I walk into Tucson Wholesale Pumps and walk out the door.

150
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:04,760
Right?

151
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,680
For $90.

152
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,100
And how long does it take for me to go there to get that pump from where I am?

153
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,260
15 minutes tops on a bad day.

154
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:12,200
Right.

155
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,000
Now, from one end.

156
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,820
You know, from the part where people lose the industrial side to the industrial side.

157
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,600
I could find anything here.

158
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,820
It's an anomaly.

159
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,980
Within 10 or 15 minutes from where I live here in Tucson.

160
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,600
L.A., it was like either you can't get it or it's a two-hour drive and it's four times the price.

161
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,440
So, that really nicks.

162
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,740
L.A. and California is not a good place to live if you are an inventor.

163
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,440
You do research and development and all that stuff.

164
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,780
Unless you do it for the government.

165
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,420
You know, some base.

166
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,200
You know, whatever.

167
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:40,760
Oh, yeah.

168
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,340
Somebody doesn't care if they're shipping things in from everywhere.

169
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,260
And it doesn't matter.

170
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:44,780
Yeah, yeah.

171
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,240
Yeah.

172
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,620
But California is not good.

173
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:52,580
It's not good for an inventor or somebody who's researching and needs to get stuff all the time.

174
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,980
And there's a line of work that I do.

175
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,380
There's various things that I've discussed.

176
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,840
And it's also not like New York.

177
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:00,000
Because in New York, it's just a matter of do you know the right person?

178
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,820
All you got to do is know the right person.

179
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,540
You can get anything in New York.

180
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,740
And it's only 20 minutes away at most.

181
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:07,920
In New York.

182
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,440
Right?

183
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,020
I mean, even the worst of the worst stuff.

184
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,700
If you had to go to Jersey.

185
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,980
Well, if you needed stuff like that.

186
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,520
Like Brooklyn, Navy Yard area.

187
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,060
Lower West Side of Manhattan.

188
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:22,860
Yeah.

189
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,920
Because that was where the docks were.

190
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,160
Oh, you go over by the.

191
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,520
Supplies and places like that.

192
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,860
Yeah, you go over by the fish market.

193
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,540
And there's warehouses over there.

194
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,380
You can get anything.

195
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,340
Yeah.

196
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,260
You just got to know.

197
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,700
Fortunately, I never had to go to Jersey.

198
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,420
I went to Jersey a couple of times.

199
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,860
Actually, bike racing and other visiting stuff.

200
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,080
I like the better parts of Jersey.

201
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,520
The parts that are far away.

202
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,720
The parts that are closer to Pennsylvania than New York.

203
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,240
You know what I mean?

204
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:47,740
Yeah.

205
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,200
Like Morristown.

206
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,620
Not Morristown.

207
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,720
Tom's River.

208
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,600
Well, Tom's River is actually on the eastern side of the state.

209
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,840
But here's the thing about Jersey.

210
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,620
You can drive across the whole state depending on where you are.

211
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,200
In 45 minutes maximum.

212
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,060
30 minutes on the skinny part.

213
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,820
You can go from the ocean to Pennsylvania.

214
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,660
No problem.

215
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:09,680
Yeah, that's what I mean.

216
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,820
It's a small state.

217
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,140
But Tom's River is actually on the eastern side.

218
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,040
It's over there right by the Atlantic Ocean.

219
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,120
Next to Long Beach Island and Seaside Heights.

220
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,460
But when you just get over the tunnel or the bridge.

221
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,320
You know, George Washington Bridge or whatever.

222
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,060
Right.

223
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,420
It's all right.

224
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,260
Yeah, I mean, it's fine.

225
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,600
A lot of Jersey.

226
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,240
The coast there in Jersey, by the way.

227
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,420
I do remember this from back in the 90s.

228
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,780
You see, you know, the Palisades right from Manhattan and all that.

229
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,740
Those neighborhoods tucked in.

230
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,620
There's all intelligence agencies from all over the world.

231
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,400
Yeah.

232
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,500
And allegedly, you know, in little safe.

233
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,660
I'm talking about safe houses.

234
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,680
It's not like a center.

235
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,920
You know, it's not a campus.

236
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,120
No, no, no.

237
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:49,960
But that's true.

238
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,260
Yeah.

239
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,440
They have safe houses.

240
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,440
Like in other words, every intelligence agency in the world has a safe house somewhere along

241
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,240
that Hudson River.

242
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,500
You know, George W. Bridge or whatever.

243
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:01,840
Yeah.

244
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,080
Yeah.

245
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,640
Very interesting.

246
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,560
Well, you know, I won't say it out loud, but the reason is because you can meet up with

247
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,240
the criminal element and the intelligence element right there in Jersey.

248
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,780
They happen to cross over.

249
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,680
Did I say that out loud?

250
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,360
I think I did.

251
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,880
But yeah, that's the truth of it.

252
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,640
That's a matter of fact, even the guy that they caught like afterwards and they couldn't

253
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,340
figure out why this criminal was nearby when JFK was killed.

254
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,740
He's got a Jersey connection.

255
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,040
It's hilarious.

256
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,020
And these guys all end up in Jersey at some point because it's funny.

257
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:28,560
Yeah.

258
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:30,500
Anyway.

259
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,900
So you got any questions for tonight or nothing really flying by?

260
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:37,659
Well, you know, I didn't see any heavy questions.

261
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,600
I want to thank Mr. McFadden, though, because I meant to thank him last time and I didn't

262
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,140
get to it.

263
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:49,440
And I just wanted to say thanks a lot because not too often do people even acknowledge me

264
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,160
and I appreciate it.

265
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,320
So I wanted to acknowledge you.

266
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,180
All right.

267
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,840
And moving forward.

268
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,620
I did notice it in the chat.

269
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,460
Somebody mentioned something about aliens.

270
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,760
And I know you and I had to talk about this a long time ago, like about these concepts.

271
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:05,520
And of course, it was in the news just like it was last year, the year before.

272
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,720
Maybe maybe it's been two years now where that guy went to Congress and said, look,

273
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,340
you know, we got aliens and this and that.

274
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,040
And then everybody.

275
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,500
It's not what.

276
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,320
No, no, it's always going to be the opposite.

277
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,600
The reality of it and what you what they're talking about.

278
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,520
You know, government.

279
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,160
Who are you from the government?

280
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:21,800
Government.

281
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:22,700
Yeah.

282
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,320
Yeah.

283
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,180
They don't know.

284
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,380
It's always going to be the opposite.

285
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,560
It always was, you know, up until FDR, FDR, maybe a little after they were quite honest.

286
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:37,120
Like, you know, when the U.S. was bankrupted, FDR did his fireside chats on the radio every

287
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,340
night.

288
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,700
And if you listen to those fireside chats, he's asking, he's pleading with the people

289
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,380
to participate in the new system.

290
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,640
We need you know, we need for you to volunteer.

291
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:45,460
Right.

292
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,420
That's why when you're 18, they send you a W-9 form.

293
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:48,720
Everybody.

294
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:49,740
Oh, you have to fill out.

295
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,560
You don't have to do any of it.

296
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:58,160
So after FDR, where they captured most of the population, they got very comfortable about

297
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,720
just flipping everything.

298
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,160
Like I said, it's part of the control mechanism.

299
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,780
If they put out a bunch of bullshit, most people believe it.

300
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,780
How much do you have to invest in the control system?

301
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,860
You don't.

302
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,920
They're getting the quote unquote powers that be have it real cheap.

303
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,920
You know, even though they're spending billions or trillions on the propaganda, they don't

304
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,400
have to put out a Stasi or secret police so much, you know, or, you know, enforcers like

305
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,120
like other times in other places.

306
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:27,060
You know, the control apparatus is very cheap for them.

307
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,700
Just the media.

308
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,060
Yeah.

309
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:28,900
Just put up bullshit.

310
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:29,240
Yeah.

311
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,820
You don't have to put out brown shirts anymore.

312
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,320
I mean, it's just not necessary.

313
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,780
Brown shirts or black shirts.

314
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,060
Right.

315
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,700
And yeah.

316
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,720
No, none of that.

317
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,060
But, you know, with the brown shirts, actually, they were gray shirts first, the technocrats.

318
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:40,360
Right.

319
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,620
And they swear.

320
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,720
And they lost just like the Russian revolution.

321
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,300
It was a white revolution and became, you know, once they were done, they got rid of them

322
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,320
with the red revolution.

323
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:48,840
Right.

324
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,100
You know, it's just like now it's going to happen with all this woke stuff that they

325
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,300
did to unsettle everyone.

326
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,500
They're going to go after them.

327
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,800
You know, the actual same.

328
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,560
It seemed like the establishment was going woke.

329
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,480
Now the establishment is going to go anti woke and very racist.

330
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,480
Right.

331
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,740
With a religious flair to it.

332
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,940
You know, of course, I've always said for years that we're going to go into an ultra

333
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:16,040
conservative viewpoint because eventually, you know, use biblical law as the law

334
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,020
directly improperly.

335
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,200
So you're going to see that.

336
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:27,500
But you're going to go through a type of almost almost almost as bad as when you go

337
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,640
to a donut shop, they'll have two windows, one for blacks, one for whites.

338
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,500
It's almost going to get that bad.

339
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,880
And you're like, that sounds really crazy.

340
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,460
Those, you know, like the days down south, you know.

341
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,060
Yeah.

342
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,800
It's going to get that.

343
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,400
They're going to create a not race war, but animosity.

344
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,680
You know, you know, war.

345
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,680
You can have animosity and not have war.

346
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,380
And you can have war without animosity.

347
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,200
Just propaganda.

348
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,940
We're going to start seeing a lot of racial stuff coming up now.

349
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,340
Big time again next few years.

350
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,180
We got it now.

351
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,140
I mean, it's really right now.

352
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,620
It's just that it hasn't.

353
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,000
It's not in your face.

354
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,440
See, like the woke stuff was around since Obama.

355
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,680
People don't realize that.

356
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,220
Of course.

357
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,060
Yeah.

358
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,300
So so maybe when you say we got it now, maybe in that sense.

359
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,320
But no, it's going to get pretty bad.

360
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,820
That worse than it's been in, let's say, 50, 60 years.

361
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:14,680
Look anymore.

362
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:19,880
There's a big difference between what is on the ground in most of places.

363
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,340
OK.

364
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,960
And what they're telling us is on the ground in most places.

365
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,320
OK.

366
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:25,860
That's the thing.

367
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,560
You know, like the impression they keep giving about, you know, there's crime everywhere.

368
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,220
There was always crime everywhere.

369
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,980
But in fact, it's actually not as bad as it used to be.

370
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,060
And they're making it sound worse.

371
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,960
You know, this is always the manipulation.

372
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:40,600
Right.

373
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,060
You get people nervous.

374
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,140
You get them worked up about stuff.

375
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,140
You point to a couple of bad examples and you make it seem like it's happening everywhere.

376
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:53,180
It's like, you know, the summer of George Floyd, the whole country was on fire, according to some people.

377
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,740
And it was not.

378
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,640
It was not.

379
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:07,340
And look, being in Brooklyn, like off of Vanderbilt, Pacific and Underhill Avenue there back in the 80s, I had a shop where we did industrial.

380
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,420
We did artistic sculpture and stuff.

381
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,700
And the landlord pretty much let us stay there for free because he was like a white landlord.

382
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,920
And he knew that if no one occupied the building, the chances are someone will throw a brick through the window and light the place on fire.

383
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:28,000
So it was better for us to have one of the top floor and make it look like it's called occupied so that people don't burn.

384
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:34,820
Anyway, there was every week there was someone being gunned down in the street or like some serious stuff.

385
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,300
Like a guy walking around with a knife sticking out of his side for like half an hour.

386
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,740
He couldn't pull it out.

387
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,500
It was that deep.

388
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,120
None of this, by the way, none of this stuff made it to, quote unquote, the news at all.

389
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,380
Underhill Avenue.

390
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:54,980
And yeah, this is called the border of Brownsville and Brooklyn in the 80s.

391
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,660
And very, very rough.

392
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,240
I have a quick story I'm going to count.

393
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,960
I could tell you back in the late 70s, early 80s.

394
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,880
Actually, I'd say it was 1980, 1980.

395
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,300
I kind of left home.

396
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,120
I was 15.

397
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,960
I went on my own and tried it out.

398
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:17,560
And this guy, Richard, a Jamaican family, took me in.

399
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,300
It was actually him, his brother and his mom, single mom.

400
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:27,860
And it was off of 140th and Convent Avenue in Harlem.

401
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,820
But you and I were in the same neighborhood in 1980 then.

402
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,320
Because, yeah, OK.

403
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,980
And I stayed there for about a month.

404
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,640
But this is the interesting part.

405
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,900
When I came back to Park Slope or other parts of Brooklyn and I told people where I lived,

406
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,320
they thought I was going to get killed because I was living in a black neighborhood in Harlem.

407
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,640
But I used to go to the Boys Club over there.

408
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:49,280
I used to go to the Boys Club over there because that's where business got done.

409
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,920
Anyway, please, go ahead.

410
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,540
So it's a big hill on the side.

411
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,080
Everything is...

412
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,780
It kind of gives you a feeling.

413
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,720
You don't even feel like you're in Manhattan when you're there.

414
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,240
No, not at all.

415
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,480
It feels more like the Bronx or something.

416
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:12,020
So anyway, the apartment off of there was a huge apartment.

417
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:17,220
And when you go through the long hallway to the entrance to get back, to get up,

418
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,340
I found that if I...

419
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,220
Instead of going on the front of the street,

420
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:25,040
if I went through the back of the other street, through the alley, real short,

421
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,820
I could go through the back door and the elevator was right there.

422
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,360
It was really quick instead of going through the entrance way.

423
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,120
So one day I'm going where I was staying.

424
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,720
And I go through the back door and it was never really locked.

425
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,860
And I opened the door and there's about three or four guys, black guys,

426
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,400
I'll just say it that way, melanated,

427
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,160
sitting at the step.

428
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,220
They were rolling an L.

429
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,400
And they saw me and they dropped the L, they dropped the weed,

430
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,020
they dropped everything and ran.

431
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,300
Because they thought I was, you know, Tracy or something.

432
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,340
I got you.

433
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,320
By the way, the nickname for 5-0 or police was Tracy.

434
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,080
Right?

435
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:04,960
So...

436
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,300
Even...

437
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:10,060
When I went over to the more Jamaican neighborhood,

438
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,560
what was that?

439
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,500
It was sort of like a Jamaican enclave in Harlem.

440
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,040
It wasn't Harlem proper, as they told me.

441
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:19,960
But...

442
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,460
Some people called it Little Haiti, but yeah, that too.

443
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,140
Yeah, it could be.

444
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,460
And when they saw me walking down the street,

445
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,780
you hear the Jamaicans,

446
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,820
they go, John Wayne in the area, man.

447
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,240
John Wayne in the area.

448
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,140
Right?

449
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:32,980
That's a white guy.

450
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,780
Yeah, meaning me.

451
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,520
John Wayne is to the Jamaican crowd,

452
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,020
is the police called John Wayne.

453
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,720
And he's the white guy, he's the sheriff.

454
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,160
Yeah, the white guy, yeah.

455
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,560
So I'd walk by them,

456
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,220
John Wayne in the area, man.

457
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,700
And by the way, I know it doesn't make sense to call Little Haiti

458
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,740
when there's Jamaicans around,

459
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,000
but trust me, that's what people did.

460
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,580
No, that's rough.

461
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,200
So Haitians are very rough.

462
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:57,840
Yes, they are.

463
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,160
And you can't tell.

464
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,640
I mean, I remember I met some Haitians

465
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,320
and the guy was like, you know,

466
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,119
kind of like olive toned, green eyes,

467
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,560
you know, kind of brownish hair.

468
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:09,700
Yeah, very mixed.

469
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:10,260
Very mixed.

470
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:13,579
And he introduces me to this guy

471
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:15,300
who's really dark skinned and tall

472
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,579
as his brother.

473
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,400
And I'm like, how could that,

474
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,180
you know, you guys don't look anything alike.

475
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,200
You know?

476
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,000
But anyway.

477
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,119
So, yeah.

478
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,720
So here I am.

479
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,820
My white friends think I'm going to get killed in Harlem.

480
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,880
And the people in Harlem think I'm the police.

481
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,820
And I mean, these guys,

482
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,460
they just, you know,

483
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,920
they drop the weed, they drop the L.

484
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,540
The L is a joint or a blunt, you know,

485
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,240
people, I don't know if you,

486
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,500
that's old school.

487
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,480
I don't know, do they even use,

488
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,580
do you ever heard that terminology,

489
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,360
calling it L?

490
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,140
Well, I used to hear it called a J a lot,

491
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,400
but L, I guess.

492
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,000
Drop the L.

493
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,800
Yeah, anyway.

494
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,800
You could roll a L, right?

495
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,100
Or a Dutch.

496
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,940
Or a White Owl.

497
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,580
Can you skill me in L?

498
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,360
Yep.

499
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,360
Yo, son, can you skill me in L?

500
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,360
That's because it's a loose L.

501
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,220
E-L-L.

502
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,260
It's because it's a loose cigar is what it is.

503
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,520
And then it ended up being, you know,

504
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,040
but then Lucy's ended up being the cigarettes.

505
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,040
So why would I walk by

506
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,340
and they dropped everything and run?

507
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:13,900
Right, why?

508
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,840
Because they're going to kill me?

509
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:16,580
No.

510
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,000
So in other words,

511
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,620
I'm bringing this up.

512
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,180
It's an account.

513
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,500
And these are stories you can even create

514
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,720
off of these accounts and expand on them

515
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,940
in several instances where

516
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,200
I was like, oh, maybe I'll get killed,

517
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:30,740
but I don't care.

518
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,680
If I get killed this way, I deserve it.

519
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,840
I must have done something stupid

520
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,780
and I shouldn't be stupid.

521
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,740
But I noticed that, quote unquote,

522
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,040
they were afraid of me,

523
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:40,900
who they are.

524
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,160
Melanated people, the Jamaicans

525
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,340
and the American black people

526
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,680
were not afraid,

527
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,180
but they didn't want.

528
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,540
It's like, you know,

529
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,880
we're doing something that you

530
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,220
shouldn't do in front of the popo.

531
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,940
You shouldn't do it in front of him

532
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,900
because we don't know.

533
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,120
So, oh, my gosh.

534
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,380
And, you know, and I went that was a

535
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,980
really that was a very good adjustment

536
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,360
for me coming from, quote unquote,

537
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,420
middle class, upper middle class,

538
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,360
almost white neighborhood

539
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,220
where, quote unquote, dark people

540
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,020
were dangerous.

541
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,880
I found that when I went to their

542
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,500
world, I was dangerous.

543
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:14,940
Right.

544
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,440
Oh, my gosh.

545
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,860
And that was good at 15.

546
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,040
I learned that was that set me

547
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,300
better off because most people

548
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,900
quote unquote white people will

549
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,920
never, especially mid suburban

550
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,160
America, whatever, will never

551
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,840
figure will never figure out what

552
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,440
I just told you.

553
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:28,700
Ever.

554
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,560
They'll go through their whole

555
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,400
lives thinking you go to a

556
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,500
neighborhood of dark skinned

557
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,660
people, you're in trouble.

558
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,540
See, they that's how they spend

559
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:36,860
their life.

560
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,440
So it was a very good adjustment

561
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,860
and I would very often share this

562
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,620
throughout my life with people

563
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,800
when they ask me about race

564
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,300
relations and things like that.

565
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,560
So, no, it's the misunderstood

566
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,600
part of it, you know, at least

567
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,420
that's the way it used to work.

568
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,420
Now, I got to tell you, things

569
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,020
have shifted.

570
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,060
It doesn't quite work that way

571
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:55,380
anymore.

572
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,740
This is before rap culture.

573
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,100
Right.

574
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,720
In other words, there was no

575
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,960
thug. There was rap called his

576
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,140
grandmaster Flash.

577
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:02,860
Right.

578
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:03,900
The Furious Five.

579
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:04,600
That's about it.

580
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:04,920
Yeah.

581
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,200
But I mean, this is just guys

582
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,580
talking about how great they are,

583
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,060
you know, with a record.

584
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,040
I mean, there's no subculture

585
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,740
didn't come out yet.

586
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,340
We're just to be, you know,

587
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:13,580
because.

588
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:13,880
Yeah.

589
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,220
Yeah.

590
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,280
It was just straight up going to

591
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,460
beat somebody down, going to

592
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:16,960
grab some.

593
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,220
You know, it wasn't that it was.

594
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:18,720
I knew.

595
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,920
Yeah, I knew it was going to go

596
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,660
not to blame Wu Tang, but

597
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,080
they made it really dark.

598
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,700
We were riding our bikes on

599
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,540
Canal Street going across to go

600
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,440
to the east side, get the

601
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,040
Brooklyn Bridge.

602
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,040
This is about 1990.

603
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,180
And says, yo, let's go down and

604
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:33,880
get some tapes.

605
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,680
Wu Tang.

606
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:35,920
They're there tonight.

607
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:36,860
You know, whatever someone

608
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,960
tapes and sell tapes every

609
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,680
Thursday or whatever.

610
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,120
So I heard a sample sounded

611
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,260
terrible, you know, like no

612
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:42,860
fidelity.

613
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,300
And I don't know one of the

614
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,120
guy.

615
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,780
He's like a guy.

616
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,140
This is how it sounds.

617
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,380
It's good for you.

618
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,320
It's good for you, man.

619
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,380
You know, and this is before Wu

620
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,220
Tang was anybody's

621
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:55,740
anything.

622
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,400
You know, you were selling tapes

623
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,880
on Canal Street for ten dollars.

624
00:20:59,140 --> 00:20:59,320
Right.

625
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,240
And I had one up until I moved

626
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,760
to Tucson, original from them,

627
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,460
because I don't think they hit

628
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,680
the scene till ninety two,

629
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,740
ninety three, something like

630
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,860
that, maybe even ninety four.

631
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:08,340
I don't know.

632
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,760
That's when they got big, you

633
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,500
know, but they were on the scene

634
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,920
around 90, 89, 90.

635
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:13,740
Yeah.

636
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,700
But prior to that, the L.A.

637
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,300
thing was bigger.

638
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,060
The West Coast, you know, was

639
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,060
bigger because they had better

640
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:19,540
production.

641
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,940
Bottom line, they did.

642
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,940
They had better sound.

643
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:23,980
You know what I mean?

644
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:24,820
Yeah, they did.

645
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,060
Yeah.

646
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,140
It's about for me, it was sound

647
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:26,540
quality.

648
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,500
And, you know, was it something

649
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,980
that had, you know, was it

650
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,340
cogent?

651
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,540
You know, it was understandable

652
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:32,940
and pleasant.

653
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,420
You see what good music is, what

654
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:35,920
sounds good.

655
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,960
If it doesn't sound good, it's

656
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,120
not.

657
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,120
It's genre comes second for me.

658
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,380
If it sounds good, it is good.

659
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,780
But anyway, we got off on that.

660
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,420
I think because it's going to be

661
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,800
some bizarreness coming in the

662
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,340
future, it's all unnecessary.

663
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,020
Pretty much everybody gets along

664
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:51,620
just fine.

665
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,720
And I think I've also mentioned

666
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,500
in terms of race relations in my

667
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,680
life, I've run across some

668
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,360
prominent, but fairly prominent,

669
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,900
quote, unquote, black people

670
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,560
that were wealthy, well

671
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,860
established engineers

672
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,560
and things like that.

673
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,780
And they've told me the

674
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,920
other side of what is it?

675
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,000
I think I've gone over this

676
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,520
before.

677
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,360
The affirmation.

678
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,440
What's it called when you have to

679
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,340
hire minorities?

680
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,080
I don't like that word, but

681
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,360
not for me.

682
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:21,560
Not

683
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:23,860
affirmative.

684
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,620
Affirmative action.

685
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:25,920
Yeah.

686
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,200
That was not because they were

687
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:28,840
disadvantaged.

688
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,220
It was because they noticed that

689
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,580
the white middle America,

690
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,940
middle aged white man running

691
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,700
industry and all of business was

692
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,560
kind of incestuous in terms

693
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,100
of that culture was going to fall

694
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,660
apart and they were going to lose

695
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,160
their edge.

696
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,180
You know, the banking, the

697
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,700
industrial, especially industrial

698
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,860
design, engineering,

699
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,840
all these white guys

700
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,960
working and running everything.

701
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,040
You need cultural infusion.

702
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,160
So they wouldn't do it.

703
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,480
They wouldn't hire people

704
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,520
that weren't white.

705
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,660
You know, big engineering firms,

706
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,080
engineers in Detroit, you know,

707
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,600
big insurance companies, you know,

708
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,120
all this stuff.

709
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,440
The tops of, let's say, the tops

710
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,600
of industry, you know, they just

711
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,400
hired white guys out of, you know,

712
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,940
good schools and never hired

713
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:15,020
people from, you know, East India

714
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,960
or melanated people or,

715
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,220
you know what I mean, or Asians.

716
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:19,600
Never.

717
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,740
So when the affirmative action

718
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,820
came out and gave incentive,

719
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,960
people think it was to assist a

720
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,880
disenfranchised group of people.

721
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:28,200
Right.

722
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,820
This may be one way it can be put.

723
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,120
Right.

724
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:30,460
Yeah.

725
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,900
And it has nothing to do with it

726
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,240
at all.

727
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,460
What it had to do was preventing

728
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,000
this white culture from imploding

729
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,620
on itself, put in some extra,

730
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,840
extra, let's say,

731
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,560
extra cultural,

732
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,740
extra traditional values

733
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,480
and ways of looking at things.

734
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,140
And it did work.

735
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,540
And I got this from a guy who was

736
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,260
a civil engineer.

737
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,560
He's one of the two or three guys

738
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,620
that designed, which I'm not happy

739
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,260
with, was the I-10,

740
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,900
that big route around Georgia

741
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,180
and Houston, Texas, all the

742
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:57,800
highways there.

743
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:58,360
OK.

744
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,240
They laid all that out.

745
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,360
And it was a big project.

746
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,420
You know, like if you go across

747
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,700
and you have to go through Houston,

748
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,040
you have to go through Atlanta.

749
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:07,420
Right.

750
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,960
So when you're driving.

751
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,360
So it did all this stuff.

752
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,800
And he made me aware of how the he

753
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,240
was no.

754
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,160
He was in his late 70s 10 years

755
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:16,460
ago.

756
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,700
But he let me know basically how

757
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,860
white America and industry and

758
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,380
business was imploding on itself

759
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,820
because it needed some flavor.

760
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,400
You know, it had.

761
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,180
Right.

762
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,600
Just a bunch of white guys

763
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,600
couldn't figure something out.

764
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,540
That means it can't be figured

765
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,620
out. They need to bring in a

766
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,560
brother or somebody, you know,

767
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,440
somebody from another culture

768
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,860
that has a different way of

769
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,420
seeing things.

770
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:37,980
And it does.

771
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:38,680
It is important.
