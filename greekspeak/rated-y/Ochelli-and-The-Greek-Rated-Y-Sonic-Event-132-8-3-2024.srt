1
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:12,880
It's amazing that I'm being held on a project so long, it seems to be so worthless.

2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,900
But anyway, what did I just say?

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,320
Anyway, we'll edit that part out.

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,980
No, no, no, we won't.

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,960
But I don't feel as though it's worthless at all.

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,100
I think every time we've touched upon something that is worthwhile, we've answered lots of

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:27,580
questions.

8
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,920
Is there anything in the chat recently that catches your eye, by the way?

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,180
Because we do have a little chat in case somebody's listening and doesn't know about it.

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:35,620
Okay.

11
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:37,660
No problem.

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,720
I got a recent message about...

13
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,700
Yeah, yeah, there is.

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:41,680
Oh, okay.

15
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:42,080
Go ahead.

16
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,180
Yeah, go ahead.

17
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:44,400
Okay.

18
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:44,900
I got a recent...

19
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,140
No, looking at the chat.

20
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:46,800
Okay.

21
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,680
This is miscuing.

22
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,040
Sure.

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:51,340
Go ahead.

24
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,040
Looking at the chat.

25
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:52,520
Go ahead.

26
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:52,820
You go.

27
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:59,400
I don't recall anything really to whatever, but addressing at the moment, but go for it.

28
00:00:59,500 --> 00:00:59,680
Okay.

29
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,600
I'll look at it.

30
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,840
Go for the other questions.

31
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,060
Yeah.

32
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:02,780
No problem.

33
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,580
I got a message about dreams because a long time ago we had talked about dreams and they

34
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:12,920
mentioned that you had referenced how plants are in a dream state, et cetera, et cetera.

35
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:21,440
And their question was, what is to stop us from maybe finding out that this world, the

36
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,300
way it is, the fact that we have this odd connection to memory and the way we dream

37
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,240
and all that kind of stuff, that we're not actually in a dream state at this point?

38
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:34,420
That really real life begins after this visit to this place.

39
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,780
Is that not a possibility?

40
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,300
And that was the question for you.

41
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,760
What was your response on that?

42
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,920
It goes back to...

43
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:48,060
I think I dropped a serious bomb a while back, maybe a while, like three, four sonics ago,

44
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,800
that I know the meaning of life.

45
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,120
Right.

46
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,660
And you don't, ha, ha, ha.

47
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,880
And it's just that everyone is here to waste everyone's time.

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,080
Let me just give you a little example.

49
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:04,200
So take some common oaf off the street, works in a UAW, which is the Factory Workers for

50
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,480
Auto Workers Union.

51
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,260
United Auto Workers.

52
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,620
25, yeah, 25, 30 years.

53
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,880
He does okay.

54
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:11,320
He's got all the benefits, whatever.

55
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,000
Then he retires and takes on a train hobby, make sure he gets all his blood pressure and

56
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,160
diabetes medication, whatever, and then he dies.

57
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,540
You mean a model train hobby?

58
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:21,280
Yeah.

59
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:27,120
And these cars, by the way, these trains, yeah, these cars that he's building are 130 year

60
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,760
old technology, virtually no improvement over 130 years.

61
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,140
Maybe a little bit that's worth, that's laughable.

62
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:39,640
Now, if you can't tell me anybody, now replace the factory worker with a doctor, a lawyer,

63
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,820
a priest, a construction worker, whatever, and tell me it's any different for them.

64
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,280
Right.

65
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,620
Now, let's go back to the more personal situation.

66
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:50,920
Okay.

67
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,940
You have a wife, can't fucking stand her.

68
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:59,000
She can't stand you, but you have some kind of an agreement that you compensate for each

69
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,340
other.

70
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,400
You quote unquote love each other, even though either one of you don't even know what love

71
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:03,660
is.

72
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,340
How do I know that?

73
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,680
Just ask somebody what love is.

74
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,160
They don't know.

75
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:14,080
And now, if that's not a waste of time, children, parents, parents, how do they raise their

76
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,420
children?

77
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,580
Oh, you do what I did.

78
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,100
Now, what are the chances?

79
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,200
I'm going to do with you what was done with me.

80
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:24,640
What are the chances that parents did not have their, that their lives were not wasted

81
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,240
while they were children by their parents?

82
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,460
And it continues and it continues.

83
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:33,440
You can give me a cross section of any fucking situation and I will show you how it is just

84
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,340
wasting time.

85
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,060
Matter of fact, over time with parents, the only thing that I can observe is that we do

86
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:43,060
discover, and I see this generationally and I say this as someone who is a parent, is

87
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,200
that we just find new ways to screw things up.

88
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,720
That's that's right.

89
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,120
But it's not.

90
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,080
I'm going to try to get into parenthood here.

91
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,400
It's any scenario.

92
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,200
So go up to a daffodil rose.

93
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,340
Let's just stick with the plants.

94
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:55,960
We're at the place.

95
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,340
And what's the meaning of life?

96
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,280
Well, I'm just here.

97
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,300
Right.

98
00:03:59,560 --> 00:03:59,800
OK.

99
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,320
I mean, what could be more than that?

100
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,520
A rose by any other name is still a rose.

101
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:03,800
Right.

102
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,520
It's no different than that.

103
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:11,340
So the thing that we like to make up stories to ourselves because we don't even know what

104
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,300
we we think we have an inner voice.

105
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,900
You don't have an inner voice.

106
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,120
That's given to you.

107
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:16,640
It's planted.

108
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,800
Speaking of which, a little segue, I did the past few days, I'm doing a super deep dive

109
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,680
where I do a deep dive and stuff.

110
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,200
I mean, like I'll have three hours sleep in three days or two days, which is not a lot.

111
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:30,420
Right.

112
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,660
So in other words, I keep going all day till four thirty in the morning.

113
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,260
I sleep till seven and I'm at it till three in the morning the next day, sleep till six

114
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,500
and I'm at it till the next day.

115
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:39,880
Right.

116
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,700
Like three hours of sleep tops.

117
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,380
Right.

118
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:42,640
OK.

119
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,700
I've been doing this for a little while now on trust law.

120
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,900
And if anyone wants to get into more of the side that I'm looking at is a guy named Christopher

121
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,980
Houser, H-A-U-S-E-R.

122
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,140
He's on the mark.

123
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,720
He does it again, just like the Brandon Joe Williams guy.

124
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,080
He's leaving out some stuff.

125
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:04,660
I don't endorse Houser's, but he's the closest that I've seen on operating trust.

126
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:09,820
So I'll give some examples and you'll see what's going on more with the wasting of

127
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,820
time and how everyone's a millionaire and they don't know it and how people are too

128
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,780
shaky and too stupid to be able to utilize it because of conditioning.

129
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,760
I'll give you another example.

130
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,600
The police are not law enforcement, they're perception enforcement.

131
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,820
So if the TV, the church and says that, you know, you have to do this, the police stop

132
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,000
you because you're not doing it.

133
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,040
They're correct because the general perception, just like 9-11.

134
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:41,200
It's a fact that if you discuss the 9-11 event, the opening events always start off with whoever

135
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,480
had perceived the event or witnessed the event on television, airplanes being shown going

136
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,020
into the building.

137
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:47,680
That's fact.

138
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:53,980
So what is also a fact is that whoever was boots on the ground within visual proximity

139
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,600
of the World Trade Center was happened to be looking in that direction at a time, merely

140
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,740
saw the sides of the buildings explode out.

141
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,940
There was no sound of a plane, no visible confirmation of a plane by anyone.

142
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,520
Fact.

143
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:11,540
There's another fact that back to the TV, there were people on the ground posing as

144
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:16,660
bystanders and utility workers saying that the planes went into the towers stacked.

145
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,000
Those people also seen in various shootings across the country.

146
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,860
Same people, Colorado, Florida, Connecticut.

147
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,860
Those people were giving witnesses on various shootings that were supposed to be posed as

148
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,580
local people.

149
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:29,860
Right.

150
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:30,700
Fact.

151
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:31,880
So do you see how?

152
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:32,440
OK.

153
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,980
So now, Greek, are you saying that one thing didn't have it?

154
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:35,300
No, no.

155
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,800
I'm giving you the facts to sort it out.

156
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,320
Right.

157
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:44,160
So the big one is, for example, it's a fact.

158
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,120
Again, back to 9-11.

159
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,420
Anyone who witnessed the event on television saw planes penetrating the towers, which would

160
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,460
normally be impossible.

161
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,360
How do you know it's an impossible?

162
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,420
Anyone that works in aircraft structure, aircraft structures knows that when a plane crashes,

163
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,660
the tail section falls off, doesn't matter how slow or how fast it goes.

164
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,620
That's why in the military or people flying the plane, I was sitting back because first

165
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,160
thing I have is the tail section breaks off.

166
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:09,360
Right.

167
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,000
It's just a fit.

168
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,020
I can get into it.

169
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,680
Has to do with compound inertia and all that stuff.

170
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,240
And you can't build the structure if you build a structure.

171
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,340
So the tail section doesn't fall off immediately.

172
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:24,400
It's not cost effective to fly the thing around.

173
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:24,700
Right.

174
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,420
It's too heavy.

175
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:25,860
OK.

176
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,680
So because, you know, in airplanes, if it costs less than five hundred dollars to remove a

177
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,060
pound, do it because it's going to cost more than five hundred dollars in fuel to fly the

178
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:33,800
stupid thing around.

179
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:37,700
You know, whatever you're adding or taking away for for a high altitude, what they call

180
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,120
space.

181
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,680
It's thirty thousand dollars.

182
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,900
So if you're working on the space shuttle, if it costs thirty thousand dollars or less

183
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,860
to take off pound, take that fucking pound off because it's going to cost you more than

184
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,380
that fuel.

185
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:47,620
Right.

186
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,240
You see how it works.

187
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:48,580
Right.

188
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,100
OK.

189
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:49,420
OK.

190
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:53,660
Insurance works the same way when you're in a public building and like there's something

191
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,000
that's going to fall off the building and hit someone in the public.

192
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,900
They look at it and they say, oh, what's our insurance?

193
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:04,000
Is it cheaper to to let someone get hit and get insurance claim or is it cheaper to fix

194
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,620
it because insurance?

195
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,200
Well, you see, that's how everything is based on this number scheme.

196
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,340
Cost benefit analysis.

197
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:09,700
Yeah.

198
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,040
Yeah.

199
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,620
So you see the dangers in public and they don't fix it because it's it's more expensive

200
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,940
than the insurance claim would be.

201
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:15,620
So they don't care.

202
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,600
So there's this analysis thing.

203
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,580
So this is when you ask me about the dream thing, it's about the same thing.

204
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:27,320
So I've done several protocols on Greek speak where I've gone over food.

205
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:33,000
I've gone over spiritual stuff, soul stuff, which is medical stuff, by the way.

206
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:37,140
Now, that's a new one because, first of all, no one knows the definition of soul and spirit

207
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:37,919
that they're different.

208
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,659
And I say no one with very little exception.

209
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,660
When we speak about the human body and medical stuff, that's soul stuff, metabolite.

210
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:44,860
Right.

211
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,200
OK.

212
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,000
And body stuff together.

213
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,960
Because when you're if the soul, if the body doesn't have a soul, it doesn't matter.

214
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,700
It's just dense meat.

215
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,860
You end up on the supermarket.

216
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:53,580
All right.

217
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,740
Wrapped in plastic or whatever.

218
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:00,160
So we've talked about all these things and those are actually miniature protocols.

219
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,640
Now, the dream aspect of it, when you go back to this is your weight.

220
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:11,620
OK, there's some kind of a movie set situation where some authority producer would director

221
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,660
finance, whatever, has set up a situation where we have to be on this place called

222
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,040
Earth.

223
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:24,000
The way society is just to fill something, some purpose, just like extras, right?

224
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,340
Just like extras in the movie.

225
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,860
And then it gets blown up and redone again.

226
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,320
Who cares?

227
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:27,600
Right.

228
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,520
But it looks real.

229
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,320
But it's not.

230
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:30,880
It looks real.

231
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,700
But it's not.

232
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,220
Right.

233
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:38,160
So the other aspect of dreaming, I would I would just go.

234
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:47,180
If you could find Isak, who is it, Isak, who wrote Swinging the Wild Pendulum, Bentov.

235
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:53,900
He says him and also a few other people in that study of like paranormal research or

236
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:58,300
the mind and consciousness, they can't really put their finger on it.

237
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,860
But what they have seen enough evidence of is that we're asleep, we're actually our consciousness

238
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,380
is being used elsewhere.

239
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,720
Now, there's so many excuses and reasons for sleeping.

240
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,660
You know, you can kill someone if they don't.

241
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,760
If you don't sleep for seven days, you'll probably die.

242
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,260
You need that recuperation time.

243
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,700
What's one third of your life?

244
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,260
Right.

245
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:15,800
Right.

246
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,260
So if you live 90 years, you spent 30 years asleep.

247
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:18,540
Right.

248
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,780
And that's a stalking, stalking the wild, stalking the wild pendulum.

249
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,140
Thank you.

250
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,300
So.

251
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,160
So you're being the consciousness has been in Donald Marshall with the cloning makes

252
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:29,720
total sense.

253
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,480
Of course, the consciousness transfer and all that.

254
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,960
So the dream is something in between.

255
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:39,320
But you have to have already worked out who you are, meaning physically, mentally, spiritually.

256
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,080
And you've already have to work out the inner voice.

257
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:46,360
In other words, if you hear an inner voice in your head and it sounds like you and your

258
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,580
voice, that's not you.

259
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:53,500
Your inner dialogue is without words, sort of how it was before you learned the language.

260
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,900
Think about if you can remember when you were an infant before you knew the language, what

261
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:02,300
kind of dialogue this is a shortcut, by the way, what kind of dialogue you had internally

262
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,840
before you knew any language at all.

263
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:10,520
Most people can't recall that much because the physical size of the brain cannot access

264
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,640
that information, because right now you're a different antenna, just like someone setting

265
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,500
up ham radio.

266
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:19,780
When you set up something for six twenty seven, that antenna, it's not going to work on the

267
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,920
eleven hundred band.

268
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,400
You need another antenna for that.

269
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,400
So you're going to have to go back.

270
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,080
Right.

271
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:24,880
OK, so.

272
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,660
So right now you're brave.

273
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,080
So, yeah, that's where the shrunken head principle comes in.

274
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:35,440
Literally, if you can transfer your head, your spirit into a smaller head, literally

275
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:41,080
a small brain, you will be able to get all your you would even be able to recall being

276
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,440
coming down the birth canal.

277
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,000
Right.

278
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,740
And all that stuff.

279
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,380
So I don't recommend that, but I'm sure it's been experimented with.

280
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:54,420
Now, we don't get any of this technology very often with certain circles that I've intermingled

281
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:54,960
with here.

282
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,060
Like I give an example.

283
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,800
I won't mention a company like Raytheon or anything like that.

284
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,320
I was invited to a party and just various sundry people there.

285
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,280
By the way, someone says they're an engineer.

286
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,920
I'm not going to mention the company Raytheon.

287
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,500
Don't be impressed.

288
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,960
The people in the fucking gift shop are engineers.

289
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:12,700
Right.

290
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,920
There's certain jobs.

291
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:14,660
Right.

292
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,660
Like if someone says, I'm an attorney, you're a fucking officer of the court.

293
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,480
No different than the janitor and the bailiff or whatever.

294
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:20,820
Right.

295
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:21,200
Right.

296
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,640
So if I'm a doctor, you're a fucking medical technician.

297
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:25,620
Yep.

298
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,600
You're a medical technician.

299
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:29,940
Right.

300
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,280
If you don't do these procedures, you know nothing about the human body at all.

301
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,520
Even the brain surgeon, it's procedural.

302
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,720
They're told exactly.

303
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,380
Don't look.

304
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,360
Don't ask questions.

305
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:39,280
Right.

306
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:45,860
So all this overestimating and overdoing, right, is where we're stuck.

307
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,220
Asking all these questions is where we're stuck.

308
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:54,460
So it's basically just a big hole in the wall that we're trying to look through.

309
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,340
But the lights are out on both sides.

310
00:12:59,270 --> 00:12:59,370
Hmm.

311
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,090
Now, is that an answer or not?

312
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,330
No, that is.

313
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:02,690
That is.

314
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:03,830
If you can solve the internal.

315
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:04,190
Yeah.

316
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,770
If you could if you can get rid of that internal voice.

317
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,690
Here's an example of the internal voice, how it works.

318
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:09,170
OK.

319
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:14,290
Remember when you were on Normie, if you ever were and then you got some information about

320
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:18,610
the money system, about the flat earth, about anything that got you out of that normie phase

321
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:23,530
about like taxes don't pay for anything or the human body is more like or something that

322
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:28,590
or 9-11 was a conspiracy where everyone really thinks it was 19 Arab hijackers with box cutters

323
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,850
that vaporize those buildings.

324
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:30,210
Right.

325
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:30,950
Right.

326
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:37,250
So when you got out of the normie phase where you just blatantly accept anything and you're

327
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:43,130
just a vegetable, really a walking vegetable and you started getting into, quote unquote,

328
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:51,810
what's being awake and more searching where you can wear the badge of honor being called

329
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,870
a conspiracy theorist or something.

330
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:54,750
OK.

331
00:13:55,110 --> 00:14:02,030
For about a week to a month at that point, you had incredible clarity and your inner

332
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:08,410
voice was very calm and peaceful and almost not there, because at that point, the being

333
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:14,370
that was providing you your inner voice as a normie had a certain has a certain level

334
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:14,690
or whatever.

335
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:20,030
When you start discovering other things about this reality, that being is too dumb to feed

336
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,410
you to keep you in check.

337
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,470
So they have to switch the being.

338
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:28,690
They have to get another one more advanced that's already been indoctrinated that being

339
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:32,550
that spiritual entities are indoctrinated in the new group that you're going into.

340
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:33,490
Right.

341
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:34,170
Right.

342
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,810
The fringe element, the alternative.

343
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:36,210
Right.

344
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:36,810
OK, whatever.

345
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:40,930
So until they find one, very rarely is there an immediate replacement.

346
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:43,310
Very rarely, like within a minute or a day or a week.

347
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:43,870
Very rarely.

348
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,890
It's usually about a week.

349
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,030
That's why I gave you up to a month.

350
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:51,150
You'll notice that after about a week or a month of learning these new things and wanting

351
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:54,450
to go in a new direction, realize that everything you were taught was a lot worse.

352
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,810
Most of the things you were taught was a lie.

353
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:02,790
You have this incredible clarity and then you start to take on this new feeling of potential

354
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:09,210
either fear or despair, uncertainty, doubt, and the voice comes back, but it's in a different

355
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:09,910
dialogue.

356
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:13,510
And once you transcend that, let's say you go to a higher level.

357
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:18,210
Oh, again, you get that clarity because that being that was giving you, you know, you're

358
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:21,090
one of the alternatives will wake people now you're not asleep anymore.

359
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:27,270
That one's not enough because now you've transcended that that many multitude or subculture within

360
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,010
the main culture.

361
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:32,250
And they have to send another one when you transcend that one a few more times, a few

362
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,050
more like a rocket booster stages.

363
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:38,190
When you get to the final stage, there's very little anymore.

364
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:43,190
There are very few beings, very, very few beings that can, they can replace you with

365
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:48,230
now and what they do to conserve on their side is they give you a being that makes you

366
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:52,450
prescient and actually tells you in your own mind what's going to happen anywhere between

367
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:54,690
the next five seconds to eight minutes in the future.

368
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,610
And those people fall for that and they call themselves psychics.

369
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,130
You're not psychic.

370
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:02,630
Everyone, in other words, everyone has the same psychic ability as everybody else.

371
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:09,790
Your ability to access it as an inner dialogue comes from another being for a little while

372
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:10,510
here at whatever.

373
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:14,590
For a little while, a few years ago, I was able to tell between five to eight seconds

374
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,890
up to five minutes what's going to happen.

375
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:21,290
I mean, specifically to the point where I'm going to tell you in the next, the next car

376
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:28,850
to come down this road is going to be a 1983 Nissan pickup truck, a white color, a boom.

377
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:29,450
There it is.

378
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:30,770
How the fuck do you know that?

379
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,410
Because I'm not falling for it.

380
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:36,410
I know what's going on and UPS is going to knock on the door and the guy's going to say

381
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,610
he's got a package, but he's actually got the wrong address.

382
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:39,070
Hold on.

383
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,190
Wait five minutes later.

384
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:40,790
Knock, knock.

385
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:41,150
Yeah.

386
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:41,610
Yeah.

387
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:41,970
Yeah.

388
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:42,730
That kind of stuff.

389
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:42,970
Yeah.

390
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:43,850
All the time.

391
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,710
I said, no, I'm not falling for this shit.

392
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,510
You guys just leave me alone.

393
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,510
Right now.

394
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,870
This is not a vertical level.

395
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:54,010
This is like when you're in the military and you climb up the ranks.

396
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:54,750
This is lateral.

397
00:16:54,750 --> 00:17:00,370
You're going outside of the pool, right onto the shore and you're trying to dry yourself

398
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:00,850
off.

399
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,610
Everybody's been dipped.

400
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,410
The sheep dipping is actually a term, isn't it?

401
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:05,990
Yes, it is.

402
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:06,670
For the public.

403
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:07,010
Yeah.

404
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:07,970
You look it up.

405
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:08,670
What it means.

406
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,490
And yeah.

407
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:13,349
So the dream thing is very, very, very complex.

408
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:20,550
Now I've gotten into many talks or monologues about Castaneda actually said this too, because

409
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:23,550
a lot of people say, oh, you got some guys in the red kit, never read Castaneda, but recently

410
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:26,109
I've gone through most of his stuff on audio books past two years.

411
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:31,790
If you're in your dream, um, I've said this and I've also, so I haven't heard Castaneda.

412
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:37,630
Maybe he has or hasn't ever noticed when you're in a dream and there's dialogue, you look

413
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,070
at people and their mouths are not moving.

414
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:40,310
Yes.

415
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:44,550
That was a fascinating thing that you brought up to me about, I mean, almost 10 years ago.

416
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:50,810
And I said, you know, that's something I've always noticed, but nobody, nobody ever says

417
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:51,170
that.

418
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,170
But it's true.

419
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:52,450
Yeah.

420
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:52,790
Yeah.

421
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,770
You never see it.

422
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:58,210
You just, you make eye contact and you have a transference of an idea.

423
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:00,230
All of a sudden, you know what's going on.

424
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,610
Nobody's saying anything to you, even if you think they did.

425
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:03,370
That's right.

426
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:06,330
So in other words, what you're doing here is you're catching the man behind the curtain.

427
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:10,050
You're seeing that this is all done as a, as a, as a, as a show for you.

428
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:16,390
You're not actually another reality, but if you're actually building stuff and doing stuff

429
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:20,270
with your hands or your feet, and you can actually see your hands and feet moving, you're

430
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,050
no longer in a dream.

431
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,190
You're an alternate reality.

432
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:26,830
It's kind of like, you can't see the UV spectrum or the infrared.

433
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:32,730
So if you go into a reality, that's UV and infrared, you, you're blind.

434
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:37,930
So what I mean by you're going into another reality, when you see tactile motion with

435
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:43,150
your own appendages and digits, right, you are now, it's not that you're really in a

436
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:43,810
different reality.

437
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:44,610
You're taken from here.

438
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:48,890
What you're doing is you're given UV or x-ray vision now, right?

439
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:49,970
You see?

440
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:54,170
Well, about vision, because I pay very close attention to it in the same types of, you know,

441
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,650
scenarios where I, where I know that the mouths don't move.

442
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:01,970
I can also tell you that my vision is usually in one of two places, either it's within three

443
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,070
feet of me and that's it.

444
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:09,750
There's nothing past that three feet or it is so far wide that it's beyond any experience

445
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,530
in life.

446
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:13,130
It's like miles and miles in all directions.

447
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:14,310
That's the one.

448
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:14,890
Hold on.

449
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:16,010
I want to capture some of that.

450
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:19,950
I don't know if anyone's ever been to a shooting range and if you don't wear goggles, I recommend

451
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,970
you do because bullets can shatter, leaving the muzzle.

452
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,450
Yes, of course.

453
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:25,430
Yeah.

454
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:28,950
So I can also get deposit and also deposits of gas.

455
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:32,630
People think that it's, can also spray back in the eye.

456
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:36,230
The goggles are absolutely necessary to release some sort of protective glasses, right?

457
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:43,610
But if you have ones that do not obscure peripheral vision or without goggles, you can actually

458
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:45,990
see bullets flying from your peripheral vision.

459
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:52,990
But if you ask someone to look and look directly within that 30 or 60 degree vision cone to

460
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,590
see that, did you see the bullet go by?

461
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,390
No, I didn't see it.

462
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,910
But from your peripheral, you can.

463
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:04,230
So your peripheral can actually capture in time, much more information in time per unit

464
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:04,650
of time.

465
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:09,710
So in other words, within that 30 to 60 to 45, let's just get 30 to 45 degree vision

466
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,090
cone.

467
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:13,590
That speed of that bullet is not imperceivable.

468
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:18,470
But through the, beyond that cone, the peripheral, that speed slow seems to slow down.

469
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,570
You could pick up more information at a higher speed.

470
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:24,530
Well, I can tell you that's true from being shot at, because quite honestly, being shot

471
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:28,750
at running away, I can see a bullet whiz past me in my peripheral vision.

472
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:32,370
I don't even have great vision, but I can still see that in my peripheral vision.

473
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:36,630
If I turn to look at the person firing, I don't see the bullets coming out of the gun.

474
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:37,770
I don't.

475
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:43,210
I see a flash or something, or I see, you know, their, their movement when they fire a bullet,

476
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,450
but I don't see the bullet.

477
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:44,950
Yeah.

478
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:49,610
Peripherally though, if it whizzes past me and it's in my side, you know, it's perceivable.

479
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:49,930
Yes.

480
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:50,510
It's perceivable.

481
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:51,170
It's perceivable.

482
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,070
You made the level of detail again.

483
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:53,630
Okay.

484
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,090
So let's go beyond the peripheral.

485
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:55,630
What's that?

486
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,330
Now we're out of sight range completely.

487
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:58,110
Then it's the mind.

488
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:04,490
Now we're going into star Wars episode four, which is the first one where he's practicing

489
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:07,450
with the lightsaber and he says, I'm putting blinder on you, right?

490
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,190
Use the force.

491
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:08,530
Right.

492
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:08,930
Right.

493
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:09,690
Okay.

494
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:10,870
So that's the higher level.

495
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:15,070
And that's where you go in your dream, where you don't need these sensory orgas, which

496
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:19,790
what I like about what Jason Brashear says, they're filters, these, these, what we have.

497
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:24,130
So that's why people who are damaged, either brain damage or perceptual damage, they can

498
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:27,770
hear more, see better because the filter has been changed, right?

499
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,130
Like we have audio filters.

500
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:33,610
That's why I like when I was really young playing with radios, Oh, some old guy.

501
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:34,530
So you didn't do it right.

502
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:34,870
Or whatever.

503
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,290
But I enjoyed not doing it right.

504
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:39,110
Cause I was starting to hear things that no one, you know, that you're not supposed

505
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:39,850
to go and listen to.

506
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,230
Cause there's supposedly nothing there.

507
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:41,810
Right.

508
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:42,250
Right.

509
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:42,850
Supposedly.

510
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:43,030
Right.

511
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:44,010
But there's lots of stuff there.

512
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:47,950
I had more fun not being, uh, not being told how to tune it.

513
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:53,690
So I was all over the place and saying, well, you know, so anyway, it wasn't tangible, but

514
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:54,430
it was interesting.

515
00:21:56,050 --> 00:22:00,310
So what I'm, what I'm trying to get to is we don't know because we're, first of all,

516
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:05,490
if you had the answers for everything, succinct, and by the way, it's not hard to do that, to

517
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:10,830
get everything in order, how it would be more and more difficult for you to be one

518
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,010
of the members of the surface dwelling earth inhabitants, who's wasting their time.

519
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:18,450
And the purpose, the main purpose of surface dwelling earth inhabitants is to waste their

520
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:18,930
time.

521
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,230
That is the main purpose.

522
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:24,970
And that is, uh, that is, you basically can go up to anyone.

523
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:29,410
I assure you this, that's fairly reasonable and argue the word argue, by the way, it means

524
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:34,890
to give reason for it's not what it's like the word nice, the real, the real me or apologetic

525
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:35,790
means to defend.

526
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,250
Well, it's not about the conflict.

527
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,230
It's about the, to make an argument.

528
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:44,510
That's why they call it that in legalese because it means to offer a reason for what, what's

529
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:44,970
going on.

530
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:45,130
Yeah.

531
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:50,710
Your reason, your rationale behind something, your rationale, your explanation, almost.

532
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:51,150
Yeah.

533
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:51,630
That's right.

534
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:58,010
It's sort of, it's sort of coupled with apology, Jetix, but they're, they're different apologetics

535
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:03,070
tend to be more, uh, but your belief system and argument would be more of a situation

536
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:03,750
or events.

537
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,730
It's more about advocacy than it did.

538
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:06,870
Just plain story.

539
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:07,210
Right.

540
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:07,730
So yeah.

541
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:07,930
Okay.

542
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:08,250
Go ahead.

543
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:09,190
All right.

544
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,970
Where, what will, what were we speaking?

545
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:11,310
Oh yeah.

546
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:16,770
So you can actually go to anyone who, uh, and argue this point or knows, provide enough

547
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:20,490
rationale and say to them, anyone out of the blue, ha ha, I know the meaning of life and

548
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:21,530
you don't.

549
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:21,790
Yeah.

550
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:27,390
You can be a little prick like that and it's cannot be refuted.

551
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:32,730
In other words, ha ha ha ha, I know the meaning of life and you don't, or yous don't.

552
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,490
And what is it?

553
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,370
Greek or Sally?

554
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,710
What is it?

555
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,710
We're all here to waste each other's time.

556
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:41,430
What?

557
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:47,150
At first it's like, well, I never heard it put as such.

558
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:47,510
Never.

559
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:52,510
Second of all, it doesn't need a lot of referencing because all you could just give the small

560
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:57,470
example of the workers, like anybody will see it.

561
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:59,370
Anyone, everyone will see it.

562
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:05,510
Obviously, you know, when I say anyone, you know, there's very few people on this planet

563
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:05,950
anyway.

564
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:12,910
So what I mean by this is these things are not difficult to figure out, but maybe it's

565
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,270
better that you don't figure it out.

566
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:15,350
That wouldn't do.
