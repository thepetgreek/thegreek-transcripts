1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:16,340
Ah, Sonic Event 133, this one is anyway, Greek, you know, interesting conversation we were

2
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,000
having before we started recording, as always, by the way, yeah, you're trying to say what

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
we say about the conversation on the recording is not interesting.

4
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,420
No, not at all.

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:24,920
Not at all.

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,140
I just look, I actually have a couple of things that we recorded before we started talking

7
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,940
a few times that I put together, and I might release those soon.

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,120
But anyway, as is today, what is on your mind?

9
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,840
I looked in the chat, by the way.

10
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:43,520
And I noticed that somebody was talking about, you know, some of the stuff that you had discussed

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,960
regarding the monetary system, and yeah, we're gonna get into more tonight real quick and

12
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,080
give a confirmation.

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:49,920
Oh, excellent.

14
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:50,220
Okay.

15
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,320
I also had a question from somebody about murder, by the way, um, in a contact, it was

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,780
a Facebook contact, weird Facebook contact.

17
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,100
Somebody who never had a Facebook account until like this month.

18
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:03,560
And I know the person.

19
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,220
Well, I hear you.

20
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,480
I know someone who's never going to have a Facebook account.

21
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:06,960
Yeah, you.

22
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:07,400
Anyway.

23
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:07,940
Yeah.

24
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:14,280
But anyway, those things first came out, by the way, just like YouTube, PayPal, or whatever.

25
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,720
I will never do that.

26
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,140
I will never, ever, ever, ever, ever do that.

27
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:18,640
And guess what?

28
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,060
It's been what, a decade or so?

29
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,180
I'm still holding my word.

30
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,300
Well, it's more than a day.

31
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,060
Look, PayPal.

32
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,500
I got a PayPal account when they were giving you five bucks to sign up, and I did that

33
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,980
in 97.

34
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,040
Oh, how did they give you five bucks to sign up?

35
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,660
Listen to the past few, uh, uh, we're talking.

36
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:35,280
Yeah.

37
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,060
You know, the U.S. was bankrupted again in 2003.

38
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,400
That's where the Paperwork Reduction Act comes from.

39
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:40,780
Right.

40
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,640
But anyway, that's where everything's done digitally.

41
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:43,700
Absolutely.

42
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,180
Just like when they bankrupted in 33, now everything was a check.

43
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,120
Well, that's why.

44
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:48,940
Not a certificate.

45
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:49,600
That's why.

46
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,820
I know when they bankrupted it before, you know, hold on.

47
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:57,280
When they bankrupted it 70 years before that, in 1863, what did they do then?

48
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:03,400
They put the entire country under, essentially, not martial law, but military rule, General

49
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,360
Rule 100.

50
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,300
Anyway, so these are just simple, basic things that are not being communicated.

51
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,260
What about murder, though?

52
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:10,780
Yeah, no.

53
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,760
Lincoln's suspension of the Constitution happened right around then, didn't it?

54
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:14,880
Yeah.

55
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:20,340
And Congress went into, uh, more quo or something, like they can meet, but it's not official.

56
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,200
Right.

57
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,240
In other words, they could meet, but it's not official.

58
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,760
And when they meet, they could still keep the congressional record going and all this,

59
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,580
but it's not official.

60
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,520
That's why there's an official congressional record paper that's printed every single day,

61
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,000
which tells you the minutes of what happened.

62
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,340
And okay.

63
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,080
Anyway, about murder.

64
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,160
Murder.

65
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:36,540
Murder, right.

66
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:42,060
So the reason why they asked about it is because we had done a sonic years ago on hell.

67
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,080
And we talked about it and we were kind of making jokes about it.

68
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,580
That's all misinterpretation.

69
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,820
And the hell that the Christians talk about is Dante's Inferno type.

70
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,320
Yes.

71
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:56,160
And that's the weird thing, because Dante is not making a commentary on Christianity.

72
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,100
No, no, no.

73
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,320
But his whole thing is just like the Necrocomicon.

74
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,660
There's some truth in it.

75
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,260
Yes.

76
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:02,660
Right.

77
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,000
There's a lot of truth in it.

78
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:04,800
You know, the the.

79
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:05,440
All right.

80
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:12,440
You know, when you do a flyby on a planet and the surface is totally there means it's

81
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:18,080
an advanced civilization, just like when you do a drone fly over a subdivision, you don't

82
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,580
see like beds and couches on people's roofs.

83
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,060
Right.

84
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,680
And right where we're in the chairs and tables on the roof.

85
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,460
Where is everything inside?

86
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:27,240
Right.

87
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:27,740
Right.

88
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,740
You might see some patio furniture or whatever.

89
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,040
Yeah.

90
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:36,980
But but the earth is in the perspective that humans have is strictly from the surface mentality.

91
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:42,300
And any advanced society will not be on the surface in any world, let's just say, whether

92
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,080
you believe there's such a thing as space or not.

93
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:50,260
The concept is, is there to dictate something that, you know, that I just illustrated.

94
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:50,900
But go ahead.

95
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:51,560
So, yeah.

96
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:51,840
Hell.

97
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,660
Concept of hell.

98
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:52,960
Yeah.

99
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,880
The concept of hell.

100
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,180
OK.

101
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,060
So here's the thing about murder and all this, because during that same time period, we also

102
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:04,740
did a discussion on sexuality and perversion and, you know, people having sex with animals,

103
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,540
which you're the only guy I've ever heard talk about how, you know, there really were

104
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,700
these hybrids, et cetera.

105
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,200
And you know, the whole thing about man laying down by the way, animal to death.

106
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,019
Yeah.

107
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:21,840
So I think it's human and jellyfish are the two known species that could pretty much intermix

108
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,580
with anything.

109
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,100
That is weird.

110
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,220
That is outside of the other aberration.

111
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:27,640
What is it?

112
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,560
There's more than rats.

113
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:29,880
More.

114
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:30,480
Yeah.

115
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,380
You've seen on the cloning where they grow a human ear on a rat.

116
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:33,680
Right.

117
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,140
Oh, yeah.

118
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,500
But you can't grow a rat ear on a human.

119
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:37,460
No.

120
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:37,760
But anyway.

121
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:38,400
Yeah.

122
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:38,600
OK.

123
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,480
So let's let's go.

124
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,080
And then.

125
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,380
OK.

126
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,420
Well, see, and that's the thing.

127
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,760
So what is special here?

128
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,900
And the question is, what is the deterrent?

129
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,160
Right.

130
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,420
I mean, you talked about with sexuality and with mixing with animals and with men mixing

131
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,260
with men, et cetera.

132
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,240
But then what about murder?

133
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:02,040
Because we never discussed, is there really a justifiable or a righteous killing, et cetera,

134
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,960
this kind of thing?

135
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,940
According to, you know, biblical law.

136
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,580
And my response was, look, to my mind, biblical law is by agreement.

137
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,220
It's by agreement.

138
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:10,560
OK.

139
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:10,980
Social.

140
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:11,400
OK.

141
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:16,160
What's the difference between adultery and being polyamorous?

142
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:16,760
Right.

143
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,520
What's the difference?

144
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,560
It's the same action.

145
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:26,920
What's the difference between rape and and regular consensual sex is the the consent.

146
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:32,640
So with murder of someone, murder is as prescribed, killing another person.

147
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,100
But when it's socially accepted, like in other words.

148
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,660
The law we live in is if you an eye for an eye, if you take a life, your life is taken

149
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,400
and they have an open court and everybody agrees and they cap, you know, they hang the

150
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,740
guy or whatever, shoot him.

151
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,000
Is that murder?

152
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,100
Capital punishment.

153
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:49,380
Right.

154
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:49,700
Is it?

155
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:49,860
No.

156
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,800
It's all about consent.

157
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,680
And that's why it's so important since I've been speaking.

158
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,400
Pick a law form and that's your law form.

159
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,800
And I'm going to get into something here that goes back to 2013, 2014, maybe.

160
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,740
But does that satisfy the question?

161
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,380
It's all based on what law form you live under.

162
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,420
Well, I think it does.

163
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,360
But there you go.

164
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:06,600
Right.

165
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:12,180
So the executioner is not subject to being a murderer, even though he doesn't know the

166
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:12,540
subject.

167
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:16,140
He's actually serving a purpose in a societal agreement.

168
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,040
Right.

169
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,120
Well, OK.

170
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,860
Let's leave the murder out of it.

171
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,740
Replace it with adultery and being polyamorous, meaning having more than one partner.

172
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,000
Right.

173
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,880
Not polygamous.

174
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,080
Or even violence or even violence versus BDSM.

175
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,340
Right.

176
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,600
Which, you know, is pretty simple.

177
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,360
OK.

178
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,240
I've got stories about all that stuff.

179
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:33,960
Well, OK.

180
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,920
I didn't want to go there, but.

181
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:35,480
Yeah.

182
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,100
But that's fine.

183
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,620
That story's accounts that these accounts.

184
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,880
So whenever you give an account, it's you have to give it in the form of a story where

185
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,180
you preface and form and discuss, but, you know, the discussion is just you and I right

186
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:46,440
now.

187
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:46,760
Right.

188
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,620
And I think what we speak on over time has brought up discussions in other places, which

189
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,100
will.

190
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:52,640
Yeah.

191
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,620
So, you know, it's all about the culture.

192
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,980
That's why it's so important to know your law law form and where you get your law form

193
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,340
from.

194
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,660
And, you know, so that's all about murder has to do with law.

195
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,580
If you go back to the Bible, murder, no murder.

196
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:12,020
But it's OK to go if you're ordered to destroy everything and everyone, even the children

197
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,280
of a certain, you know, under certain conditions.

198
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,160
It's all conditional.

199
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,040
Right.

200
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,740
All conditional.

201
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:21,080
So in that case, the concept of where the soldiers don't go to hell, that's that sort

202
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,320
of thing, which is a very Italian.

203
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,620
And I think they're glorified.

204
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,020
Actually, right.

205
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,840
They're glorified.

206
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,120
Yeah.

207
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,240
I had 50 kills.

208
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,600
I killed 50 Nazis.

209
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,160
Right.

210
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,960
So you got you got a Greek concept, which was then picked up by the Romans, which has been

211
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,560
carried on throughout society ever after, I think.

212
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,060
Right.

213
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:43,220
It's before the Greeks and it's up until now, it's it's yeah, it's always been this way.

214
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:49,980
In other words, the social order has been always about law and culture, what's accepted

215
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:53,060
and what's not and what what's consented to and what's not.

216
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,420
So if it's consented, anything goes.

217
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,080
Right.

218
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,760
This kind of ties in.

219
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,440
I wanted to give an account also.

220
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,380
Are we good?

221
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,320
Yeah.

222
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:01,560
Yeah.

223
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,100
I think so.

224
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:02,380
Sure.

225
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:02,600
Good.

226
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:09,320
Now, another thing that you'll find is back in the early days of 2010, I used to call

227
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,640
in American Freedom Radio, Revolution Radio, and then with Seth Michael late at night,

228
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,600
I would do three, four or five hours with him on a weekend in 2010, 2011, 2012.

229
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:24,580
And then I think we started we didn't get, quote unquote, a show till much later.

230
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:31,820
But I would call it and be a fixture on American Freedom Radio, Revolution Radio and by demand.

231
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,700
People say, hey, Greek, we want you to come on.

232
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,299
I'm like, yeah, not tonight or tonight.

233
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:36,940
I could do it.

234
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:44,080
So one of the things that I was putting on blast back then was, you know, people go to

235
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,380
court asking for justice.

236
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,280
Do you know what you're asking for?

237
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,480
Yeah, I want, you know, right ruling to the right thing.

238
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,680
High moral code.

239
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,200
I said, no, no.

240
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,720
Do you know what you're really asking for?

241
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,020
So I was I put that on blast and I think I might be the only person who's ever done that.

242
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,900
You're actually asking for the intervention of the goddess justice.

243
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,940
And yeah, that it's a pagan goddess.

244
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:07,060
And I'm the only one that I've actually framed it that way on blast, meaning when I would

245
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,620
come on and give a dose of Greek speak.

246
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,440
That's what you got.

247
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,340
You got time.

248
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,360
You got the human body.

249
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:11,980
All right.

250
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:15,900
Well, I was researching Christopher Houser on trust law.

251
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,680
I want to get into a little bit of that's very important.

252
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:23,260
And he did a video on Lady Justice.

253
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:29,600
And he says around 2013, 2014, a buddy of his came out to me, says, you know what that

254
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,520
justice thing is?

255
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:35,860
And he says, yeah, you know, it gives the dictionary definition made a long story short

256
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,020
because I'm going to give the remedy here because I used to give.

257
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,100
Why do you say that?

258
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:39,380
Right.

259
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,600
Because these are not courts.

260
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,160
It's like there's no Congress and all that.

261
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,340
Right.

262
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:42,740
Right.

263
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,100
Because people say, how do I get out of this court case?

264
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,500
Well, you don't really want to get out of there if you belong there.

265
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,060
If you don't belong there, you don't have to think about getting out of there.

266
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,980
Just give them a surefire reason why you don't belong there.

267
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:53,160
Right.

268
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,400
Never.

269
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,120
Right.

270
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,000
You know what I mean?

271
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,300
People say, how do I get out of this?

272
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,680
I said, why do you want you should never want to get out of something.

273
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,180
Is it something?

274
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:05,040
Is it your responsibility to deal with it or you shouldn't be there in the first place

275
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,840
is the question.

276
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,380
And you should have good reasons for both.

277
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,240
Right.

278
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,660
So people say, how do I get out of this court case?

279
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,380
And then and they tell me they just want to get out.

280
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,560
I'm not going to.

281
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,420
Yeah, I got a solution.

282
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,520
You got it's your responsibility.

283
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,840
But if someone does answer, how do I get out of this?

284
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:24,620
Well, because you don't want to handle a responsibility or you just don't belong there in the first

285
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:24,860
place.

286
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,460
If it's I don't belong there in the first place, then this is what you do.

287
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,400
Right.

288
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,260
And I do give advice on that legal advice and lawful advice.

289
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:32,560
Right.

290
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,740
But not at law, you know, in law, in fact.

291
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:44,960
So interesting thing here is anyway, Hauser looks at his friend, tell us what just is.

292
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:45,960
Listen, I'm going to call you.

293
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,240
This is 2013, 2014.

294
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:53,020
He says, why don't you look it up and we'll talk about it in a couple of weeks.

295
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,480
Well, Hauser looks into it.

296
00:10:54,660 --> 00:11:01,100
Christopher Hauser keeps finding these definitions, but finally finds one that it's a Roman pagan

297
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:05,120
goddess borrowed from the Greek D.I.K.E.

298
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:05,740
D.K.

299
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,380
Dyke goddess who was on the Isle of Lesbos.

300
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:09,660
Right.

301
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,560
Can't make that up.

302
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:14,060
And so he said to and he says to pay us.

303
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,540
So what he did was he went into court.

304
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:15,900
Yeah.

305
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,560
Now, Howard Stern didn't invent that.

306
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:17,940
By the way.

307
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,100
Yeah.

308
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,140
Right.

309
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:19,840
And.

310
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,260
And yeah, so he goes into court.

311
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,800
This is the first time I felt like a man.

312
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:32,600
I had a man up and reason I had to go to court is because he was being tracked or tailed

313
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,500
because he was dealing in copious amounts of marijuana.

314
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,200
OK, so at a pound or half a pound of marijuana in the car.

315
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,660
And when they turn the lights on, the cops behind him, he tossed it out the window.

316
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,780
They got out, picked it up, took him in, you know, all that.

317
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:46,980
Right.

318
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,040
So I had to go to court for that.

319
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:48,280
Right.

320
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:55,600
And so that's where to go court for. So he shows up early, and he judged everybody that comes in,

321
00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:00,060
and he says, I'd like to ask a question. The judge says, go ahead. He says,

322
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,780
are you here to serve justice? And the judge kind of giggles. He says, yes, I try to do my best.

323
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,800
You know, then he looks at the prosecutor. Are you here to serve justice? I guess so.

324
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,800
Looks at the clerk. Are you here to serve justice? Yeah, I guess so. He says,

325
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:23,460
how dare you bring me into a pagan house of worship? Right? You're serving, right? You

326
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:28,160
serve God, right? Serve justice, right? It's a temple, pagan temple. And they all got befuddled,

327
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:34,500
and they told him, case dismissed. Now, this is not the first one, but this is on YouTube.

328
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,520
Now, I wanted to reach out to Chris Houser and say, by the way, did your friend happen to hear

329
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,700
about this from a guy called the Greek back then? Anyway, I had interviews, various copious

330
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:47,340
interviews, because I'm the only one as far as, like, in other words, I'm not, I don't want to be

331
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:52,420
belligerent about it or take credit for it, but if suddenly you see a YouTube video about saying,

332
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,880
I spoke to a friend about keeping time, that the full moon is the first day of the month,

333
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:01,860
and the day starts at noon. The chances that they got it from listening to some Greek speak,

334
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:08,460
or someone who knew someone who knew someone that listened to Greek speak is about 99.999999%,

335
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:16,100
right? So that's why I'm bringing this up, because it's so unusual, and it's so simple.

336
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:21,360
Now, I want to bring up a few things about Chris Houser. I remember I was studying trust law.

337
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:25,740
Now, most of the stuff that he puts out, again, this is like Brandon Joe Williams.

338
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,440
I don't endorse him, because a lot of the stuff he says about 1099A, ignore, because that gets

339
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:37,440
people in trouble, and I'll explain what that is. The US has been, this is the story that people

340
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:45,820
don't know. The US was bankrupt in 1933, and public law 73-10 or HCR 192 states that, and it's also in

341
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:50,440
the codes, in the UCC codes, that all debts are owed to the United States, right? Because they

342
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,780
didn't put it out for vote, should we be, you're right, go bankrupt, right? So because they did

343
00:13:55,780 --> 00:14:00,300
that, and remember, this whole system is set up by demonic people, you know, the bankers, right?

344
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:05,920
If you don't know that the bankers are Satanists, not that I have anything against it directly,

345
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:12,780
because all the religions basically follow a similar path, but you have to understand what

346
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:16,960
Satanism is. If someone says, I'm Catholic, devout Catholic, you don't have to ask him what he does,

347
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:22,180
just go look up what devout Catholics do, right? So if someone says, be basically inclined to

348
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,460
Satanism, you don't have to ask them what do you do, just go look up what they do, right? It's

349
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:30,580
general. So this is the banking system. But the US went bankrupt in 1933. And they put out all

350
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:34,860
these public laws and all the debts belong to the US, United States, the corporation that's

351
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:41,460
somewhere in the District of Columbia. Now, what they did also, they did it under trust law. Now,

352
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:47,120
I can't find this, I think it's 1990-1992. James Traficant was on the floor of Congress. And he

353
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,220
says, here we are, congressmen in front of the largest chapter 11 and the largest trust in human

354
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:58,300
history in basically the United States, right? In receivership, and I can't, I was trying to find

355
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:03,720
the speech on Google, right? I did another browser still couldn't find the speech, where years ago,

356
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:08,740
it was easy to find the speech that he spelled this out in the 90s, right? Traficant, the guy

357
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:13,660
with the pompadour style toupee, you know? Right. You know, what's interesting about that is if you

358
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:19,920
go to C-SPAN, you might find it in the C-SPAN archives. Oh, okay, maybe, you know, we've got

359
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,000
some people that do due diligence. James Traficant's speech on the United States is the

360
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:33,380
largest trust, and it's a chapter 11 bankruptcy receivership. So anyway, what he gets into is

361
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,540
anyone, all the people, regardless if you're a citizen, resident, and all the stuff that

362
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:44,140
Brandon talks about, are a beneficiary of this trust. Now, if you understand trust law,

363
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:48,780
the trust is set up with a grantor, a beneficiary, who is supposed to benefit,

364
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:53,500
and everybody else working in the trust is for that person's benefit. So here's a simple

365
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:58,960
example to make it easy. You are a beneficiary, especially if you sign all this paperwork,

366
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,720
and you give a social, any place they ask for a social security number or social insurance number,

367
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:12,960
and you have to sign, and you sign with a B-N-E, B-E-N-E dot, short for beneficiary,

368
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:18,060
after your name. You now assume the title that any actions of anyone that has to do anything

369
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:23,660
with that form has to benefit you. Now, I used to tell this to people a long time ago, but I

370
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:28,220
never saw it so clear like Hauser talks about it. Like, give me an example. There's somebody here

371
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:35,860
in Tucson. They had a pirate radio. They got busted by the FCC. They'll find you, by the way,

372
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,700
if you broadcast more than a watt and a half. They'll find you. They'll knock on your door.

373
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,260
You're like, how the hell did they find me? Even if you're in a moving van, they'll plot,

374
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:48,020
they'll plot your, they'll map you out and try to predict where you're next going to go.

375
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,840
Well, there was a minor change to the AM stipulations, and you can use a 10-watt

376
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,280
tower from your backyard now. Legally, no license, nothing necessary.

377
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,460
Yeah, go ahead.

378
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:03,440
Yeah, but we're talking, this is a decade and a half ago. We've got some other stuff going on.

379
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:08,859
Skipped out on this bench warrant, whatever. So anyway, he goes in there, and they go through

380
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:14,480
all these counts. And the judge says, how do you plead all this? And he says, I can't,

381
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:19,859
I'm not here to argue the facts. I'm not going to plea anything. I can't see how any of this

382
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:24,300
would benefit me. The judge looks down, puts his, Judge Green, not going to mention any names,

383
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:29,100
in Tucson. This guy, this judge made so much money for them that they actually built him his

384
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:33,780
own building. Anyway, he pulls his, he had these half-style reading glasses. You know which ones

385
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,480
I'm talking about?

386
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:34,920
Oh, yeah.

387
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,660
The half-style, yeah. Puts them on his nose, looks at him for about 10 seconds. He goes,

388
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,360
okay, case dismissed. Get out of here.

389
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:44,300
The bifocals without the top focal.

390
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:52,300
That's right, yeah. So anyway, when you are a beneficiary, let's say you go to a court or

391
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:58,720
anything, a cop, cop pulls you over, gives you a ticket. You sign it beneficiary.

392
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,940
And anything the cop, okay, the cop is going to attach social security number. The bank is

393
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:08,500
going to attach social security. Anybody that's got a social security, social insurance number

394
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:14,300
has to act for your benefit, right? You see what I mean? So it's all a trust action.

395
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,800
And if you say it's not for your benefit, it's trust violation, trust fraud, trust

396
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:24,700
impairment. You can go on and on and on. And they can't say no. Now, one way you can entrap

397
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:29,820
them is if you go like people for social security benefits or a traffic ticket or a court or session

398
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:34,700
or whatever. Everybody talks about the all caps name as a straw man, I guess, defined to convey

399
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:40,000
property. It is a straw man, but it's different. It's the name of the trust. Now, what you can do

400
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,480
is, and I've seen this, you go to a court, it doesn't matter what it's for, traffic ticket,

401
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:49,880
anything, or DMV, anything, anything at all. It could be your telephone company.

402
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:57,220
If you have the B, A, E, N, E on your signature card, your beneficiary, you just ask them what I

403
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:03,600
signed here, whatever it is, corporation, government. Did you take my social security

404
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,920
number? You could say my social security number on the record. Yes, we did. What is the social

405
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:16,140
security? It's a trust. And I signed a beneficiary. So anything you do that is not to my benefit

406
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:22,360
is a trust fraud, trust misdemeanor, trust impairment. You can go under several, yeah,

407
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:27,360
it depends on what they do and how far they take it. Very, very powerful. Social security benefits.

408
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,540
I know a lady, she's not getting basically a thousand dollars a month to live on. And she's

409
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:37,940
broken neck and all that stuff. The thing for her to do is to go there and basically say,

410
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,360
I can't live on this. And just ask them the same thing. You have my social security number.

411
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:48,120
Let them say what it is. What is the social security? It's a trust. It's a SESTICA trust.

412
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:55,060
SESTICA means it has a definite beneficiary. SESTICA trusts came about back in the sailing

413
00:19:55,060 --> 00:20:01,740
days when a port was in Dock and Harbor and it left, disembarked, and it left some rope behind

414
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:08,440
or a piece of cargo or a tool. The harbor master had to put it aside with that ship's name on it,

415
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,560
right? Because it's not his. And he can't use it for his benefit.

416
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,520
So that's where it came from back in one of the places. This is on the Tontine and all that.

417
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:27,260
So this is the crux of what Hauser talks about. Now, what he was doing. So if you go to buy a car,

418
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:34,560
what basically he was teaching people to do is you just go to the car salesman or whatever,

419
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:39,040
a new car or used car, new car, because it doesn't matter what the cost is. Remember,

420
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:42,560
I've been saying for years, you just take a piece of paper, write any number on it,

421
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:47,180
write it out in words and sign it. It's good for that. It could be a trillion. It doesn't matter.

422
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:52,560
Right. But if everyone, okay, I want to make one more point before we go. But anyway, he was

423
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:57,580
telling the car people, well, you know, my credit sucks, but run it anyway. Boom. Soon as they run

424
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:01,800
your credit report, don't they have the social security number on them? Yes. Absolutely. Didn't

425
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:07,100
you sign it with a beneficiary signature? Yes. Now they're holding the bag preventing you from

426
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:12,700
getting something that you need. You give them a 1099 a and you put the treasury on the form as

427
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:18,940
what the debtor because remember, the law says the United States owes everything is owed. Right,

428
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:24,160
right. All debts are. Yeah. Yeah. So running this, some people got the cars in there. But what he

429
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:30,860
doesn't talk about people is if you read the full instructions for these forms, you can't use it for

430
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:38,320
this kind of stuff. It's really basically between financial institutions or investments, cashing out

431
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:43,440
investments and all that. But a lot of people did get cars. But a lot when he since he got on

432
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,940
YouTube, I know someone who did get a new Harley Davidson pickup truck and was working getting a

433
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:53,000
house and he got all that stuff. But two years later, the Attorney General came after him for

434
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,720
using public funds. Right. And a federal court. And I remember in the in the federal court,

435
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,500
this is a deck more than a decade ago. He brought up laws like the laws we just brought up in the

436
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,580
justice. You can't use law here because it's not it's not a court. It's an administrative hearing.

437
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:12,920
Right. Yeah. People don't know. How do you prove. OK, that's enough for that. I just want to give

438
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:17,140
the spirit. How do you know it's not. You have three branches of government. Right. And they're

439
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,540
supposed to balance each other out. Right. We don't have to mention here, but we'll mention

440
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:26,260
him anyway. Legislative, judicial. Right. Executive. Right. Now, the way the courts are

441
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:31,900
since the Civil War or the War of the States or the War of Northern Aggression is this. Yes. You

442
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:40,080
can see this right now. This what happens is the executor appoints a judge and it has to be

443
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:46,500
confirmed by the legislator legislature. And once the judge is in this, this is on all levels,

444
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:51,100
federal, state, local, whatever. They do election ballots. They still have to be confirmed by.

445
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:56,920
Now, who runs the courts? Who's the top poncho? The attorney general. And he's what? Is he

446
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:02,500
judicial? No, he's part of the executive branch. Right. And the legislature confirms it. Where's

447
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:07,840
the judicial branch in this? There is no judicial branch. It's all a mockery. It's all because you

448
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:13,760
can't have. How many times have you heard me say on sonic events? OK, Greek, so what? It doesn't

449
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:20,100
matter. It doesn't matter if we don't have money. We use anything and we get what we want. Yes,

450
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:24,460
it does matter, because when you lose your money, what's defined as money, not finances,

451
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:29,640
but money has to have some kind of value. You lose law. You're no longer under law.

452
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:36,220
Everything's commercial. That's the problem. Right. So now here, just to fast forward,

453
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,820
what I want to say that actually for a couple of weeks now, I haven't put it so succinctly.

454
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:46,980
If everything OK, there are rules written down, whether you like them or believe them or not.

455
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:53,840
Can you go and find, let's say, for the financial system how it's supposed to work? Yes,

456
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:59,920
there is a UCC. There's each country. Each state has its rules and laws. Right. If everyone I'm

457
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,940
talking about, the person who gets the electric bill or the rise in bill and wants to buy

458
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:08,660
something with a credit card, those people with the big financial companies or whatever,

459
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:14,520
it doesn't matter or with what's called taxation. If everyone followed those rules,

460
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:20,600
it would destroy the system. Right. Right. Because you should be able to go into a car dealer,

461
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:26,500
a Ferrari dealer and say, I want two Ferraris. Right. And you write it on a piece of paper,

462
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,460
sign it, and he'll give you the two Ferraris. Why will it destroy the system? Because by the end of

463
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:36,240
the week, it'll be eighteen hundred dollars for a gallon of milk. All right. And people who work

464
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,300
only with cash, you're going to need more than a wheelbarrow. You need a pallet that's shrink

465
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:45,880
wrapped with forklift to go buy a refrigerator. Right. OK, so you're going to need trillions and

466
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,480
trillions of quadrillions in cash. It's going to become impractical again. It's going to be worse,

467
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:56,540
less impractical than having to bring gold or silver coins in. Right. So right. Imagine a

468
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:02,000
thousand silver. It's a thousand silver coins. Right. No, I carry it. You know,

469
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,360
I tried carrying a hundred silver coins to pain in the ass. I mean, that's only a hundred dollars.

470
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:13,240
Prima facie. Right. OK, so so anyway, and they really are a hundred dollars. So so if everyone

471
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,480
followed the rules and the financial, the financial system would completely collapse.

472
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:25,520
Let's go to another system. Religion. That's easy. If what is Christianity supposedly based on,

473
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,140
say, the Bible, if they did what was in the Bible, Christianity would not exist.

474
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:35,840
Same with Islam. Same with all those religions. So if people followed the rules of religion or

475
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,800
finance, both of those systems would completely collapse. Same with the medical. If people

476
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:45,060
follow the rules with the medical, everyone knew, in other words, the patients, the doctor,

477
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:49,020
everyone knew everything that was memorialized or enough of it that it was accurate.

478
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,860
They wouldn't say you're a slab of meat with calories. And, you know, basically,

479
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,260
if you listen to Greek speak, you know, I define what they tell you is that you're a

480
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:04,540
pressurized filter bag. Right. Right. Right. By the way, you know, I see the heart is not a pump.

481
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:10,960
A lot of people say that. OK, but you got to do research when you say that, because you know what

482
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:17,520
a pacemaker is when they do experimental work on people with pacemakers. Some of them say it's OK

483
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,980
to experiment on me, whatever. Right. While they're still alive, they have a button on the

484
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:28,820
pacemaker and they notice that when they make the heart pulse faster, the blood moves slower.

485
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,660
And when they push a stream of blood through the heart and a living person

486
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:38,320
really fast, the heart slows down. What kind of fucking pump is that?

487
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,860
If you're making the pump, the heart pulse twice as fast and the blood goes half as fast,

488
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:50,480
slower and slower, the faster you go, what kind of pump is that? What kind of pump works that way?

489
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,520
And that would be more accurately described as a regulator, wouldn't it?

490
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:58,100
Sounds like a regulator or brakes. The more you use the brakes, the slower the car goes. Right.

491
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:03,440
Yes, a regulator. OK, so I just want to throw that in because I think every medical journal

492
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,280
in the world has published something about what I just said. Right. They may not leave it up,

493
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:12,680
but anyway, it'd be interesting to see what's left. So, you know, the faster the blood goes

494
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,800
through the heart, the slower the heart goes. And then when the heart is artificially sped up,

495
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:20,220
the blood goes through slower. That's a that's a wonderful pump design. Yeah, right. OK,

496
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,920
so if they looked at the tissue, like I've gotten so many people saying, you know,

497
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:28,700
the tissue in the body is hydrophobic. You know, in other words, no moisture

498
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,960
goes through it at all. There's no absorption. This, that and the other.

499
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:36,480
They wouldn't say that you're just a pressurized filter bag. Let's say you're a walking miracle.

500
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:44,200
You're a walking, magical, mysterious miracle. And we wouldn't need it. It wouldn't it would

501
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,720
be a joke to do what they're doing right now. And we would all go back more to studying

502
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:55,080
the, you know, like the ether. Right. How that works. What is it? Right. And we wouldn't have

503
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:59,460
a disease. First of all, half of the diseases that people think they have would go away instantly

504
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:03,780
because, you know, there's no blood sugar. There's no right. All these diseases that do.

505
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:09,900
So what will happen is the medical system will completely fall apart if people found out really

506
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:14,720
what was memorialized. You see how it works. And this is how everything on Earth is. And

507
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:18,320
right now, every subject, any subject, even engineering,

508
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:24,720
you know, you know, they they practice exclusions when they do physics experiments and they see

509
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,100
anomalies. They don't want to include those things in there. When the early transistors

510
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:34,100
were invented by Schlotzky and these guys in the 1920s to get away from vacuum tubes,

511
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:38,260
they were wet. They weren't there. They were solid, but they were wet putties.

512
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:43,800
They would shut down the lab at night and come back the next day and the things would be on

513
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:49,920
by themselves. Right. They had to get rid of that. Right. We don't want somebody to buy a radio,

514
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:54,240
plug it in for a few hours, unplug it. And then the thing starts playing again. Right.

515
00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:01,400
So anything, every subject under the sun, anything that has any social structure will

516
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:07,440
completely fall apart if the people just knew what was written about these things.

517
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:12,100
And that's pretty much the reality you're living in. So you can't tell me this is a real world.
