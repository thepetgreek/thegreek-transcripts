1
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:12,900
Rated Y 134 gotta tell you, Greg, it's been a weird week.

2
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:20,320
You know, have you noticed electronic disturbances because I'm getting reports from all over

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:20,680
the place.

4
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,800
People are having trouble with their Internet trouble with their electricity.

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,600
Is there is there something in the ether at the moment?

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,040
Yeah.

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,640
Well, I thought it was what I was doing here.

8
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:32,860
Oh, maybe.

9
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,280
No, but not for everyone.

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,420
I thought maybe that's a reprieve.

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,200
I've been doing a lot of weather work here and you could have some people that are following

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,720
and they say, yeah, man, I'm looking at the satellite and storms when you say you're gonna

13
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,880
do something for them right over where you are at the center.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,680
I'm like, yeah, well, and here's another here's another question I have for you, actually.

15
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,700
And I didn't broach this off air or anywhere.

16
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,560
And I'm just going to surprise you with it.

17
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:01,320
Do you have anything to do with the weird changing of direction of Debbie?

18
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,060
Because no, I didn't do anything.

19
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:10,120
But I'm sure from their meteorological stuff, they have what's called wind shear, where

20
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,380
one storm can, you know, like billiards, you know, one can bump the next, right?

21
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:17,580
As also a void area, high pressure could also bump it.

22
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,740
So no, I didn't pay any attention to that.

23
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:27,320
I don't really do hurricanes anymore or major storm mitigation unless I'm getting compensated.

24
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:34,900
The last one I did, which was Lee, which was phenomenal, largest storm to form an eight

25
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,360
hour and they never saw a category five form in eight hours.

26
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:38,700
Right.

27
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,260
And I stopped it from moving, shut it down.

28
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:47,720
And then the next day came back category five and shut it down again without compensation.

29
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:52,720
Someone sent me a bunch of Federal Reserve notes demanding lawful money for me to do

30
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:52,840
it.

31
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,580
So I said, all right, fuck, yeah, I'll do it.

32
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,300
So, yeah.

33
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:56,980
Hey, why not?

34
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:02,080
But a weird thing happened because where I am, we were being warned that there was going

35
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,560
to be all this flooding and get ready for it.

36
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,440
And it did nothing.

37
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,039
Yeah.

38
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,479
Nothing.

39
00:02:07,699 --> 00:02:09,580
It's hitting New York is what I see now.

40
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:10,740
It was hitting New York.

41
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,260
Right.

42
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,100
It steered away from here.

43
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,580
It hit Florida a bit and then decided to skip Georgia.

44
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,900
You know, which was like really weird.

45
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,240
Yeah.

46
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:20,560
Good.

47
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,880
I've only been doing local ops for a year.

48
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,380
We have there's a there's an op.

49
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,720
There's a map that I sent out for rainfall for the last month here locally.

50
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,960
And I live right in the middle of town.

51
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,180
And you could see we're right where I was last month.

52
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,020
It rained four and a half inches, like a few about a mile out.

53
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:39,900
It's three inches.

54
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,900
And then another mile out.

55
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,660
It's two inches.

56
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:46,860
All these inches that I mentioned go out in a radius pattern out from the center.

57
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,780
Now, usually you don't get that kind of rain in the center of town because that's the least

58
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,760
there's no rain magnets.

59
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:52,520
There's no trees.

60
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,160
There's no mountains.

61
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:53,580
Right.

62
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,020
So where the rain was supposed to be going was the least amount of rain and where it's

63
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,300
not supposed to be going was the most.

64
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,560
I'll post that map up in chat.

65
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,240
Let's see.

66
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,520
I think it's an image right now.

67
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,180
I'll find it somewhere.

68
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,040
I'll send it to you and then you could post it or someone will.

69
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,240
But what.

70
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,600
So, OK, this is what I did.

71
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,280
I'm just coaching a couple of people about this.

72
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,820
This is basically weather work one on one.

73
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,380
I put up I don't think I sent you any of the videos of the device, the recent device.

74
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:25,360
It's a remaking of an old device and someone else has reproduced it and someone else is

75
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,180
going to reproduce it with success.

76
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,020
But it's the kind of device that you have a clear blue sky.

77
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:35,020
You put it out in 15 minutes, you get clouds and within an hour or two, you have rain.

78
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,220
That's pretty potent device.

79
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:37,460
Right.

80
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:42,080
It's a pretty, pretty interesting device at a rate of 75 to 80 percent.

81
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,260
Now, I was told by a colonel at Fort Huachuca Army Intelligence.

82
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,400
They had me do demonstrations back in 2013, 15 demonstrations.

83
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:58,460
And the back word was that after I was done, if this guy can do forget gets three out of

84
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,820
the 15, he's the real deal.

85
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:06,320
I got 11 out of the 15 and it was so abrupt that they were telling me, all right, tomorrow

86
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,560
put rain down over here.

87
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,400
OK, shit.

88
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,020
That's that's a really short call.

89
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,460
So I would put rain down.

90
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,640
I could see it on the satellite.

91
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,839
But then I go to the forecast and it shows sunny.

92
00:04:15,899 --> 00:04:17,040
No chance of rain.

93
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,380
Right.

94
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,040
Like I can't be because you could see the satellite, you know.

95
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,380
So what I had to do to get boots on the ground confirmation is give you a place with Sarah

96
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,280
Vista in the dry season.

97
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,420
So what I did was, all right, how do I find I don't know anyone there.

98
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:30,600
Yeah.

99
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,520
So I went to the Yellow Pages online and I found a 7-Eleven on Fry Road, Fry Boulevard,

100
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,160
the main road.

101
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,340
And I called them and I said, hey, I'm driving into Sarah Vista.

102
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,100
Is it raining there?

103
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,260
They're like, fuck, it's raining.

104
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,400
Just came out of nowhere.

105
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:43,940
Thanks.

106
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:44,380
Bye.

107
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:45,500
Right.

108
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,540
That's how you do it.

109
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:52,560
So if you want to throw rain down on the city, it shows no chance of rain and it's not raining,

110
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,040
but you could see it on the satellite.

111
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:58,280
You just call a convenience store because they're open all the time.

112
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:58,540
Right.

113
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,480
And they could tell people, it's not like an office building where you haven't been

114
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:02,660
out.

115
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,920
We only go out for lunch.

116
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,020
You know, I don't know, man.

117
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,020
You know, so people are walking in and out, right?

118
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:08,480
Yeah.

119
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,240
No, you're guaranteed.

120
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:09,880
Yeah.

121
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,600
You're guaranteed front windows, at least at a convenience store.

122
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:12,940
Right.

123
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,180
Yeah.

124
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,860
Windows and people coming in and out.

125
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,400
And that too.

126
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:15,660
Right.

127
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,520
So people are going to come in and out with umbrellas, be wet, whatever.

128
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,420
So you're going to know.

129
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:23,340
Or they'll pull up with wet cars, even though it's not raining there yet.

130
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:23,860
Yep.

131
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,340
So.

132
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:24,960
Exactly.

133
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,780
So that's what I do to get boots on the ground confirmation.

134
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:33,720
But OK, the advice I give people when they get started with me on certain things is it

135
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,980
when you wherever wherever you are doing this on the northern hemisphere above the equator,

136
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,940
it's going to take 10 to 14 days to come back to you, meaning around the conveyor.

137
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:43,980
No one is the norm.

138
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,640
It doesn't matter if it's flat or round.

139
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,620
If you think it's round, it will go around the northern hemisphere.

140
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,720
If you think it's flat, it just forms that circle.

141
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,560
The inner circle.

142
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:52,840
Right.

143
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:58,980
OK, so and I told I said this about a month ago, what you'll see happening is if you're

144
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:03,180
trying to make rain here in the US, especially on the West Coast, Southwest, you're going

145
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,620
to get really hot weather a few days to a week later.

146
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:13,120
What you'll see in Europe is very hot weather, no rain, unusually hot, like, you know, Spain,

147
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,980
France, Greece, Turkey.

148
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:21,620
And then what you'll see about another four or five days later is torrential rains in

149
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,720
northern Asia, Korea, especially in Japan.

150
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,080
Well, this is exactly what happened in the past three weeks.

151
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,180
Very hot in Europe.

152
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,820
And the other I think last week, North Korea has got flooded.

153
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,040
I mean, all of North Korea got flooded.

154
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,200
Right. So it's very you got rugged territory there, mountains and stuff.

155
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,520
But all lowlands were flooded.

156
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,080
Right. This is typical.

157
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,140
And also when you look at what's called the jet streams, they don't go across in this

158
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,360
fractal, random, wavy pattern.

159
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:56,520
What you start to see is the omega, the Greek letter omega forming over major areas, just

160
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,580
like the omega, you know, with the two kind of flat spots and then upside down.

161
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,600
Right. You. Yeah.

162
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,540
Like an upside, like a horseshoe upside, like a horseshoe with the two little flanges on

163
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,380
the bottom. So that's what you'll see forming.

164
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,760
And that was forming everywhere, too.

165
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:13,020
So now it's OK. So when you do weather work, what is it, drink responding, do it

166
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:18,740
responsibly, right, because it goes around the entire conveyor and that's how it

167
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,520
works. But you know what I have to say, look, if you don't like the bad weather you're

168
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,100
getting because I'm making good weather here, call me and we'll set you up with a

169
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,460
device so you can bounce it off.

170
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,760
Right. You lay it off.

171
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,120
It's hot potato. It's what it is.

172
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:38,120
So, yeah, I'm getting a I turned on another computer that I had and I was starting to

173
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:44,800
do a media portfolio, you know, from back then, you know, from back in 2010 till like

174
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,940
2015 or 17 when I was the most active.

175
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,860
OK. So, yeah, OK, I got it.

176
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,500
Well, what's what's interesting there is, is it possible that somebody else did this that

177
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,620
I'm asking you about?

178
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,000
We're just. Yeah, there is.

179
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,260
But generally there's not that many people that can engineer.

180
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,960
OK. Anybody could go out and by accident, you can accidentally build one of these

181
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,420
devices with junk and not know what it does and it'll do it.

182
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:16,460
But it'll be very random when you're constantly hitting the stream from an

183
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:22,240
engineer. OK, so when you're doing the weather engineering perspective, what is

184
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,600
engineering? These are the current conditions, right?

185
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,480
Let's say there's no rain in a particular geographic location and there's no rain in

186
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,380
the forecast for 10 days, 20 days.

187
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,140
It's not foreseeable. And also it's not the rainy season.

188
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,820
So what we're going to do is we're going to engineer rain by doing this blocking

189
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:46,580
here, blocking the flow from here and allowing this other flow to speed up.

190
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,560
And then when the two come together, what?

191
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,500
Right. OK, right.

192
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:56,180
All right. So but when you do that and it happens, that's really a that's a plus.

193
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,420
You know, that's a success. Right.

194
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:04,500
But when it happens, the you have to follow, like I said, the streams as they go

195
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,840
around the globe or the flat earth or whatever, what you want to believe in.

196
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,280
Right. And you will see what I just stated earlier.

197
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:14,080
Right. So what you're saying about Debbie and all that?

198
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:18,860
No, I didn't do it. But OK, so let's just recap on Debbie, which was something the

199
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,680
storm or hurricane didn't really form, came up the middle.

200
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,400
Right. And then it started supposed to go to you.

201
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,820
And then it went up. Now it's up in New York area or something.

202
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:33,220
So what that is, that's that's what I call sheer, probably.

203
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,380
But but here's the thing.

204
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,420
This has been reported several times, whether you want to believe it or not, about

205
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,740
ninety nine percent of the weather can be controlled.

206
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:49,020
So if I'm loosely speaking on it here and showing other people, by the way, the other

207
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:52,960
people that I'm showing how to do weather work or skeptics, they're not like, oh, I

208
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,940
wish I could do the weather. Finally, I found someone.

209
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,640
No, no, no, no. It's nothing like that.

210
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,540
So I heard you could do the weather.

211
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,480
What a crock of shit.

212
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,940
Right. That's the majority, I bet, of anybody who's actually going to get into this.

213
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,800
OK, let me just see this not work for myself is what I'm going to do.

214
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,280
But even with that high level of skepticism, it works because it's I'm not into the

215
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:20,440
woos. So look, this is this is like if I I've said this many times, I won't discuss

216
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,520
anything that that's too personally based on anyone.

217
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:28,680
I only discuss things that are technically accessible, meaning anyone, once you know

218
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,820
how to do it, you can do it.

219
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,460
Right. It's like, you know, imagine driving a car was a natural talent.

220
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,460
There'd be hardly any cars, people in cars, let's say, conveying and motorized wagons,

221
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,260
right? Engine driven wagons.

222
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,340
But because it's something that you can technically access, you know, even on a small

223
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:47,460
ritualistic level, if you turn this wheel left and right, the thing goes left and right.

224
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,240
If you push one pedal, it goes the other pedal.

225
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,620
It stops. That's all you need to know.

226
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,840
You're what you're off to the races, let's say.

227
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,980
Right. OK, that's because you technically access it.

228
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,060
In other words, how do I do that?

229
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,040
You tell them and it works.

230
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,260
OK, there are other things that are naturally you heard about, like psychics, right?

231
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,580
Like the police use them, right?

232
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,500
Naturally, someone.

233
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,800
Yeah. OK.

234
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,900
You know, and I've gone into where why they're psychic before.

235
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,260
We don't need to get into that again.

236
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,620
But it's not them.

237
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,680
Everyone, if one everyone has the same ability, it's just with them.

238
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,320
It's accentuated because of the reasons that I've stated in the past for one of the

239
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,860
reasons. Now, another thing is like Yo-Yo Ma, the cellist at four years old, he's

240
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,920
playing concert cello and fuck out of here.

241
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,980
That's a natural talent, right?

242
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,960
Because there's people that go.

243
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,800
Yeah, there's people that go maybe not at four, but like nine.

244
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,500
But but, you know, yeah.

245
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:44,060
So I don't discuss those things because it's it's no matter how much you discuss

246
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,940
it, you still can't you won't be able to do it.

247
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,080
Why not discuss things that anyone could pick up and do?

248
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,920
That's that's my hallmark.

249
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:50,720
Right.

250
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,280
No, it makes perfect sense.

251
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,400
And look, speaking of things that anybody can access.

252
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,680
Right. We've talked a lot about the medical stuff, and I know that's always a

253
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,880
curiosity as well.

254
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:09,380
And I did know a couple of questions a little ways back, and I wasn't just from my

255
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,660
own head. I was going to ask you about something because I've been having troubles

256
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:18,280
lately and I've been trying to use compression to change up

257
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,740
different problems I'm having with, say, sensations.

258
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,680
Right. I got a numbness in my hand and I'm trying to bring it back around because it

259
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,520
sort of fell asleep weeks ago and I got this hand that feels like it's asleep.

260
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,980
For how long? Fell asleep, like stayed asleep or fell asleep for a few minutes like

261
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,360
normally?

262
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,920
No, no, no. What happened is I went to sleep, like sleep, sleep and woke up.

263
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,500
And, you know, you wake up and you've been laying on your arm or something and you

264
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,260
go, oh, crap. And you got to shake it a minute and then it gets better.

265
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,680
You know what I mean? And the sensation comes back.

266
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:52,620
Well, it didn't come back about six weeks ago.

267
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,140
Yeah. Six weeks later.

268
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,760
OK, yeah, that's a yin.

269
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,720
Because if it happened, it started off when you were asleep, which is the most yin

270
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,160
state you could be. Right.

271
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,520
Right. And still have some yang to protect you.

272
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,700
You still you woke up. So that means there's yang there, too.

273
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,920
It's not just yin. That's a yin state.

274
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,640
So the thing to fire that thing back up is it's stuck in a yin state because yin

275
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,320
is spread out. It's not focused or anything.

276
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,880
So if it's you don't have feeling in it, it's it's you know, it's more yin than

277
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,020
yang. Right. So you have a very yin.

278
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,680
It's it's probably the left hand.

279
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,180
Right. No, it's actually the right hand, which is a big problem for me.

280
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:37,860
Yeah. Well, OK. So because the left is the left is where it goes down.

281
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,340
So the yin goes up on the right.

282
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:45,240
So it's it's yin going up, but it's it's bypassing

283
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,520
the hand and it's manifesting a stuck zone of yin on the right.

284
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,540
I have to think about it, because that's where the energy on the right hand is,

285
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,300
where the energy goes up. Right.

286
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,860
From so if you're standing with your hands, your fingers pointed, the tips of your

287
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:02,540
fingers pointed towards the floor or the ground.

288
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,480
Right. What's literally happening is the energy around your body is going up

289
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,660
through your right arm and then going down out through your left.

290
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,720
Right. Right. So so there's a block.

291
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,440
So that's going to affect other things as well, unless it's coming in at the wrist

292
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,360
or elbow, which would be much more difficult.

293
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,400
Right. Because you can look at the surface area.

294
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,260
It's very small. Right. More young.

295
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,400
And what I did, what I attempted was compression, you know, around the forearm,

296
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,160
thinking that that's where the forearm I would do compression on the hand itself.

297
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,160
Wrap each individual digit starting from the tips towards the heart.

298
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,260
And you go to the next figure finger for starting at the tip towards the heart.

299
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,820
Right. Never wrap away from the heart.

300
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,960
Right. So you know what I mean? Right. Right. Right.

301
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,880
Now, what would you suggest I wrap it with anything?

302
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,340
Banana peels, anything. Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.

303
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,360
OK, doesn't matter. I keep old sheets for that reason.

304
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,860
You know, when sheets get threadbare and they start getting holes or they rip easy.

305
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,560
Yeah, I got it. I cut up t-shirts for the same reason.

306
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,000
Good. Yeah. Don't throw them away.

307
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,980
Yeah. What if you really want long term storage on fabrics that are natural?

308
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:10,140
Get a pot of boiling water, throw the sheet in there and boil it for 10 minutes

309
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,840
and then dry it. That'll sanitize it. Right.

310
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,140
So you don't take it out like years later and it's sour. Right. Right.

311
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,620
So, you know, years ago, they're really good launderers, by the way.

312
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,560
That's what they did every day.

313
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,380
If you ever watch an old film

314
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,920
about old cultures, when they go to the laundry part of town,

315
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,980
it's all these boiling vats. Right. Mm hmm.

316
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,380
So that's that's autoclaving.

317
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:33,940
You know, they still do it, you know, in medical or whatever, supposedly.

318
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,500
Yeah. And keep sheets around.

319
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,000
So now you have a sheet you can tear into custom little bands.

320
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,240
You know, bands as bands, you know, several long bands. Right.

321
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,320
What I what I would do is cut one two feet long, wrap your finger, let it hang

322
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,740
or wrap it around the palm and then go to the end.

323
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,280
Also, when I say go towards the heart.

324
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,800
So you start with the pinky finger first. Right. OK.

325
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,240
And then the ring finger and then the thumb,

326
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,420
then the forefinger and your middle finger last.

327
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,660
All right. And sometimes you want to give the middle finger first,

328
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,160
but not this time. Right. Gotcha.

329
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,400
So, OK. And middle finger last and across the palm.

330
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,800
And then just do it to the wrist.

331
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,720
But don't focus on tying it on the wrist.

332
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,700
And that's your compression for the hand.

333
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,080
So what that will do, that will decrease the vacuum

334
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,040
in the hand because you've compressed it.

335
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:27,720
So the body will say we have too much vacuum in the hand.

336
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,960
So let's release the vacuum

337
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,680
because you've made the volume smaller. Right. OK.

338
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,960
Right. Actually, when you make the volume smaller,

339
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,960
with the same vacuum, the vacuum. Right.

340
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,840
The vacuum goes down.

341
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,880
Right. And it'll balance it out.

342
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:49,120
But then when you remove the bandages, the hand will expand.

343
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,780
And whatever that low state of it,

344
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,940
you'll have an immediate boost of vacuum. Right. Right.

345
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,340
And that's how you play with with the vacuum, the yin and yang,

346
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,120
because yin and yang is also vacuum.

347
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,839
But that's that's what I would do for the compression.

348
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,359
Definitely on the hand and that should fix it.

349
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,119
But remember, the longer it takes, the longer you have it,

350
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:13,579
whatever it is, the harder, the longer it's going to take to. Right.

351
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,119
Right. Of course. Yeah.

352
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,000
Yeah. I mean, like with a wound,

353
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:20,460
you treat a wound like we've been saying it heals in two days.

354
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:24,760
If you decide to do that a week later, it's not going to it's going to,

355
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:26,319
you know, it's not going to help. Yeah. Right.

356
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:30,180
The longer it sits, the longer it sits unattended, the longer it takes to heal.

357
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:33,260
I have a term for that. It's facilitating the injury.

358
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:38,420
OK. Yeah. So time facilitates the injury if it's untreated.

359
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,820
That's right. Yeah. And so it's like that would make like you say,

360
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,440
it's people's character. You're dealing with someone.

361
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,460
You're like, why is this person like, let's say, always making excuses.

362
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,540
Right. What do they say? They're set in their ways.

363
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,500
Which means, yeah, exactly.

364
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,140
You try to remedy it and they still they don't want to do it.

365
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,700
You know, it's like, oh, I've always done this.

366
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,320
Well, who's this guy now telling me? Right. Same thing with the body.

367
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,480
Even if you know, the reason why people build up an infection,

368
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,540
it's the body making balance.

369
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,280
And we try to treat the infection.

370
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,720
It's like another injury that you're causing now, believe it or not.

371
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,640
But, you know, sometimes the body makes balance.

372
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,380
It could even kill you to make balance.

373
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,680
What do you think of people dying in car accidents?

374
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,580
Is those people were so out of whack

375
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,420
that the only way that the universe could put them in balance

376
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,480
is by having them whacked in a car accident?

377
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,580
I'm serious. This is when you start looking at things in a big perspective.

378
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,080
Well, same way with the social perspective.

379
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,460
Well, let me let me ask you if something that I've observed is is correct.

380
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,660
And maybe this will make sense since you bring this up,

381
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,940
because I was thinking about this recently and I didn't mention it to you.

382
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,620
But, you know, it seems to me that those that die rather suddenly,

383
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,760
those that have their lives interrupted, you know, pretty abruptly

384
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:52,240
are only two classes of people, the really, really way

385
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,300
too good people or really bad people, like people that are destructive

386
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,880
to others or people that are just so out of balance that.

387
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:05,120
Yeah, that act, that quick end actually put the rest of the whole

388
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,640
entire existence in balance.

389
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,580
It's almost like if you're too good or too bad, you got to go, you know?

390
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,880
Well, yeah, the society, you know, a lot of people

391
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,760
complaining about the government, the bad food, their talk poisoning us.

392
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,320
And they're telling us it's good for us.

393
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,640
It's that, you know, that is actually from an overarching perspective.

394
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:25,960
These social things that are happening that are negative for the population

395
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,720
from an overarching, large cosmic perspective.

396
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,540
That's the cosmos making balance.

397
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,200
It's like this is a really wackadoo society.

398
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,520
Let's get them, inspire them to start toxifying.

399
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,640
You know, the people that they look up to will start poisoning them

400
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,760
and telling them it's good for them.

401
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:42,520
That's how we go.

402
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,660
It'll take, you know, 30, 40, 50, 100 years to eliminate them.

403
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,480
But let's just set them off in that direction to balance the overall.

404
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,400
You see? Right.

405
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,080
That's why I keep saying that you never say you want to make the world

406
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,460
a better place because it's fine. It's supposed to be this way.

407
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,240
What are you going to do for yourself once you know better?

408
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,740
If you don't know better, it's fine, right?

409
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,240
I guess it's good, you know, with ignorance is bliss.

410
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,940
Yeah, it's been said many times, many times, many ways.

411
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:13,200
All right. Anyways, it's yeah, it's one of those things.

412
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:18,060
So balance, it seems to me as though nature and maybe this is wrong

413
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,940
because it's not just nature and maybe I'm just oversimplifying it.

414
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,560
But nature does seek to balance itself one way or another.

415
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,800
You know, life recycles itself

416
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:32,080
and then finds a way when it's necessary and finds a way to end when it's not.

417
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:36,440
It's the also, you know, the term piss, you know, getting pissed on and pissed

418
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,820
or whatever is the popular term.

419
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,460
It's there's an art called Doween.

420
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,900
I think it's spelled deal hyphen.

421
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,640
I am. It's like a self stimulation.

422
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:50,720
Then, OK, ladies, we're talking about just Asian stuff here.

423
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,180
But maybe their batteries are done.

424
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:58,140
OK, so so what you what is is

425
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,620
imagine standing and take your right hand to make a light fist.

426
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,660
And with that light fist, start tapping your left arm

427
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,380
all the way from your hand up to your shoulders and neck

428
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,040
and then reverse and do that.

429
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:15,220
And then you do like your back and you're outside of your legs all the way down.

430
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,840
OK, what that's doing is stimulating the bladder meridian.

431
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,860
And this is the athletes that were prone to injury.

432
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,860
I would show to do that.

433
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,660
They would no longer have injuries or crashes or falls or whatever

434
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,660
because the body's trying to make best.

435
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,480
And that's the bladder meridian.

436
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,880
It's the largest meridian, the most around the entire outside

437
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,940
of the entire body is the bladder meridian.

438
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,660
And that requires the most stimulation.

439
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,420
So let's say you're riding your bike and you keep crashing

440
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,600
or you're one of the people that are known to crash often.

441
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:46,960
If you start doing Doween, right, you will crash less.

442
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,640
And this is also more important for people who are like boxers or wrestlers

443
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,880
or any sport, any sport, right?

444
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,560
Yeah. Or physical.

445
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,840
Let's say you work in construction.

446
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,940
Very important, right?

447
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,180
Anything physical to do doing the stimulation of the outer

448
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,600
peripheral of the body.

449
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,720
There was also there's also other forms of doing that were taught to warriors,

450
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,680
fighters, people that were going into battle

451
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,260
and lessened your chance of getting a hit or getting hit.

452
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,280
And it's the bladder meridian.

453
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,380
So I just want to bring that up, you know, making best.

454
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:22,460
In other words, if you know the body requires a certain amount of stimulation

455
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,080
and if you don't offer it or it doesn't encounter that,

456
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,620
it will happen anyway in a way that you maybe don't like.

457
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,000
Why don't you do it?

458
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,400
You know, right.

459
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,760
Why don't you do it preemptively?

460
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,200
So that's called going deal.

461
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:41,620
I am going is in Japanese and doing or doing

462
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,240
or going, going in Chinese.

463
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,260
You know, it's kind of like Jane.

464
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,780
So a lady named Jane from China, the name tag.

465
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,220
I said, oh, what was your name in China?

466
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,840
She was saying, I said, that's close enough.

467
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,860
That's how it works.

468
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:56,860
So doing.

469
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,280
Yeah, that happens a lot with with with people that come from other places.

470
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,940
They adopt a name. It's funny.

471
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,260
A lot of completely different.

472
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,100
Yeah, but it's good when it's.

473
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,140
Well, names are names are exempt from.

474
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,500
Translation, so whatever your name sounds like

475
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:17,360
is what it should be in any language spelled phonetically.

476
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,160
That's why when I ask people, is it so what sound do you answer to?

477
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,620
And I'm like, what? I said, what's your name?

478
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,320
Well, what's your name? It's something you answer to, right?

479
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,120
It's a sound that you answer to. True.

480
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,920
Meaning if you're totally unfamiliar with the language,

481
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,660
people are having a conversation.

482
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,740
Go to someone who's unfamiliar with the language.

483
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,140
So how many times did you mention his name?

484
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,180
I don't know what the hell they're talking about. Right.

485
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,480
So they're all sounds to you. Right.

486
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,220
Yeah. So how can we react to this sound?

487
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,800
And look, he's reacting to this sound right now, but punching the guy in the face.

488
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,820
Oh, wow. Look at that.

489
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,880
And you know that if you're in a crowded restaurant

490
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,920
and you hear your own name, you know, being said, right.

491
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:53,240
You like I'm sitting somewhere and I hear, you know, Chuck over there.

492
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,560
I go, I turn my head because I'm thinking it must be me.

493
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,600
That's the sound that you respond to.

494
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,220
That is the sound I respond to.

495
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,160
That's right. You know, names. That's all names.

496
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,700
Yeah, absolutely.

497
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,920
When you put a number on it, it becomes a beneficiary trust.

498
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,540
So we got into that a little bit.

499
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,420
We did get into that recently. Yes.

500
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,480
And there's more. There's a lot more to get into it.

501
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,680
It's fun when you do it.

502
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,240
I could tell you a story about a drug dealer

503
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:21,500
that was in there for a little while and Tennessee. OK.

504
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:27,680
And he shot TBI officer, a detective. OK.

505
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,840
And he was the detective was posing as a buyer

506
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,520
and he shot him in the head, killed him.

507
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,100
So he was in prison in Tennessee. Right.

508
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,240
And he runs into Chris.

509
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,560
Chris, like you said, what do I do?

510
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,500
And give me a death penalty.

511
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,700
Well, maybe we could do something.

512
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,680
I'll give you a death penalty.

513
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,160
By the way, he got out of jail doing this.

514
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,320
Oh, I'm going to tell you.

515
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,540
This is all right. Let me think about it.

516
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,480
I'll give you an answer tomorrow.

517
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,420
So they got together

518
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,880
and he says, all right, back in the 80s,

519
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:00,440
Ronald Reagan declared a war on drugs and it was written up as a war.

520
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,240
Congressionally and all that.

521
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,780
So because you're being charged with drug felony

522
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:12,020
and the homicide and all this and it's a war, you're an enemy combatant.

523
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,800
You can't be treated as a civilian.

524
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,940
So what they're doing to you by trying to give you the death penalty

525
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,140
is against the U.N. and Geneva Convention.

526
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,400
Right. You can't execute prisoners, right?

527
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,540
You can't go pick up every and you can't go pick up every soldier

528
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,660
that battled you in a war afterwards.

529
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:30,520
You know, yeah, in a lawful.

530
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,720
Yeah. So anyway, he says, go in there.

531
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,440
He says, just tell your lawyer that tells the lawyers.

532
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,040
Oh, if I tell him that, I'll pull my license away. Right.

533
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,360
So it's OK. So he goes up there.

534
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,760
He says, yelling in the court, all this stuff out.

535
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,800
Yeah. And there's more to it.

536
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,180
But he's basically because of the war on drugs.

537
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,740
I am an enemy combatant.

538
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,680
I'm a combatant.

539
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,840
And what you're doing to me here is against the Geneva Convention,

540
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,660
the United Nations.

541
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,620
I'm going to I'm filing.

542
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:57,880
I'm actively filing a report and a complaint to the Hague.

543
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,240
They were like, holy shit.

544
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:01,840
Is that cool?

545
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,960
That is really because that is really I mean, think about that.

546
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,820
That is fucking cool.

547
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,760
So that's what this law they call it lawfare.

548
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,380
Now it's fine.

549
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,560
It's actually my cup of tea.

550
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,800
I love because you have to think outside the box. Right.

551
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,740
But how far outside?

552
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:19,080
That's not really that far outside the box to say that I'm in jail

553
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,720
because I'm a drug dealer and I shot an undercover cop and killed him.

554
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,240
How far of a leap is it to say, well, it's war?

555
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,880
I'm a combatant. How far?

556
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:31,260
Because everybody everybody's been told about the war on drugs.

557
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,040
Everyone for years. Absolutely.

558
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,360
So where is where? How far outside the box is that?

559
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,720
It's not really. It's just right.

560
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,340
Right in the box, isn't it?

561
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,820
Not at all. It's right. Right.

562
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:44,320
And right up their alley, because if they have a legal declaration, right,

563
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,180
they're supposed to adhere to their legal.

564
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,340
So now we're talking about combatants.

565
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,220
Since when do like county jails handle warfare combatants?

566
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,940
You know, they don't. Yeah, they don't.

567
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:57,260
It's international law. It's Geneva Convention, dude.

568
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,400
So they yeah, it goes on and on.

569
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,700
He he went to the transfer him to a more minimal thing.

570
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:06,060
He's out. They gave him parole, like 15 years paroling.

571
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,000
A month later, they called him in.

572
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,580
This is not just three months parole.

573
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,680
And two weeks later, they called him. You're off parole. You're done.

574
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,000
Wow. They went from 15 years to three months to two.

575
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,200
So two weeks he was finished.

576
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,640
They're in and out. Yeah. Yeah.

577
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,840
That's the truth. Right.

578
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,940
It's what he what he was saying was actually the truth.

579
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,520
Well, they wanted him the hell out of there.

580
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,400
So he didn't tell somebody.

581
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,300
Well, they wanted him dead to get that bond.

582
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,680
He was on death row, ready to be put

583
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,000
on death row.

584
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,780
Because yeah, right before you go to death row, they have another trial. Right.

585
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,340
Yeah. No, it's just really cool.

586
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,540
I like that legal thinking.

587
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,900
You see, it's it's all legal, but it's always it's a shame and the pathetic

588
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,360
how we're told about the human body.

589
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,400
You have to go to a doctor and for law, you go to a lawyer.

590
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,460
Everyone should be thinking about medical practices.

591
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:52,420
The word practice, by the way, is that corporate thing to

592
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:56,320
in medical has usually to do with administering pharmaceuticals,

593
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,820
but should think about their biology and should think about the rule and order

594
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,740
and law constantly.

595
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,920
You should always be thinking about those things constantly and developing them.

596
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,340
So law and medicine, they both they call them both practices.

597
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,880
You know, that's the corporate side.

598
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,000
That's a term used by the United States.

599
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,920
So it used to be shell shock years ago.

600
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:18,580
Now it's PTSD because shell shock was an actual condition,

601
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,400
you know, whatever.

602
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:22,640
But PTSD is something that the bankers have trademarked.

603
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,760
So they can monetize that.

604
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,720
They can't monetize a bond when someone gets bonded,

605
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,820
medically bonded with a condition.

606
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,240
They monetize that shell shock.

607
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,700
You see, it's just like when you look at your states, they're spelled out.

608
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,720
But with those little two letter abbreviations,

609
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,940
those are trademarked by the Federal Reserve. Right.

610
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,840
Right. So the things you use in your mailing codes like Georgia's

611
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,000
mailing codes, language codes, you know, all over the now

612
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,100
the Internet is another government itself.

613
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,940
They're doing another thing with the Internet.

614
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:52,340
It's another.

615
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,620
So someone recently messaged me about a confused about Arizona or this or that.

616
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,020
I said, no, no.

617
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,320
What you're confused about is everything you hear about on television

618
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,180
that's political.

619
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,600
And they mention a political geographic area.

620
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,540
They're not talking about the geography. Right. Right.

621
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,060
There is no United States.

622
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,140
There is no state of Georgia, state of Arizona.

623
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:10,980
There is no such thing.

624
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,680
It's a corporation, right?

625
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,520
It has no geographic could be anywhere.

626
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:19,300
Title 28, section 3002, subsection 15A.

627
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,040
Right. You could be is no geographic.

628
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,140
And that's why it's conferring nationality.

629
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,160
That's when a cop pulls you over.

630
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,480
Let's say if you're going to Tennessee, you run a red light.

631
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,960
So the first thing says, you know, in the state of Tennessee, it's illegal.

632
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:36,220
They always say, or if you're in Georgia, they before they tell you

633
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,680
why they're arresting you or giving you a ticket on the state of Georgia,

634
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:42,120
what they're doing there when they say state of the United States,

635
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,420
they're conferring nationality.

636
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:46,960
You say, oh, I disagree about that national nationality statement there.

637
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:51,440
But you move a little too fast right now for the purposes of this arrest.

638
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,880
I'm in Antarctica or for the purpose.

639
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,900
And no one can tell you you're not because when you say Antarctica,

640
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,700
it's not talking about the geography.

641
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,520
It's where you're conferring your nationality.

642
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:03,240
It gets complicated because you've never heard this before.

643
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,400
But if you were raised

644
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,420
knowing this, you'd say, Greek, why are you talking to me?

645
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,400
I should have any better thing better to say. We know that. Right.

646
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,180
I don't know too many people that know that.

647
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,380
That's for sure. Yeah. You see.

648
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,640
So, yeah. So it's interesting.

649
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,520
And we have so much doubt.

650
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,360
If you have the, quote unquote, the law on your side

651
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,140
and everyone, including the judges, lawyers, your family,

652
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,160
it's like that's not how it is. What are you going to do?

653
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,520
Stick with the law. Stick with it.

654
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,860
Because they'll just they'll capitulate.

655
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,340
They'll capitulate.

656
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,460
I mean, just like these guys that call them sovereign citizens or whatever.

657
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,660
They go into court. They start.

658
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,260
It's all, Judge, I have not before.

659
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:45,420
I'm here in form of proper, a jury jurist in form of proper.

660
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,020
This is not pro se, pro se.

661
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,640
You really get no jurisdiction.

662
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:54,920
And I'm telling this goddamn court, you judge up there, you start cursing.

663
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,720
And they're like, they can't do anything to you

664
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,480
because you haven't they haven't gotten jurisdiction yet.

665
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,520
I don't recommend doing that.

666
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,200
But just be yourself and be angry.

667
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:07,700
Be really upset, because they even if you're sitting in jail for a long time,

668
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,360
you start getting upset about the jurisdiction.

669
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,480
They're going to figure out a way to get you out, dump you into another prison,

670
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,940
because remember, they when they transfer bonds, they get a commission. Right.

671
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,680
Oh, yeah. Right.

672
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:20,160
So and then that that that I've heard that says, oh,

673
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,060
they want me to be somebody else's problem.

674
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,100
Well, you don't have to stay.

675
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,540
Right. So that's your question.

676
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,520
The jurisdiction was so many jurisdictional issues.

677
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,280
So many because all the law says it has to be a competent authority

678
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:32,780
in government.

679
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,780
These are all listed on Dun & Bradstreet.

680
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,380
How are they a competent authority?

681
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,120
That says a corporation cannot be a government.

682
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,620
And the government cannot be a corporation.

683
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,000
So you stick with all that.

684
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,880
I always tell people, stick with it.

685
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,280
You do the right thing.

686
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,340
It's a lot of people are afraid of the IRS. Same thing.

687
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,020
IRS, every time you do something right, you get a response from the IRS says,

688
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:55,200
yes, we got your letter about this as Congress has ratified

689
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,960
or has Congress has approved always.

690
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,960
And if they send you a nasty letter saying you sound like a tax protester

691
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,020
and we are taxing you because Congress has.

692
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,260
So whenever you deal with the IRS, everything has to do with Congress,

693
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:12,220
not when you look for law, stick with stuff that's in Congress has done.

694
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,220
That's because they're working with right.

695
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,920
Congress that Mark Twain said the most dangerous thing to America

696
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,680
is when Congress goes to session. Right.

697
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,020
Yeah. So I just give up the little tidbit.

698
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,720
People like trying to go away.

699
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,560
So the IRS, they go try to pull things here.

700
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,420
They're no, no, no.

701
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,740
Stick with what Congress actions of Congress.

702
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,140
And they'll they'll recognize that right away.

703
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,200
That's what they're trained to do.

704
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,800
It's interesting to find out

705
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,800
how when you're dealing with an agency or a group, even a group,

706
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,480
let's say you want to become a Freemason.

707
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,080
You don't know anything about Freemason, but you want to be one.

708
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,100
Isn't it good to find out

709
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,580
what their inner workings and inner rules are first?

710
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:52,220
Not what you think they are, what they say they are.

711
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,940
Right. Right.

712
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,740
Well, whatever. Boy Scouts, anything.

713
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,460
I don't recommend any of those associations.

714
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:01,500
But what I'm saying is find out how they work internally

715
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,200
when you work in the IRS internally.

716
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,040
They're always saying there are people where you see Congress,

717
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:05,800
you know, blah, blah, blah.

718
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,220
That's why we do this in Congress.

719
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,800
When they send you a letter, Congress, you need a pro or con.

720
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,340
It's Congress.

721
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,000
So guess what? You're going to look for

722
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:17,260
stuff that Congress has in Europe that will work for you. Right. Right.

723
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:21,360
Yeah. Demand for lawful money for twelve, four, eleven.

724
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,640
They look like, yeah, OK, cool.

725
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,640
Congress says that's right.

726
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,800
Anything else start hitting you with fines and arguing when

727
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,580
I'm not a citizen?

728
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,080
You know, there's so many other these is a whole bunch of auto workers

729
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,580
that knew about the W-8 Ben filed, and they people working on auto factories,

730
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:41,520
you know, in America haven't get no withdrawal taken out of their check for decades

731
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,120
because they filed W-8 Ben.

732
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,420
All right. Anyway, so

733
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:50,560
and then the IRS says you can't file W-8 Ben.

734
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,880
As you say, I'm not a U.S. citizen, even though they're born here.

735
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,160
Right. U.S. citizen means you're a citizen of the United States,

736
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,760
which is somewhere in the District of Columbia.

737
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,380
Right. Everyone has the mistake that the United States is in

738
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,640
is the District of Columbia.

739
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,740
No, it's in the District of Columbia.

740
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,420
So you go to the District of Columbia and you start driving around.

741
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,340
Look for the United States.

742
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,219
You'll never find it.

743
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,400
There's no specific location.

744
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,480
Same with state of Arizona.

745
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,280
Where is state of Arizona or state of Georgia?

746
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,280
Go down to the ability.

747
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:17,320
Where is the state of this is the address.

748
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,219
OK, I'm at this address.

749
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,239
Where is the state of Arizona?

750
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:19,920
Where is the show?

751
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,760
Never going to find it.

752
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,340
That's all what you pledge to.

753
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,340
Right. But by the way, I'm a citizen of slow Jamestown.

754
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:32,620
Slow. Yeah, you know, like at night, the DJs play slow jams.

755
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,219
I got you. I got you.

756
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,420
I took you a second there.

757
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,760
I'm like, slow jam is what?

758
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:40,420
But I got it. Yeah, it's it's a real place, by the way.

759
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,900
It's also they do have they could make conferred your geographic location.

760
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,900
Look it up to put in the kingdom of slow jam.

761
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,440
There's a king, too. He's pretty cool.

762
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,940
He is a DJ to put in.

763
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,239
I'm doing it right now. Kingdom.

764
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:59,260
OK, of slow jam and stand.

765
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,380
Well, you got to sign up to be a citizen, too.

766
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,240
And you could you got to pay if you want a passport.

767
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,120
Here you go. What does it say?

768
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,420
You do it slow. Jamestown just says it's J.A.M.A.

769
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:13,100
Founded on December 1st, 2021 by slow jam DJ Randy Williams.

770
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,760
So Jamestown is located in an empty part of desert state Route 78.

771
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,600
Micronation political entity that claims independence.

772
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,000
Well, if you go to images.

773
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:27,720
Yeah, he is actually he was accepted by the embassy of Cuba.

774
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,240
He went to Cuba.

775
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,620
Because right now, you know, if you're a U.S. citizen, you don't go to Cuba.

776
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,600
But if you're in slow Jamestown, you can't. Right.

777
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,380
Yeah, he has a border patrol.

778
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,100
He does. He's only right there.

779
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,920
So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, eight people

780
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,320
and seven people in his cabinet in him. You see it.

781
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,140
Anyway. Wow.

782
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,300
Are you able to pull it up?

783
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,460
I'm trying to pull it up, but my browser is giving me trouble.

784
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,480
Oh, that's why slow and then Jamestown.

785
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,280
Yeah. All A's.

786
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,800
Yeah, it's a real place.

787
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,380
And you go to their site and you sign up your citizen.

788
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,000
If you want a passport, they have passports and all that, too.

789
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,720
Yeah. Now, it says it's not recognized by the United States,

790
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:12,100
but the all the codes and the statutes and the law says that

791
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:15,160
how to confer national, how to create a nation.

792
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,940
Basically, you have to do is be at peace.

793
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:19,540
And Brandon, Joe Williams goes over this.

794
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,460
And you don't have to be recognized by any other nation to be a nation.

795
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:26,280
So a lot of times when they when they bring them up in the media,

796
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,600
it is not recognized by the United States.

797
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,380
It doesn't have to be.

798
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,880
I got the Republic of Slow Jamestown website here.

799
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,020
Yeah, there you go. Yeah.

800
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,320
I wrote Kingdom, but it's the Republic.

801
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,880
OK, so like, for example, Cuba doesn't exist

802
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,220
because the United States doesn't recognize it.

803
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,080
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

804
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,820
What a crock of shit, right?

805
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:42,920
OK, I see.

806
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,140
Randy R. Dubb Williams is the soldier.

807
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,240
Yeah, I want to go sign up.

808
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,960
The sultan of Slow Jamestown, the sultan of Slow Jamestown.

809
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,660
There's another micronation in Nevada is a few micronations.

810
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,000
Yeah. And you do have some certain amenities.

811
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,620
Yeah, he's going to you.

812
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,360
I think he went to a California court on a traffic ticket.

813
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,220
I think he beat it because of that beat.

814
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,540
You know, so I'm going to go look up and see what how he did with it.
