1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,700
Rated Y, 135.

2
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,740
So here we are, Greek.

3
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,700
And how are you doing today?

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,379
You're yawning a bit before we started recording.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,540
Yeah, I had dinner and just fell out.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,540
I've got a cat on my shoulder.

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,400
I'm walking around.

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,060
I'm going to go outside and have a smoke and we'll continue this discussion with a cat

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:26,580
on my shoulder.

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,880
He just has to be on my shoulder.

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,560
Well, that's cool.

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,080
I mean, was he looking to relax?

13
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,159
Were you looking to relax?

14
00:00:31,299 --> 00:00:33,100
Is there forced relaxation here?

15
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:33,740
What's going on?

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,120
Yeah.

17
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:34,720
All of it.

18
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:34,940
Yeah.

19
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,020
That's how animals die.

20
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,040
You know, a lot of things that people mistake, well, I shouldn't say mistake completely,

21
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,600
association with animals.

22
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,220
You know, the animal's so friendly, likes me.

23
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,560
It's actually domination, domination tactics, you know, a lot of times when cats rubbing

24
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,140
up against you, it's, it's dumb, it's, it's marking you, right?

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:55,780
Right.

26
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,640
So yeah.

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,100
Yeah.

28
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:57,920
Yeah.

29
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,820
We've got some stuff going.

30
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,960
Didn't you bring up a super moon?

31
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:01,240
Yeah.

32
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:01,620
Yeah.

33
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm going to bring that up in a second.

34
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,940
But just since you bring up the animals real fast, I mean, cats and dogs seem different

35
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:07,500
in this way.

36
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:07,840
Right.

37
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,800
Because cats, I believe in, you know, as soon as you say domination, I go, yeah, and you're

38
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,220
right about, oh, he's so friendly.

39
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:14,940
No, he doesn't love you.

40
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,040
He's just making sure that you're his, but nobody does.

41
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:19,820
Well, no.

42
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,400
No, they do love you.

43
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,360
Actually, I felt more affection from cats and dogs.

44
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:24,820
Really?

45
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,320
Well, they do.

46
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,580
They both have a tremendous affection, I should say, that they just show it differently.

47
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,540
And I'm more into pussy than into dogs.

48
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,760
So anyway, well, maybe I'm more doggy style.

49
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,380
What can I say?

50
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:41,500
But the thing is, they just seem to be more of the affectionate type to me.

51
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,520
I don't know if that's just a personal thing or I mean, are they more submissive than cats?

52
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,620
Generally speaking, you think?

53
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:48,420
No.

54
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,020
Well, I also view dogs.

55
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,960
I was I learned from a young age, if you have an unemployed dog, it's not going to be a

56
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,560
happy dog.

57
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,080
Any dog.

58
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,420
They always need a job.

59
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,880
They have to have something to do.

60
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,960
So I'm not for the dogs in the New York City apartment kind of thing, you know, you got

61
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,720
to have some property and it's not just a friend that you got to they have to have

62
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,139
a job.

63
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,000
Otherwise, they get whatever, you know, not always, you know, not always, but typically

64
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,720
well, my little dogs, they have to warn us when people come near the property or on the

65
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,060
property.

66
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:17,420
Right.

67
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:17,960
Yeah.

68
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,380
That's part of their job.

69
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,500
And, you know, but but I don't know, Buster is super affectionate, though.

70
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,740
He likes to you think he's just marking me when he wants to, like, get up on my leg and

71
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,560
stuff.

72
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,520
Of course.

73
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,540
Of course.

74
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,120
OK.

75
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,060
I was just curious.

76
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:32,900
Anyway.

77
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,420
No, you did mention the super moon.

78
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,260
And because I mentioned it to you before we started recording.

79
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,160
And the thing is, and people talk about this, oh, it's a super moon.

80
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,780
There's a special moon coming.

81
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,340
It's extra.

82
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,840
But it's so funny.

83
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,540
You said something to me right before we recorded.

84
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,920
I'd love for you to repeat because, I mean, people are so stupid that, you know, the word

85
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,280
month.

86
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,300
What does it sound like?

87
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:51,980
It sounds like.

88
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:52,840
Yeah.

89
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,840
Well, anything they have to say, they meaning the conventional society is foolish.

90
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,500
They even have a ridiculous thing where the blue moon, you have two moons, two full moons

91
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,140
in one month.

92
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:03,760
What?

93
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,060
Yeah.

94
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,460
But that doesn't make any sense.

95
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,760
You have to move on.

96
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,580
Your month starts.

97
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,880
You have two months and one month.

98
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:09,400
Great.

99
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:09,620
Right.

100
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,160
Oh, my gosh.

101
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,040
It's so ridiculous.

102
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,140
You know, this leads into a lot of things.

103
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,280
I think I want to bring up someone mentioned in chat.

104
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:21,640
So the moon thing's pretty short because there there's no comparison or you can contrast.

105
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,020
But you can't compare what the norm is.

106
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,880
The regular people have in their societies of many modern culture.

107
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,840
It's all Western culture, even the Chinese.

108
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,240
Right.

109
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,960
And Asian.

110
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,620
And what's interesting about the Asian culture, it's all about vanity.

111
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:41,340
People don't understand that, you know, I can't stand people from Asia because of the

112
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:41,740
vanity.

113
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,760
I mean, I love Asian culture.

114
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,440
I love you.

115
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:45,800
Do enjoy.

116
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,420
I love the food.

117
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,020
I love the traditional ways.

118
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:54,840
But the current like modern people remember, I'm going to be my 60th year next month.

119
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:03,300
And I still when I was when I was young, some old wise man told me, you know, you're getting

120
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,640
old when you walk into a room and everybody in the room is younger than you.

121
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,360
And a lot of people, you know, start you hear about them dying.

122
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:10,660
Right.

123
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,100
Anyway.

124
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,680
So the average age is around 30 years old.

125
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,459
Right.

126
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:18,480
And it's very immature because they were captured.

127
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,820
Their mentality was captured, you know, 30 years ago or 20 years ago.

128
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,620
Very, very bad.

129
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,180
So the vanity of the Asian people, I just can't stand.

130
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,520
And it's not them.

131
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,460
It's not them, meaning the 30 somethings or the 20 somethings or whatever.

132
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:39,000
Even before I give you I lived with an Asian family, they were Indonesian Chinese for about

133
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,360
two weeks when I was 17 years old.

134
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,560
And the man cooks, the dad cooks, everyone waits for the dad.

135
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,780
He comes in, breaks out the wok, makes a dish, a vegetable stir fry.

136
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,780
Everybody gets rice.

137
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,680
And by the way, they eat with tablespoons, not chopsticks, because you could scoop a

138
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,100
lot better.

139
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,120
So the chopsticks are for scooping.

140
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,240
Tablespoon is a much more efficient they spoon the rice in their mouth.

141
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,460
They still have chopsticks.

142
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,260
And everyone picks the entree from the center.

143
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,320
You don't get like your entree, your side and all that in the same plate.

144
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,340
You just have a bowl of rice.

145
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,520
OK, make a long story short.

146
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,180
This was a two bedroom apartment with like nine people in me.

147
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,180
And and right when it came to bedtime, everyone knew their place.

148
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:26,880
It was an L couch or three people slept along the L couch to two people slept in the bed.

149
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,700
Two people slept on the floor near the bed.

150
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,240
The two people slept in the back foyer.

151
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,700
Everyone found a place to sleep.

152
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:33,980
Right.

153
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,900
You just didn't want to block the bathroom.

154
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:36,420
OK.

155
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,440
And that's how everybody lived.

156
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:44,140
It was, you know, now the aunt that lived there worked in a sweatshop at minimum wage.

157
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,180
And one day when I happened to be there, she comes home and she's so excited that she bought

158
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,220
a Gucci handbag.

159
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,960
A Gucci handbag.

160
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:53,240
OK.

161
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,320
Now, I don't know.

162
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,540
What is a Gucci handbag?

163
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,560
Oh, thousands now.

164
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,860
But then it was at least nine hundred or a thousand.

165
00:05:59,020 --> 00:05:59,280
Yes.

166
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,160
There you are.

167
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,400
Five hundred dollars.

168
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:05,340
That's like a week's pay at a decent job kind of bag, at least.

169
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,100
And some people.

170
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:06,640
Three months.

171
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,040
Three months.

172
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,140
Yeah.

173
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,160
Probably a month.

174
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,140
More than a month's pay.

175
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,380
So she could walk around.

176
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,280
She's poor.

177
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,500
Off the boat.

178
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,220
Are you right?

179
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,100
And it's what most important thing for her was not to get her and her daughter on a place.

180
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:23,720
It may be a better paying job, but to get a Gucci bag.

181
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,580
And at that point, I started paying more attention to this culture.

182
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,300
And I was like, oh, the vanity is unbelievable.

183
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:29,780
Right.

184
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,780
Because you're going to go.

185
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,160
Yeah.

186
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,740
Because you're willing to invest money that you could spend on a whole month's rent into

187
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,320
a bag.

188
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,600
We don't have to explain it.

189
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,380
Just think about it.

190
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,460
Just think about what I just said.

191
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,900
It's no different than in the ghetto.

192
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:40,620
The ghetto.

193
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:41,260
Right.

194
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,520
You buy a two thousand dollar car, you touch it up with spray paint from the or a thousand

195
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,620
dollar car or you inherit a car.

196
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,700
You touch it up with spray paint.

197
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,660
That's close enough for me.

198
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,120
It's hardware.

199
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,080
But you go out and spend four thousand dollars on spinning rims.

200
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,860
Those days are up.

201
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,320
Do you need to explain anything there?

202
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,360
It's vanity.

203
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:00,960
It's pure.

204
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,320
So in other words, the vanity has outdone.

205
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:08,100
And there's a there's a lesson here for the current vanity, because the current vanity

206
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,640
is that we're technologically advanced.

207
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,980
Why are we having these problems yet?

208
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,820
They're dumb or they're doornails.

209
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,060
Right.

210
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,920
It's also it's also akin to the you know, in any neighborhood anywhere, actually, not

211
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,080
just the ghetto with the spinning rims, but any neighborhood anywhere.

212
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,120
You got five hundred dollar car with a two thousand dollar stereo.

213
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:24,740
Right.

214
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,960
You don't have to explain it.

215
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,280
Wherever you tell this is happening to you should be able to see it's vanity.

216
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,120
I've kind of spelled it out.

217
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:37,200
But the same with the moons, the same with what everyone is talking about out in the world

218
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:37,400
here.

219
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,640
There's one or two more items I want to cover.

220
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,240
Let's cover the dentistry real quick.

221
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,420
Someone brought up dentistry.

222
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,320
I saw it in the chat.

223
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,540
It's funny because I rebuilt an upper and lower partial just the other day.

224
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,200
And my advice to people doing dentistry is learn how to communicate in it, because you're

225
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,680
going to need the tools of the trade and the language of the trade.

226
00:07:59,400 --> 00:07:59,520
Right.

227
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:06,000
So there's actually enough classes and courses online you can zoom through and have a better

228
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,500
better part of an undergraduate degree in dentistry.

229
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,840
You can do it on your own.

230
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,420
And dentistry is amazing in that it is one of those things that, you know, how you talk

231
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:19,080
about everything was already done 150 years ago, it is one of those things that literally

232
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,260
the tools haven't changed even there is, you know, the same tools that, say, Doc Holliday

233
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,720
used when he was a gunfighter.

234
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,500
He was a dentist.

235
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,920
The same tools he used are virtually the same things they use today.

236
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,580
Yes, they have a few motors and whatever.

237
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,320
But aside from that, it's about distraction.

238
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:39,539
OK, it's one other thing, because I had a medical doctor, recent conversation being

239
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:40,240
out in the wild.

240
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,720
And the medicine that you have right now, it's very clear what's going on.

241
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,860
If it was up to the elite, the people control the world, they would have no medical offered

242
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,160
to you at all, at all, die in the street.

243
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,940
If that were the case, people would get together and form their own groups and actually do

244
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:03,640
research and actually figure out how things work, much like we discuss here and actually

245
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,340
have incredible medicine, incredible, you know, the stuff where you can regrow parts

246
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,720
of the body and rapid healing and all that.

247
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,100
So instead, what they do is they have this medical show, all fiction, universities very

248
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,480
well endowed, billions and billions in hospitals.

249
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:24,780
And the state, the administrative state, basically has laws.

250
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,500
Oh, you can't do it.

251
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,540
They only they can do it.

252
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,100
OK, that means that they're restricting it and they're closing it down, just like education,

253
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:32,680
academia.

254
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,120
Right.

255
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,280
Any all the school, any school that gets federal funding has to give all the bullshit.

256
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,940
Right. Which is all of them.

257
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,360
There are schools that are not federally funded.

258
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:46,260
But unfortunately, the people that try to operate those, just like people who homeschool.

259
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,900
Right. Where did they get their education?

260
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,480
Most likely from a federal school.

261
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,080
So when they homeschool or do a non-federally funded school, guess what?

262
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,320
They're going to teach the same shit that's being taught in the right.

263
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,760
Yeah. Unfortunately, I don't school.

264
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,260
So it doesn't make much of a difference.

265
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,400
Again, again.

266
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,880
Right. And I have done the homeschooling, by the way, and I try to change it up a bit.

267
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,380
But honestly, a lot of the stuff I wind up teaching is, in fact, the stuff that I learned

268
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,160
from. Yeah, I know.

269
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,220
Which doesn't work.

270
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:17,120
Yeah. You can teach it and you can show it, but tell them it's not part of the teaching.

271
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,880
Right. There's a difference.

272
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:24,620
Like really, math is one of those things that I don't mind using because it's you know, if

273
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,580
it makes sense, it makes sense.

274
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,740
The math works. Even the math is screwed up because they're not putting the emphasis on how

275
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,080
the math is practical.

276
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,420
They're putting the emphasis on a syllabus.

277
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,460
Well, see, that's the thing.

278
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:37,580
I'm trying to say, look, you can use this to do this with it.

279
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:43,000
You know what I mean? When I do math with my with Frankie, I do it so that it's like,

280
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,900
look, this is this and you can actually apply it with this.

281
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,900
You know what I mean? You can measure this.

282
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,880
This is this long and this is why it makes sense.

283
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,000
You got to fit this into this.

284
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,280
You know, I try to apply some practical use to it, not just here's a number.

285
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,360
Here's a sheet. Here's the order you do it.

286
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,980
You know, hopefully if I were to do homeschooling or non-fairly funded school, I would

287
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:07,500
present what's being taught to everyone else as a presentation, but not as the teaching.

288
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,100
There's a difference. And however, that's couch back to dentistry.

289
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:20,000
The thing I would advise on dentistry is you have the the hardest part of the body, you

290
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,640
know, that's on the out, you know, in the mouth, the tooth near the softest part of the

291
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:28,720
body, which is the soft tissue of the the lingual, you know, the cheek, you know, all

292
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,720
that. Right. Just all everything going on in the mouth.

293
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,920
Tongue, teeth, soft.

294
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,580
OK. Yes. Very, very, very soft.

295
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:39,240
And for surface area, it's the softest surface area.

296
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,980
It's exposed next to the hardest.

297
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,540
So so what my point here, why are you saying that?

298
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,520
Because one of the most basic things and fundamental things in dentistry is an

299
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:55,500
extraction. When a tooth, it's very rare that a tooth should be reconstructed or

300
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,620
rehabilitated. It's better to have them just pulled out.

301
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,620
Because there's enough plastic so you can do partials now if you have a grouping.

302
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:07,020
But and the partials, if they're done right, which they're never done right, I'm

303
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,860
probably make the best partials in the world.

304
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,860
Partials like a denture.

305
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,020
You know, if you like, you lose your front teeth.

306
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,700
I can make one and it looks like your natural teeth.

307
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:18,860
As a matter of fact, I have I have front I have upper and lower partials right now.

308
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,100
I only have eight teeth left in my mouth, but I have a full set of teeth in my mouth.

309
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:25,280
Right. But only eight of them are left that are mine.

310
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:31,580
And all the other 24 are ones that I've made and put in and gotten and modified.

311
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,820
And it's funny when I see my dentist friend, he takes the partials and he shows

312
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:41,720
them to everyone in the lab or whoever's around.

313
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,740
And they're like, wow, those are pretty good.

314
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,900
OK, so what's the deal?

315
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,860
He says, well, he made these.

316
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:54,220
And they're like, well, you know, you have to be you have to understand that it's a

317
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,360
form of artistry. Right.

318
00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:00,720
And I do notice that good dentists are also like good sculptors, you know, meaning like

319
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,860
sculptors, the people who carve shit out of wood and marble and stone.

320
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,300
Right. Right. Because you have to form something that looks good and works well.

321
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:13,520
But my advice to that, again, is you have the hardest part of the tooth and the

322
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,720
softest part of the mouth.

323
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:20,760
And an extraction is usually the way to go with with most cases, especially if you

324
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,380
have what's called mobility, a loose tooth.

325
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,000
You know, we're talking about your adult teeth now.

326
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,460
We got loose. You have to extract that.

327
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:31,540
And then cleaning out the PDL, PDL, the periodontal ligament doesn't always have to be

328
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,760
cleaned out in the socket, depending on the mobility.

329
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:37,840
If you have three or four millimeter mobility in the tooth, the PDL is probably gone.

330
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,100
But if it's a loose tooth, it's very painful.

331
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,840
You're going to have to clean the socket out.

332
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,540
I've gone over this before.

333
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:49,200
Now, my point, my advice again is that when you get into that soft area known as the

334
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,740
mouth, all around, up, down, inside, back, front, very soft.

335
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,040
And you have something called a hard tooth.

336
00:13:55,140 --> 00:14:01,480
When you're going to do an extraction requires a good amount of energy and strength to

337
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:06,200
get that out. You have to wiggle back and forth, just like remember when you were a

338
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,440
child and you wiggled the tooth before you pulled it out.

339
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,160
You know, your baby teeth, I call them, right?

340
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,560
Right. Well, same thing with an adult.

341
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,940
But you don't want to be wiggling back and forth all day.

342
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,880
You got to go one, two, three out.

343
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,500
And it's really tough.

344
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:23,260
You got to have. It's kind of like those when you get to take a shvitz, you know, a

345
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,060
bath, a steam shower and you get a massage.

346
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:32,480
If you walked in there and a Russian bathhouse and it's time to get rubbed down and

347
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,400
you see some skinny, scrawny 90 pounder, that's not going to be a good massage.

348
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:43,040
You want someone that's two and a quarter, at least six foot, right, to give you a rub

349
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,220
down. Right. You know what I mean?

350
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,620
So you're going to have to find that energy.

351
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,460
If you're going to be doing extractions, you can't baby pussyfoot around.

352
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,520
It's one, two, three out.

353
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,000
And it's a lot. It's hard.

354
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:00,420
It's hard. It's like imagine pulling out a kernel of corn off the cob with your finger,

355
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,920
right? Not biting into it.

356
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,520
You know, are you strong enough to do that?

357
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,060
Or yeah, it's it's pretty tough.

358
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,740
It's pretty tough. And the reason I'm saying this is because you want to you want to

359
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,100
inflict as little pain.

360
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,260
It's called torture, as little pain as possible on who you're working on.

361
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,820
And the best thing is just one, two, boom out.

362
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:26,880
The hardest thing to learn in dentistry, if even if you're artistic or not, is doing an

363
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,880
extraction well.

364
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,620
Right. And that's it.

365
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,800
Other than that, it's fine, because once you get the teeth out of the mouth, there's

366
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,780
plenty of easy ways.

367
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:38,780
There are enough kits sold on Amazon that you can have a professional, semi-professional

368
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:42,540
dentist office set up at home for less than five hundred bucks right now.

369
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,500
Now, I'm at an unfair advantage because I know someone who's a dentist.

370
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,000
Very so often, his wife will say, oh, you know, I'm not going to mention names.

371
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,680
He left these tools for you.

372
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,940
You know, he's not using them anymore.

373
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,040
Come over. Maybe you could use some of these, you know, as a kind of relationship.

374
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,960
You know what I mean? It's not fair.

375
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,080
And yeah, I could roll with any dentist.

376
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,140
It's no big deal.

377
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:09,420
So yeah, and also there's plenty of topical antiseptics, not antiseptics,

378
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,860
anesthetics, anesthetics right now that they're horrible tasting.

379
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:20,280
But they get they get pretty deep into the tissue that if you didn't, instead of going

380
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:26,820
with a hypo into the into the under under to get to the nerve directly, a lot of the

381
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:33,180
topical ones in most cases will it'll feel like your nerve is numbed out.

382
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:37,960
So in other words, what I'm trying to say, get into dentistry because it's been

383
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:42,000
because we have tap water and sewer water separated.

384
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:46,540
And dentistry is why people are living longer, not because of any other reason.

385
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:51,240
So, yeah, I chose that because you can literally say you can extend someone's

386
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,540
life. If you're living with rotten teeth in your mouth, you're not going to live as

387
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,320
long as if you had them not in your mouth.

388
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,900
And no one has to be walking around toothless because you can you can make your

389
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,359
own dentures, your own parcels.

390
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:09,000
Right. I call them parcels even when it's a full because you need anyway, it's

391
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,819
another we can do it. I should do a dental seminar, shouldn't I?

392
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,020
That would be great. Yeah.

393
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,560
If you did one solid one.

394
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,079
Yeah, that would be good.

395
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,960
And just to show the do's and don'ts.

396
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,319
But you still have time before everything collapses, it seems.

397
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:22,560
Maybe, maybe not.

398
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:28,480
But, you know, something like when they did the COVID debacle, a lot of dentists

399
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,740
weren't seeing people. So you might have wanted to be able to do some dentistry.

400
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,540
Right. On a lockdown.

401
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,060
Right. And it's going to be one of those things where if you've got a big, major

402
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:39,880
problem, it's going to be an essential, you know, last thought of, but definitely

403
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,960
essential service to keeping people alive.

404
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,380
Yeah. The other thing I want to mention, I got messages from someone I consider a

405
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:51,200
friend and his one of his children had sprained an ankle

406
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,920
and he was messaging me.

407
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,820
I didn't get the message for four hours or so about wrapping it.

408
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,200
And they put cold on it.

409
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,540
And he was very unsure about he knows about the Greek speaking, the compression.

410
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:08,080
So my suggestion on that is when you hear me make up something, not

411
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,020
make up, but bring up something like compression on an injury.

412
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:17,600
And it's so radically different of an approach than what you see out there.

413
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,900
You have to meditate on that. So when the opportunity comes up to do it, you're ready

414
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:25,700
to go. And, you know, if you meditate on something that you've heard,

415
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:30,180
you can be you can for the first time, it'll be 90 percent if you've thought about

416
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,620
it. But if you haven't thought about, oh, you heard this or whatever, everybody runs

417
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,960
for an ice pack and you're like, well, rapid type, but I'm not sure I really think

418
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,260
about it. It's not going to work.

419
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,700
So. Right. So you have to really meditate and think that that I can't do for you.

420
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:47,540
I presented several things on great specifics and they're so simple.

421
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,460
I just keep being redundant, basically wrapped towards the heart.

422
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,920
Now, it was an ankle.

423
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:58,020
So in this case, what I messaged back was start wrapping from the middle of the foot

424
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,620
or wrap towards the heart, you know, back up towards the ankle.

425
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,000
But don't double back.

426
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,580
You ever see someone's ankle being wrapped?

427
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,760
They start at the middle of the foot, they wrap up to the ankle and they cross over

428
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,500
the ankle and they double back down and finish at the bottom of the foot.

429
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,100
Right. Usually. Right.

430
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,080
Don't do that, because when you wrap double back and go down towards the foot, what

431
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,700
are you doing? You're going against the heart, away from the heart and the energy

432
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,300
flow. You just change the whole thing.

433
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,360
So what do you do there?

434
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,880
You have two bandages or, you know, what you do is you wrap from the middle of the

435
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,240
foot towards the heart, which is up towards the ankle, up to be up towards the

436
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,800
calf. You stop there, tie it off, cut the bandage or get another bandage and start

437
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,240
again. Your second layer starts again at the middle of the foot.

438
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,580
That's one thing. When you go towards the heart, you cannot double back the same

439
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,720
with the wrist or the hand.

440
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,020
You're tempted. You ever see how a hand is wrapped?

441
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,640
They go back over the wrist and they double back again.

442
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,380
But when you double back, you're going away from the heart.

443
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:55,440
It's very critical that it's all motion and intent is towards the heart.

444
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,800
Big difference. Yeah.

445
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,520
So, yeah. And you have to do it immediately.

446
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:06,280
Very, very fast because you're living in a society of morons and you have a choice

447
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,820
to do what everybody else does or do something a little better.

448
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,440
Right. So that's what you have to think of, you know.

449
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:15,560
And but if you haven't meditated on it, practice means gone over it.

450
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,000
It's like rumination, right? Chewing the cut.

451
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,480
What I mean by meditate is when you hear something go over in your mind over and

452
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,600
over and over, even if you have to go back and replay the past minute a hundred

453
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,480
times, do it and think about it a hundred different ways or think about it for a

454
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,480
few days. Make notes on it.

455
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,920
That's meditation. The same thing.

456
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,880
It doesn't have to be constant new, new, new feed or stream of information.

457
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,760
Just go over the same thing because you'll see it differently over time, just like

458
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:45,280
it's. So let's say I did a sonic when it had one and a half minutes on wrapping

459
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,880
something tight, go back and replay that 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 times and think about it

460
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,360
for a few days. What will happen is by the second day, it'll be like, you know, when

461
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,000
you watch a movie the second time, you're like, I don't remember seeing this.

462
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,680
Right. Right. So it'll settle.

463
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,980
And that's what meditation is.

464
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:03,620
Well, I did that when I asked you about my hand, actually, because I had the same

465
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:07,060
thought, too. And when I did it immediately and I said, wait a minute, this is wrong

466
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,620
because I'm going back the other way.

467
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,800
Yeah. Don't back. That's that's what makes it so strange.

468
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,080
Yeah. And I took the bandage away and I said, you know what?

469
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,340
Let me think about this. And I did exactly what you said is I went back over in my

470
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,600
mind and said, no, it's supposed to go in that one direction.

471
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,240
If I go this way, I'm going in the opposite direction.

472
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,780
So that's why I do that. You don't do that.

473
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,260
You don't do that, does it?

474
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:31,660
Yeah. Yeah. With my hand, because you told me to start with the fingertips and then to

475
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,020
go toward. Yeah, right.

476
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,960
Towards the heart, towards the heart.

477
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,060
So it could be any part of the body.

478
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,360
Now, why does I think of let's just let's create some justification real quick.

479
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,240
So whether you're in real life, you see someone yourself or in the movies or on TV,

480
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,360
someone gets their nose punched or slammed and they what do they do?

481
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,500
They put their hands over it.

482
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,800
What do they cover? They press on.

483
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,620
They're not really pressing it, but they're covering it.

484
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,800
Right. Which is right.

485
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,680
More and more pressure than it would have been if they did.

486
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,140
Someone bumps an elbow.

487
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,240
Ouch. What do they do?

488
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,380
They reach over with their opposite arm and hand.

489
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,000
And what do they do?

490
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,680
Naturally, you hold it.

491
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,200
Yeah. You're always holding something.

492
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,960
That's the body's intelligence telling you, squeeze it, push, put pressure on it, even

493
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,600
if just touching it is more compression than not touching it.

494
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,820
So your body is telling you to do that.

495
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:21,760
But when you get that, you understand that it's a natural reflex because that's what you

496
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,160
should do. How do we advance that?

497
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:26,320
And that's what the Greek speak compression stuff on wounds is.

498
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,960
I've had I had an injury a week ago for a left forefinger and wrist.

499
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,560
And I was like, oh, this is really messed up.

500
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,640
This is going to hurt. It's going to be sore.

501
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:39,440
And as I'm saying this to myself, I'm walking around looking for some electrical tape and

502
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,880
paper towels. And I wrapped the paper towel first on the electrical tape, super tight

503
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,220
and paper towel you do.

504
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,280
So, you know, it doesn't the you want a bond breaker so that the adhesive doesn't stick to

505
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,900
your skin. Yeah, right.

506
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,740
Yeah. And it was 15 minutes.

507
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,500
My finger turned blue and my hand was numb.

508
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:01,880
Perfect. Unwrapped it and immediately wrapped it again.

509
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,760
Not as tight, not as tight.

510
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,160
After three hours, the third after the third time, which was very loose.

511
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:14,380
But that night I just, you know, barely felt a soreness.

512
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,800
And the next day it was healed, where if I had not, I would still be feeling it if I had

513
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,680
not done that. You know, most people say, well, it's not bad.

514
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,700
It'll get it'll get better.

515
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:27,820
No, do go ahead and practice the compression on the small stuff and watch stuff that you

516
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,840
expected a scratch or a cut.

517
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,340
I got cut by a sharp piece of metal on my forearm.

518
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,120
I was like, ah, it's not deep.

519
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,840
It's it's a cut.

520
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,860
Well, it's all right.

521
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,700
And I'm like, no, wrap that shit.

522
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,540
And I wrapped it and the next day it was healed almost completely.

523
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,760
Right. And that was the other thing about the compression is that I didn't do it right

524
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,860
away. I told you I had this problem for a little while.

525
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:53,060
So now I'm thinking to myself, remember, you had said and I remember you saying, look,

526
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:56,180
since you let it sit for a while, it's going to take now a while to pull it back.

527
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:00,440
If I had gotten on it right away, then I could have answered it right away and pulled back

528
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,100
the problem right away for this numbers.

529
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,360
Right. Right. Make a big deal of doing it when it's really minor.

530
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,480
So you could see how miraculous it is.

531
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,240
So when something major, you're confident.

532
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:12,660
And I've done really bad injuries that way.

533
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,020
A third degree.

534
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,360
What do you call when the bone comes through the tibia?

535
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,680
Yeah. And it was a laceration and a broken tibia.

536
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,200
But I'm saying compound fracture.

537
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:26,680
Yeah. But if you walked around with this problem now for a while and you didn't address

538
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,420
it, now it's going to take longer to address.

539
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,020
Oh, you couldn't walk around with a compound.

540
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,560
So I'm not a compound fracture.

541
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:36,320
I'm saying the thing that I had is that I realized also there's a time issue here where

542
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,480
if you get to it right away, then you can get it back right away.

543
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,500
But if you don't, it's going to take more time.

544
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,200
Yeah. That was something. Yeah.

545
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,400
In other words, you don't need to call the the body has its internal paramedics, ambulance

546
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,840
and emergency room. You don't want to activate that.

547
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,920
Right. Because that'll get swelling and it'll create a whole other.

548
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,520
Then what it'll do is say, oh, it's injured.

549
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,080
We need to separate from the rest of the body.

550
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:01,580
So go ahead and create some edema, send some plot, a lot of plasma there, get it to

551
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:04,600
swell up so it doesn't mess up any other part of the body.

552
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,740
You don't want that at all.

553
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:10,460
You want to tell yourself that nothing, everything's fine, you know, and you're on your

554
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:15,320
way. But yeah, yeah, it works really, really well.

555
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,240
And things that are inside the body.

556
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,520
Also, I've gotten messages.

557
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,320
Some person had some skin manifestations.

558
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,600
And the first thing is like, great, I'm glad it's on your skin, because if it was on the

559
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,520
internal organs, it would be much more difficult.

560
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:30,740
Right. So in society, we have stigmas of people that have skin manifestations.

561
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:36,920
But it's actually a blessing in a way that you're getting all that manifestation on the

562
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,600
surface and not in your liver or in your kidneys.

563
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,800
Right. Or in your brain.

564
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,900
Right. I mean, that's that's a little more harder.

565
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,700
It's much slower to recover from.

566
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,660
So when on the skin, you can actually do more topical things and you can monitor it.

567
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:57,080
You know, you could in other words, you can have what they call abnormal tissue growing

568
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,660
all over your liver and you don't know it.

569
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:02,260
You just feel slight discomfort and you never know it sometimes.

570
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:06,440
But if you have abnormal tissue on your skin, you're going to see it right away and do

571
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,460
something about it. Right.

572
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,060
Right. So it's actually a positive thing.

573
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,420
And then you can address it that way.

574
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,180
Yeah, there's so much to do.

575
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,900
I need to do a medical seminar somehow.

576
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:24,140
And actually, I think it's something that needs to be done in manual form, because

577
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,120
meditating on it with the audio is good.

578
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,860
But it may be having something on in text also.

579
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,580
That's where I need a publicist or someone because I'm like, there's so many things

580
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:39,540
that I'm working on that for me to sit down and write, you know, I guess I could do

581
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:44,160
an hour a day, you know, before I retire, let's say for the day, make sure I just

582
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,240
spend an hour, I guess.

583
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,860
I don't know. I'm not making excuses.

584
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:50,320
It can be done. But you should have something in writing like a bullet points at

585
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:55,720
least. And then combined with the audio, there might be.

586
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,240
I'm not going to. I'm not supposed to say this, but I'm going to say it.

587
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:03,680
There might be somebody working on a compilation of Greek speak stuff, which is

588
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,860
around twelve thousand thirteen thousand pages.

589
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:11,160
I went to an author's club one day, by the way, here in town on a meet up group

590
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:15,260
because authors clubs are not a book reading, but all were authors meet.

591
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,220
Right. Because it's all different subjects.

592
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:21,880
There was a retired psychiatrist, retired fireman, retired engineers, people from all

593
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,740
walks of writing books about whatever bullshit.

594
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:29,260
Right. Yeah. And they were like, oh, how do I get my manuscript down from one

595
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,400
hundred fifty thousand words?

596
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,500
I'm like, oh, yeah, OK.

597
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,040
How many pages is that? Four hundred pages or something, you know, three hundred

598
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,300
pages. I said, what are you?

599
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,940
All right. Well, who are you and what are you doing?

600
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,740
I said, well, I got what have you got written?

601
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,680
I said, I've got eleven thousand eight hundred something pages.

602
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,520
They thought I said words. I said, oh, that's easy.

603
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,220
I said pages. And they're like, what?

604
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,260
Who the hell's got eleven thousand twelve thousand pages of transcripts?

605
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,800
Right. Nobody that I know of.

606
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:56,200
I mean, I'm sure I'm sure they're out there, but, you know, to to publish.

607
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,480
But doing and this is the part that I'm not supposed to talk about is the possibility

608
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,880
of having all that accessed via an A.I.

609
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,600
search. So you say, you know, compression healing in the A.I.

610
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,000
searches is twelve thousand pages and brings up everything I've said about that

611
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,020
subject. Right. Is it the same guy who's working on the master manuscripts?

612
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,600
A master. Yeah, sort of, sort of.

613
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,020
It may never happen. I'm not supposed to talk about it, really.

614
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,980
But I kind of did because I'm seeing the necessity of it, because I think majority

615
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:33,220
of this kind of the salient Greek topics are you won't find anywhere else, which is

616
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,740
kind of pathetic because it's so basic.

617
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,360
Well, the thing that'll make it a great tool is a searchable index, which is exactly,

618
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:44,520
you know, right. But a very good of, you know, one that's very pertinent, not general,

619
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,260
because, you know, you search it and you got thirty six pages.

620
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,120
No, I mean, like spot on.

621
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,260
That's where. Yeah, no, I don't know.

622
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,500
A very something like that.

623
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,640
Yeah. Very specific.

624
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,660
Well, look, there's a difference between an index and a well done index, too.

625
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:02,520
So, I mean, an index that's really searchable and easy, you know, very accessible

626
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,520
and very specific when you search for specific things.

627
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,020
So that that's the that's the key of it.

628
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,500
Transcripts are nothing anymore.

629
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,280
They they're automated at this point.

630
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,400
You know, that's what I mean.

631
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,400
Yeah. Yeah. But if you're a good speaker, it should read well.

632
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,360
Oh, no, definitely.

633
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:21,040
But it doesn't mean that you can't make it even better with the search based on the

634
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,300
indexing, like I said. So I keep using that word.

635
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,780
Why? OK, anyways.

636
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,400
So anything else you want to cover here?

637
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,900
So I think we're good. OK, excellent.
