1
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:14,900
Rated Y, 136, we could sit here and talk about the stuff that everybody else does.

2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,480
But if that would be the case, you wouldn't be here listening to this, would you?

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,400
You wouldn't want to come here and hear us talk about what, the Democratic National Convention.

4
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,200
Which side are you on?

5
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,720
Does it actually matter?

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,560
It's so retarded.

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,380
Once you start looking at definitions of terms and definitions of government and law, you

8
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,160
know, you remember the Federalist Papers that people have heard of them, McGrath has read

9
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:41,660
of them.

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:47,060
It said that it's not the government's duty to control the behavior of the citizen, citizen

11
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,260
meant something different then.

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,980
It's the citizen's duty to control the behavior of the government, right?

13
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,860
That's just a thing, right?

14
00:00:54,860 --> 00:01:00,100
And then it gets flipped by that idiot Kennedy, that's not what your government could do

15
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,480
for you, what you could do for your country, you could do for your country.

16
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,240
That was taken wrong, right?

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,480
But either way, either way, it's very, yeah, when you look at what they're discussing,

18
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:19,440
and it's pretty evident and pretty obvious what's going on, and the people are in a stupor.

19
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:24,380
It's kind of like, in early Greek speak, I used to really badger, you know, badger people,

20
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,760
you know, before the MPC term was popular, I was calling them space heaters, because what

21
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,680
do they all have in common?

22
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,340
They take up space, they're alive, they give off heat, so they're a space heater, right?

23
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,260
You know, don't step on my cord, right?

24
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,720
My cord is kinked.

25
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,440
Yeah, physical characteristics, I mean, that matches up.

26
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:45,240
You know, I thought you might have actually kind of enjoyed some of the DNC stuff that

27
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,960
they were spreading around, though, because there was a little bit of a dance party feel

28
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,200
there.

29
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,340
Did you, did you, did you hear about that at all?

30
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,120
No, no, but here's the thing.

31
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,020
It's entertainment.

32
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:54,560
Yeah.

33
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:02,800
Because I will give, look, I'll give anything to prove that no one there, none of the politicians,

34
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,880
none of the, know anything at all about law, about government at all.

35
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:07,699
Of course not.

36
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,960
It's not, it's a total misrepresentation.

37
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,500
You know how Eisenhower warned about the, you notice I didn't want to entertain the

38
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:19,280
dance thing, but when I was in the military industrial complex, he was correct.

39
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,140
I've been looking at, I've been trying to summarize this for some fairly intelligent

40
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,480
people behind the scenes.

41
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,040
What's going on in lieu of what we've been speaking of with definitions, with Brandon

42
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,740
Joe Williams coming on the scene, being popular and all that.

43
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,540
It is the military industrial complex.

44
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,340
I've looked at it in every aspect because the institutions that are blamed for the woes

45
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:45,320
of the quote unquote citizen can easily be put down with by the military and they're not

46
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,160
because the military wants it that way.

47
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,940
That's why I've discussed in the past, there's a military base in each state, which is not

48
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:52,760
required.

49
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,620
It should just be on the borders and on the, on the, on the fronts, right?

50
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,860
The waterfronts.

51
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,060
Yeah.

52
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,860
They're in each state because there's a chain of command.

53
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,380
See, police are paramilitary.

54
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:09,580
If they want to go arrest someone and they SWAT them and he just destroys the SWAT team.

55
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:14,880
Well, they get on the horn and they're like, call the army base, right?

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,800
And bring a tank.

57
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,340
Yep.

58
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,740
You know, if they don't have their own tank or call the air in here in southwest of the

59
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:25,920
air force and they drop a bomb, which is why they gifted to all these, uh, you know, local

60
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,720
police departments.

61
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,380
People were outraged for a little while.

62
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,480
Like, why is it that my local police department has armored personnel?

63
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,740
No, I'm not talking about armored.

64
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,900
I'm talking about chain of command.

65
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,380
Oh yeah.

66
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:35,600
Yeah.

67
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,100
But what I'm saying is they bring an armored, armored vehicles are very easy to take out.

68
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,040
They have a big Achilles heel.

69
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,780
Do you know what it, yeah, it's, it's the undercarriage.

70
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,320
Yeah.

71
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:46,680
Of course.

72
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,860
You never, you never hit where the armor is.

73
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:49,100
Right?

74
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:49,640
Right.

75
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,620
That's the undercarriage.

76
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,680
That's why these guys throw these improvised devices underneath.

77
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,540
That's where to go.

78
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,560
But it's a, no, but it's funky.

79
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,280
I'm just saying they distribute this equipment for a reason so that it's there and accessible

80
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,060
for their guys when they step things up.

81
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:03,600
That's all.

82
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:03,820
Yeah.

83
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,100
No, no.

84
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,720
I'm talking more of the chain of command.

85
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,240
And if the military can't take you, then they do NATO.

86
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,620
Then they do the bigger international, right?

87
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,320
Military and satellites.

88
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,480
You know, they go out to space.

89
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,720
Now the military is for hire.

90
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:21,920
They do blow up people's homes and they, you know, if it makes it to the media, it's always

91
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,060
a gas pipe explosion.

92
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,160
There was a famous one that happened during the Obama years.

93
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,100
There was a critic, a journalist that criticized Obama and his car exploded.

94
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,200
They said it hit a tree, but it exploded before it hit the tree.

95
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:34,920
It was in a Mercedes.

96
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:35,880
Right.

97
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,520
Do you remember that?

98
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,600
Who that was?

99
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,780
I actually do remember that, but I don't remember who it was either.

100
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:40,500
Yeah.

101
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,380
There was a video.

102
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,140
They, they went around confiscating all the video, but one got out.

103
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:48,860
You can see the car bursting into flames as it's going down Santa Monica Boulevard or whatever.

104
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,460
And then it hits a tree and the engine is ejected.

105
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,720
And they even consulted Mercedes and it's like, no, that doesn't happen.

106
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:01,160
Normally, it was supposedly they hit him with a drone, in other words, a low flying drone

107
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,740
and then an air to ground missile.

108
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:04,160
Right.

109
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:04,600
Yeah.

110
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,640
So anyway, this happens often.

111
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,640
The most popular one was during the Obama days.

112
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:16,620
There was some lady, quasi-government agency, ex-employee, working with the press back and

113
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,880
forth with the, I forgot which agency it was in California.

114
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:24,480
They dropped an F-14 or F-16, came over and dropped the bomb on her house.

115
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,800
So, I mean, that's pretty much what all the neighbors said.

116
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,800
A plane, a jet plane came by and dropped something on the house and blew up the house.

117
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:36,320
When it showed up in the media, because it was in the San Francisco area, you see the,

118
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,300
they said it was a gas line explosion.

119
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,920
And the gas company shows up with this truck and they unload these old gas pipes and dump

120
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,800
them in the street.

121
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,640
I'm serious.

122
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,520
You can actually see them, you know, from the helicopter news.

123
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,000
They really botched that one up.

124
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,420
But it doesn't matter because these people are so stupid.

125
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,060
Here's the thing.

126
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,540
Years ago, I would criticize people, but it's no, there's no sense.

127
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,520
It's kind of like you're, you're studying them and I make up these terms, but I really

128
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,560
have no malady or ill will against them.

129
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,320
It's kind of like, let's say you're a geologist and you're studying rocks and you find a rock

130
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,720
that you trip on or falls on your foot.

131
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,040
You don't argue with it.

132
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,360
It's a freaking rock, right?

133
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,720
So this is what people, it's hard for people to understand.

134
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:26,740
They can do, they, meaning anyone, can do anything to anyone and no one cares, you know.

135
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,480
There's no outrage.

136
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,420
You know, like if someone's been wrongfully imprisoned, all you got to do is show up with

137
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,920
not even a thousand people around the prison and they'll let them out.

138
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,040
Let them out every time.

139
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,980
This was more in the past, not anymore.

140
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:46,160
It's amazing how quelled it is, you know, the, the human instinct to, to not fight back,

141
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,980
but to be more aggressive for what is right.

142
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,000
But again, it's all military.

143
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,560
For example, if you look at the courts, the court system, there is no judicial branch

144
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,340
anywhere anymore.

145
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,820
They're all administrative tribunals.

146
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,140
This is the proof throughout the world.

147
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,660
What they do, like, you know, it's supposed to be three branches of government.

148
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,160
There isn't.

149
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,760
There's just executive and legislative.

150
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,760
The only place there's any standing in judicial is the Supreme Court because they have the

151
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,800
judicial group there, the justices, Supreme Court justices.

152
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,040
But guess what?

153
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,160
You can look this up if you don't know technically.

154
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,580
The Supreme Court of the United States is not a court of record.

155
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,200
It's an appellate court, right?

156
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,860
Whatever they decide has to be bounced down to a district court again, right?

157
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,280
The people don't know that it's not, it's the highest court in the land.

158
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,620
But if you read the constitution, there's an article that states, let it not be in the

159
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,140
constitution.

160
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:37,100
Let it not be misconstrued that any court in the United States has any power in law

161
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:37,760
or equity.

162
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,560
So they're telling you they don't have a judiciary.

163
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,920
It was never properly set up.

164
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,220
Here's proof.

165
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:51,580
When you go to any court system, the prosecutors are all attorneys and the judges are all attorneys

166
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,740
and they're all governed by the attorney general.

167
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,140
There's a reason why they call him general, duh.

168
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,500
It's military.

169
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,360
And he's part of the judicial branch.

170
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,100
Wrong.

171
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:06,820
He's part of the executive branch, which is military, right now, how does it work?

172
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,920
They appoint judges that they say they elect them.

173
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,760
But even if they're elected, they have to be sworn in and still they have to be confirmed.

174
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,280
And that is done by the legislation.

175
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,560
So basically you've got the executive appointing confirmed by the legislative.

176
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,960
Where's the judicial in this?

177
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,720
There is none.

178
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,920
There is none.

179
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,060
So that's why it's all done by contract.

180
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,160
Now there's a famous case in the United States.

181
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,900
It's Tompkins versus Erie Railroad, 1938.

182
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,900
And that made everything sway towards contracts.

183
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,620
Doesn't matter what you kill someone, you damage state property.

184
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,880
That's what it is.

185
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,280
It's not it's not murdering a human.

186
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,580
You kill, you destroyed human state property.

187
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,720
You have a birth certificate.

188
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,260
If you kill someone that doesn't have a birth certificate, they don't care.

189
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,640
They're like, whatever.

190
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,220
You know, they won't they won't do it.

191
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,400
They won't take the case.

192
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,560
This is very well known also, but it's not publicized, right?

193
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,500
So the the other hand of this is what the people think.

194
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,260
Ninety nine percent of the people, you know, like I go to Reddit to look up things to see

195
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:08,940
what the people, different communities, special, especially local, are saying.

196
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:09,380
Yeah.

197
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,560
And they have no clue.

198
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,940
And the more educated they are, the less they know.

199
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:18,980
So they're running this whole thing under a military industrial complex, all based on

200
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,880
contracts, bonds, you know, monitored the banks.

201
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:22,300
Right.

202
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,220
The the military loves the banks.

203
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:25,720
Right.

204
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,100
The banks love the military.

205
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:32,880
The purpose of the U.S. military is to represent the full might and force of the bankers, not

206
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,740
the government, which doesn't really exist, as you are told.

207
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,200
There is a government, but it's a corporation.

208
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:44,020
But somewhere in the CFR Code of Federal Regulations says that a corporation cannot be a government.

209
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:45,740
Ah.

210
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:56,820
But if you look up Title 18, Chapter 3002 titles, Title 18, I think it's three thousand

211
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,820
section three thousand and two subsection 15.

212
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,780
A got it right.

213
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,400
It states the United States is a federal corporation.

214
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,340
Now, you bring this up to an academic or say, oh, that's for the purposes of banking.

215
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,340
What?

216
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,700
No, it's not.

217
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:18,580
Because the United States is supposed to issue the currency to the banks and the banks are

218
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,700
not corporations either.

219
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,700
They're associations, national.

220
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,120
And then they started.

221
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,220
Oh, I know.

222
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:24,880
It's not like that.

223
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,560
They can't tell you.

224
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,280
They'll say, no, it's not like that.

225
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:27,820
You misunderstood.

226
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:28,920
I misunderstood.

227
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,400
Oh, my gosh.

228
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,680
So and this is why I tell people, if you study the definitions of law, not just reading the

229
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:41,400
law, because when you read a word person state, depending if it's upper or lower case or whatever,

230
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,660
you have to know how that word is being defined and go look at the definitions.

231
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,700
Now, if you study the definitions of those terms for, let's say, 15 minutes a day for

232
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:53,040
three months, you will know more than all the attorneys in the country put together.

233
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,660
What kind of statement is that?

234
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,360
Why do I say that?

235
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,900
Because let's say there are two million attorneys in the country.

236
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,720
I've said this before.

237
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,020
What's two million times zero?

238
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,680
Still zero.

239
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,760
So they don't know any.

240
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,800
None of them do at all.

241
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,000
So this is the situation that you're in.

242
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,920
So now when you get to the political scheme that's being pulled right now, it's nothing

243
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,500
but a show.

244
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,040
I someone wants to look it up.

245
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,480
There's a website that does statistics.

246
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,320
I looked at this back back in the day.

247
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:24,560
Just see if I could give out rough figures to see if they were right.

248
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,760
Like how much of the GDP is spent on entertainment industry, the whole entertainment, whatever

249
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,420
you want to brag.

250
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,780
You know, you can you could you could bracket the entertainment industry wide or narrow.

251
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:39,920
You know, narrow would be Hollywood or, you know, theater, radio, whatever.

252
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,600
Right. TV, the wide bracket of entertainment.

253
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,200
How much is being spent and then how much is being spent on all of education?

254
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,260
And you know what?

255
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:53,360
More was being spent on, guess what, entertainment and what.

256
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,300
By the way, what what year should I look at for this?

257
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,540
Because of any year, usually these these studies that kind of stick.

258
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,640
The latest you're going to find is probably twenty nineteen because they're always five

259
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,200
years behind.

260
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,500
Oh, I see one for twenty twenty three.

261
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,280
So I was curious.

262
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,240
Oh, that's that's very that's a fast one.

263
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,020
That's a fast one.

264
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,100
So I was going to look at that.

265
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:12,900
What do you think?

266
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,640
Should I look at that one?

267
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,320
Just for reference here real quick.

268
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:15,600
Yeah.

269
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:15,920
Go ahead.

270
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,120
Yeah.

271
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,260
Because I used to look at this stuff.

272
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,760
So when I'm giving analogies or anecdotes about things like, you know, I have a rough

273
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,040
figure and some people used to come and I have a good memory.

274
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,980
So it was people say that sounded outrageous.

275
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:27,580
I looked it up.

276
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:27,780
Yeah.

277
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,700
It's pretty much on there.

278
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:28,940
Yeah.

279
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,180
So.

280
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:29,880
Wow.

281
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,100
Wow.

282
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:30,860
Wow.

283
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,000
Wow.

284
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,560
Wow.

285
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:33,880
Wow.

286
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,380
Wow.

287
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,020
Wow.

288
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:54,980
Wow.

289
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,160
Wow.

290
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,540
Wow.

291
00:12:59,560 --> 00:12:59,660
Wow.

292
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:00,840
Wow.

293
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:04,460
Wow.

294
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,880
So I know it's about.

295
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:06,180
Yeah.

296
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,560
So that's only the digital.

297
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:08,920
But that's only the.

298
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,160
Yeah.

299
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:13,620
I mean, there's narrow scope and then there's overall, you know, what's the whole piece

300
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,480
of the pie, not just the crust or crumbs.

301
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:15,780
Right.

302
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,300
Oh, yeah.

303
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,760
There's one here that says it'll break it down by industry.

304
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:19,700
Yeah.

305
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,660
And how many industries and you add them up.

306
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:21,880
Right.

307
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,380
Yeah.

308
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,160
It's probably close to a short of a trillion.

309
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,280
Let's see, Bureau of Economic Analysis.

310
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,480
The Bureau of Economic Analysis?

311
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,600
Yeah, that sounds about right.

312
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,520
Yeah, there's other groups that do that.

313
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,560
Like there was a famous one that showed, that made the rounds recently about how the U.S.

314
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,580
population was going to be reduced down to below 60 million, right, or 100 million, remember

315
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,040
that one?

316
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:46,740
Yeah, I saw that.

317
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,260
That made the rounds.

318
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:47,560
Yeah.

319
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,760
Real GDP by industry, okay, privacy.

320
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,080
You get the point.

321
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,460
No, I'm taking a look at it.

322
00:13:53,460 --> 00:14:00,160
And it's actually, well, there's more than double, the rough figures that I can read

323
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,660
here real fast show me that it's more than double on entertainment, and that's the generally

324
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:10,800
accepted surface stuff, like the digital and a couple of other things that they added together

325
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,160
to create the entertainment aggregate.

326
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:21,080
Yeah, it's more than double what is spent on education in the private and public sectors

327
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,960
combined.

328
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:22,500
Okay.

329
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,620
No, I'm just looking at it just factually.

330
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,580
That's what it is.

331
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,220
It's more than double.

332
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:33,400
Yeah, so what I mean by this is, considering the level of education the people in the legal

333
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:38,400
industry and politics have, they would follow the entertainment example.

334
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,700
They would be under entertainment.

335
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,180
They would not be under education, the current political circus, you see what I mean?

336
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:44,680
Right.

337
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,180
And that's what they've done.

338
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,480
I mean, really, I compared the two different conventions.

339
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,920
It's like one was the WWF convention, and the other one was the dance party.

340
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,800
Oh, yeah, I want Camacho.

341
00:14:55,140 --> 00:15:00,620
If they had Camacho, remember from President Camacho running from my idiocracy, I would

342
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:04,660
vote I would actually register and vote and then repeal the registration.

343
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,960
If you know what's his what's the actor's name?

344
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
The black actor that is really he's always a muscular dude.

345
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,200
He's an old spice commercials.

346
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,260
Yeah, I forget his name.

347
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:12,860
But you know what?

348
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:17,260
It's hilarious because I talked about this and he said exactly that on Friday night on

349
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:20,560
the call in show where I said, you know, I'm looking at this, I'm looking at the two

350
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,960
different conventions and I'm thinking to myself, wouldn't we be better off with the

351
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,900
guy from Idiocracy?

352
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:28,240
And I played a clip, his State of the Union address.

353
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:28,920
I love it.

354
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,140
By the way, that that clip is hilarious to me.

355
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,760
But yeah, that's worth watching.

356
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:35,200
Yeah.

357
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,080
Who was the actor?

358
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,200
I mean, you only get that information while you're talking.

359
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:38,760
But go ahead.

360
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,160
Continue.

361
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:46,880
Because if I could pull up a soundbite because he's he does it well.

362
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:53,080
He always plays a thug or whatever in a lot of films.

363
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,220
Terry Crews.

364
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,700
Oh, it's him.

365
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,120
Yeah.

366
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,040
Terry Crews.

367
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:01,460
Yeah.

368
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,600
Terry Crews.

369
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:02,760
Yeah.

370
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,440
He does.

371
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,640
He's also the the father in that TV show.

372
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,680
Everybody hates Chris.

373
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,280
The Chris Rock.

374
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:08,560
Yeah.

375
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,180
They didn't cast him well on that.

376
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,860
He came out saying that they were touching his private parts, producers and all that

377
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,700
just to give a little signal on that.

378
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,540
She's down with them.

379
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm sure he's at the cloning centers to this guy on that show.

380
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,120
They were touching him.

381
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:21,760
No, no, no.

382
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:28,160
He was in the in the media about what to producers and directors party and they were want to

383
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,200
touch his private parts.

384
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:29,640
Yeah.

385
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,300
Terry Crews.

386
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:30,760
Yeah.

387
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:30,980
Yeah.

388
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,920
Somebody's not bringing up a visual idea who this guy is.

389
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,180
Usually he's bald in a lot of his stuff.

390
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:40,340
But the Camacho thing, they gave him a big old wig, like a Jerry Curl wig.

391
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,360
Yeah.

392
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,380
We're running out of French fries and burrito covers.

393
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,320
But I got a solution.

394
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,160
That's what you said last time, didn't you?

395
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:51,960
I got a solution.

396
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:52,960
You're a dick!

397
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:53,900
What's up, Gary?

398
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,190
Anyway, that's that's it.

399
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,690
Terry Crews.

400
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:01,590
Yeah, absolutely.

401
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:03,650
Yeah, absolutely.

402
00:17:03,849 --> 00:17:05,270
No, I was going to get a clip to there.

403
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:06,690
But it's worse.

404
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,190
It's it's much worse.

405
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:08,849
Yeah, it's worse.

406
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,609
But the thing is, you know, this is if you.

407
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:13,670
Well, here's a statistic.

408
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:17,349
I remember reading a while back, in ancient Greece, you know, the place where they tout

409
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:22,630
his model of democracy, he was 99% slave, right. And they were, you know, in terms of,

410
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:29,150
you know, their citizens were categorized as slaves, right. So, I mean, it's just a distortion,

411
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:34,570
maybe if what how people feel or think about it, but you know, they're acting like, you know,

412
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:41,950
you know, school is not education, right at all. It never, never really was, even when the grammar

413
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:46,550
schools were happening and the edge level of educate, you know, you had a, you know,

414
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:50,210
in the 1800s, you know, you were done with everything by the time you were 13 or 14.

415
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:55,310
And you were done with university before you were 20. Even then, there was a lot of complaining

416
00:17:55,310 --> 00:18:01,130
about, you know, rash conventionalism and ignoring things that, you know, should be taught, right?

417
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:07,210
Right. Right. I love it. By the way, I'm just looking at, because you made me look it up a

418
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,950
The House of Representing.

419
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:15,870
Idiocracy is a documentary. I came out, I did a talk once on,

420
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:19,530
it was a talk show, like one of these blog talk radio things with a group.

421
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:22,770
Here he is.

422
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:41,790
I know she's bad.

423
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,830
That was bad right now, but I got a solution.

424
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:50,890
But I got a solution. Then he goes through a whole thing. We got this guy.

425
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,570
That's exactly what's going on right now.

426
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:53,490
Exactly, exactly.

427
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,170
Exactly what's going on right now.

428
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,070
Okay, you beat me to it again.

429
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:01,230
Well, yeah. And the attorneys that were in there, there's a skit in there. But anyway,

430
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:05,150
I was saying I was on a blog talk radio thing there. And they were talking about the movie,

431
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,790
The Matrix. And I was saying, well, there's a movie called Idiocracy. That's a documentary.

432
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:13,530
And then I heard her recording the next week after I did this interview with them.

433
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:18,390
I was like, oh, the Greeks said, you got to see this movie called Idiocracy. I never heard of it,

434
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:22,210
but you got to see it because it's even better than The Matrix. They didn't know it was a spoof.

435
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:27,430
I thought that was really funny in itself, because it is true. They just didn't know.

436
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:32,470
They were just taking my word for it, which is true. It is more pertinent than The Matrix.

437
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:33,190
It is.

438
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,730
You're seeing it right now.

439
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:38,250
Quite appropriately made by the same guy. It's Mike Judge's thing.

440
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,790
The guy who made Beavis and Butthead.

441
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:41,530
Yeah, perfect. Yeah.

442
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:49,030
He knows. Mike Judge knows. He's another guy. He's been enthralled in controversy

443
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,430
privately, I think, also.

444
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:55,150
You know, I don't think I've asked you too much about this before. But what about this idea of

445
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:58,930
the since we're talking about entertainment, the entertainment elites, there are some people that

446
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:04,810
are in the know that, you know, know the whole agenda that are the insiders, so to speak,

447
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:09,570
and are getting the privilege to produce. What are your thoughts on that? I mean,

448
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:15,090
you know, is there a group of people that like have the privilege and already know what's

449
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:19,470
happening and are just, you know, making the movies just just for fun at this point

450
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:23,330
to rub it in people's faces and all that? I mean, what do you think about all that?

451
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:30,110
Nothing much to think about. You can go all the way back to the literary world with Dickens and

452
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:35,010
all these other guys when the Freemasons and started making they took Freemasonry underground

453
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:39,450
and they kept whatever they kept on the surface and they experimented with it. So when you look

454
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:42,730
at Dickens and other writers that were his contemporaries, they were pushing an agenda

455
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:48,770
back then. So was Samuel Clemens, Mark Twain pushing an agenda. We're talking about when

456
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:54,250
they're before TV and radio. Yeah, definitely. You know, that system, that mechanism was started.

457
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:58,050
Yeah. And long before 1984, because that's another thing that comes up. Well,

458
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:03,230
1984, which was made in 1948 and it was made by an MI6 guy. Well, he in an interview,

459
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:07,010
several interviews, he's mentioned that he was told to write.

460
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:14,290
Yeah. Eric Blair, I think, was his real name, actually, by the way. Right. But he was told

461
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:17,610
to write it. You know how like they have this secret pact that you're supposed to say what

462
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:22,990
you're going to do before you do it publicly. Brave New World is relevant, too. But people

463
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,670
often go to that and they don't look at that classic literature stuff. They think it's benign.

464
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:31,990
You know, the the Mark Twain stuff and whatnot. Yeah. I like Brave New World, though, because

465
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:37,350
when they tell you you're pneumatic, it's a good thing. It's interesting, too, the way they have

466
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:41,690
stuff divided. You haven't seen brain, you know, you're wondering that's a joke. It's a lascivious

467
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:47,670
joke. I understand. But there's a lot. Well, there was one. OK, here's the thing for people

468
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:54,570
who don't know. There is a BBC three hour YouTube on Brave New World. Brave New World decided to

469
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:59,470
make a film. It's actually stuck to the book. Exactly. So the book, Brave New World, you could

470
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:06,650
watch it on YouTube. If you haven't seen it, you should you should check it out. But when you wanted

471
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:13,170
to have the you had the alphas, betas, gammas, deltas, when you had sex, it was just like a normal

472
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:17,750
thing, like brushing your teeth or whatever like that. It wasn't, you know, it was very erotic.

473
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:25,230
You had whatever aids and aid, meaning help you needed. Yeah. And tools and and people were

474
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:31,710
described in sex. They were pneumatic, very pneumatic, very good. Right. Right. You know,

475
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:38,750
I guess pneumatic, like a jackhammer, I guess. So no, but it was all, you know, it was all rather

476
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:43,970
devoid of any of this, you know, forget about romance. As a matter of fact, they get in

477
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:50,630
trouble there. Yeah, for romance. Yeah. I just found it. It's still up there. Brave New World,

478
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:58,310
full TV movie reedit, three, three hours and two to three hours, just three minutes short of three

479
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:02,910
hours. Well, I don't think I've ever watched that whole thing. But the BBC does some interesting

480
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:09,610
work. Well, they're they're just like the rest. But they in other words, if you're to recommend

481
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:13,810
a movie that was based on a book, you need to know both before you make a recommendation. And I

482
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:18,510
familiar with the book. I read the book, I started reading it, put it down the 10 years later,

483
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:24,390
I finished it right, without going back and rereading it. So, you know, it'd be best to read

484
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:29,870
it in one shot, because there's a lot of start, you know, criticism in there. And in a way called

485
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:36,610
sarcastic. But the movie holds the book gets into a lot of fine details of what I call interjectory.

486
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:42,930
There's a mechanism in literature, when you bring up something new, you pause the story,

487
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:47,310
and you explain what that new thing that was just brought up is an interjection. There's a lot of

488
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:52,850
that in the book and like hand signals and tools and things. And it's actually done in the movie,

489
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:58,450
those things are shown in the film, the BBC film. So I will tell you the truth, I enjoy the Library

490
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:04,270
of Congress version of the audio book. I've never listened to the commercial version. But I do have

491
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:10,370
a copy of it. Actually, I got a CD copy of it. But but but I listened to the one that the Library

492
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:16,510
of Congress made. And I think it's interesting in the audio form. You know, it allows you to track

493
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:21,990
a lot of stuff that's going to say just watch the film for three hours. Three hours. It's pretty

494
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:26,450
good. It's on YouTube, brave new world. Well, they go free out there for people to catch. Anyway,

495
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:32,130
so recommended reading from the Greek. There you go. Um, yeah, it's not it's not Look, it's not

496
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:43,250
great. Neither is 1984. Because you it's just that stuff wasn't really put out even to me,

497
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:49,370
for me or to me, I just saw it as a social thing. Because it's even deeper than that. It's even

498
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:54,150
worse than that. That would be like the the level of reality that most people think they're in.

499
00:24:55,170 --> 00:25:00,690
1984 and a brave new world shows another level of reality, right? And as a comparison. But there's

500
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:05,790
even another level and another level behind that. And that's more like what we get into the,

501
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:09,290
you know, like Dimitri Kolozov says, you know, there's three truths, right?

502
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:14,630
The first truth that goes to the groups, the main group, and then the second truth is those that run

503
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:18,570
the group. And the third truth is really what happens. So we're into third, fourth and fifth

504
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:23,590
truths, you know, because the facts don't always have to be what people think, you know, like,

505
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:28,770
again, the 911 analogy, I'd rather just say, you know, like, people search for the truth,

506
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:36,230
but you have to have your facts straight. The 911 analogy I give is, it's a fact that

507
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:43,230
people who witnessed the event on television saw the towers hit by airplanes. That's a fact.

508
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:50,130
It's also a fact that the people who were boots on the ground on that day did not witness did not see

509
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:54,990
and did not hear any airplanes, they just saw the sides of the building explode. That's a fact.

510
00:25:54,990 --> 00:26:01,230
Another fact is that the media had interviewed people on the ground in New York that day

511
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:08,830
morning, who said that they saw airplanes go into the building. That's a fact. And there's another

512
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:13,970
fact, you ready, that those same people that were interviewed on the ground in New York that said

513
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:19,830
they witnessed airplanes going into the buildings were also witnesses at events all over the country

514
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:24,850
over a subsequent decade, like school shootings and other things like that. The same people.

515
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:32,630
Fact. So you'll figure that out. It's hard for me to figure out because I knew people, you know,

516
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:37,190
look, I knew people in New York, I lived in New Jersey at that point. But I knew people still in

517
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:44,530
New York who gave me various stories that day. And well, this is how Yeah, I know people there.

518
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:49,710
My niece, she was 10 years old, and she said she saw the airplanes go into the building. And then

519
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:53,530
I pushed her into a corner and said, Tell me what you saw. Well, we're in the classroom teachers

520
00:26:53,530 --> 00:27:00,010
said go to the window and look, she really didn't see a plane go into the window. But it's so

521
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:05,010
convenient to say that, right? Give you an example. There was a psychological lots of psychological

522
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:11,030
studies on people's memories, and they would show, let's say 10 people separate, separate them

523
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:15,790
and show them the same film of a car accident, right? And the car like one car was red, one car

524
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:19,810
was white, people in one car wearing bright yellow, the other people wearing black, very

525
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:26,410
distinct, so very easy to see, you know, Party A, Party B, Car A, Car B, you know, right. And

526
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:32,530
all right. So they said, Take notes on all that. And after they did, they went and asked questions,

527
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:35,950
I took them out of the room what they saw in the film. So I asked a bunch of questions is was there

528
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:42,130
broken glass? And nine out of 10 of them said yes. And there was no broken glass. They went back and

529
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:48,590
saw the film, there's no broken glass, and other windows were broken. And, and they asked him,

530
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:53,990
why did they say there was broken glass? So well, because usually there's broken glass in a car

531
00:27:53,990 --> 00:28:00,370
accident. Wow, wow, they weren't asking. The questions were not usually is there broken glass,

532
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:06,170
they were asking questions about what they saw on the film, you see. So when you hear all around

533
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:10,390
that there are planes going into the building, it's if you say no, you're the odd man out,

534
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:15,750
lady out. And in some cases, they transpose things where it's like, well, I heard this sound.

535
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:21,270
Yeah, but we asked what you saw. See, and they decided they saw what's the same with

536
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:28,170
Yeah, say with a JFK. Yeah, there's JFK is even weirder than, than it's actually simpler. Like,

537
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:34,370
I believe, okay, 911 was a botched job. Right? That the building that they blew up first should

538
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:39,130
have been blown up. Second, they screwed up big time. Right, right. Because you notice that the

539
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:43,390
one that got hit second came down first. That doesn't make any sense if it's a fire, right?

540
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:47,170
Right. True. So but they pulled it off, because they had to do it that way, because they wouldn't

541
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:51,390
be able to blast the the building that was closer to building seven. I've gone over this before.

542
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:56,910
The building that got allegedly hit with an airplane first, if that were taken down first,

543
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:00,990
it would have damaged the tunnel. And the other building would still be there today.

544
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:05,570
Right? Because these these devices are delivered under tunnel by tunnel had to be done in that

545
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:09,250
order. Yeah, it had to be done in that order. So they really screwed up and their screw ups in the

546
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:14,210
JFK. Yeah. Also, when you look at that, and the biggest screw up is what people are using as

547
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:18,970
evidence. There's a pruder film, you could see it almost starts to look like stop motion photography,

548
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:25,790
where the rest of the frames, right. And I wonder if that wasn't even a plant. Right? Because part

549
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:30,410
of the thing, you know, there's a pruder film, right? Yeah, of course. Yeah. Well, I, you know,

550
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:34,010
I got a different view on this, because I've studied that thing, you know, granularly. So I

551
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:38,730
mean, I've got a lot of different views on it. And all right, so just one of you, would you say

552
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:46,770
the film is intact? Is it duped? Well, I don't think it was duped. Is it intact? No, it was

553
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:52,170
frames missing. Not what people have seen publicly. No, it is not intact. And I can tell you right

554
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:57,930
away that there's no way if you saw a film that appears to be remotely stable, like the camera's

555
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:03,110
not shaking all over the place, then you didn't see the original. That's step one. Yeah, right.

556
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:09,010
In other words, whoever was filming that was told to film that. Well, I don't know that. There are a

557
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:14,030
lot of people that say that. But I know that if you saw a film, you personally, if you've seen this

558
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:19,730
film, and it's kind of stable, then you've not seen the original. Because the original film is not

559
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:24,570
stabilized the way that he's got it. Okay, that's right. Yeah, yeah, that's right. Same with the

560
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:29,630
same with the World Trade Center. The raw films that were put out the ground shook like a mighty

561
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:33,930
earthquake, like, you know, like five or six on the Richter scale, right? And then the building

562
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:39,890
comes down 10 seconds later, right? The newer films, there's no shaking at all. Yeah, the ones

563
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:43,610
that ones that show the shaking are no longer online, or they've been redone. So there's no

564
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:48,790
shaking. There you go. But any copy of the Zapruder film, though, it's just, it's not stable.

565
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:53,850
The original itself is not stable. And I've seen the film that shakes around. But it hasn't been

566
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:58,990
shown to the public any copy you buy from anywhere or anything else. It's not been shown to the

567
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:04,310
public. So I'm just saying, and there are differences in it. But I but to tell you that it

568
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:08,970
was duped or all that, that's, I would have to prove that by saying I know how it was done.

569
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:14,310
Or I, you know, so on and so forth. But it is, in other words, you remove frames, and then you

570
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:19,210
you double up the frames that were previous to make it to kind of fill in. So it doesn't look

571
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:24,510
like stop motion, right? Yeah, but it's only 400. And then also, there's the psychology

572
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:30,310
of Jackie, right? I never really understood that. Why is she crawling off the back?

573
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:33,150
Right when he was supposedly shot from the back.

574
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:39,230
A whole lot of weird things going on. Yeah, I think. Yeah, you want to really if you listen,

575
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:43,850
I bet he's still alive. And they faked the whole thing. That would be one pot. Could they have

576
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:50,010
faked everything? Yes. And all that right. Not still alive. He would be 110. Right?

577
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:55,190
Yeah, exactly. He'd be dead. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. So there's a lot of setting. Anything

578
00:31:55,190 --> 00:32:00,110
that's put out is fake. I've been around long enough looking at antique shops, looking at

579
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:06,230
people's diaries, I should have acquired them. Diaries from the late 1800s diaries from the 1910s

580
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:10,010
and 1920s. And you read these diaries. And you're like, this is not a world that I've been told

581
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:13,950
about. This is a completely different world than what we're being told, you know, right?

582
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:18,470
I mean, honestly, even the closest eyewitness to the shooting that day

583
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:24,450
says stuff that is not in the Supruder film or did all the way up until somebody showed him

584
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:29,650
the Supruder film. There you go. There's their broken glass. Yes, there's broken glass. You

585
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:35,370
know, that kind of thing where like he says that Kennedy jumped up during this event, like he

586
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:41,590
actually jumped up is what he said. He said it all the way up until the 1980s. And then somebody

587
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:45,710
was real. Yeah, yeah. It's like flat earth rounder if you could prove both.

588
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:49,570
Right. And somebody showed him the film. And they said, Do you see him jumping up? He says, No,

589
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:54,530
but that's what I always remembered. And it's just really strange. And actually,

590
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:59,390
that's that was done on TV in a weird way, too. It was it was really bizarre. That guy's name

591
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:05,170
was Bill Newman. He's standing like a feet away, like 10, 10, 15 feet away, actually, at the time.

592
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:09,410
Wow, that's like, it's like you could feel 10 feet away on something like that is like you're right

593
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:15,690
on top of it. Yeah, yeah. So anyway, so with that in mind, and all the fakery that goes on,

594
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:20,330
it's no surprise that there's a dance party and a WWF reunion at the other place, right? I mean,

595
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:25,330
Hall of Famers getting together from the WWF. I think the people wanted if they didn't want it,

596
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:31,710
they could put a stop to it. Well, that's 5% 5% is all it takes. And yeah, get me out of here.

597
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:35,490
That's the thing about complaints. When people complain about this stuff. I always say, you know

598
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:40,290
what, it wouldn't be produced, it wouldn't be happening. Unless there was a waiting audience

599
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:46,090
that wanted it. That's, that's the hard part about this, you know? Yeah, but there is movement.

600
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:51,230
Like, that's why I was so happy with Brandon, Joe Williams and Chris Hauser, whatever, you know,

601
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:57,870
about using the trust, you know, the all capital name. For example, people becoming state nationals.

602
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:02,350
It was like 2000 p you can do this, you know, not to be US citizen, right?

603
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:07,330
Through the State Department. And I have something like that even more official,

604
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:12,409
because I did that 2006. And I've got paper, I think I showed you some of the paperwork, right?

605
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:17,750
A while ago. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So I did it. You don't have to do it the way I did and get

606
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:23,150
detained and all that trying to come back into the country. But for about 10 years,

607
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:27,389
the State Department showed that there was 2000 people that did that over 10 years, right?

608
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:31,790
And when it started at a certain point, when information started to get out,

609
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:36,830
I think it was like five years ago. Now it's up to 50,000 in five years, did it?

610
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:42,210
And most of those 50,000 are attorneys, believe it or not. But they never tell anyone, right?

611
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:48,030
No. The other thing is with the IRS. Now, what people don't understand the death and taxes thing

612
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:53,710
is it's a subscription. And how you get into the subscription is with a W-9. When you're 18,

613
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:58,330
they rat on you and they say, in other words, oh, he's 18. Send him in the mail. They send

614
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:03,150
little tiny form that you sign and send in from the IRS called W-9. You don't even know. It's

615
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:05,790
like you don't have to do it. You don't have to take any action. You don't have to pay anything.

616
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:10,350
Just sign and send it. And you just subscribed. And then every time you do anything with the

617
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:15,170
IRS, you swear to it. You swear, actually, that you live in the District of Columbia,

618
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:18,850
right? Like telling someone says you have to sign that Greek. I'm like, okay,

619
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:22,290
why don't you sign it and swear that I live in the District of Columbia? Oh, I see what you mean.

620
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:27,650
Right. So what happens, people don't understand why there are people getting beaten up by the

621
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:32,750
IRS. It's not because it's the IRS or taxes, because you're swearing to it, which is called

622
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:37,230
penalties of perjury. Now, let me give you an example. And this is true. Any attorney that

623
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:42,670
doesn't even know definitions won't know this. In other words, it's like saying go to a nine-year-old

624
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:48,350
and they would know this, right? If you walk into Goodwill and you say, hey, I'm going to donate my

625
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:55,710
couch to you. And I'm also going to fill out this form here where under the penalty of perjury,

626
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:59,890
I'm swearing that I'm going to give you this couch. Do you know that if you don't give them

627
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:03,270
the couch, they could call the marshals, they could come kick down your door and take the couch

628
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:08,130
and still put you in jail for a year? I'm serious. That's how the law works. It has nothing to do

629
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:16,150
with the IRS. So the IRS has a way to unsubscribe, just like any other subscription, right? It's

630
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:23,470
called Form 56, or every IRS form has, or you use this form, or what does it say in the instruction

631
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:27,150
book? It doesn't matter what form it is. Use this form and say, fill out this form. And in the very

632
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:34,350
end, it says, or make your own statement. In other words, write us a letter, right? So this has been

633
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:38,390
going on. So, and then the 10, go ahead. Oh, I was just going to say, we talked about this,

634
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:43,130
that Snoopy did this in the, uh, in the PSA. That's right. It says, please unsubscribe me.

635
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:47,910
They put it out there in the seventies, right? Please, dear IRS, please unsubscribe me. And

636
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:52,850
that's what it is. It's an unsubscription. Now the other people, when you, when you have a debt,

637
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:56,670
it belongs to the treasury. There's a 1099A. Another thing that's been going on, you could

638
00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:01,170
call the IRS. It's one of these triplicate forms where it has, uh, they're all put together.

639
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:06,570
You've seen them where it's a white, uh, pink and yellow. And when you write on the white one,

640
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:12,570
it writes, it's like a form of a carbon hospital. The hospital is the same exact way. When you do

641
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:17,070
registration of carpet, it's got the white, the yellow, and the pink. Whenever you see those three

642
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:22,650
forms that goes to the U S treasury, but okay. So the IRS was kicking around. You can't get these,

643
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:26,750
you have to get them from the IRS, right? You can't print them out. It was like,

644
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:31,130
they were sending out like 40 a month, 50 a month after some of the word got out,

645
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:36,650
people would order a thousand of them. Right. So now they're like, they're not available. Like

646
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:41,750
3 million were ordered one year. Once the word got out on how to use them. Right. So actually

647
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:47,110
it was more than 40 a month because the, um, if you get a mortgage, you'd give a mortgage or buy

648
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:53,150
a car and you do a forensic audit on it. It will show the 10 99 paid your social security account

649
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:58,990
to get the money to give you, right? It's crazy. So now what's happening. So what I'm trying to

650
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:04,270
say, there is a movement behind the scenes. There are a lot of quote unquote, Americans that are

651
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:09,190
using the system to get out of the same system. In other words, you're using the tools that was

652
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:14,050
put in by the system to get out, to opt out because the whole country was based on throwing

653
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:22,250
tea in the Harbor over a 2% tax. Right. Allegedly. So one of the IRS chair, people were

654
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:26,370
interviewed, you know, about people get in trouble with taxes. No, no, it's voluntary. It has to be

655
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:30,550
voluntary. Otherwise it wouldn't work. The thing is you just don't know how and when you volunteered

656
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:35,750
and how and when to unvolunteer or unsubscribe. And this is, this is going on. That's what got

657
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:40,270
my juices flowing to speak about Brandon, Joe Williams. I don't endorse him because a lot of

658
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:46,050
stuff he says is, is not correct, but it won't get you in trouble versus what other people do

659
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:52,470
more severe things like putting liens on public officials the wrong way. Uh, uh, if you didn't

660
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:56,690
like a court decision, people would go put a lien on a judge and then the judge's wife wants to go

661
00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:01,350
buy something and they deny her credit card because there's a $40 million lien that gets them very

662
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:05,270
upset and they have the power to kick down your door. Right. Even without a warrant, they never

663
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:10,710
have a warrant by the way. Uh, warrants cannot be issued by a nonjudicial entity. Do you remember

664
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:15,710
a training day when, uh, he breaks in and he says, well, I want to see the warrant and he gives her,

665
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:20,970
he gives her a Chinese menu. Yeah, that's exactly what's going on. It's the same thing. It's never

666
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:26,490
signed. It can't, they're not because it's not judicial. Uh, so anyway, the thing that gets my

667
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:31,930
juices flowing is I know there is a movement it's hidden. It's never talked about where it was a

668
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:36,710
few hundred people. Now it's in the tens of thousands that are actually using the remedies,

669
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:39,930
you know, this, you know, to get out of the sickness, right? What do you need a remedy for,

670
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:44,810
right? To get out of being sick, to get out of the system. And I'm watching the, uh, the surface

671
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:50,330
reaction of that. Right. So when people are understanding how to get out of unsubscribing

672
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:55,030
from the IRS or citizenship or all these other things, uh, by the way, you may not be able to

673
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:59,390
do this in other countries. I'm speaking about America, by the way, United States of America.

674
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:06,990
If you're in Canada, um, UK, Europe, let's say, uh, heaven forbid you're in Bulgaria. Cause Bulgaria

675
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:11,530
is being run. Like, um, Romania was being run under Chichesco, right? I don't know if you know

676
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:16,850
anyone from there. That's really bad. Still. It's just as bad as would have been in the eighties

677
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:21,710
or seventies, you know, these, uh, Eastern block countries. So anyway, if you're in Australia,

678
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:28,230
New Zealand, you're a subject you really, there still is ways because if you have a, uh, a

679
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:33,170
universal tax laid on you, like an income tax and you have a social security number or social

680
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:39,190
insurance number, it's the same as here. It's just a different method. I know that all the

681
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:44,330
countries in the world have clauses when you do transactions, for example, to make a conditional

682
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:49,210
endorsement. So you don't create a tax liability every time you sign a check. I know they like,

683
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:53,270
um, someone recently asked me, what's it for Canada? I said, I remember for Canada,

684
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:57,870
you just look up in a search engine in the codes, uh, restricted endorsements. And they,

685
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:03,070
you do, you know, write down lawful money only. And they can't tell you not to write that because

686
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:07,750
you're allowed to restrict an endorsement. Right. Right. And that prevents a tax liability. So

687
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:15,050
everywhere, there's a way to get out of it. Um, uh, yeah. And you know, who's to blame? It's not

688
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:18,670
the government, your parents, they didn't do due diligence and their parents. Right.

689
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:23,130
So that's why I've always been saying, you know, it's, it's the people around you,

690
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:26,490
you know, the, the people like when you're listening to this, it could be the people

691
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:30,910
that you're in the same room as you right now that are, while you're listening to this Greek

692
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:35,570
speak, right. It's usually the people that are closest to you that mess you up the most, you know,

693
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:39,670
parents, especially because they didn't do their due diligence.
