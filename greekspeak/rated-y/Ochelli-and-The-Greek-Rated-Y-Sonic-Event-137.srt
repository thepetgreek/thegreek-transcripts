1
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:17,020
Rated Y 137, so let's jump right in with what you're hearing back from people about what

2
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:21,560
they've actually, you know, paid attention to, heard on the Sonics and worked with, right

3
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:21,780
Greek?

4
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:22,340
How you doing?

5
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:23,960
Yeah, I'm doing okay.

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,440
Um, yeah, just, uh, yes.

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,680
What about our acupuncture?

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,900
I said, well, I've covered that before, but let's, let's go over that real fast one more

9
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:33,260
time.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,240
Um, you ask those people that practice it, they don't know what it is.

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,920
They just, you know, well, they'll just like an attorney, they'll just read off what they've

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,980
been told to say, right?

13
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:52,140
Um, what, what the original, uh, premise was that there is a field around the body, right?

14
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,840
Um, more, and it actually interacts with the way you look, the way you smell and your

15
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,520
heat, the amount of heat you give with all those are factors, right?

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,580
Uh, but this field is, they call the aura, it's the, you know, the, the, um, the typical,

17
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,660
you know, the breakfast cereal types, you know, fruit, nuts and flakes, or, uh, exactly

18
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:14,040
say they don't know what it is, but it's an energy field around you.

19
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,220
Just like there are contactless, um, electronic, uh, equipment, you know, you can measure and

20
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,820
see if the, you have a hot wire, uh, without, you know, uh, touching the wire, right?

21
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,280
Right.

22
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:25,720
Okay.

23
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,280
Uh, yeah.

24
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,060
There's all these, uh, like radio sensing and all that.

25
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:34,740
So it has been proven that we have a field around us now that field is also is perpetuated

26
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,060
or let's say pumped by your musculature.

27
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:43,000
So let's say you have someone who's a quadriplegic wheelchair bound, the field will measure very,

28
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,720
very small.

29
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,680
And you have someone who is a bodybuilder, their field will be huge because typically

30
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,800
that field like it or not, or no, it or not is perpetuated by the muscles, which by the,

31
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,660
by the way, the word muscle means tiny mouse, by the way.

32
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,960
So I thought that was funny whenever someone says they've got a lot of muscle, but anyway,

33
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,140
um, they got a lot of tiny mice.

34
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:03,580
Okay.

35
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,160
Yeah.

36
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:04,540
Yeah.

37
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,660
So it's, yeah.

38
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,720
So it was all right.

39
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:12,440
Uh, so this field, by the way, in Tai Chi, certain practices, you can amp it up regardless

40
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,200
of your musculature using the emo work.

41
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,040
All right.

42
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,720
So this is the field, what we're talking about, and that's actually more important than the

43
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,400
acupuncture.

44
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:27,340
Now, the science of acupuncture is based on a movement of energy through the body.

45
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,860
Now, energy is a loose term here.

46
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,600
Uh, it's in other words, I like the word to encompass more than what the standard definition

47
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,480
of energy is.

48
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:34,720
Okay.

49
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:35,420
Okay.

50
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,780
Meaning non-material should say it's all non-material.

51
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:44,220
So there was a study way back when that, uh, parts of the body, they're in balance, have

52
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:50,100
the potential, uh, to tap into this energy field and parts of the body that are in balance,

53
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,340
meaning they have too little to tap into that energy field surrounding the body or parts

54
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,680
of the body that have too much energy to discharge into the field.

55
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:04,240
So where did we first find out about sticking metal into a living thing?

56
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:09,200
The earth is a living thing to attract an electrical circuit or to make an electrical

57
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,340
circuit, a lightning rod, imagine what a lightning rod looks like.

58
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,020
And that's exactly what acupuncture does.

59
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,360
And basically based on the techniques that are taught and how skilled the person doing

60
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,660
it is, they can either use it to send energy to your field, a drain and energy, uh, you

61
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:30,580
know, too much energy in one part of the body or bring that energy that's lacking in the

62
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,660
body from the field that's surrounding it.

63
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,720
That's all it is.

64
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,060
Think of it as a lightning rod.

65
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,320
Uh, another idea would be why did they put lightning rods on buildings in place?

66
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,480
So you had a more predictable place of where the lightning would strike, right?

67
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,220
It was just, it's not that the lightning rods prevent lightning from striking.

68
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,940
It's a, you now make that strike predictable location wise, right?

69
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,440
Okay.

70
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,460
And you feel, you feel safer around it.

71
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,180
It's exactly acupuncture works also when you study it now.

72
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:04,900
So what this sounds like is you're balancing things out by staking it out and, and make,

73
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,920
making things distribute equally in a way.

74
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,940
So remember, there's no steady state, even though we seem to be thinking that way, you're

75
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:18,720
either discharging into that energy field, the aura, or you're charging the body underneath

76
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,279
the aura.

77
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:20,920
Right.

78
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:25,920
So some parts of like most, believe it or not, uh, if you live in a society that's got

79
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:32,400
the EMF radiation, that we have stimulants and food, uh, toxic ingredients, do you, most

80
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,800
people will be overcharged.

81
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,660
Their organs will be overcharged and you have to discharge them.

82
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,180
Okay.

83
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,680
Right.

84
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,740
Uh, uh, cases of, uh, renal exhaustion, like you've been stressed for a year and you can't

85
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:50,640
take it anymore, a poor diet, dehydration, uh, poor mental state, your body will be too

86
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,380
low energy.

87
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,040
You need a boost, right?

88
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,180
So stimulants and chemicals and electromagnetic will overcharge the organs where the other

89
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,640
ones I just mentioned, the starving, you know, undercharged.

90
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:06,000
So a good, uh, when I used to have medical practitioners, I'd speak with them, they'd

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,220
bring me a case, these medical practitioners in many different fields, both allopathic neurosurgeon

92
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:20,440
types, a standard, you know, and, uh, the alternative medicine types or whatever they

93
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:20,960
call themselves.

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,160
Yeah.

95
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:21,520
Okay.

96
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,080
Yeah.

97
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,760
Well, every time they bring me a case, I say, hold on.

98
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,740
What about ABC?

99
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,900
I would ask these questions and they would always go back and say, oh, I don't know.

100
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,440
I never asked those questions.

101
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,440
Right.

102
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:33,540
Right.

103
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:41,020
So, uh, so what I'm trying to say is it all is based around, do you know about asking the

104
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:41,700
right questions?

105
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,980
I mean, you've probably heard this before, right?

106
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,920
You know, if you're asking the right questions, you know, that means that you're, you're, you're

107
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,220
going to figure more out than if you didn't.

108
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,800
So the same thing goes with acupuncture.

109
00:05:53,920 --> 00:06:01,620
Um, it doesn't work for everyone, uh, because they're not asking why they should do acupuncture.

110
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,680
In other words, also not every acupuncture practitioner knows what knows is very good

111
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:12,940
at just like a carpenter or a plumber, but empirically, and it's in a form and it's valid.

112
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:17,940
It's a valid form, but it's very difficult for many people to grasp because you have to

113
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,040
acknowledge there's a field around the body and that many don't want to acknowledge that.

114
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,880
So that's like a overview of acupuncture and pick and choose, I don't know the question

115
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,820
of whatever acupuncture might be from that.

116
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,260
Uh, never is acupuncture, a local thing.

117
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,560
Uh, okay.

118
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,900
It is sometimes someone says, I have a pain in my ankle pain in the ass, right?

119
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,260
Oh, wait, that's my, well, no.

120
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:41,600
Okay.

121
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,640
Uh, whatever.

122
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,420
Yeah.

123
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,680
Uh, yeah.

124
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,800
Uh, so, uh, whatever.

125
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,720
Uh, and they'll go treat that.

126
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,940
No, a good practitioner, uh, will not.

127
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:50,280
Okay.

128
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,380
You have the pain in your, your ankle.

129
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:52,740
Okay.

130
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,780
But he has to look at the entire body, right?

131
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,260
Right.

132
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:56,360
Okay.

133
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,960
Uh, not just the ankle.

134
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,800
Now I've seen, I've seen this before where someone went in, they had a recovery from

135
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,500
an injury and, uh, it was their neck and the practitioner did not, did not, was not inclusive

136
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,820
about the rest of the body.

137
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,620
So that's, it's not going to work that cause they're maybe it's hit or miss 50, 50.

138
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,220
It didn't work.

139
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:20,760
And then I found someone who knew about asking about the entire body and also per other conditions

140
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,480
and near person's habits and all that.

141
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,680
And it did work for them.

142
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,700
So it's just like anybody, anything else.

143
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,040
Yeah.

144
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:32,280
Like for instance, if somebody is having chronic pain, you got to look at their, their actions,

145
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,460
the way they walk, uh, what it is they surround themselves with, uh, let me just say it this

146
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:38,660
way.

147
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:43,480
Um, when people come to me for pain, I totally ignore that.

148
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,280
It's like a pain is absolutely inconsequential.

149
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:46,760
Okay.

150
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,360
You're in pain, take a freaking pain inducer or what are they called?

151
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,260
A painkillers.

152
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:57,720
I mean, there's so many, some of them, especially if you, I'm talking about over the shelf, aren't

153
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,260
there a lot of pain relief things that are over the counter that you don't have to get

154
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,680
prescription, all kinds of stuff.

155
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:02,880
Sure.

156
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:03,480
Yeah.

157
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,340
And then they have the prescription ones, right.

158
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,340
And they get really up to the fentanyl, right?

159
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,000
Isn't fentanyl primarily pain relief.

160
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,420
Yeah.

161
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:10,540
Okay.

162
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,040
And then Oxycontin, all those.

163
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:12,500
Right.

164
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,620
And, uh, yeah, I'm not against any of that.

165
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,140
Absolutely.

166
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,180
In other words, if someone says Greek, what I do about this pain, I say, okay, take anything

167
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:19,680
you can.

168
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,940
And if it has an orange, if it's prescription and it has that bright orange warning, it

169
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,940
says, do not take with alcohol.

170
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,240
That's the first thing you want to do.

171
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,800
You want to take it with alcohol.

172
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,520
Absolutely.

173
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,620
Take it with alcohol.

174
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:30,420
Right.

175
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:30,900
Yeah.

176
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,799
Um, you're laughing cause you know, it's true.

177
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,039
Right.

178
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,840
Cause it amplifies the effects.

179
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:35,880
Oh yeah.

180
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,100
And you don't need as much.

181
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,520
The alcohol is always going to end up being cheaper than the pill.

182
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:40,940
Absolutely true.

183
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:41,200
Yeah.

184
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,179
It depends on what you're drinking, but it doesn't matter.

185
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:48,860
Cause anyway, so, so the pain, then the thing is then finding out why the city, it's kind

186
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,620
of like the smoke alarm is going off in my house.

187
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,400
What should I do?

188
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,840
I'm not going to sit there and address, well, what does the smoke alarm alarm sound like?

189
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,740
How long has it been going?

190
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,440
Who cares?

191
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,040
Where's the fire?

192
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,460
Where's the smoke?

193
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,000
Right.

194
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,960
You see big difference to me.

195
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,940
Pain is something I never even consider.

196
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,200
It was like, you know, pain, what were we telling you?

197
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,580
Why are you, why are you in pain?

198
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,200
You should have taken care of that before your next meal.

199
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,520
There's a whole bunch of stuff you could take on them.

200
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,280
Here's the thing.

201
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:22,700
If especially, okay, here, if you know anyone who has a grandmother, the social security,

202
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,580
Medicare, whatever, they all have pain pills.

203
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,860
So if you know someone who has a graph, Hey, is your grandma have something in her medicine

204
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,240
chest?

205
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,340
You know, does she have anything yet?

206
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,080
You'll go there and you'll find they're easy.

207
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,120
I'm talking about the, the prescription ones are really easy to get.

208
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,260
I threw my back out about 10 years ago.

209
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,440
I couldn't walk for a day.

210
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,700
And I said, I told the wife, go ask around.

211
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,820
This is, you know, I see, you see, there's an old lady that lives with that young guy

212
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,340
across the street, knock on their door, man, they had all the pill.

213
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:57,060
They gave me like half a pill of, I forgot what it was, a nebutal or something, or I don't

214
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:57,220
know.

215
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,860
It was, it was a couple of really powerful stuff, man.

216
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,520
I was, I was great.

217
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,440
Pain was no longer an issue.

218
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:09,600
It was now the issue was, what do I, can I do to get mobility back into the back without

219
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,840
it's sending a trigger?

220
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,600
So don't, don't ever ask me about pain because pain is like an afterthought.

221
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,520
It's like your smoke alarm.

222
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:17,760
Forget about the smoke alarm.

223
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,100
Who cares what color your smoke alarm is or how loud it is.

224
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:20,740
Why is it on?

225
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,560
Why is it going on?

226
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,080
Why are you?

227
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,120
So you have to address the cause.

228
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,800
I am all for, if anyone is in pain, I am, it doesn't matter toothache, whatever, you

229
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,300
know, your wife or a dog where there's no reason to be in pain at all.

230
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,600
There are so many things out there to take.

231
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,640
I'm particularly a Kratom head.

232
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,800
Years ago I was having some dental issues and I was just not happy, you know, 21, 27

233
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,000
someone said they've tried Kratom.

234
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,200
I'm like, Oh, what the hell is that?

235
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,280
And I'm just a Kratom head.

236
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:51,700
I love it.

237
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,780
I buy it by the kilo.

238
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,440
I get the stuff called, it's a train wreck blend.

239
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,960
Usually the kilos about 200 bucks at the smoke shops.

240
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:05,060
I get it for 69 bucks at a wholesaler, Kratom, wholesaler, whatever.

241
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,600
And I do about 30 grams a day of that stuff.

242
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:14,540
I love it because years ago I used to like getting high, but then I discovered that

243
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,080
I was better when I wasn't high.

244
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,960
But now I discovered that when I'm taking Kratom, getting older doesn't feel so bad,

245
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,260
right?

246
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,600
It's kind of a euphoric thing.

247
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,540
It's very interesting for some people.

248
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,240
Like if you have a low sex drive, it'll give you a strong sex drive.

249
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:36,720
If you have a strong sex drive, it'll damp out your sex drive where, you know, it depends.

250
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,320
You have to experiment with it.

251
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,800
Some people find credit.

252
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:45,880
It's an opioid, by the way, it's, it is classified as an opioid, opioid, and it's used in a lot

253
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:51,460
of, um, we got off to painkillers from acupuncture, but it's used, uh, you know how they go from

254
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,460
the people that go from a drug addiction, let's say like heroin into a synthetic heroin

255
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,020
that doesn't get you off the addiction.

256
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,360
Well, now you've got to get off, you know, you've got to get off the thing that was supposed

257
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,560
to get you off of that.

258
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,660
Kratom is used for that.

259
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:10,800
So people that take the Kratom, uh, that were on heavy opioid addictions can taper off and

260
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,260
it's done.

261
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:14,760
It's really a wonderful, uh, tool for that.

262
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,700
And the FDA was going after it.

263
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,300
There was a lot of kickback.

264
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:23,420
It's actually legal in Australia, I think, in England and a couple of the States like

265
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:23,920
Arkansas.

266
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,060
It's treated like, what is it?

267
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,280
Class three, class four.

268
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,160
What is the lower class, uh, drug?

269
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,480
I forgot what it's called.

270
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:30,940
What did they have?

271
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:31,560
Different classes.

272
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,880
Class one and two were together.

273
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,220
Yeah.

274
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,980
It's like, it's like a third or a third or four.

275
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,820
I forget.

276
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:36,320
Yeah.

277
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,420
It's low on the bottom, but you're not supposed to have it.

278
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:38,520
Right.

279
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:38,820
Right.

280
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:39,540
Okay.

281
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:39,840
Still.

282
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,160
Yeah.

283
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:40,640
Right.

284
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,960
So anyway, so that's the story about acupuncture and pain.

285
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:48,480
But again, we got into the pain because how many people actually consider acupuncture,

286
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,880
uh, because they're in pain just about everyone, right?

287
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,200
And that should not be the reason you're doing it.

288
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,740
The reason you should be doing it is because for pain, there's so many things you can take

289
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,420
pain.

290
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,500
Pain is a, uh, is a quick and dirty thing.

291
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,440
Well, you know what I, you know, when you tell someone just do it quick and dirty, it

292
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:06,920
doesn't matter.

293
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:07,600
Right.

294
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,180
Uh, that's what pain is.

295
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,440
If you have pain, just do a quick and dirty solution.

296
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,800
It doesn't matter.

297
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,200
Just get rid of the pain so you can think more clearly.

298
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,800
That's not what you should be chasing.

299
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,800
You should be chasing what's causing the pain and acupuncture done properly can do that.

300
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,140
But good luck finding a good practitioner that understands it.

301
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:25,540
Yeah.

302
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,380
Because it becomes like chiropractor.

303
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:32,360
You know, when chiropractor was being fought in the 60s, 70s, uh, they were fighting the

304
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,040
chiropractors.

305
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:33,260
Right.

306
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,040
And then they, then they took them on.

307
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:35,400
Right.

308
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,220
They, they, they accepted them.

309
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,440
They embraced them and they became shit.

310
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,180
Right.

311
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,120
You're not as good.

312
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:45,400
Not to say they became shit, but they're not as good as they were when they were more rogue.

313
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,280
Right.

314
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,940
And that's the weird thing about the acupuncture thing is that there are some people that practice

315
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,280
it or that, you know, actually do it for people.

316
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:58,520
And they don't even know what, what works or why or anything else they, they just do

317
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,160
it like anything.

318
00:13:59,320 --> 00:13:59,460
Yeah.

319
00:13:59,520 --> 00:13:59,840
Yeah.

320
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,480
It's weird.

321
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,720
I mean, you're thinking, well, somebody is sticking you with a whole bunch of needles.

322
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,680
They got to know what they're doing.

323
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:04,960
Right.

324
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:05,340
No.

325
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,840
A bunch of them don't.

326
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,160
You know what?

327
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,460
They're not even really needles.

328
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,020
You know, they're really high end ones.

329
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,980
They're very fine.

330
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,040
You don't even, they're so fine.

331
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,780
You don't feel them.

332
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,860
And they're like tubes.

333
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:20,620
They, they have found, uh, I'm trying to recall, was it for these, these wires, these micro wires,

334
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,880
and they're actually tubular.

335
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,160
It's like, how the hell did they get that micro hole in there?

336
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:24,860
Right.

337
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,200
Um, yeah, they are needles, but they're not like sewing needles.

338
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,900
They're not, they're, you know, they're made to, the geometry is made to penetrate the skin.

339
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:32,640
Yeah.

340
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,060
Right.

341
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,320
So that you basically don't even notice it.

342
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,400
It's, you know, if it's done right.

343
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:37,620
Yeah.

344
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,160
The twisting.

345
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:38,640
Yeah.

346
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:46,360
Also the thing about, uh, acupuncture, it's the, the practitioner, let's, let's not even

347
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,000
getting into it.

348
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,900
Let's do an analogy.

349
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,300
A, uh, I got a lightning rod.

350
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,700
I'm going to go install it.

351
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:57,280
I'm climbing the long ladder and I got the lightning rod in my hand as I'm going to the

352
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,060
top of the building.

353
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:03,240
What are the chances of that lightning rod getting hit by lightning and me holding onto

354
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,660
it also getting hit by lightning?

355
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,040
Very high.

356
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:06,720
Right.

357
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,240
Yeah.

358
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,180
You see like holding a live wire.

359
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,520
So, so guess what?

360
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,920
When the practitioner is working on you, are they grounding themselves and do they understand

361
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,500
that they have to somehow isolate their field from yours?

362
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:23,200
What is the likeliness when you're getting acupuncture that the field, uh, that's on

363
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,120
the body, on the ground, let's say, right.

364
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,640
Cause the body would be like the ground is being transferred to yours or vice versa.

365
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,920
Are there draining you more?

366
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,280
Right.

367
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,720
What are the chances of that?

368
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,320
150%.

369
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:34,780
Yeah.

370
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,940
Because they have to know.

371
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:36,240
Yeah.

372
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,840
It's like holding a wire.

373
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,280
Wait, hold on to this wire, Chuck.

374
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:39,660
Yeah.

375
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,380
Like what they often call static electricity.

376
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:46,340
I mean, you're almost guaranteeing a discharge once it's built up or vice versa.

377
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,320
So let's say someone's overcharged.

378
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,880
Is it possible that the practitioner now when they apply it, let's say a quote unquote,

379
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,220
a needle to that area, they're either going to accept that charge.

380
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,060
Of course they are.

381
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:57,440
Yeah.

382
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:02,440
So these things are considering their techniques on that, by the way, with the acupuncture,

383
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,400
there's mock subduction.

384
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,340
You ever seen that where they put a cup on your, it pulls the skin up, you know, it increases

385
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,680
the vacuum in the body.

386
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:08,980
Oh yeah.

387
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,400
I've seen that.

388
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,100
Familiar with that.

389
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:10,320
Yeah.

390
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,140
The glass, the cupping.

391
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,180
Yeah.

392
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,180
They just put a hot air, the light of match or a burning, uh, whatever.

393
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,980
And then they put it and it sucks your skin up.

394
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,580
Uh, that, what do you think that's doing?

395
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,720
It's increasing vacuum artificially, right?

396
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,420
And that works also.

397
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:22,720
Yeah.

398
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,940
That's exactly what I was thinking.

399
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,000
It changes.

400
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:29,500
Cause like you talked about with the, with the vacuum, you know, the body and the, uh,

401
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:29,760
yeah.

402
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,380
It's like, it's like pulling a play.

403
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,060
When you pull the plunger up, what is it?

404
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:33,460
It's a vacuum.

405
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,240
When you push the plunger down, it's pressure positive.

406
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,280
It's all, it's all about vacuum and induction.

407
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:44,960
By the way, with induction, when I say induction, I think I give enough examples that it is a

408
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,680
broad term because if you have an induction cooktop stove, your pots won't work.

409
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,420
They have to have some Ferris in it.

410
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:51,640
Right?

411
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,580
So if you have an all copper pot and all glass pot, where it won't work on an induction,

412
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:59,180
so it has to have a, you know, that's why years ago you got pots and pans and when they

413
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,560
were aluminum with Teflon, they said, okay, on induction stoves.

414
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,300
Yeah.

415
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:08,220
That meant that it had a piece of steel in it, you know, Ferris for it to work.

416
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:08,480
Right.

417
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,520
So what's the, uh, this is a completely other Sonic.

418
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:17,339
The induction aspect of the human body is what do you have Ferris?

419
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,260
By the way, the blood is not magnetic.

420
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:24,020
It's not, the iron in the blood has nothing to do with the iron you'd find anywhere else,

421
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,099
but cause it's organic.

422
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,520
But the, uh, so what is it inducing?

423
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,780
What the induction of the body, what is it required?

424
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:37,840
You know how you need Ferris and pots and pans to induce for, uh, the soap to work or

425
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,400
what do you need in your body to, for the induction to work?

426
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,120
You want to take guests?

427
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:42,940
A very good guests.

428
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:43,440
Water.

429
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:45,540
Water.

430
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,240
Now we're dealing with the water as an inductive element.

431
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,000
Now how much research is being done on that?

432
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:51,380
Zero.

433
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,420
Zero.

434
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,940
Nobody's doing research on that.

435
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,680
I don't want anyone understanding that.

436
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:55,880
Yeah.

437
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,720
And, and what do you have to incorporate to understand, uh, understand it?

438
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:06,120
Uh, guess what, uh, block wall of the magnet, the part of the magnet that nothing attracts

439
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,400
to.

440
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:07,740
Okay.

441
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,740
That's enough for that.

442
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:13,580
Anybody who's been around knows what I'm talking about, but I think that's like part of a seminar.

443
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm starting to slowly put together, uh, more of a compendium on, on physiology.

444
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:23,600
I never really, uh, when I speak on the body, I never say this is medical or whatever.

445
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,200
It's really physiology, you know, which is how the organic biological things really work.

446
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:29,740
Right.

447
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,180
Right.

448
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:36,160
It's, uh, by the way, just to interject that someone sent message the other day, archaic

449
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,940
said his last show with mud flood did announce on September 10th, he's going to have uncommon

450
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,600
sense radio.

451
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:41,920
Right.

452
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:42,460
Okay.

453
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,940
Uh, so I guess we're on, and I did cut confirmation just to let people know, but then some people

454
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,740
are suggesting, you know, what to talk about when I go on a first time interview, like

455
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:55,240
something, uh, uh, that I haven't been on before.

456
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,580
And I would suggest that most of the people are not familiar.

457
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:02,620
I'm going to do what's called Greek speak, baby speak, you know, which is the stuff I

458
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:06,040
talked about 10, 20, look, I've been doing this for three decades.

459
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:06,220
Now.

460
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,140
So the early, since the early two thousands, the tens and the twenties, that's one, two,

461
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:10,720
three decades.

462
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,400
It doesn't mean full 33 decades, but four through crossing into a third decade.

463
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:20,660
So what I first started speaking on is what I always do when I start somewhere, but it's

464
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,260
always with a variation, right?

465
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:22,780
Right.

466
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,700
So I predict we'll hear something about the real meaning of the word nice.

467
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:34,780
And uh, yeah, the direction of heat, the intestines, you know, the Bay it's baby speak, but it's

468
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,960
not, when you say baby speak, it sounds like you're doing it in a baby voice, but it will

469
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,140
not be a baby voice.

470
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,520
It'll just be baby topics.

471
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:46,160
Anybody who's been on this planet for at least a month, uh, can and should know is the topic.

472
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,700
You know how that's the slogan and the heading for it.

473
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,180
Greek speak.

474
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,220
Anyone who's been on this planet for more than a month can and should know.

475
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:52,860
Right.

476
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,240
Warm, warm, warm feet, cool head, this kind of thing.

477
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:00,800
And uh, by the way, he does that live on YouTube, I guess.

478
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,340
Is that what's going to happen there?

479
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,700
So September 10th, you'll be doing that with them.

480
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:04,980
Yeah.

481
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:12,620
2 PM Texas time, which is, uh, I don't know if it's an hour now or so central time or

482
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,280
whatever it's called.

483
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,180
So yeah.

484
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,020
An hour difference from the East and uh, yeah, right.

485
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:17,800
Exactly.

486
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:18,560
Yeah.

487
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,320
So what else you got?

488
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:23,580
Oh, Hey, look, the other thing was, uh, you had mentioned that you got some, uh, feedback

489
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,860
regarding, uh, the bills.

490
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:26,920
Oh yeah.

491
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,140
Yeah.

492
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:27,880
Let's go into that.

493
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,780
I'll go from memory.

494
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:33,540
Because looking at it, you know, is, is that to, to be more, I don't need to be specific

495
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:39,680
on it, but someone sent in a bill of exchange, uh, to a, um, utility company.

496
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:44,100
And they basically, actually there was done in person and they tried to play hot potato.

497
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,020
They told me like they passed it over and they said, it's not mine.

498
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:47,400
It's yours.

499
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,080
Meaning the clerk.

500
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:48,580
Right.

501
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,020
Right.

502
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,280
Cause they've been told they're getting thousands of these now.

503
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:58,520
And, uh, I got a copy was made back and essentially it basically stated, uh, you didn't really,

504
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,340
it's not a payment.

505
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,940
You just sent us the voucher on the bottom where the clip off or cut off at the bottom

506
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,620
of the state.

507
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,140
Right.

508
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:05,400
Right.

509
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,460
And we take cash, blah, blah, blah.

510
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,560
You know, the standard thing, you know, cash credit card check, I'm just paraphrasing.

511
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,140
Yeah.

512
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,340
Well, the thing is, that's fine.

513
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:18,900
And a lot of these, uh, things are happening, but we utility companies, it's pretty interesting.

514
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,620
Uh, I don't know where to start with this bill, do like several things parallel.

515
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,520
Let's just do the overview.

516
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,160
Okay.

517
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:25,580
All right.

518
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:29,580
So you could look up something called, if you go to a browser search, look up, uh, what

519
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:36,760
is in fine, you know, in the world of finance or finance, what is a C T O. So you look

520
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:41,440
up CTO and they'll tell you, Oh, that is called a CTO stands for a confidential treatment

521
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:41,880
order.

522
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:49,260
And that is where a company that is publicly listed or publicly is, is has to show it's

523
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:56,280
a finances publicly can engage in a confidential treatment order CTO, where it keeps certain

524
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:01,980
transactions with certain people secret completely, and they can actually deny that it ever happened.

525
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:02,620
Okay.

526
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:07,060
So what's going on with all utility companies is this, they all have CTOs.

527
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:07,720
That's okay.

528
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,580
Do you notice after COVID people say, Oh, our utility bills went up 10, 20, 30%, right

529
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,340
across the board.

530
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,520
Okay.

531
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,960
What they did was, uh, let's say pick the electric company.

532
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,100
And what they do is they go to a securities, they were actually solicited security company

533
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:26,220
and says, Hey, uh, uh, what's your average billing?

534
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,280
What do you get per year?

535
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:31,460
We'll give you this much over it, but let us, uh, all the billings from now on come to us.

536
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,060
So they start raising the prices.

537
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:40,700
So when you see, I got into this before utility companies raising the cost of, uh, let's say

538
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,680
electrical power, it's cheaper to produce electrical power now than ever.

539
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,960
So why are the bills going up?

540
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:50,320
Because they're selling the future earnings to a private securities firm.

541
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,040
And guess what?

542
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,040
It's under a CTO.

543
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,080
So no matter how much you do with, what do they call it?

544
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,600
Freedom of information or whatever they're, they don't have to answer.

545
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,660
And they've got the securities exchange commission behind them.

546
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,280
So what's the solution for that?

547
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,120
That's what I like to get solutions is you have to get enough people, cause this is not

548
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,760
going to happen, but you can try it.

549
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,440
I'll be surprised.

550
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:15,400
Uh, you get enough people that have the similar billing and you strike, you strike for one

551
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,320
or two months, just don't pay your bill and tell them why.

552
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:22,360
And if enough people do that, the security company that is receiving these payments will

553
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,440
say, Hey, this is a bad deal.

554
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,100
You said everybody pays on time.

555
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,420
Most people pay on time.

556
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,440
Oh, we want to go back to how it was.

557
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,260
And then when it goes, we don't want to deal.

558
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,860
We don't want to buy your future earnings.

559
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,180
Right.

560
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:41,500
And then when it dumps back down, they, the prices you tell you should drop, right?

561
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,740
Because they're not the, now the utility company controls it again, you see?

562
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,700
So that's, what's pretty much going on with utility companies.

563
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,820
Now let's go back to the bill exchange.

564
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:56,360
You've got to find, I think it's UCC article three, read it that covers, I might be wrong

565
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:56,640
on this.

566
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,180
There are other articles, not wrong, but there are other articles that cover what's called

567
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,080
bill of exchange.

568
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,000
The primary one is the bill of exchange act of 1882.

569
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:12,340
The other thing you should be very familiar with is title 12 of the U S code and some

570
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,480
other corresponding codes.

571
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,140
This, I don't have any of this in front of me.

572
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,360
I'm actually standing in my kitchen making some coffee.

573
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:24,240
And there are many other, cause what, what this would be a research done on this.

574
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,520
Cause there are many codes that have not been brought up that also pertain.

575
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,160
That's why I've been putting mentioning Brandon Joe Williams as a good primer.

576
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:39,280
He does go into the UCC and several things and reads them out very well.

577
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:46,920
So what I would suggest is find out, do your research on what, what codes and laws articles

578
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:51,120
of UCC and U S codes and code of federal regulations.

579
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,760
No one's talking about the CFR have to do with bills of exchange.

580
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:58,940
In essence there's two aspects to it and I'm not going to get into it.

581
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:02,920
One is that, you know, you're the beneficiary of the trust known as the social security

582
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,380
number.

583
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,360
Anyone who asks you, actually I should go into it.

584
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:11,820
Social security number is a trust and you are the beneficiary.

585
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:18,100
Now you, someone could make you the trustee, but that's reverses the role, right?

586
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:24,780
Because when something goes wrong in the trust, who takes the hit, who goes to jail, who pays

587
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,120
for it?

588
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:25,800
The trustees.

589
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,560
So that's what they're always trying to make you do.

590
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,020
Yeah.

591
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,620
So when you, okay.

592
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:32,660
So anybody who has your social security number and you acknowledge that you're the beneficiary

593
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:35,320
and you look at them and you say, Oh, I'm the beneficiary trustee.

594
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,240
What are you going to do?

595
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:36,760
Right?

596
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,660
That changes it.

597
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,120
Uh, I've done this, for example, uh, this is going to be all over the place, but someone

598
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,200
had, uh, uh, was picked up on a domestic violence charge.

599
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,580
Uh, the girlfriend called up and they picked him up.

600
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:55,160
He had, uh, already a bench warrant out from, from two years before he had a DUI.

601
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,220
Uh, I mean, he wasn't looking good for him.

602
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,120
They had him in jail overnight.

603
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:05,200
He goes up in front of the judge and, um, he, he was, I used to talk to him a lot.

604
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,580
So you got to clear up that stuff.

605
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:11,780
And he goes for the judge and judge, they did like arraignment sentencing all at the

606
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,300
same time.

607
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,200
It was very strange.

608
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,360
You know, judge is a prosecutor.

609
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,320
I'll get into that again.

610
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,280
How the system works.

611
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,440
We've been doing that a little bit.

612
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:21,060
Anyway, he reads off all these things about doing jail and fines and all that.

613
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,200
And he looks at Ben, Ben, the judge needs your response.

614
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,480
So he looks at me, he says, no, I don't think that I don't see how any of that's going to

615
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,400
benefit me judge.

616
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:34,360
And the judge like stares at him, puts his glasses on 10 seconds later, he goes, okay,

617
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,160
case dismissed.

618
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:36,820
Right.

619
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:41,380
Because he made the judge a trustee, right?

620
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:47,620
That's why judge Bork said when he was addressed on public, on public, on CBS, like 1981, it

621
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:51,860
wasn't when Reagan, the 82 or whatever, judge Bork for being reviewed for Supreme court

622
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,340
justice.

623
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,980
So one of the reporters asked him on TV, what are you going to do about the growing prison

624
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,540
population?

625
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,360
He says, absolutely nothing.

626
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,840
Everyone's volunteered to be there.

627
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,000
Right.

628
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,940
And they cut it right there.

629
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,140
Right.

630
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,900
So, yeah.

631
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,680
So, so, okay.

632
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,660
So anyone do the utility companies have social security number?

633
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,320
Yes, they do.

634
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,240
So they're trustee.

635
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,780
You shouldn't even be getting a bill.

636
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,260
The bill should be going to the treasury.

637
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,240
How's that going to happen?

638
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,500
Because it's open.

639
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,700
You can act as a trustee and take the hit.

640
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:22,040
In other words, go to jail or go and get other notes and work for it.

641
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,300
Or you just solely act as a beneficiary.

642
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:28,320
And anyone who has that number is now a trustee, right?

643
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:33,300
That's why like if you get a letter from the IRS, why am I getting a letter from a, I shouldn't

644
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:33,900
even be known.

645
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:34,800
Right.

646
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:39,660
Anything that is titled with the old caps name, they're taxing the trust.

647
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,120
They're putting the trust in jail there.

648
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,120
The bill, the water bill goes to the trust, not you.

649
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,580
Start off.

650
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,600
I mean, you just don't say it like this, but the thing that she's always running your mind,

651
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,660
why are you giving me the bill?

652
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,360
I'm a beneficiary.

653
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,500
I shouldn't even know about it.

654
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,580
You have social security number.

655
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,200
You're a trustee.

656
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:54,740
Handle it.

657
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,640
You got the access to the trust.

658
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,700
I shouldn't even know there's a water bill.

659
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,680
I shouldn't even know there's a tax bill.

660
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,780
I shouldn't know there's a car bill.

661
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,580
I shouldn't even crank our company.

662
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,500
Why are you sending to me?

663
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:09,020
So the old caps trust your trustee, do your job, trustee, you see?

664
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:12,260
But that's not going to happen that easy, right?

665
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:16,640
Because of the population doesn't know this, by the way, as I mentioned, the entire system

666
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,100
is set up with a dead man's switch.

667
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,920
Once people find out the laws, the whole system falls apart.

668
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,560
It was set up that way, right?

669
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:30,040
Just like the speech in trafficking, he said, basically, the whole bankruptcy and Congress

670
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,740
being trustees is a coroner's report, or the new budget was a coroner's report.

671
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,520
Yeah, I've said the country was killed in 33, it just hasn't been buried yet.

672
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:42,300
So the burial happens when enough people realize what the laws actually say, what they're supposed

673
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:42,820
to be doing.

674
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,380
Am I all for it?

675
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:44,900
Yeah.

676
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:45,760
Cover your ears.

677
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,100
Hell yeah, I'm all for it.

678
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:47,520
All right.

679
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:51,000
So because how much more do you want to live like that, right?

680
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,840
So some people don't mind and don't care.

681
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,440
That's not me.

682
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,320
But here's the thing.

683
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,840
With the bills, there's so many ways.

684
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,820
You can do what's called a conditional acceptance.

685
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,840
I'm not an expert on it, but there's a lot of conditional acceptances that I've seen

686
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,460
are 25, 30 pages long.

687
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,600
It could just be one paragraph.

688
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,940
All you've got to do, and I'm not saying this is in any order.

689
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:18,000
You'll notice when you do sign, I think two or three sonics ago, we did go over how CHAT-GBT

690
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,900
tells you that a bill is actually a check, right?

691
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,280
And now, here's the thing.

692
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,420
Let's just go back there.

693
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:28,940
When you get to that point, when you're writing out the bottom of the voucher of a bill like

694
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,480
a check, do me a favor.

695
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,620
Have a check.

696
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:36,040
Just go online and get a sample check, and look at it well, and look at the voucher.

697
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:39,100
You'll see it has a routing number with a code on the bottom, right?

698
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,360
Just like a check does, right?

699
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,340
And try to suss out, you know how a check is laid out.

700
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,700
It's the bank, and then who the customer is, who it's going to, the amount, and it's also

701
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,020
written.

702
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,960
Look at a check, and then look at the voucher that comes to the bottom of the bill.

703
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:59,500
Don't start writing on it the third-grade penmanship all over the place.

704
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:05,300
Try to make it look like what you put there corresponds geometrically.

705
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,780
It kind of looks good, right?

706
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,740
It doesn't have to be that big.

707
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,880
It has to look clean.

708
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:17,280
Handwritten, always, by the way, trumps printed or typewritten, always.

709
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,140
This is in the code as well.

710
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,400
So basically, words trump numbers.

711
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:26,360
When you see numbers and it's written in words, what's written in the words is really

712
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,000
what's followed.

713
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,840
And then handwritten is more important than typewritten.

714
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,320
That's why when you have a contract, and you don't like something, you cross it out, put

715
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:33,920
your initial there.

716
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:38,200
That actually is more important than what's typewritten or printed on the contract when

717
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:38,740
it's handwritten.

718
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,760
That's why you don't hear this much, but if you listen to some YouTube channels about

719
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:50,420
litigants and attorneys on both sides or whatever, or judges or legal staff or whatever,

720
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:56,080
they'll mention, they said, I got a correspondence from so-and-so, and it was handwritten.

721
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,520
You hear that sometimes.

722
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,380
And they wrote it by hand.

723
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,140
It's a big deal.

724
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,040
It is a big deal.

725
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:06,920
You don't have to write it by hand, but if you do, make it look presentable, very neat.

726
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,120
It should be good penmanship.

727
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,520
You could practice your penmanship.

728
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:17,320
There are printers now that you, by the way, it has an AI element in it where you feed

729
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:17,480
it.

730
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:17,980
It scans.

731
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:23,280
You have to sign your name, anything, seven or 10 times, and it scans it, and then it

732
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:28,120
has a fountain pen in the printer, and it actually signs for you with a pen.

733
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,460
These printers exist.

734
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,840
High-end brokers use them.

735
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,260
And Wells Fargo, I'm sure.

736
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:34,920
Yeah.

737
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,540
I've seen those.

738
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,060
They actually duplicate the signature and that.

739
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:39,780
Right.

740
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:43,380
That's why they need you to sign seven or eight times, so it kind of sees the variant.

741
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:43,980
Right.

742
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,080
Okay.

743
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,080
Now, let's go back to the conditional acceptance.

744
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,160
What you do when you do give a conditional acceptance is basically setting them up.

745
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:56,700
We were growing up with, have you stopped beating your wife yet?

746
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,480
That's a setup.

747
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,100
Have you stopped beating your wife yet?

748
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,880
If you say no, it means you're still beating her.

749
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,840
If you say yes, you're still beating her.

750
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,200
Then you were beating her before.

751
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,800
So conditional acceptances are like that.

752
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,460
By the way, the bills of exchange are like that, too.

753
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,040
But, okay.

754
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,140
Conditional acceptance could be, to start off, a question.

755
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:27,020
Records show that you are a legal corporation, legal municipality, legal utility, whatever

756
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,880
foundation, organization.

757
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:34,840
And you send out billing through the mail, electronically, whatever.

758
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:43,040
When you send out your billing, is it per United States laws, codes, and regulations?

759
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,160
And commercial codes?

760
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:46,900
That's a question.

761
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:53,160
When you send out your billing, do you do remittance also according to the United States

762
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,460
codes, laws, rules, regulations?

763
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,840
Remittance is when you accept something back for payment, right?

764
00:32:59,100 --> 00:32:59,340
Right.

765
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,900
Typically, remittance is used when you have coupons.

766
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:10,220
When you go to the store and you have $5 off of whisked laundry detergent, and you give

767
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,900
the coupon to the cashier, that's called a remittance.

768
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,500
It's not a payment, but, right?

769
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:14,980
Right.

770
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:15,420
Okay.

771
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,080
It's like a redeeming.

772
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,260
Okay.

773
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:18,980
All right.

774
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,660
So basically, you could set up a utility company.

775
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,100
Are you following all these laws?

776
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:26,580
And you put Uniform Commercial Code, United States Code of Federal Relations, United States

777
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:26,960
Code.

778
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:27,980
What are they going to say?

779
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,180
What are they going to say?

780
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:29,540
No?

781
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,580
We don't follow them?

782
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:31,440
Nope.

783
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,780
They're going to admit to that?

784
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,560
Now, if they admit that they do follow the law, well, you got them right under your fingertips.

785
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:43,580
The Uniform Commercial Code tells you, just like CHAT-DBT, how to turn a bill into a check.

786
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,920
You just turn it into a check.

787
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,180
Pay to the order of, they already have the utility company, right?

788
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:53,720
And you write the, let's say it's $123.40, one, two, three, four.

789
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,020
You write with your hand, 123, right?

790
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,720
Just like the, I think in the fourth or fifth grade, they do check writing in math class

791
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,460
here now, right?

792
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:02,620
They used to.

793
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,460
I don't know if they still do.

794
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,080
Okay.

795
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:04,600
Well, yeah.

796
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,219
But you see, so you set it up just like the check.

797
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:12,639
So if they say in the conditional acceptance, yes, we do do everything under United States

798
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,000
Codes.

799
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:16,940
Are you able to cite the codes that show you and tell you what a bill of exchange needs

800
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,520
to contain?

801
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,159
Easy peasy.

802
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,739
It's the UCC Article 3.

803
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:27,880
It's in 12 U.S.C., you know, Title 12, United States Code.

804
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:31,480
It's in 411, 412, right?

805
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:35,239
You have the Bill of Exchange Act of 1882.

806
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:38,920
You don't have to go back that far, but you can pull some verbiage.

807
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:43,380
It's the same exact verbiage, just like if you look at Title 12, Section 411, it's the

808
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:43,639
same.

809
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:48,239
Where did they get the verbiage out of that in the U.S. Code, 12 U.S.C. 411?

810
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,480
Where did that verbiage come from?

811
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,540
It came directly out of the 16th Amendment.

812
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,659
Look it up.

813
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,060
They do a lot of copy and pasting, right?

814
00:34:55,380 --> 00:35:00,380
So when you look at the UCC Uniform Commercial Code, like Article 3, basically, it's all

815
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:00,960
over the place.

816
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:07,720
I think it's Article 3-301, 302, 303, 304, all the way, 308 goes with reserving rights.

817
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,220
When you look at those, it's cut and pasted from where?

818
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,240
The UCC cut and pasted from where?

819
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,180
The Bill of Exchange Act of 1882.

820
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:20,480
You might have noticed, anyone who's studied law sees a lot of cut and pasting going on

821
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,460
between codes and laws and things like that, right?

822
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,960
So it'll make it easy.

823
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:25,900
Yeah, it'll make it easy.

824
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:30,120
So basically, you basically ask whoever you're planning on sending a bill of exchange to,

825
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:35,280
first, you have to establish that they send out bills and accept remittance and payment,

826
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:35,620
right?

827
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,100
It seems like you do.

828
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:41,560
They're not going to say we don't, because they do, and then you ask them, do you follow

829
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:45,260
the laws of the United States, codes, rules, regulation, and commercial laws known as the

830
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,020
Uniform Commercial Code?

831
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:46,840
Do you follow that?

832
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,900
And you just send that letter out.

833
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,120
What are they going to do?

834
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:55,180
If they say no, well, now you go to the attorney general and say, look, these guys are running

835
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,900
utility companies, so they don't follow the law.

836
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,800
You got a confession, right?

837
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:06,980
But if they say, yes, we do follow the law, can you copy and paste how all the codes actually

838
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:09,380
tell you a bill turns into a check?

839
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,220
Yeah.

840
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,460
And you're done.

841
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,640
This is a simplified thing.

842
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,940
This is kind of like when I talk about scalier, just wrap a pipe around the part of the magnet

843
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:21,600
that doesn't stick to iron sticks to the block wall, and you're done.

844
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,440
Well, it's not that simple.

845
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,340
I had to do like a nine-hour seminar, right?

846
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:24,800
Right.

847
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,700
And people still don't get it.

848
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,720
So the same thing with this, this might require a seminar to be more pointed, but you got

849
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:36,140
to take in, at the same time, this is what, I don't endorse Brandon Joe Williams because

850
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:44,400
he never brings up conditional, he does bring up conditional endorsements with an I, or he

851
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,740
doesn't matter, but he thinks so, without recourse.

852
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,400
But I'm telling you, that still creates a tax liability, even though you think you hopped

853
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:53,700
it out.

854
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,920
Because I know people that have YouTube channels that live in England, and they get IRS forms,

855
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,560
they say they have to fill out.

856
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,580
So it has nothing to do with being a citizen or not, like they're trying to.

857
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:09,020
So what's important is a conditional endorsement where you're still making a demand for lawful

858
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,360
money, right?

859
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,720
That's the paramount thing.

860
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,180
Now, I don't know how well the two would mix.

861
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:23,260
Someone who really is doing Title 12, 411, lawful money only, I don't think that type

862
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:26,900
of person who's doing it from a moral point of view or an ethical point of view is going

863
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:30,700
to want to jump down and grab those bills and sign them, send them in, because now you're

864
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,120
acting like a Federal Reserve Bank.

865
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:37,380
So I have to ponder on that to see if there's a commingling, like on one side, you're acting

866
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,660
like a bank, and the other side, you're not.

867
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:45,700
But making a demand for lawful money doesn't mean that you're acting like a bank that's

868
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:51,240
bad or they have any more jurisdiction over you or creating any liability.

869
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,320
You have to think about that, but you should always include that.

870
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,780
Right, because looking through some of this stuff, I mean, it says the SEC issues certain

871
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,480
things, you know.

872
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:00,740
Well, hold on.

873
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,960
The SEC is a real bullshit company, by the way.

874
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,640
They are a company.

875
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:08,460
They're the easiest thing to get rid of, and they make these big deals about them, right?

876
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:13,700
The SEC is like any other of the agencies or corporations, but the reason they seem

877
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,900
so big and bad is because people let them be big and bad.

878
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:20,200
But you could spank them around and get them out of the picture real fast, but that's okay.

879
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,000
Go ahead with your example.

880
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,020
Well, no, I was just saying that with the confidential treatment orders, they're just,

881
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,600
the SEC is part of it.

882
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,260
They issue these, it says.

883
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,920
They're the ones who are supposed to issue them.

884
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,060
So that's why.

885
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,960
Yeah, you go to, let's say the utility company, they go to the SEC and say, we want to do

886
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,140
a confidential treatment order.

887
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,660
So the SEC has it on record, but no one else knows.

888
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:47,000
But it's interesting because it's almost like, you know, with using the Federal Reserve notes

889
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,780
effectively, what do they say?

890
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,940
The only people that are supposed to use those are what?

891
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,500
Agents of the Federal Reserve, right?

892
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,180
That's right.

893
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,400
So the problem.

894
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,480
Now, anyone could use them, but you're not authorized to use them.

895
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:02,260
And what happens when you, you're found with something that you're not authorized to use?

896
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,820
What is that thing called now?

897
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:04,840
Contraband.

898
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,840
Yeah, that's contraband.

899
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,120
Right.

900
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:09,760
And so, but therefore not, it's not useful to you.

901
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:13,280
It shouldn't be useful to you because you are not authorized to.

902
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,360
Well, yeah.

903
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:14,620
Okay.

904
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:22,060
But once we go into the codes, we Federal Reserve notes are any bills, any bonds, right?

905
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,860
Any bills of exchange.

906
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,520
What's a bill of exchange, right?

907
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,380
Mm hmm.

908
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,140
Okay.

909
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:28,480
You see?

910
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,640
Now here's the, okay.

911
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,300
That was kind of like a messy tangential over the place.

912
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,340
So here's the second part.

913
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:39,020
So let's say you get a bill from utility company and the bottom says, detach this voucher,

914
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,840
send it in with your payment.

915
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,760
And you fill out that voucher like a check.

916
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:48,280
If they tell you whether they give it, okay, they usually, by the way, in this case, they

917
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:48,820
kept it.

918
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,060
They kept it.

919
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:50,360
Right.

920
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,540
They send you a copy back.

921
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:51,760
Right.

922
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:52,220
Yeah.

923
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,540
Which means that's okay.

924
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:59,100
Well, the code says that if it's refused, there is no debt, the debt is cleared.

925
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,900
That's why I mean, this is all like, have you stopped beating your wife yet?

926
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,300
You damned if you do, damned if you don't.

927
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,320
So the minute you, it's like stepping in poop.

928
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:10,220
Once they get a bill of exchange, they're done, they're finished.

929
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,740
Because if they refuse it, there's no debt.

930
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:17,280
Now if they don't send it back, means they used it.

931
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,560
They literally deposit, made a deposit.

932
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:23,240
They ran a transaction number on it and they deposited it.

933
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,820
They never give them back.

934
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,540
I have never seen one come back.

935
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,020
They send a copy back.

936
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:32,780
Now I was in a, uh, it was hanging around this people in a court case for a bad check.

937
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:38,140
It was a bad check for a million bucks and they got the 10% initially they pulled it,

938
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:38,860
pulled it anyway.

939
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,880
And they kept it and they were like, Oh, you, you, you gotta, you gotta come talk to us.

940
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:43,420
Well, why?

941
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,240
Well, we got a bad check.

942
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,220
Oh, give me a check back.

943
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:46,680
I'll make it right.

944
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,640
No, we can't give it back.

945
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,600
Cause the bank was able to use that million dollar check, even though there was zero in

946
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,040
the bank.

947
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:52,100
Right.

948
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,680
They don't want, right anyway.

949
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:53,780
Right.

950
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,620
So, uh, we never got the check back.

951
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,400
Judge says, yeah, they gave you a check back.

952
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,600
So they gave you a legal copy, legal copy.

953
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,320
It said, right.

954
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,080
You know, Xerox copy of it or a copy machine.

955
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:06,720
Is that okay?

956
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,640
Is what you do need a recess?

957
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:09,600
No, no recess.

958
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,800
I need to really need a recess.

959
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:11,280
Okay.

960
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,020
Run down in the court building.

961
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,140
Find a copy machine.

962
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,160
Took about 20 minutes.

963
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,980
Take a $10 bill, make a copy of it and then bring it back.

964
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,200
All right.

965
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:20,880
What do you got?

966
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:21,580
Let's continue.

967
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:21,680
Let's continue.

968
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:21,900
Okay.

969
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,880
Uh, judge, can I spend this?

970
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:28,560
And you give the judge a Xerox copy of a $10 bill.

971
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,800
Obviously not.

972
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:30,700
Yeah.

973
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,680
So that, that's what, that's how good the legal copy of the check is.

974
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,860
I need the original check back.

975
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:35,420
Right.

976
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,280
They won't do it because they used it.

977
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,980
It's the same thing.

978
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:44,580
So that was done very often after that, by the way, in a lot of bank cases.

979
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:48,920
So at this point, um, they're damned if they do damage.

980
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:49,220
They don't.

981
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:53,440
Now I know on another side note, the utility companies, credit card companies and all that,

982
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,740
they're getting them by the thousands.

983
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:58,320
Now what I would do, let's say I wanted to mix, I'll tell you what I would do, but don't

984
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,340
do what I would do.

985
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:04,660
What I would do is, uh, be prepared to have another party.

986
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:08,640
Uh, you could shut down the account when it goes sour and then they say they hold you

987
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,620
for an unsecured debt, just like not paying a phone bill or whatever, right.

988
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:16,980
But what I would do is if I was messing around, let's say I had an account with the electric

989
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:17,560
company yesterday.

990
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,660
I wanted to really do this and experiment with it.

991
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:23,780
Um, before I even started messing around, the first thing I would do is get another

992
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:24,860
party that would back up.

993
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,260
So if I close the account, right.

994
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,400
And it doesn't mean that they won't think I still owe it.

995
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:29,780
That's okay.

996
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:34,360
In other words, you could rack up a hundred thousand dollars in, uh, uh, electric bills

997
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,100
in three months and then close the account.

998
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,220
You can do that, but then they're going to send it to a collection agency.

999
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:39,520
You see?

1000
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:42,240
So let's say you need the power on in the building.

1001
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,860
What I would do is get another party.

1002
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:48,280
So as I'm messing around, I could shut the account anytime and then have the other party

1003
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,540
just put it in their name, right?

1004
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:53,220
So have someone else that you could put it in their name or their trust name.

1005
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,020
It's never in your name.

1006
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,260
So, um, so let's say you, you know, you have a, uh, not a wife, but someone else, because

1007
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:03,020
they, you know, whatever, if you, if you have a marriage license, that's like the worst

1008
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:03,620
thing in the world.

1009
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,260
But yeah.

1010
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:07,760
Cause then you have your wife, you have a corporate attachment, you have a corporate

1011
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,800
attachment that way.

1012
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:09,520
That's right.

1013
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,060
In the computer, you're the same entity, right?

1014
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:17,180
So another party to completely different address and everything like that.

1015
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:22,880
So anyway, uh, cause they asked for previous address to sometimes anything that's verifiable.

1016
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:25,780
So what I do is I line up, uh, what do they call it in football?

1017
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:29,280
When you have a player that, uh, in case somebody gets knocked out, you bring in the other guy,

1018
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,020
what do they call it?

1019
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:30,840
A backup?

1020
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,320
Uh, yeah, there you go.

1021
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:33,240
Reserve player.

1022
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:33,800
Reserve.

1023
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,140
Okay.

1024
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:34,400
Sure.

1025
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:36,540
I would have a reserve account holder somewhere in reserve.

1026
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:36,760
Okay.

1027
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,820
So now here we go.

1028
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,320
So first thing I would do is send a conditional acceptance to the utility electric company.

1029
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,880
Uh, I noticed you guys are electrical company.

1030
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,760
You put down how many years they've been operating.

1031
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:51,480
You sending out bills and remittances, people are paying them.

1032
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:55,600
When you send out your bills and all that, do you, is it in accordance with the United

1033
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:59,900
States laws, codes, uniform, commercial code, all of a question mark.

1034
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:00,420
That's all.

1035
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,400
Put an envelope, send it in.

1036
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,380
And if they don't answer, you send them another one.

1037
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,660
Hey, this is a number two.

1038
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:07,660
I need, I need to know.

1039
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:09,400
Have you stopped beating your wife yet?

1040
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:12,820
So now here's the thing.

1041
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,100
When they see that they know what's going well, they usually don't.

1042
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:15,880
They're so stupid.

1043
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,820
Like I'll talk a little bit about identity theft, so I'll show you how stupid that is.

1044
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:24,420
By the way, if anyone has your social security number and first name, last name and address

1045
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:30,700
and phone number and you didn't give it to them under FTC PA and FICA, that's a identity

1046
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:31,140
theft.

1047
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:35,360
I'm going to go back to the, how would you like to, let me just to the tangent here.

1048
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:40,280
So right now, anybody can go look up their credit report and you're going to see like

1049
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:46,120
Nexus, Lexus, Experion, like three or four credit reporting agencies have your information,

1050
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:46,520
right?

1051
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,220
Uh, did you give it to them?

1052
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:54,900
Now, if someone wants to put something up there, they have to send you a letter 30 days before

1053
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,520
they publish it or make it accessible in the credit report.

1054
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:58,380
Did you get that?

1055
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:04,380
Did you ever get, right now, if anybody, you go look up your credit report, right?

1056
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,300
Uh, and you see it's listed.

1057
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:07,540
All these things are listed.

1058
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:13,100
Now, it's not only the people that are listing it, but whoever, it doesn't matter, a dentist,

1059
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:18,100
a back rent, um, let's say you didn't pay a credit card and they put it on your credit

1060
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:18,340
report.

1061
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:19,040
That's normal, right?

1062
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:23,300
That credit card company has to send you a letter, uh, 30 days before they give it to

1063
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,560
the credit card company that they're putting it on your credit report.

1064
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:26,260
Did you get that?

1065
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:29,740
And you have to ask them, say, Hey, listen, I had a fire, you know, I lost it.

1066
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,100
Can you show me proof that you sent it to me?

1067
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:33,640
Uh oh.

1068
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,320
You know, it's $500 each time.

1069
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:41,480
So if you, you could rack up, so let's say, so let's say you go to Experian and they got

1070
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:44,280
like a credit card company, dentist bill or whatever.

1071
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,160
Did any of those people send you a letter 30 days before they put, and they have to

1072
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:48,480
prove it.

1073
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,400
Just say you lost it.

1074
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,080
Uh, can you prove that you sent me the letter?

1075
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,600
I never saw any of this stuff.

1076
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:53,400
Yeah.

1077
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:54,880
Each one is 500 bucks.

1078
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,380
So you got three reporting agencies with five things in that's 15 times 500, 6,000 bucks

1079
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:01,260
right away and they don't argue.

1080
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:08,200
And because, because, um, you saw that and you didn't get notice you're into mental anguish.

1081
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:13,820
So now you want $1,500 treble damages on top of the 500 of each one, right?

1082
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:17,760
So very quickly, what's 1,500 right times.

1083
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:23,360
So now we're up to 40,000 and you notice each one and it's very, you cite the FICO law.

1084
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,180
Usually they don't fight it.

1085
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:26,720
They do fight it.

1086
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:27,420
They're so stupid.

1087
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,220
Like LexisNexis is free.

1088
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:31,080
Oh no, we don't have to do that.

1089
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:31,480
Oops.

1090
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,440
You show them the law.

1091
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:32,920
Oops.

1092
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,140
They screwed up.

1093
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,060
Usually you get a check from an attorney.

1094
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:39,880
The attorney will call you and they'll say, yeah, we saw your letter.

1095
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:41,980
How, what does it take to settle this matter?

1096
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:48,100
So usually most people could rack up between 20 and $30,000 in fines and you just get on

1097
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:48,400
the horn.

1098
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:55,720
And I assure you 90% if you could show 20 or $30,000 is out, you're going to get five

1099
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,940
to 10,000 from attorneys, no court case, nothing right away.

1100
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:01,800
Now, if most people did this, that would be great.

1101
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:04,880
You know, I mean, now anybody can do this because right.

1102
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:08,460
If you go look up anyone, I tell them, look up the credit was a free credit report doesn't

1103
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:09,040
whatever.

1104
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:10,080
I said, I had like six things.

1105
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:14,160
Do you remember getting a letter from all those, uh, you six things on each reporting

1106
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:14,600
agency?

1107
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:15,700
That's three times six.

1108
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:16,500
That's 18.

1109
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:18,660
That's $500 for each one.

1110
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:19,560
But treble damages.

1111
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:22,000
Cause did you get mental anguish when you found that out?

1112
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:22,960
Yeah.

1113
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,420
Well, that's treble damages.

1114
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:24,740
Right.

1115
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:25,540
You go to credit karma.

1116
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:26,660
That's 1,500 now.

1117
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:30,420
You go to that credit karma company or whatever, and they'll show you like a three different

1118
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:31,480
reporting agencies.

1119
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:35,020
So all at once, each one, each one, each reporting, each one.

1120
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:39,000
So if one, let's say the dentist, you didn't pay the bill and reports it to three agencies.

1121
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:39,880
That's not $500.

1122
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,340
That's 500 plus 500 plus 500, 1,500.

1123
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:42,720
Yeah.

1124
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:43,000
Right.

1125
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:43,500
Right.

1126
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:47,020
But, but were you, did that give you mental anguish when you saw that?

1127
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:48,380
Well, yeah.

1128
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:48,800
Okay.

1129
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:50,000
So I'm upset about it.

1130
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,280
So that's treble damages.

1131
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,460
So I want another 1,500 on top of that.

1132
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,680
So now multiply that times like 18.

1133
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:57,920
Whoa.

1134
00:47:58,540 --> 00:47:59,780
So now you got three grand.

1135
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:00,200
Yeah.

1136
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,420
You got three grand by a right.

1137
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:02,860
Okay.

1138
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:04,460
So you got three grand by six.

1139
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:05,800
I mean, that's a lot of people.

1140
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:06,540
Not a lot.

1141
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,340
That's 18,000 to start with.

1142
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:08,580
Yeah.

1143
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:08,880
Okay.

1144
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:09,420
Yeah.

1145
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:09,520
Yeah.

1146
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,000
There's a few.

1147
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:10,720
And guess what?

1148
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,700
When they do it, cause they're so stupid, they don't communicate.

1149
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:13,440
They'll do it again.

1150
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,340
And then next year you go after him again.

1151
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:19,760
So anyway, and then by the way, when they all, everything comes out, if your credit

1152
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:23,440
score and your credit score goes up to like eight 40, plus you got like 10, 20,000.

1153
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,780
From the attorneys in your pocket.

1154
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:29,080
Now there's people that are doing this and they're waking up and they don't know what

1155
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,360
to do because it's too late.

1156
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:32,000
It's too late.

1157
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:32,780
Just show them a lot.

1158
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:33,280
Now this, okay.

1159
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,700
Why did I give this as an example?

1160
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:40,440
The same thing with the water company, electric company, telephone company, do a conditional

1161
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,320
letter, conditional acceptance.

1162
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,580
I noticed you're a business established.

1163
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,960
Make sure, let them know you did research when you signed a letter, conditional acceptance.

1164
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:56,520
When you say you were the electric company, it was established on May 13th, 1938 by so

1165
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,100
and so.

1166
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:00,240
And you've got this many customers and you send out Billy.

1167
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:03,620
That's like, Ooh, this guy, why is he giving us all these details?

1168
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,200
He's very detail oriented.

1169
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:09,960
Oh, it's not, it's mostly, it's not going to go in the trash.

1170
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:10,920
Right?

1171
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:15,380
Cause if you're that detail oriented on the, and then you say, I noticed while you're billing

1172
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:19,500
us up, do you follow the laws of the United States, the commercial codes and that's, you

1173
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,400
know, all the state laws and all that.

1174
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:27,660
If they answer yes and they reject your bill of exchange later, well you answered, yes.

1175
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,440
Now, you know, if they say no, you don't have to go any further.

1176
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:36,300
He's going to attorney general say, have a contract with these people.

1177
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:41,200
And uh, I was expecting to spend $10,000 with them, you know, a thousand dollars a year

1178
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:41,780
in 10 years.

1179
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,060
Now I'm totally mentally, mentally anguished.

1180
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:45,440
That caused me mental anguish.

1181
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:46,220
Right?

1182
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:48,320
Anyway.

1183
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:49,820
Right?

1184
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:52,280
So you trap them and that's how you do it.

1185
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:53,280
Right?

1186
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:55,200
Cause right now they're doing the trapping on you.

1187
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:59,560
How dare they send a letter that we only accept cash.

1188
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:01,860
What's cash, corn, potatoes.

1189
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:05,220
It's so, but remember they're stupid.

1190
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:06,100
They're really dumb.

1191
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:06,600
They don't know.

1192
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:10,400
I've spoken to attorney generals before and talk to them and they don't know anything at

1193
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:10,580
all.

1194
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,120
They go, Oh no, just, I know what you're saying.

1195
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,540
You just have to be a good citizen.

1196
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,180
You can't ask them questions at all.

1197
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,820
They're like monkeys swinging from a tree.

1198
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:18,480
Yeah.

1199
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:19,280
Well, that's the problem.

1200
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:24,240
Now you go to the attorney general to go ahead and look for what they call relief on this.

1201
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:24,680
Right?

1202
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:28,380
Uh, what happens if he doesn't know what the hell you're talking about?

1203
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:34,600
You're not going to the attorney general who doesn't know what you're talking about.

1204
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:36,800
You're going to the office of attorney general.

1205
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:38,520
All you have to do is show them that you noticed it.

1206
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:40,480
It's the office.

1207
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:45,740
When you, okay, when you, you'd have the elections coming up for various things.

1208
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:49,000
You're not voting for Trump or whoever the other one is.

1209
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:51,060
You're voting for the office of president.

1210
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:52,800
Right?

1211
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,840
When you, right, you see what I mean?

1212
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:57,740
When you go talk to your congressman, you're not talking to that idiot.

1213
00:50:57,860 --> 00:50:59,860
You're talking to the office of the Congress.

1214
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:00,820
It's called the office.

1215
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:01,600
Guess what?

1216
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:03,620
The people hold an office also.

1217
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,980
It's known as the people and they've abandoned that office.

1218
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,560
Wasn't there a TV show called the office?

1219
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:11,140
Yeah.

1220
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,140
Yeah, there was Scott.

1221
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:15,600
You notice how they, uh, how they, uh, what are they underscored?

1222
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:18,540
The characters, the office has nothing to do with the character.

1223
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:22,920
It has to do with the office being noticed and what liability does it carry to go against

1224
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,040
what that office means.

1225
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:27,640
And if the office doesn't do their job, you do their job for them.

1226
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,840
That's in, that's their titles for that.

1227
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:34,900
By the way, if you go, let's say to an office, any government office, and they don't do what

1228
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:37,480
they're supposed to do, you have to wait 180 days.

1229
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:38,260
I know it's a long time.

1230
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:41,240
And then you take it on yourself as what's called a private attorney general.

1231
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:43,320
Are you familiar with this?

1232
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:44,600
Have we ever gone over this before?

1233
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:45,320
No, I don't.

1234
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:49,740
I don't recall this at all, but 180 days, six months, what they would say basically

1235
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:54,560
with you, they only give you 10 days or 21 days, but then you got to give them six months.

1236
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:55,080
That's okay.

1237
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:59,200
Play by the rules because remember, did you have a lot of mental anguish for six months?

1238
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,380
How much is six months worth of mental anguish worth?

1239
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,220
Well, it racks up.

1240
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,400
Remember you got to add that on.

1241
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,920
Hey, look, every day I'm losing sleep over this.

1242
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:07,480
Yeah.

1243
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:07,800
Yeah.

1244
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:08,140
Right.

1245
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:08,580
Okay.

1246
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:10,080
Wow.

1247
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:11,440
Yeah.

1248
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:11,940
So I don't know.

1249
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:13,160
These Sonics might be worth it.

1250
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:15,180
This is like, you know, there's no attorney.

1251
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:17,080
You can go to a $1,500 an hour attorney.

1252
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:17,700
They don't know this.

1253
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:19,160
What we just went over in the Sonic.

1254
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:19,500
So.

1255
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:20,180
No.

1256
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:20,820
Not at all.
