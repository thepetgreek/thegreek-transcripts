00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:11,540
Sonic Event 14, Oteli in the Greek, welcome to it.

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,420
You know, this is, this is going to be yet another diverse discussion, I think.

3
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,020
But I don't know, I don't know how much input I'm going to have on this one, Greg, how you

4
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,000
doing today?

5
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,680
Doing all right.

6
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,720
It's about what the second week, I think.

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,100
We're just starting the second week of the second month, 2.2.

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,320
You know, it's funny, I was listening to somebody that, they got these YouTube channels called,

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,500
actually, if I say what they do, it's in their title, but they call themselves decoders.

10
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,100
And they're supposedly so smart.

11
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,680
And it's funny, because they recently put up a two and a half hour video, had it on

12
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,140
in the background while I was working on a class D amplifier, just redoing the terminals

13
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,720
and stuff, running silver wire, taking the copper out and stuff like that.

14
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,320
But anyway, I was listening to that.

15
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,900
And it was funny, like the first half hour, they're talking about calendars, and oh, my

16
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,480
goodness, the presumptions and the, what, you know, which, oh, this one's, this Hebrew

17
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,100
calendar is really, yeah, because it's 13 lunar months.

18
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,740
You're always like, oh, my goodness, oh, my goodness, and hey, I'm not going to contact

19
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,140
them.

20
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,860
No, if you guys want to contact them, you know, whoever's, thinks they got hot pants

21
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:30,000
on for timekeeping, I would suggest you go and contact them and lay it out for them if

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,400
you can.

23
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,200
Because let me tell you, man, YouTube, I call it you, you know, when people want to change

24
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,420
a water pump or something, or want to learn how to do dovetail joints, they go to YouTube

25
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,020
University.

26
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:46,060
And one guy, one time on a call, Greek man, I can't find this YouTube University online.

27
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,980
I said, Oh, no, no, no, that's what I call it.

28
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,780
In other words, when you want to learn how to do something, like physical or whatever,

29
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:58,760
you know, in terms of like real basic rudimentary based stuff, I call it go to YouTube, watch

30
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,440
YouTube video, call it YouTube University.

31
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,100
Right?

32
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:05,020
Like I saw a guy the other day, which I thought was perfectly acceptable, teaching you how

33
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,680
to play a keyboard.

34
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,700
He says, Listen, if you can learn four chords, I can teach you to play about 500 songs.

35
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:11,920
Sure.

36
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:12,820
Yeah, pop music.

37
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:13,140
Yeah.

38
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,880
And I said, Okay, fair enough.

39
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,460
And then I took a little look, you look at his demonstration.

40
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,700
I said, Yeah, that's about right.

41
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:24,020
Because there's common elements to commonly known songs.

42
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,640
Again, you know, if you want to learn how to change a pipe in your sink, if you want

43
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,460
to learn how to change the oil in your car, if you want to learn a little bit about maybe

44
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:37,220
how to work with some wood or whatever, you may find different qualities of individuals

45
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,560
on there, but plenty of how to's.

46
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,540
Yeah, yeah.

47
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,000
Yeah.

48
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:45,100
I'll tell you the only thing like being completely forthright.

49
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,100
I'm kind of glad archaics came around Jason Breshears.

50
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,300
Because I don't subscribe to him.

51
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,600
I mean, literally, I've never I don't subscribe.

52
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,760
I haven't subscribed to his channel, or I endorse what he says.

53
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,740
But he's a breath of fresh air, because he's reasonably intelligent.

54
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:03,460
And he actually cites, let me just put it this way, for years, like when I was started

55
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:09,400
on Revolution Radio speaking publicly in Santos Bonacci back in 2010, 2011, and all that my

56
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,100
whole thing was, look, if you want a new idea, read an old book, you got to go back to stuff

57
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,140
from before 1920 and 1800s is fine.

58
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:21,440
You don't have to go back before, because they did in the 1800s, they did so many anthologies

59
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,520
and all the ancient writs.

60
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,980
If you're reading something about, let's say, the book of the Egyptian Book of the Dead

61
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:32,220
that was written in the 1800s, it's good, trust me, it's fine, it's trustworthy, right?

62
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,480
But if you read something about the Egyptian Book of the Dead, published 1920s and later,

63
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,420
no good, no good, right?

64
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,240
So he's always hearkening back to the old stuff.

65
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:49,360
But the rest, I don't know, and I got to tip my hat, because he gave me something I didn't

66
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,060
have, which was the 138-year cycle, which is contemplative.

67
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,820
I don't see diehard proof of the 138-year period.

68
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,800
I think he's reading into it more than he's reading out of it, you know what I mean?

69
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,720
And that was Santos on that, huh?

70
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,620
Because I used to speak with him a bit.

71
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,480
This was Jason of Archaic, that's my critique, and I'm glad he came around.

72
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,860
Santos is too airy-fairy for me.

73
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,519
Yeah, that's why I was surprised.

74
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,320
Yeah, he was intrigued, you know, because we were on American Freedom Radio, I used to

75
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,700
call in American Freedom Radio all the time, and Danny says, you need to get a show here.

76
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,880
This was back in 2010, and I was calling Vinnie Eastwood all the time.

77
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,380
And I said, no, no, no, stuff I have to say, it's not time yet.

78
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:37,220
People are too excited, you know, it's too free, they're not, they have no, I don't see

79
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,480
enough evidence of people looking back far enough to understand what the hell I'm going

80
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:40,820
to say.

81
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,640
Everything is too new.

82
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:48,620
I want other people to crack the ice, you know, about going back to old books and stuff.

83
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,700
I don't want to be the one to break the ice on stuff.

84
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:55,080
But not until we did the ONG, I said, okay, it's time to start breaking the ice.

85
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,680
Or trailblazing.

86
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,720
Because it ain't happening, you know?

87
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,360
It was, we started 2015-16 on the Pope's work schedule, something like that, 2015.

88
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,460
Yeah, I think it was 2015, the first ones.

89
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:11,460
You know what's interesting is that a bunch of people that I'm not sure ever heard you,

90
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,020
I hear little bits and pieces of things that were lifted from some of those on occasion.

91
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:24,160
Just in passing, you know, and it just, it catches my attention because I realize how

92
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,000
different that was at the time.

93
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,880
But over the years, I've noticed a couple of people, it's like, wait a minute, that sounds

94
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,220
really familiar.

95
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,380
And yeah.

96
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,780
You mean like Greek speak?

97
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,080
Yeah, like Greek speak.

98
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,620
Oh, like, this thing about the books.

99
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,060
Oh, yeah, yeah.

100
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:45,280
It started, because at the time when I was yelling about it, and timekeeping and how

101
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,820
the human body works and stuff, people were like, huh, what?

102
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,160
And so I said, no, no, no, I need, I'm not the type of person to break the ice on this

103
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,380
or be the first one, you know?

104
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,520
I'm not going to pop anyone's intellectual cherry, so to speak.

105
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,340
I'm not into that.

106
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,780
Virgins are boring, by the way.

107
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,080
So anyway, yeah, yeah.

108
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,920
So anyway, I just wanted to put that out.

109
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,460
And you know, I've been saying, look, I've run into people.

110
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,440
Yeah, well, fair enough.

111
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,200
I want to bring up something from the chat, because you just mentioned this 138 year time

112
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,100
period.

113
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,320
And I noticed in the chat that somebody had asked about these time periods, which you

114
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,560
mentioned in a previous Sonic.

115
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,900
I think it was the 30, 40, and, wait a minute, no, no, no, 120.

116
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,160
Yeah, 70.

117
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,560
But the big ones are 20, 40, 70, and 120.

118
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,980
And they're close enough.

119
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,700
Like, if you look at, for example, the biblical chronology of 70 years in Babylon, it was

120
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,400
really 71.

121
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:52,040
And if you count the entire thing with the getting to Babylon and getting out, it was

122
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,580
closer to 73, 74.

123
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,640
So that's how the chronologies work, you know?

124
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,200
But it's not like the moon landings.

125
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,380
Remember, Bush says we're going to be going to the moon in 2014.

126
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,540
He said that in 2000.

127
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,340
And then in 2014, so we'll be going by 2022.

128
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,660
And now they're saying they're going to go by 20.

129
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,280
You see what I mean?

130
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,840
It's not like that.

131
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:15,940
We're talking about stuff that is mentioned to happen and then when it actually happens.

132
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,600
Well, it's interesting to me because, look, 40 years is like a full generation having

133
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,300
come and gone.

134
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,500
You know, 70 years, you have that cleansing, that time for perspective.

135
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,600
Psychologically, I look at this.

136
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:35,120
And 120 years, you're completely removed from what came before, right?

137
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,640
Well, I think you could do it today.

138
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,900
You can do it in two weeks.

139
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:39,680
No.

140
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,340
Well, see now.

141
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,060
It's not 120.

142
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,680
I mean, not two weeks, but two years.

143
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,940
Well, things disappear.

144
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,060
11, 20 years.

145
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:45,620
Yeah.

146
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:50,780
I mean, see, that's the thing is that I've noted an acceleration, but the natural flow

147
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:55,300
of things seems to be more like this, where over the course of a lifetime, you have people's

148
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,400
memories that shift.

149
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,240
Now, like you said, nowadays, yeah, it happens faster.

150
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,500
You kind of stole my punchline because I was going to say that, you know, that requires

151
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:09,140
people to have an attention span and to retain knowledge, which is almost unheard of anymore.

152
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:09,520
Yeah.

153
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,520
If we, okay, this is how I look at it.

154
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,060
This is my kind of from the Victor Schauberger point of view, trees and rocks.

155
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:22,240
You know, people call rocks inanimate or whatever, but, you know, it's not fair because I'm suggesting

156
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,020
that rocks have one thought for a few seconds every few thousand years or a thousand years.

157
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,160
So the rock has a five-second thought.

158
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,120
I'd like to be closer to that rock right there.

159
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:32,919
She's real pretty.

160
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:36,980
And a thousand years later, he has another thought, oh, what happened to that rock?

161
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:37,919
Right?

162
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:38,720
Right?

163
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,720
So, okay.

164
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,840
So that's one way of time.

165
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,980
And then trees are the other.

166
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:48,480
If you want to know really how the generations in terms of the earth is concerned, look at

167
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,520
how long it takes for forests to grow.

168
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,260
I'm not talking just trees, but a forest, which is a community of trees, let's say.

169
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:58,360
And then you have these aspens, which they look like a forest, but it's really one organism.

170
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,420
They're all connected, right?

171
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,660
So just like society becomes all connected.

172
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,200
So in the sense of 120 years for a tree, well, it's not very long, is it?

173
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,800
You know, no, not very long.

174
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,680
And again, you have various things that interact.

175
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,340
And by the way, I don't think it's just the one kind of forest that's like that.

176
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,400
I think all forests sort of interact in that way, but some of them are more cohesive than

177
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,220
others because they're all interdependent.

178
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:23,900
Even the animals.

179
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,460
They need shade.

180
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:29,960
Some trees, trees that need shade have to grow near trees that are taller.

181
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:34,800
Well, even their death, the death of the animal, when the animal dies, decays, and some of

182
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:41,100
it sinks into the earth, that literally does put a nutrient in the soil that allows other

183
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,840
things to grow.

184
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,440
So, you know, sort of sinks into the soil.

185
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,400
You haven't been around dead animals.

186
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,040
They get eaten up or picked up by others before it sinks into the soil.

187
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:51,960
But I got you, though.

188
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:52,680
That's a good point.

189
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,300
But eventually some part of it does.

190
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,100
Yeah.

191
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:55,780
Yeah.

192
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,440
It's more processed.

193
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,520
It's not as direct.

194
00:09:59,020 --> 00:09:59,360
But yeah.

195
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:04,320
No, I mean, well, even soaking the soil with blood, which typically happens if something

196
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,180
is attacked and actually taken down, right?

197
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,300
If it's being...

198
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:07,500
It's a symbol.

199
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,160
It's definitely a symbol.

200
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,300
Well, more than a symbol, though, because doesn't it literally feed the ground a bit?

201
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,440
Not really.

202
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:14,980
No?

203
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:15,580
No.

204
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,360
Okay.

205
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,060
Misconception on my part.

206
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:23,560
But back to this 40-70-120, what does that, you know, some people start going into it

207
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,580
and you get the, like you said, airy-fairy with Santos there.

208
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,620
And I like Santos.

209
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,580
He's not a bad guy.

210
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:28,980
Oh, no.

211
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,300
He's not.

212
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,060
He's not.

213
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,760
He's actually...

214
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,880
It'd be a lot of fun to tell him to bring his guitar, hang out.

215
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,320
Absolutely.

216
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,240
So you have a blast.

217
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:36,800
Yeah.

218
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:37,880
Absolutely.

219
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,960
But some people might go, well, those are frequencies.

220
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:44,620
And I'm like, no, they're not frequencies, but...

221
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,460
They're vibrations.

222
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,240
Yeah.

223
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,600
You know, but here's the thing with Santos and Jason.

224
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,400
He's taking advantage of ignorant people.

225
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:58,340
In other words, from two points of view, if you read the comments section, oh, my gosh.

226
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,660
Oh, my gosh.

227
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,480
These people are...

228
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:01,740
Anyway.

229
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,060
What I mean taking advantage of ignorant people is he makes a lot of mistakes.

230
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,560
So do everyone that makes mistakes.

231
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,220
But some of them are big.

232
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:16,040
And I'm not being light and fair here because, sorry, you're going to have to know Greek

233
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,820
speak to see the mistakes.

234
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:25,380
Because no one really looks there where I've looked, you know, and usually in most cases.

235
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,800
So I look at the comments.

236
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,160
So let's say, for example, you know, you'll have a thing with 400 comments and I go through

237
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,620
most of them, if not all of them.

238
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,660
We'll get into speed reading one day.

239
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,580
You know, you actually look at something and then look away and see if you could read it

240
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,560
while you're looking away, like you're taking a picture of it.

241
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,700
You know, that's another form of speed reading.

242
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,800
So anyway, I look at all these comments and I'm like, wow, okay, no one here brought up

243
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,360
timekeeping.

244
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,380
No one here brought up this part of this.

245
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,320
No one brought up that.

246
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,240
There's 400 people commenting and no one picked it up.

247
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:54,600
Wow.

248
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,480
You know?

249
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:01,660
So, you know, what was one of my mottos for a while has been, why bother?

250
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,140
I mean, but they mean well.

251
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,040
Here's the, you know, intent.

252
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,020
If you pick up on someone's intent, right, like people don't like attorneys even though

253
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:17,440
they don't understand the legal system because it's not because of anything other that they

254
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,560
know the intent of the attorney is to cheat and lie.

255
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,840
Even the attorney doesn't even know that.

256
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,360
He's just in that culture.

257
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,460
It's part of his culture.

258
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,760
He doesn't even know, most of them don't know that they're doing it.

259
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:34,280
So, people don't like attorneys and now doctors specifically because they don't know anything

260
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,580
about what they're doing, but they know that they're going to cheat and lie.

261
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:40,000
So, these guys that we mentioned are not like that.

262
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,460
Their intent is good.

263
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:50,160
But at the same time, if the people don't know, it grows and grows, you know, and it

264
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,740
becomes a certain cult, as I should say, kind of thing, cult of personality.

265
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:02,720
So, and this is not to mention any more names like Cliff High or someone like that.

266
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,600
You wouldn't believe like every few months, oh, Greek, you got to go listen to Cliff High.

267
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:11,400
I said, okay, Cliff High, all right, he means well.

268
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,940
Actually, he means very well.

269
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,820
He doesn't have to be doing what he's doing.

270
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,840
A lot of people might have heard of him.

271
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:22,100
He's a perfect example of someone who sounds smart and is not, right?

272
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,740
And someone, if you're making hardcore predictions with dates and they don't come true, you only

273
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,860
get one or two chances.

274
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:32,280
This guy who's making predictions every six months with dates and everything for like

275
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,880
the past five years and nothing ever comes through, ever, and he still has a growing

276
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,240
following.

277
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,500
So, is he doing anything wrong?

278
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:40,480
No.

279
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:46,040
Actually, it's kind of like when Fox, some businessmen try to sue Fox News back in the

280
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,640
day and went to court and they dismissed the case because they said you can't sue Fox News

281
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,120
for libel because they're entertainment.

282
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:52,080
Yeah, right.

283
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:52,440
You know.

284
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:53,720
Right.

285
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,700
Which, yeah, they're currently going through a lawsuit, too, and I'm waiting for that to

286
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,240
come out again.

287
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:58,980
Yeah.

288
00:13:58,980 --> 00:13:59,760
It's all entertainment.

289
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,540
So, this is all entertainment at the end of the day.

290
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,480
At the end of the day, if you're listening to these guys and it's more fun than being

291
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,500
with whoever you're usually with or your job or job, you know the difference between a job

292
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,000
and a job?

293
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:14,600
Okay.

294
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,100
Go ahead.

295
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:20,540
So, a job is usually, you know, you do an application, which is you do a pledging, begging

296
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:20,900
form.

297
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,600
To apply means to beg, by the way, to plead.

298
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:33,620
And they pay you a usually prevailing wage of some kind with some kind of ancillary compensation

299
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,600
they call benefits.

300
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:40,160
And by the way, if you know anyone that works in the military for a career military or airman

301
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,520
job, like I said, how's your job?

302
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,320
Oh, I love it.

303
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,280
It's got a lot of bennies.

304
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,220
They call it the bennies.

305
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:44,760
Yeah, right.

306
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:45,460
Yeah.

307
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,800
So, I'm like, oh my gosh.

308
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,520
When I hear that, that's like, you know, borderline, this person's an NPC.

309
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,580
But anyway, that's a job.

310
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:57,460
You know, they file, you have to file a return to the revenue department.

311
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,940
You notice I didn't say pay taxes?

312
00:14:59,180 --> 00:14:59,440
Right.

313
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,160
Right?

314
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,880
Because I don't know anyone who's ever paid any taxes.

315
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,540
I've never met anyone or really heard.

316
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,720
People say they do.

317
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,680
So, when people say they do something and they're really not, what do you call them?

318
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,020
Crazy.

319
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:13,140
Crazy?

320
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,160
Anyway.

321
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,480
So, okay.

322
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:21,300
So, you file with the revenue department, you know, return, right, because you're using

323
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:21,940
private credit.

324
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,340
You can't just go and rent a chainsaw and bring it back and wave goodbye and say there's

325
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,740
no law that I have to pay you.

326
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,440
That's going to cause a lot of trouble.

327
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,120
You're using private credit.

328
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,760
So, you have to tell them how much of the private credit you use and you have to give them a

329
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,700
cutback, a kickback.

330
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:37,800
That's all it is.

331
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,280
And if you don't do it, you get in big trouble.

332
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,860
This happens with the mob also, by the way, guys.

333
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,800
It happens with any organization, legal or not.

334
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:49,500
I had a hard time trying to explain that to somebody recently where I was like, look, what

335
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:57,000
it's really about is you can do whatever you want as long as you operate and you pay the

336
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,440
person who...

337
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,020
Or return.

338
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:58,800
Yeah.

339
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:05,020
You pay, the term I use, but what you're doing is you're giving them a cut.

340
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:05,860
Right.

341
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:06,540
Of what you're doing.

342
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:12,220
They do this all the time when you go to a cherry or apple picking thing, co-op, you

343
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:16,020
pick apples, you have to give so much back and you keep a certain amount.

344
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,000
You know?

345
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,460
So, okay.

346
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:19,980
That's...

347
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,260
Okay.

348
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,040
So, anyway, that's a job.

349
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,400
You know, the basic stuff.

350
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,440
You get retirement pension.

351
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:24,920
Okay.

352
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:25,600
Okay.

353
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,780
A yob, like I got a yob, man.

354
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,740
A yob is there's no application.

355
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,520
There's no return.

356
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,260
Usually, you get paid with bank notes, Federal Reserve notes or some kind of barter.

357
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,580
There's no retirement.

358
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:40,960
Anyway.

359
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,220
Anyway, it's a bad joke.

360
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,260
Anyway.

361
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,040
I got you.

362
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,040
It's not racist or ethnic, but it's a yob, man.

363
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,720
I got a yob.

364
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,020
Okay?

365
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:48,820
I totally understand.

366
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,220
That's the difference between a yob and a job.

367
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,100
I've had both.

368
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:51,880
Okay.

369
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:52,540
By the way.

370
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,780
But, yeah, go ahead.

371
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,580
I've had both.

372
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,440
But, yeah, go ahead.

373
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,440
Yeah.

374
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,000
All right.

375
00:16:59,060 --> 00:16:59,980
So, that's basically...

376
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,380
We drifted away from this and that.

377
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,000
And I just wanted to say that, yeah, the internet is funny.

378
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:06,400
I do like YouTube University.

379
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,339
We also spoke just briefly before you hit the red button or record about debating.

380
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,020
Yes.

381
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,859
And I wanted to bring this up because I've always been challenged, not recently because

382
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:18,599
I try to keep to myself now as much as possible.

383
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:24,380
The academics used to want to debate me and I used to tell the academics and say, okay,

384
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,560
you just got professorship and you want to debate me on the medical stuff.

385
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:30,400
Okay.

386
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,160
You're going to need to go and find your professor and his professor, if he's still

387
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,140
alive, all the whole department, the physics department, hydrology department and chemistry

388
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,200
department, the entire department, all of the authors, if they're still alive, of all

389
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,320
the books you've ever read on all of these subjects and you're still going to lose.

390
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:54,740
And that was like, I didn't mean that to be an intimidation tactic to them, but they got

391
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,260
intimidated.

392
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,040
They said, oh, no, I won't debate you then.

393
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,960
They actually believed what I said and I wasn't joking, by the way.

394
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:06,500
Another time I went and someone wanted to debate me, a similar subject was on physics.

395
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:12,860
I said, okay, someone was there with their daughter, with me, had their 12-year-old daughter.

396
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,600
I said, I'm not going to debate you on physics.

397
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,620
I need 20 minutes because I'm going to coach her.

398
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,380
She knows nothing on the subject for 20 minutes.

399
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,000
She's going to debate you and you're still going to lose.

400
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:25,100
And this was like a master's degree, whatever, physics person.

401
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:35,600
So, this is the problem with debating and why am I so confident about that confidence?

402
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,320
And I can prove it.

403
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,680
I can do it.

404
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,340
This is what happens in debates that's a big flaw and no one notices.

405
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:48,220
There's a saying that says, never correct your opponent when they're making mistakes.

406
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,140
Actually, it's more like, never correct your enemy when they're making mistakes.

407
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:56,700
See, I don't see anyone as an enemy, but your opponent, your adversary.

408
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,320
Never correct your adversary when they're making mistakes.

409
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,120
What do you hear, Chuck?

410
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,040
You've seen debates on various subjects, probably the one that you research.

411
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:05,680
Yeah.

412
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,040
What do they do?

413
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,000
What do they do?

414
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:08,440
Always.

415
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,360
One guy finishes and the other guy starts to correct the other guy.

416
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:12,680
Right.

417
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:17,180
That's not how you gain any ground on the battlefield at all.

418
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:23,860
And typically, by the way, before you even discussed this with me, before I pressed record,

419
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,000
I recognize that.

420
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,280
That's why people say, you should debate this.

421
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,440
I don't debate these people.

422
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,520
It is so pointless.

423
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,140
Well, you can.

424
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,200
Oh, I can.

425
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,260
But you've got to show up.

426
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:40,160
You don't show up to a knife fight with a knife, because then you're going to try to

427
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,380
prove that you're a better knife fighter and you might get cut in the process.

428
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,700
And you don't show up with a gun, you show up with a nuke.

429
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,600
So everyone within a five-mile radius is done.

430
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,820
See, because the debates are not between the two debaters.

431
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,180
It's to educate the audience.

432
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,460
It's an excellent Socratic education tool.

433
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:06,560
Even though the debates in a Socrates-type setting only last ten seconds, you see, they

434
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,680
don't go on and on and on.

435
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,740
Oh, no, I agree with you.

436
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,580
It's an excellent tool, but the execution...

437
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:20,320
That it's just exactly as you described, by the way, where it's just, oh, well, let me

438
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,760
tell you what you just said wrong.

439
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,420
That doesn't help you, and it doesn't help...

440
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,500
No, it gives me a headache.

441
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,620
It actually helps them.

442
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,340
It gives me a headache, because, yeah, I'm watching this, and yeah, I could maybe learn

443
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:38,280
something from it, possibly, but it's not effective.

444
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:44,560
I mean, you know, please read Sun Tzu, at least, before you do this.

445
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:49,900
You know, we were talking about maybe there should be a video start here for Greek-speak.

446
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:57,320
Anyone who's listened to what I call primary or fundamental Greek-speak, the basic, basic

447
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:02,480
rants that I go on, I cover timekeeping, the human body, water, a bunch of other stuff.

448
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:06,540
Okay, those simple analogies that I give on fundamental Greek-speak, like if I had

449
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:10,720
just 15 minutes to say what Greek-speak is about, that is what I use in the debates.

450
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,160
Strictly that.

451
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,540
And that's it.

452
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,480
Never address what they're saying, because how can you address what they're saying?

453
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,320
Why would you address what the opponent is saying if it's false?

454
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:27,080
You would just be... if you're looking not to correct him, because that would be a disadvantage

455
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:27,640
to you, right?

456
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,120
Remember, never correct your enemy when they're making mistakes.

457
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:38,100
So you cannot address what they're saying to correct it, and you cannot...

458
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,280
you shouldn't really repeat what they said, because then it's redundancy.

459
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,840
So you have to rise above it and give an overall perspective that a five-year-old...

460
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:54,700
I like to keep the perspective within eight-year-old comprehension, eight to twelve-year-old,

461
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,640
which is Victorian grammar school.

462
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,360
People don't know.

463
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,080
I think I've mentioned this before.

464
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:04,780
If you go study like the, quote-unquote, intellectual giants of the 19th century,

465
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,680
there was something called Victorian grammar school.

466
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,500
It was more of a formalized type of education.

467
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,560
Later on, the formal education that exists now came from Prussia.

468
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,560
But in Victorian grammar school, you went to school, basically.

469
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:20,940
You had the primer, basic, and then your schooling, which would be, let's say,

470
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:27,180
considered high school and college, would be between the years of seven and thirteen years old.

471
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:33,900
And your bachelor degree would be between, let's say, twelve and fifteen years old.

472
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,680
That's why when you look up people from the 19th century,

473
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:45,180
like this one guy was at Cambridge, right, or Oxford, and he was in this year.

474
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:50,500
Well, you go back and see when he was born and what year he's at Oxford,

475
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,000
and he's 20 years old as a professor.

476
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:58,040
He's like, wait a second, because 20 years old, I'm basically not even...

477
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,640
I have another two years to get a bachelor's degree.

478
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,840
Well, how could I... you see?

479
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,960
So you'll see evidence of people having all their education done by 15 or 16,

480
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,000
completely college... you see what I mean?

481
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:07,500
Right.

482
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,100
Back then, that's basically how it was.

483
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,740
I got off the subject.

484
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:15,040
Let's reel this back into what we wanted to talk about.

485
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:19,860
Well, I started with the time periods, and then we kind of went into debating and all that,

486
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,740
which I think you should...

487
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,260
Oh, the chat.

488
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,620
The essence of the chat is good, usually.

489
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:33,360
In this Rated Y chat, I've noticed that it's hopping enough and pertinent enough to address,

490
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:33,940
and we will.

491
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,340
I asked about what subjects to get deep and solo, or solo and deep,

492
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,940
and there are quite a few, and I think you brought up orally earlier

493
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:48,760
about the farming and the ether and all that, that Vandy brought up in the chat,

494
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,820
and that's a really big subject because we want to keep the little guys happy,

495
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,220
which are the plants, and some of them are big, too.

496
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,780
And the easiest thing, just like people...

497
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:09,640
Okay, we'll get into that on another sonic, but this is how I approach plants.

498
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,600
They're organisms, living organisms.

499
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,060
Of course.

500
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:21,940
Eating just plants is vegetarian and plant-based, but they're still a living organism.

501
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,220
Okay, I've gone over this loosely, but plants are always in a dream state.

502
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:34,840
So imagine you're in a dream, and your arm gets cut off, and you're like,

503
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,440
oh, I'm in a dream.

504
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,320
My arm got cut off.

505
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,260
Big deal, right?

506
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:37,800
Right.

507
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,580
Well, that's why you can go up to a plant and break off a leaf and eat it or whatever,

508
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,740
or get chewed up.

509
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:50,040
By the way, other than frogs, all hallucinogenics are gotten from what source?

510
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,240
Plants.

511
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:52,640
You see?

512
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,560
It's very simple.

513
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:58,300
Well, plants are the decaying plants because the mushrooms are different.

514
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:02,020
Yeah, well, mushrooms are not plants, and they're not animals.

515
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:02,780
They're something else.

516
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,520
Well, that's what I said.

517
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,200
It's different.

518
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:07,940
Yeah, just like spiders are not insects.

519
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,700
The other thing about spiders, we'll get back to plants real quick,

520
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,120
is spiders are incredible.

521
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,740
They can turn off their psyche.

522
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:21,180
In other words, there is no psychic perception of spiders.

523
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:24,420
You know you have a psychic perception if there's a bug around,

524
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,120
if you're tuned into it?

525
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,440
But a spider could crawl on your shoulder, and you won't even know it's there

526
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,880
until you see it, if it wants to hide itself psychically.

527
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:37,800
So anyway, I think David Bowie sung about the spiders on Mars at one point, didn't he?

528
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,200
Yeah, he did.

529
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:42,560
But I've taken notice of that before, that spiders are one of those things.

530
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,800
The way I've always put it is spiders are one of the creatures

531
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,240
that can really, truly sneak up on you.

532
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,060
Right, because of their psychic ability.

533
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,940
In other words, within the ether.

534
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,460
So back to plants.

535
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,020
I gave the person an analogy, and the human body is like an upside-down plant.

536
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,680
You have the limbs, which are the arms.

537
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:03,420
You have the seed, which is the ovum and the sperm.

538
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:07,100
And you have the flower, which is the genitalia.

539
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,580
And you have the root ball, which is the brain.

540
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,980
So if you turn a human upside down, stick him in the ground,

541
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,200
he basically resembles a plant.

542
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,200
Okay, so we have an ethereal flip.

543
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,420
But basically, I said you want to keep the little guys happy.

544
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,920
I have a primrose bush here.

545
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,580
It makes these little roses, and just because they're little,

546
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,420
the plant is large, the shrub is large,

547
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:36,300
and it's full of maybe 2,000 roses right now, maybe more.

548
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,380
It's a beautiful primrose.

549
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,660
They're not really roses, but they kind of resemble a rose bush.

550
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:43,940
I guess it is.

551
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:48,860
So anyway, these guys, the plants, you want to keep them happy.

552
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,720
So let's go back to the people analogy.

553
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,080
I've been giving people analogies here with the dream state

554
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,800
and the upside-down nature and this and that.

555
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,960
Okay, Chuck, we've got a group of people.

556
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:03,400
We can make them happy by internally making them feel,

557
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,900
and also giving them good food and drink, let's say.

558
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:11,720
A good party, so they're gratified, right?

559
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,460
Let's say you make people happy.

560
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,700
Or you could break out a whole bunch of drugs, get them high.

561
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,620
That's another way to make people happy, isn't it?

562
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,300
It'll work, yeah.

563
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,760
But usually when you have good food and drink and gratification from that,

564
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,160
it lasts a long time, and you come off of it good.

565
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,940
What happens when you get people happy when you give them drugs?

566
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,380
Some of them come off of it not so well,

567
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,200
but everybody's going to say,

568
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,300
it was better when I was high, right?

569
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:45,120
I'm not high now, and I've got to go on with the rest of it.

570
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:45,920
Whatever.

571
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,860
Well, it's either that or you get them caught in a cycle of,

572
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,200
they continuously go back to getting high, in which case, you know.

573
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,360
Sure, and that's what's going on with plants.

574
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,260
So you live in a society,

575
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,380
and by the way, this is Greek-speak.

576
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,740
You're not going to probably have anyone else hear this.

577
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,620
I'll say this this way, very simply.

578
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:06,240
All these fertilizers, chemical or whatever,

579
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:07,820
you know what they're doing?

580
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,400
They're getting the plants high,

581
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,840
and when you get them high, they do what they do.

582
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,660
Just like if you got a crowd, and you got them high,

583
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,160
and you put on some music, they're all going to want to jump up and dance,

584
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,620
take their clothes off, whatever, right?

585
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:21,140
So you give plants these drugs, what do they do?

586
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,260
They spurt out leaves and buds and bloom

587
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,660
and put out veg and fruit and whatever, right?

588
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,020
But they're high.

589
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,360
So it's not going to be that great.

590
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:36,040
A musician knows that if you do a session,

591
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,460
and you get really high,

592
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,040
you think you're playing the best stuff ever,

593
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,300
and you go the next day, and when you sober up,

594
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,320
listen to the recording,

595
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,260
oh, that sounds like shit.

596
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,220
I have tried so many times to explain that,

597
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,940
and I'll tell you it takes so many times.

598
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,980
I was a musician for a while,

599
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,140
and I can't tell you how many times I've had to have that conversation

600
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:00,380
where it's like, I realize you're enjoying playing

601
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,340
when you're high.

602
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,420
And you think that you're doing a great set,

603
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,720
or it came out really, you played it really well this time.

604
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,780
Yeah, because you think it's great,

605
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,560
because it sounds great to you.

606
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,840
Make sure you're recording it, though.

607
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:14,520
Yeah, right, because when I listen back,

608
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,120
I go, ooh.

609
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:16,740
That was really bad.

610
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,440
This is exactly what's going on.

611
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,200
So when you get a fruit or a veg from plants

612
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,820
that grew that while they were high,

613
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,280
it might look good, but it has no flavor,

614
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,580
no taste, and no nutrition.

615
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,540
I'm giving this analogy

616
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,060
because what I'm trying to do is pair up our existence

617
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,060
with everything that exists around us, right?

618
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,600
And this pairing, what it does is

619
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,300
it allows one to understand the flow

620
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,340
of when to give, when not to give,

621
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,780
what to do, what not to do,

622
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,000
instead of, oh, I read it somewhere,

623
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,140
and I think this might work.

624
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,220
So we'll get into that.

625
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,120
But essentially, I did give an answer there

626
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,900
that most of the vegetative layer

627
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,880
is slightly below the earth and slightly above the earth.

628
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,000
That's where you want to make ethereal adjustments.

629
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,280
And I'll have to think about that a little more

630
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,140
because on the solo sonics,

631
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,000
I think I'm going to go really, really deep

632
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,200
and give a lot of information.

633
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,060
So I'm going to need an outline for that.

634
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,600
So all that stuff's being worked on.

635
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:12,400
Fair enough.

636
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,180
But also that brings us to water

637
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,160
and the subject that we neglected

638
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,720
in the last sonic, which is hygiene.

639
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,140
But no one knows we neglected it

640
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,520
because we never even brought it up on the sonics.

641
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,460
I thought we brought it up for a moment

642
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,640
and then just spun away.

643
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,680
I think in the end, yeah, cutting it off.

644
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,780
So the water, which one should do first?

645
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,120
They both go together because

646
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,980
to have something spiritually clean,

647
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,320
it has to be cleaned with water.

648
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,520
Are you familiar with that, even from pagan rituals?

649
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,580
Yes, practical.

650
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,700
I was just going to say, in a very practical way,

651
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:48,080
there is nothing that gets cleaned either.

652
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,800
And again, think about the practices.

653
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,520
All right, I'm going to bring up something really bad here,

654
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,800
but even the idea where they do the baptisms, right?

655
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,860
There is water involved.

656
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,940
Anytime you're cleaning, resetting,

657
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,840
anytime you're transferring energy,

658
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,760
all of these processes involve water.

659
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,640
Now, somebody might say, well, obviously,

660
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,420
because you're on planet Earth, dummy,

661
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,360
and the majority of what happens on this planet

662
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,180
is dictated to by water.

663
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,600
Water is a part of everything that occurs, right?

664
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,860
Right, but from a spiritual point of view,

665
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,760
it's not chemical.

666
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:23,980
Like, give an example.

667
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,420
You can have something that's deemed unclean

668
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:32,500
and then have it cleaned just by washing it, right?

669
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:32,640
Right.

670
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,540
But if you were to scan it with all the men's materialistic stuff,

671
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,860
you won't find anything unclean.

672
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,020
It's just a spiritual, it's part of a process

673
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,080
because the memory of the thing,

674
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,000
I think it's like synesthesia or being synesthetic,

675
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,820
like certain people, I don't think it's the correct term.

676
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,260
This is where you can have sex.

677
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,240
If you give an axe to someone that was very psychic

678
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,820
and that axe was used to kill someone,

679
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,940
they'll pick up on that, where an average person won't.

680
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:01,740
Yeah, I have experienced that with metallic objects myself,

681
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,320
but only metallic objects.

682
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:04,620
Sure.

683
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:07,400
So I want to get into the more important part

684
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,000
because, you know, I always say if you're giving,

685
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,360
got something important to say and your battery's low,

686
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,220
just get the important part out

687
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,460
so when the battery dies, at least you got, right?

688
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:15,760
You see?

689
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:16,140
Yeah.

690
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:21,380
So, water, okay.

691
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,840
I think on the page you have the water thing

692
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,100
that we did a few years ago, quite a few years ago now,

693
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:27,860
more than a few.

694
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,840
I added that to the playlist, yeah, I did.

695
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,360
Okay, so I think I remember what we spoke about there.

696
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,940
So all that holds true.

697
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,420
But what I've been working on lately,

698
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:40,680
and if anyone is familiar with Ken Wheeler's talk on magnetism,

699
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,760
and if you're familiar, not just glossed by,

700
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,440
when I say the inertial plane or the block wall of a magnet,

701
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,020
okay, what is that?

702
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,980
Okay, so if you look up in standard, you know,

703
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,600
the guys who are major league bullshitters,

704
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,900
you know, the academics.

705
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:00,400
Right.

706
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,520
Even if you go to their diagrams, everything's incorrect,

707
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,280
but they do, if you put in block wall in a search,

708
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:12,020
B-L-O-C-H, it's with an H instead of a K for block,

709
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,660
you're going to see a line going through between the poles

710
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,300
along the body of the magnet.

711
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,800
When I mean the body of the magnet, typically,

712
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,420
now a lot of refrigerator magnets and magnetic tape

713
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,380
are not magnetized this way, but your basic,

714
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,780
except for horseshoe magnets on the left and right,

715
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,480
but your basic magnet, you'll notice one side,

716
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,040
it can be marked north pole, right,

717
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,320
counterclockwise, and the other side is south pole,

718
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,080
if you look at it.

719
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,760
It's still counterclockwise, but because you flipped it over,

720
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,040
it looks clockwise, right?

721
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:42,560
Okay.

722
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,300
There's no pole, just a vortex going through,

723
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,420
just like if you work at a hardware store,

724
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,100
you know that all your screws or most of them

725
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:53,240
are right-hand threaded, but you have a drawer somewhere

726
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,040
for what?

727
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:54,780
Left-handed.

728
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,860
L-H, left-hand threaded, so, you know,

729
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,700
you try to screw it in, it goes the other way, right?

730
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:03,180
Okay, so it's kind of, that's what happens when you put

731
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,800
like poles with like poles, okay.

732
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,000
So let's say you take a ring magnet or a bar magnet

733
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,860
or something, so let's say the north pole,

734
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,420
which is going towards the south, right,

735
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,520
attracted really, if you use a compass,

736
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,480
we're not going to get into how to determine

737
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,199
north and south pole, it doesn't matter,

738
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,840
but I'm just saying you paint, usually you paint

739
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:25,639
the north pole red on a magnet and white on the south pole,

740
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:27,320
that's the typical nomenclature.

741
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,000
Okay, so when you paint those two faces,

742
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,780
or you determine the two faces where the poles are,

743
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:36,460
what are called poles, that block wall is equidistant

744
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:40,040
between the two poles along the body of the magnet, okay.

745
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,340
All right, so I want to jump over to another notion.

746
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:48,179
You could look up fuel magnetizers or water magnetizers

747
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:53,400
and you're going to see thousands if not millions

748
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,400
of images of people selling you magnets

749
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,000
to strap onto your fuel line for better gas mileage

750
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,580
or strap onto your water pipes to reduce scale

751
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,960
and other things like that, right.

752
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,380
They're all wrong.

753
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:07,760
What they're doing is they're taking the two magnets,

754
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,580
two separate magnets, and sandwiching them pole to pole

755
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:16,720
over a tube or a pipe for fuel or water, okay.

756
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,220
And to add insult to injury, there are websites

757
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:23,320
that have had debates, oh, should we put two like poles,

758
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,600
you know, the poles that push away,

759
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,040
give the appearance of pushing away,

760
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,560
or the ones that attract.

761
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,140
There's a big debate on that.

762
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:31,440
They're both wrong because you shouldn't be doing that anyway

763
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:35,180
for this treatment of water because we're still speaking

764
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:38,760
on water even though this is a magnetic treatment of water.

765
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,940
So what you would like to have done is have the water flow

766
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,620
because this is not for static water.

767
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:49,160
Most of it, 99% of it is for flowing water,

768
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,880
is when you have a conduit of water, a tube,

769
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:55,600
a pipe or something, in this case it would be better

770
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,460
if it were flexible.

771
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,340
You want, yes, you do want this,

772
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,960
and you need to have the water pipe or the conduit wrap

773
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,020
around the block wall of the magnet

774
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:09,200
and avoid the poles as much as possible.

775
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,420
Now this is very unintuitive because if you show someone

776
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:17,020
a magnet, it sticks to the refrigerator really, you know,

777
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,760
let's say it's a good strong magnet, ring magnet,

778
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,440
square magnet, bar magnet, boom, it sticks on the fridge,

779
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,200
oh, it's a really strong magnet, flip it around, boom,

780
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,300
it sticks to the fridge, okay, it's a really strong magnet.

781
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,640
But now try the block wall against the fridge,

782
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,700
eh, it doesn't stick at all.

783
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,020
So if we're going to magnetize water, we've got to put it,

784
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,440
put the part of the magnet that's really strong

785
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,480
against the water, right?

786
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,540
This is the mentality.

787
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,000
This is typical human thinking, you see?

788
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,900
Well, obviously you've got to apply force to make a change.

789
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,040
So you're thinking to yourself,

790
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,600
this is what gives the appearance of force.

791
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,240
Yeah, exactly.

792
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,060
So, yeah, that's why, you know, your starter toolkit

793
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:55,540
is just three hammers, large, medium, and small,

794
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,280
for everything, right?

795
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:04,220
Anyway, yeah, so, okay, so this is the human,

796
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,580
everyone's stuck on this, everyone's stuck on this.

797
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:08,700
So you want the water, and you need to have the water

798
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,220
running along the block wall.

799
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:15,100
Okay, and you want to increase the area to that block wall,

800
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,580
so it's good to have two like magnets stacked on each other

801
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,940
as they normally would stick, and it gives you a little more

802
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,720
area along that block wall, and it also sets the poles apart.

803
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,360
A little more talk about magnets.

804
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,000
Another thing people are distracted about,

805
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,520
if anyone says, oh, these hard drive magnets,

806
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:34,760
these neomagnets, you know, number 52, 48, whatever,

807
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:37,960
oh, they've got these really strong neomagnets, right?

808
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,740
Wrong, you don't want to use a neomagnet.

809
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,340
You want to use an iron ferrite or strontium, you know,

810
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,120
the basic barium strontium, iron ferrite,

811
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,040
cheap speaker magnets or whatever, you know,

812
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:51,240
the black colored ones, not the shiny neos.

813
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,860
Why? Well, it's Greek.

814
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,920
The neomagnets are really strong.

815
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:55,920
The other ones are junk.

816
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,800
I'm like, well, okay.

817
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,980
When you make a magnet really strong like that,

818
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,720
it has a very high magnetic density,

819
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:06,500
and that field wraps around into the block wall,

820
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,600
and it's much smaller of a field.

821
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,500
Yes, it's a stronger field.

822
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:14,300
Yes, I'm not going to say that it's not good because it's weak.

823
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,700
It's not good because it's too strong.

824
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,360
As you increase the magnetism of the object,

825
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,560
the field gets denser and denser and denser.

826
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,300
That's what you're really measuring, more density,

827
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,500
and it ends up wrapping around the block wall,

828
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,800
the area where you want to affect your fluids,

829
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,100
and it doesn't give you a lot of room,

830
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:37,900
where the magnet that doesn't appear to have such a high density,

831
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,880
and it's like the regular magnet, let's say,

832
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:44,100
that works much better because there's more room for the block wall

833
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:49,560
to adjust and affect whatever liquid that's going to be passing by it.

834
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,980
So the neomagnets don't work. I've tried them.

835
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:54,840
So the vortex itself has a greater amount of space,

836
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,380
even though it's less intense.

837
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,620
Is that about the way to put it?

838
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:03,060
Yes, like on a neomagnet, the vortex is more upright and skinny,

839
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,160
like a skinny tornado,

840
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:10,060
and the vortex on a regular magnet, a ferrite magnet,

841
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:13,040
is really wide, almost like an upside-down pyramid.

842
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,220
Okay, so you need that clearance.

843
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,700
Well, thinking of a tornado, you're talking about the difference

844
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,920
between the type of tornado that wrecks a whole town,

845
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:24,220
but does it pretty slowly and does a lot of damage?

846
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,740
No, in terms of shape, because the neomagnets will wreck a whole town.

847
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:33,200
If you have a four-inch by four-inch by one-inch-thick neomagnet,

848
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,600
and you walk by something in your hand,

849
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:38,560
and something, iron or steel, about a foot away,

850
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,640
it will tear your hand off.

851
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:43,000
It will crush your hand, and you might have to have it removed.

852
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,580
Even doing pressure and wrapping,

853
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,400
biological vacuum goes out the window at this point,

854
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,620
because it will shatter everything.

855
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:50,500
Right?

856
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:50,860
Wow.

857
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,380
Yeah, no, it's pretty strong, yeah.

858
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,960
But the thing is, we're not looking for the strength.

859
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:55,860
Right.

860
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,380
We're looking for the block wall.

861
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,040
So there are ways to accentuate the block wall.

862
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:03,920
Okay, so I've been experimenting this for a while and developing it.

863
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,760
I started this a few years ago, and recently, the past few months,

864
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:10,400
I've developed it to the point where I can now talk about it with confidence

865
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,400
that it will work for anyone and everyone, anywhere.

866
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,480
And I'll give you an example.

867
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,900
I'm in Tucson, near Tucson, Arizona, or in the middle of Tucson, Arizona,

868
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,360
on Tucson, not in Tucson.

869
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,200
I'm not dead yet.

870
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:21,940
Right, okay.

871
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,820
And we have scaled water here.

872
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,360
In other words, you take a shower with clear glass doors, and it leaves a fog.

873
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:34,080
When it dries, if you wash the car, it ends up leaving this white scale on the car.

874
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:38,640
If you have a top-loading or a washing machine,

875
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:42,200
have one of these newer very deep drum washing machines

876
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,040
with a highly polished stainless steel drum,

877
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:49,200
the clothesline usually where the clothes are usually agitated is really highly polished,

878
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:53,520
but everything above that has like a powdery white finish that's stuck on there

879
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,400
that you really have to use acid to get it off.

880
00:40:55,540 --> 00:41:00,360
Okay, the toilet bowl will develop a very strong calcium ring where the water level is.

881
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,880
Okay, I don't have any of that.

882
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,580
I used to, to a certain point.

883
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:08,980
What I did was I used these large 3- and 4-inch magnets, and I stacked them.

884
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,740
Two of them, they're half-inch thick, so I stacked them so they're an inch thick.

885
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,200
And I got a flexible tube, a flexible connector.

886
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,020
If you go to a hardware store or whatever, it looks like a hose,

887
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:22,780
but it has a stainless steel braid over it usually to prevent mechanical damage.

888
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,500
The thing is if you use the one with the stainless steel braid,

889
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:28,200
you must make sure the magnets don't stick to the stainless steel,

890
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,280
that it's a non-magnetic.

891
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:35,560
It's a martensistic stainless steel, which is a fancy way.

892
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,640
He's the guy that came up with stainless steel that was non-magnetic.

893
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,040
So martensistic, anyway, one of those words.

894
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,660
So what I did was I did it around, the easiest thing is a garden hose,

895
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,880
but you need to put a spring or a wire around it because you shouldn't have it kinking.

896
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:55,740
What I do is I wind a piece of stainless steel that fits inside the hose.

897
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,100
It looks like a spring, and I slide it in there,

898
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:02,800
and when you bend the coil or coil the hose around the magnet, it won't kink.

899
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,440
It'll be even.

900
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:04,760
Usually you see this.

901
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,780
It's called a tension relief on hoses, something that looks like a spring

902
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:09,760
where you connect the hose.

903
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:13,120
But I do this on the inside with stainless, which, again, is non-magnetic.

904
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,280
All right, so I've been experimenting with this,

905
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:21,420
and recently I discovered that you put a center magnet and three magnets total,

906
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,380
one on the outside, one on the inside, stacked, just a stack of magnets.

907
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:29,980
They're slightly smaller as they get further away, kind of stretch out that block wall.

908
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:34,420
And remember, if you go to it with a piece of iron, when this is set up,

909
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,620
it won't go anywhere near where the water is running.

910
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,200
The iron won't stick where the hose is.

911
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,700
It'll only stick away from the hose.

912
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,940
It'll stick to one of the ends, which are away from the hose.

913
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:49,700
Yeah, so you're like, hey, man, I've got a nail here,

914
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:53,540
and where your hose is on the magnet, there's no magnetism there at all.

915
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,660
I'm like, yeah, exactly, that's why it works so well.

916
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:00,340
So recently, well, anyway, I've been running this for a while,

917
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:04,780
and I've noticed that there is absolutely no toilet ring at all, calcium at all.

918
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:09,460
There is no – the stainless steel tub is completely polished all the way up running.

919
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,300
We use it every day.

920
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,240
Washing the cars here is hard because you want to – as soon as you're done washing,

921
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:19,660
you want to dry it right away, otherwise you get these spots, you know,

922
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,400
like if you don't live in a place where there's hard water.

923
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:28,320
If you have a dishwasher, one of the big things about marketing soap is it doesn't leave spots, right,

924
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,620
on the glasses, right?

925
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:33,520
Okay, well, you get these spots on everything, and when they dry,

926
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:37,220
they just look like very benign water spots, but they don't rub off, you know,

927
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:42,000
because it's a hard mineral, not an argonite.

928
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,540
An argonite is when the mineral hardens, and it's a large molecule,

929
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:48,520
and it breaks off easily, very, very fine.

930
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:52,840
Okay, so also the water heater would start making noise with scale buildup.

931
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,480
Well, it comes on a gas water heater.

932
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:55,060
Now it doesn't.

933
00:43:55,260 --> 00:44:01,080
So what I found out was where is all this scale going?

934
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:05,180
It's not being deposited on any surface.

935
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,080
By the way, you use a tiny amount of soap.

936
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:09,920
The clothing is coming out much cleaner, right?

937
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:12,720
I do water processing to drink.

938
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,880
The water is much better.

939
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:18,720
It's like if I give anyone a sample of the water that I process here for drinking,

940
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:23,960
one of the comments is, it tastes like melted snow, right?

941
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,460
I thought that was really cute.

942
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:28,840
But I do remember melted snow being delicious.

943
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,880
At one time, yeah.

944
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,640
Yeah, this is before chemtrails.

945
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,000
All right, so what is the takeaway on this?

946
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:35,980
Why am I saying this?

947
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:39,720
If anyone, I think we mentioned last time, I like to see people develop more skill.

948
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,820
Many of the people I discuss about this, they kind of look at you cross-eyed

949
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:46,400
when you bring up building or making something.

950
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:51,040
And now I just ask people, I said, you might be interested in building this.

951
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:54,100
But by the way, before I get into it, do you know how to operate a screwdriver?

952
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,040
Depending on that answer is whether I continue or not.

953
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,380
So here's the thing.

954
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:02,760
This also works.

955
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:04,620
I haven't done it with the fuel treatment.

956
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,480
But I'll give you an example of what I do with that.

957
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,740
I don't talk about this much.

958
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:17,820
It's a 1998 Dodge Caravan with a Mitsubishi 3.0 six-cylinder engine.

959
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:24,940
It's supposed to get 17 miles per gallon in the city and like 21, 22, 23 on the highway,

960
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:25,800
if you're fortunate.

961
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:30,380
Well, I drive around in the city here, and I have a computer that gives me the mileage.

962
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:35,360
And I think the last route I went, I got 33.5 miles per gallon in the city.

963
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:36,140
Nice.

964
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,920
Is that with a fair amount of, like, stopping and starting?

965
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:42,080
Yeah, a fair amount of stopping.

966
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:55,680
So, in other words, if I put in 16 gallons of gas, I get 484 miles out of that on a gas tank.

967
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:56,580
So I've done it both ways.

968
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,060
It's a scan gauge.

969
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:01,320
It tells you your actual MPG, your average MPG, engine temperature, all this.

970
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:02,300
It's called a scan gauge.

971
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:04,080
You plug it into where the USB computer goes.

972
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:09,840
So it's very unusual what's going on here because it's not just – I'm doing a bunch of other things, right?

973
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:14,580
And there's actually, I think, some people that are subbed here that are familiar with what I'm talking about

974
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:18,060
because I've helped them out with their own cars on things.

975
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,500
I've made things and sent them back and forth.

976
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:22,600
Wes, you know who you are.

977
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:30,520
So I just wanted to bring up the thing about the magnets because something –

978
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:35,360
when I started seeing this working before I got to the triple one, it worked really well with the single magnet.

979
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,400
I was like, oh, how cute, how cute.

980
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:43,800
I've got a real efficient way to prevent scale from building up, right, on things,

981
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,900
which is annoyance in a place that has hard water.

982
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:48,360
Yeah, but you said before, where does it go?

983
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,540
That is a big question.

984
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:53,740
This is the history of where does it go because that's what I said, how cute.

985
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:59,960
I figured out a really efficient way by just approaching the block wall with the fluid instead of the poles

986
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:04,640
like everyone else, and it's really cute that the scale has gone away or going away.

987
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:09,320
When I did the triple magnet, it went away away, but this is the part where it got really serious.

988
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:12,220
I'm going to go back to the car part.

989
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:14,320
Well, here it's very dusty.

990
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:18,140
If you drive into Tucson, Arizona or from any other part of the world other than New Mexico,

991
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,200
it feels like you're driving into Mars.

992
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,920
It's like, you know when they show photographs of supposedly Mars,

993
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,600
everything's got a red or brownish, tannish tinge to it, right?

994
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:25,920
Oh, yeah.

995
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,200
Well, that's what you start noticing when you're driving into Tucson.

996
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:30,020
Everything's got a tannish tinge to it.

997
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:30,640
It's not ugly.

998
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,260
It just has a tannish tinge, right?

999
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:39,720
Okay, so when you have a car washed or polished and you park it out for four hours, eight hours or overnight,

1000
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:45,280
you come back and you can almost write your name on the hood from the fine dust, very fine dust.

1001
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,420
You don't really see it.

1002
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,520
It's so fine, but if you, let's say, lean on the car or move it, you know what I mean?

1003
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:54,640
Like a car may not look that dirty, but you run your finger across and then you kind of see where your finger was.

1004
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,000
Oh, it is dusty or dirty, right?

1005
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:57,400
Right.

1006
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:57,820
You don't know.

1007
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:03,100
It's fine enough so that it's not noticeable until you actually like make a clear mark away.

1008
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:04,260
Yeah, until you clear it away.

1009
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:06,240
In other words, when you look at it, oh, the car's dirty.

1010
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:06,820
It's not dirty.

1011
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,520
It's just you don't, because also because you're used to it.

1012
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:14,460
But if you run your finger along the hood or any part, now if the car is out and about

1013
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:19,260
and then you rush it into a garage and close the door and you've got a good seal on the door, yeah, probably not.

1014
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:20,980
But this is typically here.

1015
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:28,380
Okay, so this is the part that got me, got really serious and noticed that something more than just treating the scale,

1016
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:34,960
turning it into argonite crystals, which is their academic way of saying fine minerals make scale,

1017
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:41,560
but when you magnetize it or treat it with ions, the fine minerals clump together, become larger,

1018
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:43,780
and it's called argonite, and it won't bond.

1019
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,080
It breaks off very easy.

1020
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,040
Okay, I thought that was going on.

1021
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:47,780
How cute, you know?

1022
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:48,420
Okay.

1023
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:58,680
But this got serious when I washed the car, okay, or cars, and at the end of the next day, I told my wife,

1024
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:00,280
hey, you notice something weird here?

1025
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,020
I pointed at the car, really shiny.

1026
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:03,720
I washed these cars yesterday.

1027
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:07,380
There's no dust on them, no dust at all.

1028
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,860
And the next day, hey, it's been two days.

1029
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,380
Look, there's no dust on the car.

1030
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:13,700
How is that possible?

1031
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:21,800
So what's going on here is the water became so negatively charged that anything that it touched became positively charged,

1032
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,900
which became an anode.

1033
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,300
So it repels it.

1034
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:28,440
Things will not, yeah, well, sort of repels it, yeah.

1035
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:29,820
It's not going to feel at home.

1036
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:34,280
Well, much like what happens when you try and put, like you said, you put the North and the South Pole together,

1037
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,360
it appears as though they're pushing away from each other.

1038
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,700
It won't merge, yeah.

1039
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:39,360
It won't merge.

1040
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,200
It's something dissimilar, yeah.

1041
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,740
Let's just say it puts a positive charge on it, right?

1042
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:44,120
Okay.

1043
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:51,760
The other thing is when you boil down the water, the amount of scale that you have in there is almost nonexistent also.

1044
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,660
So it's going somewhere else.

1045
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,380
It's going somewhere else.

1046
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:57,540
Now, here's the interesting part.

1047
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:04,220
You know when you walk in front of a shop like Macy's and there's a piece of glass and you see the furniture or the mannequins,

1048
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,560
you know, and you have this piece of glass between you?

1049
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:10,260
Okay, I've always discussed that everything comes from water.

1050
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:16,500
By the way, one of the tasks that I have, it's kind of a secret in terms of outcome, but it's not secret to talk about.

1051
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:21,220
I'm tasked with taking hydrogen and helium and turning it into lithium.

1052
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:22,040
Okay.

1053
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:22,720
Right?

1054
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:23,520
Okay.

1055
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,240
It's actually very simple.

1056
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,360
You just have to find the right way to do it.

1057
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:29,620
Hydrogen is very abundant.

1058
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:35,800
Well, there's 20 different types of hydrogen, but also helium is not that abundant.

1059
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:39,820
It's a byproduct of the petrol gas and oil industry.

1060
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:46,500
But anyway, they could be combined to produce lithium, which is something that supposedly they're fighting wars for,

1061
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:50,480
or it's a metal that, you know, to get into it.

1062
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,020
It's all about the batteries right now.

1063
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:54,700
Yeah, yeah, exactly, yeah, and whatever.

1064
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,220
So we can make it from hydrogen and helium.

1065
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:02,720
We're in a different – at least when I succeed at this, it'll be real fun to talk about it.

1066
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:04,100
It's going to get some people mad.

1067
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:07,300
But you guys will know first.

1068
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:09,940
Once it's done, I'm going to try to monetize it.

1069
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,240
That's why I'm not going to talk about it.

1070
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:12,220
If it's done, we'll see.

1071
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:16,240
And if it's monetized and done, I may not – I might say, hey, it got monetized.

1072
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:18,180
Part of the agreement is I can't talk about it.

1073
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:25,140
I'm assuming that that might happen, to be honest with you, because I cannot foresee anybody discovering that,

1074
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:32,040
having that in their hands, and wishing to allow anybody to really know for a long time.

1075
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:32,440
Yeah.

1076
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:40,880
Well, look, the Germans, the Germans, World War I got in trouble for synthesizing oil from carbon dioxide and water.

1077
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:42,600
That's all you need.

1078
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,660
Well, you need a catalyst.

1079
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:50,920
You need the right set grouping of catalysts because hydrocarbons, hydrocarbon literally means water carbon, right?

1080
00:51:51,600 --> 00:52:00,220
And if you look at a hydrocarbon petroleum molecule, with CO2 gas, which is abundant and it's a byproduct, it's cheap,

1081
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:05,020
and water, you have to get the right kind of water and the right kind of catalyst, just like, you know,

1082
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:06,780
vegetable shortening, Crisco, right?

1083
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:09,100
They use it for baking, whatever.

1084
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:16,380
I'm not going to get lascivious on this one, but it's oil and water.

1085
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:24,560
Well, you have to – you can't mix oil and water, but you can if you run it through – the process goes through nickel beads over nickel.

1086
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:28,140
Now, the nickel is a catalyst, and it will change both of them.

1087
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:30,420
There's no nickel content at all in it.

1088
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:31,420
It's just a catalyst.

1089
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,380
By the way, when you – I could say this much.

1090
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:43,340
Yeah, well, if you synthesize oil from water and CO2 gas and the right catalyst, the oil ends up looking more like a transmission fluid.

1091
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:48,360
It's a dark pink color, almost – yeah, and it has a wonderful smell.

1092
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,780
I don't know if you ever have a pleasant smell from petroleum.

1093
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:52,580
It's possible.

1094
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,960
I've never experienced that.

1095
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:56,800
I worked with gas, and I never –

1096
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,080
Well, that's refined.

1097
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:02,860
That's got – okay, the gasolines, what they do, just like with the food industry with fluoride, right,

1098
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:09,100
is when they have toxic chemicals that they can't get rid of, they just put them in gasoline.

1099
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:10,920
Yeah, or the diesel.

1100
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:11,500
To burn them off.

1101
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:12,120
Or the diesel.

1102
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:13,160
Right.

1103
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:15,840
Someone says, oh, I'm a believer in fluoride and toothpaste.

1104
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:17,440
That's sodium fluoride, dummy.

1105
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:21,760
Calcium fluoride is what the teeth have, and they say, oh, does it make a difference?

1106
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:24,820
Okay, so you're drinking a cola right now.

1107
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:27,760
That's – you like it because it's – you don't like it when it's flat.

1108
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,040
You like it when it's bubbly, right?

1109
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:31,440
That's CO2 gas, carbon dioxide.

1110
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:36,820
What if I replaced that carbon dioxide in your soda with carbon monoxide and you drank that often?

1111
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:38,340
Would you like that?

1112
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:39,300
What's the difference?

1113
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:42,360
Well, I'm pretty sure the carbon monoxide will kill you.

1114
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,160
Well, what's the – well, the sodium fluoride will do, too.

1115
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,700
This is – by the way, I've never heard this analogy.

1116
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:50,060
Feel free to use it.

1117
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:57,180
If you're one of these fluoride whatever people, just tell them calcium fluoride, not sodium fluoride that they put out, right?

1118
00:53:57,220 --> 00:54:00,580
Because carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, big difference.

1119
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:06,100
And if they don't see that, just keep walking because they're just – they're just repeating a thing.

1120
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,300
Okay, so here's the important part of it.

1121
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:17,560
When you see the water, like the glass and the things behind it, you know, like maybe it's not a great analogy,

1122
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:22,280
but in a showcase, you know, the glass is between you and the object, right?

1123
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:29,900
What's happening is it's creating the water between – whatever the water is carrying stays in the flow of the water.

1124
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:32,120
It stays in the water body.

1125
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:38,480
The water body, after it's been treated with the block wall of the magnet, stays within the water body,

1126
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:42,980
and it changes it enough that it wants to become water.

1127
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:45,640
So it won't stick to the washing machine tub.

1128
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:49,460
It won't stick to the car, meaning what's in the water, okay?

1129
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:50,160
Okay.

1130
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:58,320
And it stays in the water, and it wants to be – so the minerals and the stuff in the water want to become water once it goes over the magnetic part.

1131
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:05,580
Now, I've been – what I'm experimenting with now is degassing the water.

1132
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:10,020
Well, not now, but the next step – not now as we're recording this,

1133
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:18,400
but the next step is to treat the water with some implosion, which is water under a vacuum, right, to degas the water.

1134
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:24,880
By the way, most water has at least 5% to 10%, depending on your altitude, dissolved gases in it.

1135
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:31,580
Have you ever go to your tap or whatever and pour a glass of water and leave it on the counter?

1136
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:32,540
You come back five minutes.

1137
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:33,800
What do you see all over the glass?

1138
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:37,080
Little tiny bubbles all over the glass, on the bottom, top, sides, right?

1139
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:40,600
What that is is the gases that are in the water coming out.

1140
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:45,960
So part of the implosion process of water is to degas the water, which is very simple.

1141
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:55,940
You just need to build some apparatus to do that for a given volume, let's say, or you could do it while it's moving, and then affect it with that field.

1142
00:55:55,940 --> 00:56:08,320
Now, if you're going to set up these magnets, do me a favor and what's called the north side of the magnet goes towards the north and south towards the south.

1143
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:09,240
You orientate.

1144
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:09,780
Okay.

1145
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:17,100
And if you can't – if it's not vertical like that, if it's horizontal, so the magnet is either going to the ceiling or the floor,

1146
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:20,620
make sure that the south side of the magnet is pointing towards the floor.

1147
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:23,560
Then you're safe there as well, north towards the sky.

1148
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:24,100
Okay.

1149
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:30,720
Because that gives you a counterclockwise spin, just like, for example, when water goes down a drain, most likely it's counterclockwise.

1150
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:32,740
So that's the orientation.

1151
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:44,240
I wanted to bring this up because this is going to lead into transmutation aspects that are – they call it low-energy transmutation or something like that, right?

1152
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:46,900
We're taught that you need high-energy bombarding.

1153
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:51,240
What they say in a nuclear power plant, the lead turns to gold and all this stuff,

1154
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:54,400
but you don't have a nuclear power plant, so you can't make lead into gold.

1155
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:56,000
Anyway, that kind of stuff.

1156
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:01,680
But the way you make lead into gold, by the way, is by removing a hydrogen atom, right?

1157
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:03,480
So out of the lead.

1158
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:04,860
But what are you talking about, Greg?

1159
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:05,620
Lead is lead.

1160
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:06,200
There's no hydrogen.

1161
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:06,960
Okay.

1162
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:08,120
That's another discussion.

1163
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:14,900
So if you get something to look like a duck and smell like a duck and act like a duck, it must be a duck.

1164
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:18,600
But not always because you can make a robotic duck that looks just like a duck.

1165
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:27,160
I think they even had – in some recent films, they were going to do a real lion, a CG lion, or a robotic lion.

1166
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,920
That's how good the robots are getting, right?

1167
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:30,580
Right.

1168
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:38,120
I think they did the Lion King and they were merging these things, trying to figure out which one was the best.

1169
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:39,620
Wasn't that the one you were doing?

1170
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:40,660
Yeah, something like that.

1171
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:41,260
Yeah.

1172
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:47,300
So what I'm saying is you get some of the lead to act like hydrogen, smell like hydrogen, look like hydrogen.

1173
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:48,200
It's hydrogen, right?

1174
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:52,000
And then in that process is where you have the rest of it turning.

1175
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:56,760
By the way, when you start doing transmuting metals in ingot form like that,

1176
00:57:56,820 --> 00:58:03,940
let's say you have a hunk of copper and you want to start turning it to gold, it looks – it's very strange when you see the appearance.

1177
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:11,980
And whenever the gold starts to appear on a piece of metal that you're transmuting and something that's not in solution,

1178
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:19,280
something that's on a piece of metal, an ingot or a bar or something, always – as the gold starts to make its appearance,

1179
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:24,520
it always looks like it's growing organically or it looks like raindrops.

1180
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:27,380
You ever see when raindrops initially fall and they spatter?

1181
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:32,360
So you'll have the drop section where it made contact and then a spatter marks all around.

1182
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:39,560
It's as if the gold is falling or the elements that you're changing it to are falling in here from somewhere else.

1183
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:43,300
It looks identical to raindrops on a sidewalk when they start forming.

1184
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:46,740
So it's very – it's like it's – yeah.

1185
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:53,440
You know there's a ratio, by the way, of how a rock falls, right, from a certain height and it reaches terminal velocity,

1186
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:56,520
I think 140 miles per hour, and how it accelerates.

1187
00:58:57,180 --> 00:59:01,940
There's a proportion of the acceleration of a rock as it's falling.

1188
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:07,220
Someone did a study on the growth of a human embryo in the human body.

1189
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:14,960
As the embryo or the egg that's been conceived, the zygote and all that, goes to an embryo fetus,

1190
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:19,980
the proportion of its growth over nine months is exactly the proportion of a rock falling.

1191
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:25,520
It's as if the body has the same proportions of something falling.

1192
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:29,060
So you know the fall of man, get it?

1193
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:29,880
I get it.

1194
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:31,300
Anyway, yeah, yeah.

1195
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:37,100
So you could find – and what I'm trying to say is you could find similarities in many, many things,

1196
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:39,560
but you have to read out of it.

1197
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:44,240
Don't read into it what you want, like the sun of God doesn't mean the sun in the sky.

1198
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:45,900
You ever hear people say that all the time?

1199
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:46,320
Yes.

1200
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:51,540
Because in Hebrew it would be ben, not sun, right?

1201
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:53,580
And in Greek it would be yos, right?

1202
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:54,760
Or iko in Spanish.

1203
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:55,740
It wouldn't be sun.

1204
00:59:56,220 --> 01:00:00,160
See, so you know what I mean, the difference between reading out sort of reading in, right?

1205
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:01,860
So you've got to always read out of these things.

1206
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:09,100
All right, the magnet, very, very, very crucial, very simple, very easy to do.

1207
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:13,480
The main point, the main takeaway here, this is part of a water discussion,

1208
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:18,920
because when we do get into a more concerted, deep discussion on water,

1209
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:22,700
we'll be talking more about the effects and not the setup, but referring to the setup.

1210
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,620
I think we gave enough about the setup.

1211
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:25,280
What do you think?

1212
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:26,220
I think so.

1213
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:32,320
I think it's very important to remember, though, that lining things up with its natural orientation,

1214
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:35,900
because that's the way I take it when you're telling me to either, you know,

1215
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:39,820
look, if it happens to be vertical, put the south pole to the floor,

1216
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:46,380
and if not, try to put north to north and south to south if it is vertical, right?

1217
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:51,180
But here's the thing, if you could only turn the magnet east-west,

1218
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:55,700
I would rather have the floor go to the south than crisscrossing, right?

1219
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:59,300
So, like, for example, in the bathroom under the toilet tank,

1220
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,820
the way the tube only allows for it to go east-west,

1221
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:04,720
so I'd rather turn it horizontal and have the south go towards the floor.

1222
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:08,020
So sometimes you do have to make, what do you call it, a compensation,

1223
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:11,120
or you have to make the call yourself, right?

1224
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:14,680
And then there's magnetic north and true north, which will give you 10 or 15 degrees.

1225
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:15,240
That's fine.

1226
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:18,820
If you could be within 30 degrees of north, do it.

1227
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:20,540
Otherwise, just turn the south towards the floor.

1228
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:23,740
You'll be safe in almost all cases, especially if it's something that's movable.

1229
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:29,720
Now, this is very, very important to me because I'm noticing that there is a change in mass

1230
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:31,820
of the things that are dissolved in the water,

1231
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:37,000
and there's also a change in properties of the things that are being affected by the water.

1232
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:44,960
Now, the next thing is to affect this in other ways, like I said, and also in other places,

1233
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:49,960
but it's so drastic here where I'm doing it, where I dwell, where I inhabit.

1234
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:54,780
It's such a big difference. It's not like a slight difference.

1235
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:58,900
It's so, like, in-your-face noticeable and, like, what the hell is going on kind of noticeable

1236
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:02,860
that I wanted to bring that up, and it's ironclad at this point.

1237
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:05,800
It's like an iron law kind of thing.

1238
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:12,380
The magnetic treatment of fluids must be along the block wall, case closed.

1239
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:14,560
There's no debate or no option to that.

1240
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:17,380
So if you go to magnetic treatment of fluids online,

1241
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:21,440
it's all they're sandwiching the lines in between the poles of the magnets.

1242
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:23,000
So anyway.

1243
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:28,120
Yeah, well, they're creating a different effect, and it's not the one that you're creating with this.

1244
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:32,020
They're creating the effect that they were impressed with when they stuck the magnet

1245
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:33,900
to a bag of nails or the refrigerator,

1246
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:37,660
but whatever fluid is going through there is not impressed at all.

1247
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:38,920
As a matter of fact, it ignores it.

1248
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:44,220
Okay, so this is a really, really big deal,

1249
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:49,460
because if you don't have hard water and you have other things in the water,

1250
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,740
it will affect those as well, right?

1251
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:53,340
So, yeah.

1252
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:55,120
So I just wanted to bring that up on the water.

1253
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:57,420
It's very, very, very important to me,

1254
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:02,460
and many people here might care about what I consider to be important,

1255
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:04,220
want to know what does the Greek think is important,

1256
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,360
and this is one of the most important discoveries

1257
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:09,080
and workings that I've done in the past year.
