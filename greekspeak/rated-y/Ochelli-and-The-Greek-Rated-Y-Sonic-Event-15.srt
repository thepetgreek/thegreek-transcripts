1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,740
The sonic entity known as Ocelli in the Greek.

2
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:41,260
This is fun, because, well, we wind up talking about certain literary characters and books.

3
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:48,820
And we start talking about, well, what is the biblical text, what is the Bible, you know, common parlance.

4
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:54,500
All right, well, the character of, and we've seen some questions in the chat.

5
00:00:55,060 --> 00:01:01,120
I'll leave it to you to begin to just explain that, because we're all familiar with the greatest story ever told, you know.

6
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,660
I'm pulling out these metrics on purpose, but go ahead.

7
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:10,380
It's like running a stop sign, right? Let's just put it this way.

8
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:19,340
Image training, the whole society, I think it was Confucius that said it's not laws or words, it's symbols that control people.

9
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:26,900
So, you've got a stop sign, it's basically an octagon with a red field with some letters written in it.

10
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:31,760
Now, most of the people here are English speaking and used to seeing stop.

11
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:41,420
But if you go to somewhere like Qatar or Saudi Arabia, and you go to an intersection, and you see a red octagon, and it's got some Arabic script on it, guess what?

12
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,880
That's probably a stop sign, isn't it?

13
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,640
Right.

14
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,540
You see what I mean?

15
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,900
So, someone pulls a badge on you, right?

16
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,540
This is my authority.

17
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,220
It's just a piece of metal.

18
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,080
Someone raises a flag.

19
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,160
It's just a piece of cloth.

20
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:57,400
Right.

21
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,600
What are they trying to communicate?

22
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,180
You know, there's an old story.

23
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,960
Let's see if I could really redact, make it small, short.

24
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,640
Arizona farmer government agencies in the 30s started being introduced to the people.

25
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,380
Gets a knock on the door.

26
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,120
I'm from the federal government.

27
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,160
Here's my badge.

28
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,280
That means I could go anywhere on your farm.

29
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:18,880
He says, fine.

30
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,320
So, about an hour later, he doesn't see the guy, but he hears somebody, the same guy screaming.

31
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,120
He's climbed up the top of a tree, and there's this huge Brahma bull ramming the tree.

32
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,020
And the Fed is asking him for help.

33
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,780
He says, come help me.

34
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,420
Come help me.

35
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,460
And the farmer tells him, why don't you just show them your badge?

36
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:37,720
Right?

37
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,040
You see?

38
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,540
There you go.

39
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,660
So, this is all image training.

40
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:47,920
So, when you have an image that people rely on, let me just say that again.

41
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,740
People are relying on images.

42
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,320
Should we just end it right here?

43
00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:03,680
We could just end the sonic right here and do sonic 16 and make sonic 15 the world's shortest Greek-speak sonic.

44
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,260
You see what I mean?

45
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,040
You're relying on images.

46
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:07,640
Yeah.

47
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:08,280
Okay.

48
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,380
What did they do?

49
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,540
Well, this is the thing.

50
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:18,320
I love the stop sign, by the way, because I've seen that, and I've also seen that people translate it in their mind.

51
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,880
They'll tell me they saw an exit sign in a piece of film.

52
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:28,360
Now, they did not see an exit sign where the letters E-X-I-T were actually printed on an illuminated sign,

53
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,180
something that we've gotten accustomed to seeing in the United States, right?

54
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,320
But they did see that sign.

55
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,980
They translated it in their own minds, even though the language on it is not English.

56
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,780
Right, but in this case, the language is irrelevant.

57
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,700
It's irrelevant, but that's the point.

58
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,760
The symbol, the badge, the stop sign is the most universal.

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,540
Well, that hanging rectangular light near a door, somebody goes, that's an exit sign.

60
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,940
That's what they know it as.

61
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:56,420
Oh, no.

62
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,560
That star, that piece of metal.

63
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,240
I got you.

64
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:04,400
That star, that piece of metal, it's just a pointy piece of metal with some spikes coming off of it

65
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,560
and in some places it's a six-pointed star, in some places it's an eight-pointed star, right?

66
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,040
Well, yeah.

67
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,340
Well, I've worked in TV and radio, I mean radio and TV,

68
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,240
and when you're walking down the hall towards the studios,

69
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,959
they have a lit box sign that says recording or on air,

70
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,340
and it looks a lot like illuminated metal frame sign with writing on it.

71
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,080
It's not an exit sign, but it means something important.

72
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,340
But it's also positioning of the thing.

73
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:37,260
See, that thing is usually either above a particular door and or, you know,

74
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,760
a lot of those on air signs were lower, right?

75
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,320
They were lower to the ground.

76
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,760
The one that hangs from the ceiling is the exit.

77
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,920
The one that might be over the door on the wall, now that's more of an on air sign.

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,580
You see what I'm saying?

79
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,680
There are cues to the placement and use of these things as well, aren't there?

80
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,320
Yeah, but in the case of the subject we're going to bring up,

81
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,720
it's more like the badge of authority.

82
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,560
Well, yeah, but that same shape.

83
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,860
That's why I said running a stop sign.

84
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,540
Well, yes, yes, but that same shape, understand, on the tag of a dog,

85
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,840
you don't think that's a police dog, do you?

86
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,180
No, no.

87
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,100
You don't assume that's a badge.

88
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,160
No, but the thing is, yeah.

89
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:17,760
You see what I'm saying?

90
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,680
Context, right?

91
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,140
Context for placement, no?

92
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,140
It has to have authority behind it, though.

93
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:27,960
In other words, we've talked, beginner Greek speakers, people are motivated by penalties.

94
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,880
So if you don't believe in that sign or don't have the issue that you've been told it's been issued,

95
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,940
then you're in trouble, right?

96
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,360
Like in this case, as we get further subject, you're going to burn in hell, right?

97
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,620
So that's the real interesting part.

98
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,960
All right, continuing on with 15.

99
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,600
Greek, again, authority.

100
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,680
The authority behind the thing.

101
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,400
All right, go ahead.

102
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,660
It's not just the authority.

103
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,700
There's an engineering aspect to it.

104
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,840
Because as we go further on this, we're going to notice that it's false.

105
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:11,480
Most of the symbols don't really represent the way that they're handled, how they should be.

106
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,620
How are they represented?

107
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,620
Like most people want to stop at a stop sign,

108
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,000
not because they're going to be T-boned or hit by another car.

109
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,540
It's because they don't want a penalty by being caught that they ran one right.

110
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,780
Again, people are motivated by penalty.

111
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,980
And there's an engineering aspect to this.

112
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,820
Let's say social engineering, right?

113
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,780
I think I gave a couple of examples, you and I, before we started.

114
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:34,920
Diamonds.

115
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,560
Diamonds were not considered valuable until recently, past 150 years.

116
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:45,380
It was a marketing campaign that De Beers did to people that were engaged to be married.

117
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:50,120
Just like no one ate bacon and eggs until the pork belly market went up,

118
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,140
and petroleum was never known as a fossil fuel.

119
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,600
It was oil from rock, rock mineral oil.

120
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,940
Actually, you can still buy it, and it's called mineral oil, right?

121
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,300
Baby oil, right?

122
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,380
So all these things are the way that they – so things are what they are.

123
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,880
They change, and new things come in with symbolism.

124
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,040
Now, that's the engineering aspect of it.

125
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:16,400
Like, for example, the bacon and eggs, the diamonds being precious,

126
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,900
and the fossil fuel, those are social engineering examples.

127
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,160
Combine that with the symbols being very important.

128
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,940
Combine that with how people accept it and what they do with it.

129
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,860
Once they get up and running with it, it doesn't change,

130
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,220
and because it becomes generational, right?

131
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,820
So let's give the engineering point of view.

132
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,520
Sure.

133
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,840
It's not that simple.

134
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,740
People are always speaking on social engineering in this,

135
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:50,400
but I'm going to give an engineering point of view because it's very important

136
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,140
and how you see a little bit.

137
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:57,880
It's the same whether you're doing a building or social engineering or whatever

138
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,960
or an airplane or a bridge or anything.

139
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,720
Engineering concepts are the same.

140
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,880
It's about how do you handle the qualities and the quantities, right?

141
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,220
Okay.

142
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,440
Here's a simple example.

143
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,360
Let's get started.

144
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,540
You have a 10-story building, okay?

145
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,600
It's a steel building, okay?

146
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,440
Whatever facade, let's say glass facade, very simple idea.

147
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,320
I want to build a 100-story building that looks just like that.

148
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,160
Okay, so I'm going to need 10 times the material.

149
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,880
That's the simple linear approach, right?

150
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,220
It's still linear, right?

151
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:33,980
That's fair.

152
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,000
Well, yes, but from an engineering point of view,

153
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,340
you see most people would read the Bible or whatever,

154
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,580
and it's a very linear approach if you ask them how much more material do you need

155
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,860
for a 100-story building versus a 10-story building.

156
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,900
They're all going to say 10 times more.

157
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,580
That's not really how it works.

158
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,700
Well, here's the question, right?

159
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,260
Doesn't the condition change because of the fact that you're adding the height?

160
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,540
I'm not an engineer of any kind, by the way.

161
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,200
I have zero engineering ideas.

162
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:04,560
Go ahead.

163
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,700
Yeah, we're told that if we don't know engineering,

164
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,000
we have to get an engineer, so I'm going through this.

165
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,580
So basically what I'm going to give you here is basically equivalent

166
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,060
to a four-year education, what you'll get after a four-year education,

167
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,280
because basically in engineering,

168
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,340
a really good engineer can draw anything on a napkin,

169
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,480
and you'll go into reference manuals to design it,

170
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,000
and you won't be more than 5% or 10% off.

171
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,860
So that's basically what anybody could do.

172
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,640
It was all engineers look at computers and reference manuals.

173
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,120
Okay.

174
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,960
But the whole scope of engineering is how it's linear even when it's not linear.

175
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,720
So you have one linear aspect.

176
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,080
If you, let's say, go to the public, well,

177
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:48,400
100 stories requires 10 times more material than a 10-story building.

178
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:52,700
Yes, okay, very good, but that won't – no, that doesn't really work at all

179
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,680
because you have to go floor by floor.

180
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:03,220
So the load on the building on the first floor will take the nine stories above it.

181
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,240
So the first floor has to support nine stories above it.

182
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,520
The second floor has to support eight stories above it, right?

183
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,460
The third floor has to support seven stories above it

184
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,420
in terms of how strong it needs to be, right?

185
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,940
So from a stress diagram, it ends up looking like a pyramid.

186
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,700
It gets narrower and narrower, the amount of material that you need.

187
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,720
Okay, so when we go to a 100-story building,

188
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,980
the bottom floor has to support 99 stories.

189
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,460
That's just the second floor.

190
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,420
First floor, right?

191
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,980
If you go to the second floor of the 100-story building,

192
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,800
it's 98 stories above it and so on and so forth.

193
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,300
You see it's like a backward – okay, now, on the 10-story building,

194
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,720
if you look at how much material you need to support those nine floors,

195
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,260
and if you look at now the 100-story building,

196
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,600
that's the same looking building except it's 100 stories tall,

197
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,820
has to support 99 floors.

198
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,520
It's 11 times as much, isn't it?

199
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,760
You see?

200
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,180
Absolutely.

201
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:07,020
So that means that the beam structure and the structure of the first floor –

202
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:10,820
you know, the same building, one's 10 stories, the other one's 100 stories.

203
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,500
That basement and that first floor has to support 11 times more,

204
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,840
just the vertical.

205
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,880
We're not even going wind loads or complex shock loads and things moving.

206
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,000
What if – you know, this is true.

207
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,580
Some captains on medium-sized boats, if everyone goes to –

208
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,400
if it's a ferry or something and everyone goes to one side of the boat,

209
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,700
you know that boat could flip, right?

210
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,400
Right, right.

211
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,820
The same thing with buildings, by the way.

212
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:36,260
Okay.

213
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:48,500
So as we go up, it's going to get less and less.

214
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,540
So now here's the thing.

215
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,660
When you get up to the 90th floor of the 100-story building, okay,

216
00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:01,880
that will have very similar supports as the first floor of the 10-story building

217
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,680
because they each have only nine – or 91st floor.

218
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,340
Go to the 91st floor of the 100-story building.

219
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,700
That could be built just like the first floor of the 10-story building, you see,

220
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,560
because they each – because it's just nine stories above, right?

221
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,300
I understand what you're saying.

222
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,260
The one thing that I'm wondering that's missing from this, though,

223
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,640
just because I worked construction and just basically did what I was told, right?

224
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,120
I had nothing to do with design or anything.

225
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,580
But move this, break this, do that, right?

226
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:30,820
Here's the thing.

227
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:34,700
The foundation, that's the only thing I haven't heard you say anything about,

228
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,140
is you have to build it on something.

229
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,020
Right.

230
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,580
Well, just talking about what people perceive down on the top

231
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,140
because it gets a little – the foundation is what you're building on.

232
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,720
If you're bedrock or how is the load going to be distributed, very important.

233
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,920
There's a building in California right now or San Fran or somewhere that's tilting.

234
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,400
It's a recently built thing too.

235
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,080
There's one in Manhattan too like that, and it's moving.

236
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,080
Leaning Tower of Pisa type stuff, right?

237
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:57,660
Right.

238
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,060
Okay.

239
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:03,160
So we're going to get into the subject of who the Christ is and how –

240
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,880
this is really start here Greek-speak, but I always say the same thing

241
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:14,580
because I'm presuming that if people are interested,

242
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,640
they'll be able to go to the text and see it, right?

243
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,100
Okay.

244
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:24,820
But it's an okay – it's actually – that's a – I keep presumptions in a certain way

245
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,520
because they're safe and they treat people properly.

246
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:33,700
In other words, when I say what I say about anything, you have a choice there.

247
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:39,180
Like I gave you the punchline to the joke or I gave you the most important part first.

248
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:45,160
It's up to you if you want to go back and confirm it, find it, or use it,

249
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,160
or just say, okay, the Greek says there's no crucifixion.

250
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,420
That's good enough for me.

251
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,780
Someone else might say, oh, that's total bullshit.

252
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:57,800
I don't buy it, but let's go look where he said I should look to see that,

253
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,620
and it's totally obvious.

254
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:05,600
And other people will go and look to where I say to look to see it,

255
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,040
and they won't see it even though it's right in front of them, right?

256
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,140
Right, right.

257
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:09,680
You see?

258
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:16,440
So the presumption that I have saves everyone a whole lot of time, right?

259
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,940
And that's why I like to just get to the point.

260
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,300
That's a problem that researchers have.

261
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:27,820
I know you do research or whatever, but researchers go into the philosophical side,

262
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,620
which is once you – let's say you're researching what happened in a certain event

263
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,220
like 9-11 or JFK or whatever.

264
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,660
Once it's discovered what really happened, your career as a researcher is over.

265
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:42,540
So it's not in your interest to find it, you see.

266
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,080
It's not in their interest to find solutions to problems.

267
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:53,660
So when I look at stuff and I discuss it, if I can't see a clear shot,

268
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:57,780
just like designing this building, how it can be explained, I leave it alone,

269
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:02,200
and I give the reason why it's like that, where I see the reason it's like that,

270
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,840
and compare it to other things that are similar.

271
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:12,540
For example, with JFK research, how many public figure, high dignitary figures

272
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,940
have been assassinated in the past 150 years,

273
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:21,180
and how many of their assassins were actually the real assassins that we were told?

274
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,680
Probably none.

275
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,300
Very few.

276
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,700
I mean, there's a handful of circumstances I can think of off the top of my head

277
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,500
where, yeah, I think that's exactly what happened.

278
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,100
But otherwise, no.

279
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,540
One out of 10, 10%?

280
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,540
At best.

281
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,720
Yeah, at best.

282
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,060
Okay.

283
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,600
So now we're going into a field, when we do that,

284
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,360
that we know that at best we just said what it is at best, right?

285
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,840
I don't like to do that.

286
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:46,720
That's fine.

287
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,080
But I'll state it, at best is.

288
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:55,640
But the reason why at one out of 10 at best is because of this other reason now, right?

289
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,700
It's a cover-up.

290
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,100
Why is there a cover-up?

291
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,080
Again, psychological operation.

292
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:08,080
By the way, I know someone whose professor teaches medicine, right?

293
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,400
It's a doctor that teaches doctors, right?

294
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,100
Oh, boy, yeah.

295
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,300
And they're given an award.

296
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,220
Anyway, I don't want to get into too many details.

297
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,220
Recently they're going to be getting an award for what they're doing or whatever.

298
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,340
And I'm like, you know what you're doing?

299
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:27,940
I basically say it's psychological chaos is what the university is.

300
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,320
And they look at me.

301
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,000
You know, here's an interesting thing, even with this particular individual.

302
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,960
They got all the Greek speak on the medicine and more, a lot more.

303
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,120
And they agree.

304
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:44,040
They have never confronted me as challenged or anything.

305
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,720
They're like, yeah, yeah, it's pretty much it.

306
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,400
They either say I can't acknowledge it or they don't acknowledge it, meaning they,

307
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,240
whoever they is, you know, they in the big quotes, right?

308
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:53,820
They, yeah.

309
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,720
So, but when I say the things I do, there's this presumption that you can do

310
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,480
whatever you want with the information.

311
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,420
So there's an engineering, there's symbols, there's all this stuff.

312
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:10,960
But when you go back to what this is all spurring from what's in the chat,

313
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,819
and I answered recently, I'll address that on the next sonic.

314
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,660
Because going over it again, which is part of basic Greek speak,

315
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:23,520
what's any biblical stuff or any whatever stuff is all really basic Greek speak.

316
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:29,060
I don't need to get into it, but I want to get into the engineering aspect of it

317
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,480
and how to look around, just like the 10-story building.

318
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,160
It's still linear, by the way.

319
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,080
The 10-story building versus the 100-story building, it's still very linear.

320
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,360
You know, yeah, you do need 10 times the material on the outside,

321
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,220
but what's supporting it, you're going to need a hell of a lot more

322
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:51,060
on the inside, you see, right?

323
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,700
And the engineering is so simple, I just laid it out.

324
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,560
Basically, an undergraduate degree in engineering, I just laid out.

325
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:05,920
I could do one in aerospace also, if anyone's interested, and chemical engineering.

326
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,720
I could lay out a basic bachelor's to a four-year degree in about five minutes,

327
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,760
basically the premise of it, okay?

328
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,000
So it's very simple.

329
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,200
It's not easy.

330
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,320
There's a lot of homework you have to do, right?

331
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,180
But here's the thing.

332
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,000
Who is the Christ?

333
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,280
This is very important in the Western culture, by the way.

334
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,460
It's more important than most people give it importance to

335
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:37,680
because if you study history, there have been major wars for cause of religion, right?

336
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:42,700
But also, a lot of these quote-unquote religious wars,

337
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,820
each side was carrying the same cross, right?

338
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,320
So you have fights.

339
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:55,440
Okay, so there's a lot of aspects to this that may or may not really strike people well,

340
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:02,200
and I do say this in a humorous, sarcastic way when I bring up the subject of the Christ.

341
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:10,580
You know, the Christian era is dubbed the Christian era because of the academics,

342
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:15,040
and they're self-professed atheists, by the way, the academics, right?

343
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,000
How do I know?

344
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:20,120
Go to any university and do a survey with all the faculty there.

345
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:25,560
You'll find that about 75% to 90% of them profess atheism, right?

346
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,040
Right.

347
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,480
And they call it the Christian era, so it has nothing to do with religion.

348
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,780
By the way, this is something for the atheists, you guys out there.

349
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,600
You're full of crap.

350
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,660
You are victims of some major league bullshit.

351
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:37,700
Why?

352
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,480
I'm not saying this from a religious side.

353
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,740
I'm saying it from a legal, lawful side.

354
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,520
Why are the atheists full of bullshit?

355
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,140
Why?

356
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,020
I'll tell you why.

357
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,180
Very simple.

358
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,640
Everyone has easy access to the courts if you can pay the fees, right?

359
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:59,640
Everyone has a certain amount of access to certain medias that they can start a movement,

360
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,280
let's say, put information out.

361
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,180
You can do a blog.

362
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,960
You can even buy time on TV and radio or make a point, right?

363
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:06,440
Okay.

364
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,440
Okay, so you atheists are full of crap.

365
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:08,840
Why?

366
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,040
Because they say that there is no God whatever.

367
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:17,380
They're not necessarily anti-God, but you could almost hinge it as if they were, right?

368
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:22,700
G-O-D, which I don't believe in a God anyway as just one God.

369
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,380
No, there are many.

370
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:24,740
It's a pantheon.

371
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,880
It's like saying army and thinking there's one soldier.

372
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,640
It's ridiculous.

373
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,820
It's a plurality.

374
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,720
But this is why the atheists are full of shit, and I'm dragging this up because I'm waiting

375
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,420
for people in their own minds to see how obvious it is that the atheists are full of crap.

376
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,020
And I'm not going to say why.

377
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,500
We'll say that on another Sonic.

378
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,260
No, I'm just joking.

379
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,500
Why are the atheists full of crap?

380
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,100
Okay, very simple.

381
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,200
Take out a dollar bill.

382
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,100
What does it say on it?

383
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,640
In God we trust.

384
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:51,600
Okay.

385
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:56,560
How easy with all the things that I mentioned that there are plenty of people self-professing

386
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,180
being atheists.

387
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,240
Well, by the way, 300 years ago, if you did that, it was very unpopular.

388
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,260
All right, so they wear it like a badge, right?

389
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:09,440
First of all, it's out in the open, and it's quite popular, right?

390
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:16,220
Second, I just mentioned that you have very easy access to the court system, and you have

391
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:21,680
easy access to media, in other words, getting your idea out to a plurality of groups, right?

392
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,060
Okay.

393
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,420
So why are they full of shit?

394
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:29,620
How many atheists have actually filed a suit in district court to take, in God we trust,

395
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,520
off the money, what they use as money?

396
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:32,960
How many?

397
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,200
I have seen like one case where somebody tried to assert that.

398
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,940
There was like one odd case.

399
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:40,780
Really?

400
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,840
I've never heard of it.

401
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,720
Yeah, no, it did happen, and it was in New York.

402
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,540
It was very strange.

403
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:55,780
It was part of a case with a bunch of facets to it, and they just, you know what they did,

404
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,000
is just dismissed it.

405
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,020
No, I never heard of it.

406
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:00,800
I actually looked it up.

407
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:04,000
I couldn't find anything a while back because I was making this as a point.

408
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,620
I'm not saying that it didn't happen.

409
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,420
Oh, yeah, I read about this in New York.

410
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,300
It was a certain New York.

411
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,300
Well, why isn't it pursued?

412
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,800
Well, yeah, there you go.

413
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,300
Is there a movement behind it?

414
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:18,420
Where is the support and the underpinning of their ideology when they have it in their pocket?

415
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,700
The opposite is true.

416
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:26,460
Those that do believe are not creating any kind of a support.

417
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:32,620
But both things, look, here's something that I've always said, and I wonder if you disagree.

418
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:41,620
To me, when somebody says atheist, that just means that they have selected an atypical God structure.

419
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:51,020
Well, still, if you're an atheist, then you just find out where they get their laws from.

420
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,880
Well, you believe in the laws of the state.

421
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,500
Yes, I do.

422
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:56,720
Well, then the state is your God, and April 1st is your holiday.

423
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,160
Bottom line.

424
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,460
I said that before I ever met you.

425
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,220
That's where you get your law.

426
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,900
Because that's what it is.

427
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,020
You get your law from your God.

428
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:06,960
That's the structure.

429
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:07,440
Yeah.

430
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,740
So if you just look, the laws of man, that's it.

431
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,580
Okay, well, then guess who your God is?

432
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,700
Well, the guy who's running the men, which is the state, in this case, not the government.

433
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:22,060
So here's the part that I'm always sarcastic when I bring up Greek speak,

434
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,960
and I preface that I've spun off on the atheist things.

435
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,960
What do they show you?

436
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,820
What do they show you?

437
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:32,520
Even the atheist academics dubbed it the Christian era.

438
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,400
Well, it doesn't have to be, but they did.

439
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,660
And I can get into why they did also, because of the Gregorian calendar.

440
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:46,580
But I always make a reference to that figure that they show you, a guy nailed to a cross wearing a diaper.

441
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:51,460
And I say that in a way that it's not respectful.

442
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,440
No, it's not.

443
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,940
And it's not meant to be.

444
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,220
But that's what I see when I first saw that.

445
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,360
Objectively, it's the image.

446
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,520
It is the image presented.

447
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,580
I mean, that's it.

448
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:03,360
There was a guy wearing a loincloth.

449
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:03,960
Yeah, a loincloth.

450
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:04,680
It's practically false.

451
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,300
Actually, we'll get into this a little bit.

452
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:06,640
Sure.

453
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,160
If you understand what really happened, he was naked.

454
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,460
Should have been.

455
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,060
Yeah.

456
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,000
Yeah, he was naked.

457
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:21,420
Okay, so one thing about this is you'll never hear me really reading out of books and stuff like that,

458
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,240
because plenty of people do that.

459
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,380
They'll sit there and read where their reference point is.

460
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:32,200
And for some reason, I found out, like the word nice, when I tell people, you know what the word nice means?

461
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,440
I can tell them.

462
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:38,460
But I say, go look it up on your own, because after a while of trying to define things for people,

463
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:45,260
I found that if they look it up themselves, it has like 70% more punch than if you just tell them.

464
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:45,580
It really does.

465
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,380
It really does.

466
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:52,020
And off air, you said to me I was a nice guy the other day.

467
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,720
I want to see if you're awake.

468
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,680
Yeah, I got you.

469
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,120
I told you.

470
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:56,800
You know that.

471
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,780
I said something rude back to you, but we laughed about it.

472
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,520
It's okay.

473
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:08,420
But this point got me in trouble, actually, when I was about five years old.

474
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:13,960
So I want to just throw this in real fast, because you just brought up something very interesting.

475
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:21,240
I think it's very basic and is in any translation, any representation of the biblical text.

476
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:26,980
And it's there, and I wonder if you would concur with this, because I've always seen this,

477
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,940
and at five years of age, I knew this.

478
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,040
Here's the thing.

479
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,380
They describe the crucifixion, right?

480
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,200
And at a certain point, he's stripped.

481
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,740
Now, it says it there in English.

482
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:42,840
It does.

483
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,920
I don't know how it's stated right off the top of my head this very moment,

484
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,040
but you bring it back to my mind.

485
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,820
At five years old, I had recently read it.

486
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:54,680
And I said in one of those religious-based institutional schools,

487
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:59,300
first of all, he's got all these powers.

488
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,140
How does he not get himself off of the cross?

489
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,300
But this is me at five.

490
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:03,920
Sorry, Greek.

491
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,680
Well, he didn't really have – here's the thing.

492
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,540
We'll get into that, too.

493
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,180
Bring that up.

494
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:08,840
No, that's fine.

495
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,060
Okay, but the other powers thing, because that's very interesting,

496
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:15,480
because the powers that he exercised were always collective.

497
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,340
He needed two or more people.

498
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,040
Not needed, but he was done that way.

499
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,840
We can get into that maybe in the future.

500
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,760
But here's the point I want to bring up.

501
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,060
Well, but the other thing, really fast, is that he was stripped.

502
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,900
And it says he's stripped.

503
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,620
He is bare.

504
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,820
So why is he like that?

505
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,360
And it was explained to me.

506
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:35,780
Oh, no.

507
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,120
No, no, no.

508
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,240
But I'm looking at –

509
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,460
I agree what you're saying.

510
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,440
I'm not disagreeing.

511
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,180
Let's just chalk it up as we're in agreement on that.

512
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,300
But it's too fine of a detail for those that are not really aware

513
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:52,640
of how we come across how the hundred-story building really is put together.

514
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:57,060
Well, I'm just pointing out that it's just one of those flaws that they look at you

515
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,480
and then they explain away.

516
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,060
But that doesn't show you what I've just told you.

517
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,700
And I'm five years old doing this.

518
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:08,160
So, again, this is not a seriously sophisticated point of view.

519
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,900
It's just you brought it to my memory.

520
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:15,080
Subjecting young children, even at five or so –

521
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,960
five is when you're considered alive, by the way, in law,

522
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,000
because many things go wrong up until five years old.

523
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:27,100
Five years old is also the age where most breastfeeding was done to.

524
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:32,640
So when a child died between being born and five years old, it was more typical.

525
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,980
And it wasn't until the child was five that it could be counted.

526
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,060
This is kind of like – this is in law also.

527
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,940
But, okay, I see what you're saying.

528
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:46,460
But there's many – there's thousands of fine points like that that work.

529
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:51,240
But this is the – I want to come up with a way to explain the engineering aspect of this,

530
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:56,800
which is very simple, just like the ten-story building analogy to a hundred-story building.

531
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,820
It's very, very simple.

532
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:01,660
Now, there's another thing I wanted to mention that I'm going to throw in.

533
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,120
They call it the Mandela effect.

534
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:09,380
Now, I don't – I'm not going to read tonight or now any verses or any –

535
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,820
I'll give the books where you can go.

536
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,060
And you can find it.

537
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,240
The computer search engines are still very good.

538
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,820
They haven't gone totally woke yet.

539
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,820
By the way, if you ask ChatGBT for Jesus jokes, it's full of it.

540
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,460
But if you ask for a Muhammad joke, they say they don't want to disrespect anyone's religion.

541
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,240
Right?

542
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,900
So ChatGBT has gone woke.

543
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,900
Thanks, Megzy, for that.

544
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:30,860
Okay.

545
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,040
Here's the concept.

546
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:38,860
I almost – which – well, boy, I want to say so many things at once.

547
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:44,880
It's really difficult to – everything is going to all come out in one shot almost.

548
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,500
I want to say five things at the same time, right?

549
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,340
I'm sorry.

550
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:54,700
Generally speaking, I try and slow you down just so you have enough time to choose your direction.

551
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,840
That's usually what I do when I disrupt you.

552
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:57,480
Sorry.

553
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:02,120
It would actually be easier to do what I said, which is what most people do,

554
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:05,260
is they'll tell you where they got it, the page and the verse and all that,

555
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,860
regardless if it's biblical or not.

556
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,620
I don't do that.

557
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,960
There's this thing called the Mandela Effect.

558
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,240
And everyone remembers – and I'm saying this, everyone air quotes –

559
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,280
that the lion will lay down with the lamb.

560
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:19,940
There's actually lion and lamb ministries where they have lions and lambs

561
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,720
and postcards and Christmas cards.

562
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:22,120
Right.

563
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:22,660
Right.

564
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,000
But it's not.

565
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,860
It's the wolf and the lamb now.

566
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,100
Right?

567
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,620
And planets were never mentioned in the versions.

568
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,080
Now they are.

569
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,380
So we live in this fluid kind of reality.

570
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,560
Am I a Mandela Effect?

571
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:41,280
In other words, if people start watching all these videos on the Mandela Effect,

572
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,220
do I subscribe to it?

573
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,840
No, just like I don't for the flat earth.

574
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,540
But is the earth flat?

575
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,540
Depends on what you're doing.

576
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,960
Well, see, that's the interesting thing.

577
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:51,560
You have an explanation in Greek-speak already of the Mandela Effect.

578
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,740
Whether you know it or not, you've already been given it.

579
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:54,980
Just so you know.

580
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,860
It depends on what you're focused on.

581
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,400
But there is a change in this reality that we're living in because –

582
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,440
Well, certainly.

583
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,460
But here's a simple explanation.

584
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,900
Well, maybe you don't want me to give it.

585
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:07,720
No, go ahead.

586
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:07,980
Give it.

587
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,500
I've given so many.

588
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,940
But which one are you referring to?

589
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,380
The technical one or the general aspect of this?

590
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,420
No, this is general.

591
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,520
General, relatable.

592
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,980
You can see how this works.

593
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:17,740
Very simple.

594
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,140
When you talked about getting the message from yourself in the future.

595
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,600
Well, assumption.

596
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,540
Very simple one.

597
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,120
I'm assuming that I'm not special.

598
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,780
So if I can do that, you can do that.

599
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:35,680
The little voice in your head is you remembering, recounting the event.

600
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,120
Right.

601
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:41,580
So what's happening is that displacement of time, being constantly in motion,

602
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,560
means that the past can be affected.

603
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:46,400
Right.

604
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,180
It could not be changed, but it's affected.

605
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:52,220
And it's also – you notice it's not malevolent.

606
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,420
The effects just seem to be fairly innocuous.

607
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:54,920
No, no.

608
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,380
I didn't describe any negativity to it.

609
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,660
I just simply said the past can be affected.

610
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,340
That's all I'm saying.

611
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:01,580
Yeah, it can be affected.

612
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,900
Oh, yeah, from that point of view.

613
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,700
But I recommend – the only reason I'm going to recommend what I'm saying

614
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,940
is because it's very well written.

615
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:12,920
If you could put up with it, the Carlos Castaneda books.

616
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,000
Okay.

617
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,180
Of Don Juan.

618
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,340
I don't know how many there are.

619
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,080
They started – maybe there's half a dozen of them or so.

620
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,380
But I was told to get into that in the early 80s, just like in the 80s

621
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:29,040
where I was going around and asking people, do they know about the flat earth?

622
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:32,300
Okay, so when I saw it coming back.

623
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,420
But anyway, the reason why I'm recommending the Castaneda books is because

624
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:40,400
they're well written and you can follow the story, even though it's very, very slow.

625
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:46,860
But, yeah, the point – I find myself coming around to those points of view.

626
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:57,000
In other words, there is a general point of view where he talks about being indifferent, right?

627
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,400
That's the only way – being objective, right?

628
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,860
So this is the aspect of it because if you're going to invest in belief,

629
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,500
some people get to the point where they're in eternal salvation.

630
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,520
You've heard them say that.

631
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:14,820
On something that you know nothing about or care nothing about or don't see it,

632
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,300
you're going to have problems, right?

633
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,580
Either that or you're a victim of some social engineering, right?

634
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:21,980
Yeah.

635
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:27,020
Like bacon and eggs and diamonds are forever kind of thing and fossil fuel.

636
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:31,280
All right, so again, I'm not going to be reading anything,

637
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,440
but I'm going to be referencing where people are interested to do their own research.

638
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:34,860
Good.

639
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,860
Okay, so the essence of the story is very simple.

640
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,520
And here's the thing.

641
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:48,420
Like with the JFK research, especially 9-11, 9-11 was a wake-up call, an alarm to wake up.

642
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:54,280
So people hit the snooze button, and the snooze alarm went off in 2020 with the pandemic,

643
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,000
and they're still not waking up.

644
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:59,900
So the next one is going to be kind of – you get the point?

645
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,460
The 9-11 was supposed to wake you up.

646
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:03,560
It didn't.

647
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:07,160
Snooze button, 2020, hit the snooze, right?

648
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:14,080
Snooze alarm, usually this is 15 minutes or so, so 19 years later, still asleep, right?

649
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,120
So this is – I'm not addressing those people.

650
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,680
But here's the thing.

651
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,900
What happened on 9-11 is still a secret.

652
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:24,860
That's why you have all these people still trying to discuss it and putting –

653
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:28,640
but it has been exposed for what it is on many, many levels.

654
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:34,100
If you look, the only person that I know that has a good handle on it is Dmitry Kaluzov, okay?

655
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:40,720
The only thing that he doesn't mention that he agrees, and he almost said that he forgot, is the smells, right?

656
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:47,000
Because it was ionization, and you only get that smell from ionization, okay?

657
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,040
Now here's the point with the scripture.

658
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:57,020
Everything you know about the Bible that you've gotten from religion, movies,

659
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:01,500
or even reading the versions is not so, pretty much.

660
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:06,840
I haven't still – I've tried to meditate on that comment that I've mentioned.

661
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:11,760
Is there anything in Christianity that is accurate?

662
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,460
Nothing, zero, right?

663
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:21,520
So it's kind of like when you go on a construction site, sometimes you have people that literally can't read.

664
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,679
There was someone I remember.

665
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,100
He was much older than I was.

666
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:27,139
I was in my 20s.

667
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:32,920
Every week he'd come to me with the paycheck, and he'd ask me to read it, what was the amount on it.

668
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,679
I thought it was cute.

669
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:38,139
Then after a while, I figured out he didn't know how to read, and he was like in his late 40s.

670
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:41,540
So there are people like that don't know how to read or can't read.

671
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:47,060
There's also people on a construction site, when you ask them how wide is that board,

672
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:49,780
and they'll say it's 49 inches and three lines.

673
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:52,360
Three lines?

674
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:55,159
Is that three-sixteenths or three-quarters or what?

675
00:34:55,179 --> 00:35:01,620
They didn't know how to read a tape measure, which is – I can understand that to a certain point.

676
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,180
But the ones that didn't want to learn were going to have problems,

677
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:12,620
but the ones that admitted that they didn't know and wanted to learn, I think were able to proceed in advance, let's say.

678
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,860
So this is very similar to that.

679
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,480
But here's the thing.

680
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:23,880
Anything and everything that's contained information-wise, and knowledge and information are not the same thing, by the way,

681
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,340
which is another thing.

682
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:34,520
If you have knowledge of what's trying to be communicated, people that only have, for example, information on the Bible,

683
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:40,460
if they go to court, they tell them to swear on it, and they think the version of King James is a holy relic.

684
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:45,600
People that are knowledgeable of the Bible, if they go to court and they say –

685
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,820
well, actually, you don't have to swear, you affirm, but put your hand on the Bible.

686
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,060
No, no, I don't have to put my hand on the Bible.

687
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,660
I have it here on this smartphone.

688
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,740
I have it all downloaded.

689
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,260
Can I put my hand on that?

690
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,300
No.

691
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:59,040
Or I have it here on a CD.

692
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,640
I have the whole Bible downloaded on a CD or DVD.

693
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,500
Can I put my hand on that?

694
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:04,440
No.

695
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,160
Why?

696
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:12,860
Because not – you see, so people that know the scriptures know it as a form of communication.

697
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,720
It's not this pagan thing, the amulet.

698
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,800
I remember when, before I did work here, the office door wouldn't stay open,

699
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:26,500
so I just put a stack of Bibles as a doorstop to keep it from opening, because at the time I was collecting them, right?

700
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,500
You get it?

701
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:37,960
All right, so what we're going to be giving and speaking on in this long-winded prefix is knowledge of the scripture.

702
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,740
The information is up to you.

703
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,820
So everything is secret.

704
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:49,240
So in short, in short, let's just jump to the meaty part about there's no crucifixion.

705
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:56,840
In short, I've always mentioned that when you have something that's chronological, right,

706
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:02,120
and it's a saga, meaning it starts off with certain situations,

707
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:08,640
and then someone appears or a situation appears where it climaxes, you know, there's a peak to the story, right?

708
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,920
And then it continues after that, whether it ends well or ends poorly.

709
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,480
That is a cumulative book.

710
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:22,320
In other words, if you pick it up in the end and you don't know anything that came before that,

711
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,420
it's not going to make any sense.

712
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:29,080
Well, you might—you're trying to make sense of what you're reading, but you don't know what came before it.

713
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,160
So it's cumulative, you see?

714
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:35,580
Turn to the last chapter of just a pedestrian sort of novel,

715
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:40,100
and they tell you the ship sank and the little girl cried on the last page,

716
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,380
and you go, okay, well, I don't know what happened.

717
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,140
But reference manuals, like here, I've got some 1920s Britannicas here,

718
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:51,280
and I could take the last one, which is the letter Z.

719
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:52,980
No problem.

720
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,440
I could open that and just study it just fine.

721
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,280
It's just an—you see?

722
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:00,580
The biblical text is not encyclopedic.

723
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,240
It's actually—it's a chronology.

724
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:10,820
So one of the things that you know is in the conspiratorial world, you're called a nutcase if you bring up any—

725
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,400
if you ask for any information, right?

726
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:17,800
Because the society—part of what we're doing is called rated—what's rated Y,

727
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:21,460
and the motto of it is the unculting of humanity.

728
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:28,500
So one of the aspects of being—how do you know you're in a cult is you cannot question the leadership.

729
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,940
That's a very basic one, right?

730
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:37,660
And also, you know, in order to keep people controlled in a cult, you give them poor food quality because the poor food, right?

731
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,540
They lose their stamina, mental stamina.

732
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:48,000
So in a conspiratorial world, when you ask for more information or question what the mainstream or the politicians say,

733
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:53,260
you're called a nutcase, a wingnut, conspiracy theorist, denigrated, whatever.

734
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:59,060
So if you approach a Christian about the Old Testament, what do they say?

735
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,560
Oh, that's been a done away with.

736
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,500
Are you Jewish?

737
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:02,360
Right?

738
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,420
Same exact cult phenomenon.

739
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,060
So going on.

740
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,260
All right.

741
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:16,480
So if you just get into the meat of the story, it has to happen from the beginning all the way through.

742
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,440
So now you've eliminated everything before.

743
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,140
Of course, you're going to be manipulated.

744
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,140
And the more manipulation there is, I'll give you an example.

745
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:33,020
I think when Trump was still in, he went and visited and paid homage and venerated the Shanksville Memorial,

746
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,380
and they even put a bunch of airplane parts, even though when the plane supposedly went down,

747
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,860
there were no airplane parts found whatsoever.

748
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:44,120
But the Shanksville Memorial now in Pennsylvania has airplane parts in it.

749
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,780
And he even went there and said, oh, these are all right.

750
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:55,040
The same thing you see now with all the Christian religions, all of them together, they venerate all this other stuff.

751
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:58,460
So they make stuff where it never was that way.

752
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,780
It never was that way to begin with.

753
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:00,400
Yeah.

754
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:04,360
Now the simple beginner Greek speak is like this.

755
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:10,820
By the time you get to the New Testament, the Old Testament progresses, let's say, from grammar school to high school.

756
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,360
When you get to the New Testament, that would be graduate degree stuff.

757
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:22,020
Like the Book of Matthew would be your entire undergraduate, and the rest of it is graduate-level stuff.

758
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:33,500
So you have people that profess themselves to be quote-unquote Christian and believe in whatever that have not changed

759
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:37,720
or are pretty much the same mindset as they were when they were five, six, seven, eight, or nine,

760
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,800
when they were first introduced to these concepts.

761
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:49,140
Their concepts now, they think they're more evolved because they just keep reading that part that they're told to read and not the rest.

762
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,760
But actually they're very immature.

763
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:59,960
The example that I give is let's say you're graduate-level physics, and you go to lecture a bunch of five-year-olds for an hour.

764
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,700
There's a room full of them, let's say.

765
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,860
After an hour, you say, any questions?

766
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,360
And they all raise their hands.

767
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:06,620
All right.

768
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,380
What's the question?

769
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,280
Do you have any candy?

770
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:10,400
All right.

771
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,640
Now, if you isolated – no questions about what you were talking about at all.

772
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:21,320
Now, if you isolated those five-year-olds amongst that subject, right,

773
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:27,820
and 30, 40 years later or 20 years later you went and lectured them again and asked them any questions,

774
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,440
it won't be like, do you have any candy?

775
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:33,640
It will be like, Mark, can I use the bathroom or something like that, right?

776
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,060
Nothing.

777
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:37,300
So that's the difference, but it's still the same context.

778
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,900
They know nothing about what's going on.

779
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:46,840
With that said, from the engineering point of view, from the 10-story building to the 100-story building,

780
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:53,160
how much has to be supported, you go back to what they are referring to,

781
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:57,080
and they tell you to read that New Testament thing, right?

782
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:58,120
Okay.

783
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,520
That's graduate-level.

784
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:05,940
When you take, let's say, graduate-level mathematics in university is your first day in class,

785
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,180
okay, what's one plus one?

786
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:09,860
Very good.

787
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,720
Three times three, you know your times tables, right?

788
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,100
No, it's cumulative.

789
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:20,280
So at this point, when you have the individual that's mentioned in there,

790
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:27,380
there is no detail on the specifics because, first of all,

791
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:31,460
all the information in there is addressed to a certain group of people,

792
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:34,060
and they're not Christians, by the way, right?

793
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,080
And you know what?

794
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:39,340
They weren't even Jewish, as we know Judaism today, okay?

795
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,640
They were just pursuing a certain way of life.

796
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,820
They were part of a community.

797
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:48,180
Now, I want to go back to basic Greek-speak.

798
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:52,080
This is real, real basic stuff, and I'll give it this way,

799
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,140
and then I'll give some references and just reiterate.

800
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,840
So the Christ, even if you just watch the movies and you'll see the sleight of hand,

801
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:05,960
he is arrested by the Judean religious authorities.

802
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,940
They actually indicted him.

803
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:14,320
The Pharisees and some Sadducees got together and had an indictment against him,

804
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:20,200
a grand jury type situation in private where they were saying such and such and such,

805
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:20,980
we have to get him.

806
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:26,020
And there was some retort, you know, why don't we just lick a demon so allegedly?

807
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,440
Why don't we let him go?

808
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:31,860
Look how many other messiahs tried to do this, and they ran to the hills never to come back.

809
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,320
But the head priest Caiaphas says, no, we have to arrest him.

810
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,860
We have to get him to save the nation.

811
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:41,320
Okay, so it's a double entendre.

812
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:45,600
You see this all the time where something is said and it means multiple things.

813
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:49,200
Okay, so now here's the thing.

814
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:53,880
Before I continue, there's so many biblical naysayers.

815
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:55,040
You know, oh, it's not true.

816
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:55,640
It was forged.

817
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:57,200
It was copied and all this stuff.

818
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:02,760
But the only time I look at what they say, you know, a lot of people say the Bible is written there.

819
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:03,780
It was copied off of that.

820
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:04,800
No, it wasn't really copied.

821
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,720
I haven't seen no evidence of that.

822
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:09,100
And the evidence that they give is very weak and very narrow.

823
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:19,360
And the reason I don't give any biblical commentary, even the ones that are academic, especially academic, any credence,

824
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:25,640
and I have to rely on doing my own work, is because no one comes out with what we're going to be saying today,

825
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:29,800
which is so obvious and in your face once you hear it, right?

826
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:32,760
Now, once you hear this, if you don't see it, that's fine.

827
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:40,260
But if you see it after you hear me explain it or anyone that explains something similar, it does two things.

828
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:45,060
One, well, now you have a revelation on something that you thought you knew that was in front of you the whole time,

829
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,700
but you didn't know it, right?

830
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:49,880
And it also realizes you how censored you are.

831
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:53,280
You're lifting off a piece of censorship.

832
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,940
And the censorship is invisible.

833
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:58,380
It's not tangible even physically.

834
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,160
It's just like rearranging yourself again.

835
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,600
We're building a hundred-story building that looks like a ten-story building.

836
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:06,300
What does it take?

837
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,040
I'm not an engineer.

838
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:10,120
But sure, you just have to approach it logically, right?

839
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,300
It looks the same.

840
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,340
It's ten times the material.

841
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:16,980
But you have to realize how much weight each floor holds, and that makes it very, very different.

842
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,940
So you can loosely apply that to what we're speaking on, on the biblical,

843
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:26,560
because if you're going to read the New Testament, you have to be standing on what came before.

844
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,660
And that was actually one of the comments there.

845
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:32,780
So let's go back to he was arrested by the religious authorities,

846
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:37,740
which they do have their own military police-type order-keeping force,

847
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,860
just like the Vatican has the Swiss Guard, right?

848
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:43,340
Well, actually, that's for the building.

849
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:44,980
They have the Jesuits, right?

850
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:45,800
Right, right.

851
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,340
So, yeah, and whatever.

852
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:55,220
By the way, if you're an ordained Catholic priest, do it anymore.

853
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:01,120
They say, you go up to whatever they call the higher-ups, and they say,

854
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,440
okay, well, here, go see this person.

855
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,580
And they give you a name and a phone number and an address.

856
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:10,200
And the person goes and shows up, and it's the CIA office in their nearest city.

857
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:14,300
It's like you're an honorary CIA agent.

858
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:15,680
Isn't that some crazy stuff?

859
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:23,400
This is from someone that it's happened to, and their sister gave me the lowdown on that.

860
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,460
You go to the building where they tell you to go, and you go to the floor,

861
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,620
and it's the CIA office.

862
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,020
Can you imagine?

863
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:37,980
But anyway, the protection that they have, and the police and the army or whatever,

864
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:43,100
the force, paramilitary, was set out to go arrest the Christ.

865
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:45,080
Now, I'm going to throw something in there.

866
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:49,820
One of his abilities, when I speak about abilities, by the way,

867
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,460
I think you and I, Chuck, brought something up.

868
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:56,100
When you hear of someone with special abilities, if one person can do it, everyone can do it.

869
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,480
It's just that person happens to be able to see how to do it.

870
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,200
It's just like Tiger Woods really good at golf.

871
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:04,660
You know what?

872
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,520
Everybody, anybody can play golf, and everybody, as a matter of fact,

873
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:10,640
even if you're in a wheelchair, they'll make the ADA, whatever,

874
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:12,980
compliance will make sure that you get something going.

875
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:15,500
But you're not going to play it as well.

876
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,800
One of the things that was very well known that you won't find in the New Testament,

877
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:25,100
nothing that I'm saying is emphasized in the New Testament, right?

878
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:28,440
Just like when you go to graduate-level mathematics,

879
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:32,380
do they emphasize your times tables and your addition and subtraction tables?

880
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:34,220
Do they emphasize that? No.

881
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:36,160
No, the assumption is you've already covered it.

882
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,660
And you're expert in it, and you're expert.

883
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:41,080
Yeah, the assumption of the New Testament is you are expert,

884
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:45,700
not just read it, you are expert in comprehension of everything that came before it.

885
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,620
As it's said, by the way, later on,

886
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,180
not into it, paraphrasing-wise.

887
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:54,740
All right, so where were we?

888
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:59,460
So the Christ, one of his abilities was he had the ability of invisibility,

889
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:04,320
which is not like the invisible man where you see him only when he's wrapped up with bandages,

890
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:05,360
not like that.

891
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:09,080
But he would make himself disappear from your perception.

892
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:14,460
So a crowd of people want to molest him or throw him off or whatever.

893
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:21,200
Amongst the crowd, he escapes by just turning around and walking right through them, right?

894
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,360
And it's not only with a crowd.

895
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:27,700
If he came to your door, knocked on the door and says,

896
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:30,940
Would you make me some coffee? I need some help or whatever.

897
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:31,360
Sure.

898
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:35,380
And he sat down with you for three hours and spoke.

899
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:38,100
And if I asked you the next day, what did he look like?

900
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:39,800
You wouldn't be able to describe him.

901
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:42,720
How strange is that?

902
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,260
Now, that was borrowed in Men in Black.

903
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:50,080
Remember when he says, When you put on this uniform, people you meet, you will just be a whatever, right?

904
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,860
You become a vague memory, the stuff of rumors, et cetera.

905
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:56,220
Yeah, you just become a vague memory.

906
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:01,280
Okay, no need to give personal examples.

907
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,360
No problem.

908
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:03,780
Do you understand what it is?

909
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:08,500
Because I've had certain things where I've practiced that, and it works.

910
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:11,360
Maybe on the emo discussion.

911
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:17,480
Yeah, spoiler, just so you know, though, everybody who is listening to this right now,

912
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:21,540
anyone who is listening and comprehends what's being said, you are capable of this.

913
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:22,420
Of course.

914
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:22,840
Go ahead.

915
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:26,680
But not like, in other words, you could hit a golf ball with a club,

916
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:31,500
but you may not have the ranking and the score, the number sheet as Tiger Woods.

917
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,620
No, no, no, I'm not saying that you can do it with…

918
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:35,560
Yeah, and so many holes.

919
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,040
Remember, in golf, it's the fewer, the lower the number, the better.

920
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,060
Look, I can build a table right now, okay?

921
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,180
I can build one practically, no problem.

922
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:44,660
But, you know, the blind guy swinging a hammer and cutting stuff

923
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:49,240
might not quite do as well as somebody who's done it a hundred times, et cetera,

924
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,920
and someone who has practiced at it.

925
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,360
Just saying.

926
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:53,180
I bet I could do it.

927
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,340
This is not to denigrate.

928
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:58,380
I'm just saying that all these things have found,

929
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:03,120
all the things that you hear about Christ doing have a very strong foundation

930
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,520
and basis in all of our natural systems.

931
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:09,380
But if you don't understand how natural things really work,

932
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:14,180
you can easily think that it's something else.

933
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,740
Let's just say, I'm not going to say miracle, because miracles do happen,

934
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,980
but they're not as we're told.

935
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:20,580
It's just compression of time.

936
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,040
So the Christ is arrested,

937
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:28,580
and the priests knew that the people that they're going to send,

938
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,760
no matter how well they described him,

939
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:35,120
because even they could not see him, right?

940
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:39,880
They would have to acknowledge him by how he spoke,

941
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,980
and he knew this was coming.

942
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:45,260
So when they give him a description, you know,

943
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,840
like when the police are looking for someone, if they got you in the database,

944
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,160
they'll take the photo you have for the driver's license

945
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:53,100
and blow it up to an eight-and-a-half by 11, right?

946
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:56,640
So even if they did something like that,

947
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,760
they know that they still would not be able to be recognized.

948
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:07,000
So they needed a very direct, first-hand, tactile identification.

949
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:10,560
In other words, someone that knew him really well,

950
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:14,920
that knew that his followers were not subject to this invisibility.

951
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:17,100
So they got Judas.

952
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:18,520
Let's just say those stories.

953
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:20,100
It has nothing to do with what you believe in or not.

954
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:21,940
To kiss him.

955
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:28,800
The New Testament doesn't tell you that the only way the Christ could be identified

956
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:32,600
is with a kiss because he had the power of invisibility.

957
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,080
It doesn't say that, does it?

958
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:35,480
No.

959
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,140
At all in the New Testament.

960
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:37,620
No.

961
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,960
But we know that he has the power of being vague.

962
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:44,360
What I mean by invisible is, you know,

963
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,220
if you're in a room with ten people, they're only going to count nine.

964
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:51,040
And then, like, isn't there someone else here?

965
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:51,880
Oh, yeah, wait a second.

966
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,140
Yeah, there's a tenth guy here.

967
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,100
You see, like that.

968
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:57,680
So in other words, just nonchalant.

969
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,840
You could be your vague memory or vague perception.

970
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:05,660
So how come people don't ask why he had to be kissed directly, right?

971
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,400
Because, well, we've given examples prior to that, you see.

972
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:10,460
Okay.

973
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,700
He's arrested by the Judean authorities, sort of.

974
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,480
You could read the parts.

975
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:19,500
It's harmonized in the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.

976
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,220
Some of the books don't harmonize.

977
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:21,780
Some do.

978
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,620
I mean, usually in pairs.

979
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,360
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.

980
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:29,780
All these things were prophesied specifically in the book of Isaiah

981
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:31,340
and in the Psalms, by the way.

982
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:39,520
So this is the compounding and accumulation of all the works that you have to have

983
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:42,680
in order to see what I'm saying, how obvious it is.

984
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:47,440
Once you hear it, he's brought in a sort of,

985
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:51,460
I'm not going to get into how the trial allegedly transpired.

986
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:57,860
Then after he's considered guilty as accused,

987
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:03,760
which actually the accusations kind of changed, but they stayed pretty much guilty.

988
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:09,520
Then he was brought through the judicial system.

989
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:11,320
You have procedure, right?

990
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:16,060
When you go to certain things, they call it, like in jail, they call it intake.

991
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:17,860
You've got to go to intake and then holding.

992
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,620
The police arrest you.

993
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:21,140
They identify who you are.

994
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:23,340
Then they bring you up for charges.

995
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,060
Then those charges are billed out.

996
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:25,560
Yeah, okay.

997
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:28,780
Yeah, so you have all these procedures, and they run you through.

998
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:29,840
You see what it is.

999
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:35,560
Then he's brought to the Judean political or ministerial authority,

1000
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:39,100
which is Herod Jr., let's say.

1001
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:42,820
He kind of heard about him.

1002
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:46,920
There's this interchange, and he gives him a robe, right,

1003
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,280
which is very high value, let's say.

1004
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:51,640
Then he's carded off.

1005
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:57,880
This is over days now of interaction in this setting,

1006
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,180
because the setting is very important.

1007
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,340
Whenever you read something, what is the setting?

1008
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,220
Like what time of day is it?

1009
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,560
The geography.

1010
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,600
How many people are there?

1011
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:08,300
Is he alone?

1012
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:08,920
You see?

1013
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,340
Try to pick up on all of that.

1014
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,700
As if you're making a film.

1015
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,420
They call it storyboarding.

1016
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:18,520
You put in the details what the scene is going to look like, right?

1017
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,680
Well, you have to do that.

1018
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:22,060
That's why a lot of people say,

1019
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:25,420
go ahead and just read the red letters in the Bible.

1020
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:30,600
I mean, sometimes I'll put a video on, and someone will bring up the word.

1021
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:34,320
My wife and I are listening, and we're laughing our ass off.

1022
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,460
I said, just the only part that's important is read the red letter part.

1023
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,360
I said, yeah, but you don't know the setting and what that's being said in.

1024
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,480
Right, because that's what the JES.

1025
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:44,320
It's out of context.

1026
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,820
Yeah, the JESUS character said this.

1027
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:47,740
Okay, that's great.

1028
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,220
But what's the context of it, right?

1029
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:53,160
See, everyone has always got him as love, love, love.

1030
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:58,700
But the only time he said anything about love and compassion is when he was with his private group

1031
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:00,880
in a private setting in a closed house.

1032
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:06,160
Everyone else, he was pretty much like, just ignore them.

1033
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:09,200
Or, you know, you're better off Sodom and Gomorrah.

1034
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,880
You would have been better off if you were in Sodom and Gomorrah.

1035
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:13,020
What's going to happen to you?

1036
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:19,220
He was the most hateful character in the entire biblical narration, hands down, by far,

1037
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:23,240
in terms of the public and in terms of the collective.

1038
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,200
Completely abhorred.

1039
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:26,880
Just hate.

1040
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:28,460
Hate is a mild term.

1041
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:32,860
And anyone who reads this, I've had people message me,

1042
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:39,080
reads what's called the New Testament in context as I'm saying it,

1043
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,580
says, God, I can't believe I've been reading this for like 25 years,

1044
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:44,980
and the first time I see it, yeah, he's extremely hateful.

1045
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:47,140
And, you know, all right.

1046
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:54,020
So all that love stuff is only to the people that were closest to him in private, right?

1047
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:55,920
So I'm not saying that you need to do it.

1048
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:59,780
I'm just giving the information so you have a certain amount of information.

1049
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,600
I'm giving the knowledge of it.

1050
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:05,660
You find whatever you think is information that applies to you.

1051
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:07,280
Well, this is a report, okay?

1052
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:08,460
This is what happened.

1053
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:11,160
You're not judging it or trying to spin it.

1054
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,860
This is just what is, okay?

1055
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:13,560
That's what's there.

1056
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:16,780
The report on this is I'm trying to be linear

1057
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:20,820
but showing you how fat the ground floor has to be

1058
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:24,900
because you have to support 99 stories, not just nine.

1059
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:30,080
You notice how I'm not just recapping like I usually give in the standard

1060
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:32,500
start here, first Greek-speak stuff,

1061
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:38,040
because the 100-story building, the first floor is really, really robust

1062
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,980
because it has to hold all this other stuff.

1063
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:47,580
So when you find out who the character of this venerated individual in the Bible is,

1064
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,680
you'll see right away 180 opposing view

1065
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:56,620
to what the religions that supposedly have captured this character,

1066
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:59,640
not even a name, by the way, are portraying.

1067
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:08,400
And when I say that, by the way, J-E-S-U-S is a metric, okay?

1068
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:11,320
It is a metric that is used.

1069
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:14,660
You want to call them Illuminati, Freemasons, the elite.

1070
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:20,920
They rename things deliberately and put words out there to see how people will use it,

1071
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:24,240
and that is an easy gauge for them.

1072
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:27,100
When I say gauge literally, I mean it literally,

1073
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:30,540
just like if you're, let's say, you're using what they call a car,

1074
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,240
you have a gasoline gauge and you rely on it, right?

1075
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:39,860
So if the needle goes down to empty and you're on a long trip, do you heed to it?

1076
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:40,680
Of course.

1077
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,100
Oh, let's just ignore that, you know?

1078
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:43,760
No.

1079
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:46,660
Okay, so literally it is a gauge.

1080
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:49,660
So the J-E, there are many words that are metric words,

1081
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:55,400
and the main ones are ownership words like my, this is my thing or whatever.

1082
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:58,540
I've gone into that in the previous Sonic.

1083
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,000
So this is very important.

1084
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:07,160
It's not to condemn anyone, but when you see people using the J-E-S-U-S word,

1085
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:11,780
that's been put out there to see how many people know,

1086
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:17,720
and the more people that use it, that means the more people don't know what's going on, right?

1087
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:18,800
It's very simple.

1088
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,420
There are many metric words like that.

1089
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:24,740
If someone is really savvy and is a wordsmith,

1090
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:29,880
I would one day appreciate some help to put together a collection of metric words,

1091
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:32,840
words that are used as metrics.

1092
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:38,400
I have not used, you notice on this Rated Y, a lot of the previous Greek-speak terms,

1093
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:42,420
you know, like dummy load and space heaters.

1094
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:45,820
On the old ONG, I had a collection.

1095
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:49,360
I think every time we did an episode, I came up with another Greek-speak type term,

1096
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,580
you know, or every other one, you know.

1097
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:55,980
Someone once put a collection together, about 26 of them or 24 of them that are unique.

1098
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:01,420
I haven't been using those, and I haven't really been coming up with too many more.

1099
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:05,040
Well, anyway, I just wanted to throw that in there.

1100
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:05,580
No problem.

1101
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:13,420
But the J-E-S-U-S is a metric term there, and what I'm saying is use it if you need to,

1102
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:22,100
but it's not necessary because it's Joshua, or Joshua if you have to use the J, it's totally fine.

1103
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:23,940
And there is a book of Joshua.

1104
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:25,580
It's totally fine.

1105
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:30,400
You know, that's a very simple way to break the metric.

1106
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:36,020
So that's the report so far, and now we're going to jump.

1107
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:38,820
Well, yeah, because you were still on the story here, okay?

1108
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:39,280
Yeah.

1109
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:44,420
You talked about, you know, where they had taken them, and they're in the process now.

1110
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:46,840
The next part is very well known.

1111
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:47,920
Do you want to get into that?

1112
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:48,720
Yeah, yeah.

1113
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:54,420
Well, the next part, well, and the story so far, yeah, but we're not done so far.

1114
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:59,440
He's brought to Pontius Pilate, right?

1115
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:00,220
Why?

1116
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:05,040
Because he is the Prefect Governor of Judea.

1117
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:08,880
Now, the story behind anyone that was assigned.

1118
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:14,480
Now, the Romans just, well, I can't imagine any society that wouldn't be.

1119
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:16,920
The Romans were excellent bookkeepers.

1120
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,140
They liked education.

1121
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:27,040
They had a certain law that was actually quite free and open and very, very civil.

1122
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:31,040
As a matter of fact, a lot of patriots complain about Roman civil law.

1123
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:38,640
So before they send someone to, just like today, to rule over a group of people, be a Prefect Governor,

1124
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:48,580
in other words, Judea was as far east as they could go because they couldn't go further over the Jordan

1125
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:55,000
because the Parthian Empire was there, and it didn't last very well.

1126
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:01,860
In other words, any time the Romans tried to make progress to the east, they got their butts whipped,

1127
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:03,600
I mean, really, really bad.

1128
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:10,560
So the Romans were powerful as they were, but they couldn't do anything about moving eastward,

1129
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,200
and that's another story.

1130
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:18,080
But anyone could study the Seleucids and the Parthians, how they were really badass,

1131
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:24,880
and at any point in history, other than natural calamities preventing,

1132
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:29,000
the Parthians could have taken over everything the Romans had.

1133
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:30,880
No big deal, no problem.

1134
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,600
So there was a truce at that point.

1135
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:40,380
Yeah, but the basic point is that this territory is controlled by a representative of the one who conquered it,

1136
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,020
which would be the Roman Empire at the time.

1137
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,160
This is Pontius Pilate.

1138
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:50,160
Pontius Pilate being that represented that he was at the most eastward part, furthest away,

1139
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:58,160
in terms of east-west, and also it represented that he was in a very rich cultural part,

1140
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:02,680
central-type area, and before he was sent there,

1141
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:06,700
he had to know all of the laws and rituals and customs just like today.

1142
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:09,820
Which, by the way, you can read the Roman history on this if you want to,

1143
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:14,180
which is separate, and they were good bookkeepers when it came to this kind of stuff,

1144
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:16,600
and did have a decent collection of histories,

1145
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,280
where you can see that literally there was a purpose behind the control,

1146
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:26,920
and it was seen as the frontier of that particular expansion in that direction.

1147
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:31,180
Or the termination. They couldn't go beyond it.

1148
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:37,780
This is not very popular because it shows like a stain on Roman history.

1149
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:44,620
So he was also a friend of Tiberius Claudius Caesar, who was a historian,

1150
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:50,180
and they wrote letters back and forth quite often, as terms of the history that we have.

1151
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:55,160
So he's brought to Pontius Pilate, and there's several things that happen there.

1152
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:57,140
There's an interaction. I won't get into that.

1153
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:02,180
You could read that, the interaction between Yahshua, the Christ, and him,

1154
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,460
and it's very civil.

1155
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:11,760
There's an interjection of comments from his wife.

1156
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:16,440
We've heard of politicians and notary people of power,

1157
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:19,120
where their wives were involved in influencing them.

1158
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:24,880
For example, Woodrow Wilson's wife pretty much ran the country for the last year he was in office.

1159
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:30,000
He was too sick to come out into public, so she would say,

1160
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,880
just give me the paperwork. No one ever saw him.

1161
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:35,940
She'd go in and she would give the paperwork back.

1162
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:40,580
Any type of imperial structure you can find, kings and queens and stuff like that,

1163
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:44,340
where the king's office is what's important, but the queen has a great deal of influence,

1164
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:48,980
despite the fact that they're not technically part of the influence according to the government,

1165
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:50,980
but they influence the king.

1166
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:55,360
For instance, you had the queen mother there that was in office for a very long time,

1167
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:56,660
and everybody talks about the queen,

1168
01:03:56,660 --> 01:04:01,940
but really what it was is that she had control of the king's office, and so on.

1169
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:02,940
So, yeah, yeah, go ahead.

1170
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:08,420
All right, so in this case, this is mentioned in the story that she said,

1171
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:12,660
leave this man be, I've had dreams about this, right?

1172
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:17,280
Now, you have to realize that dream interpretation in pagan culture,

1173
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:22,580
in any culture, is very, very important, right?

1174
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:28,420
They take it as a fact that if a dream is interpreted, the results of that interpretation are fact.

1175
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:33,900
So she discouraged him, and he also, from his own reasoning,

1176
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:40,400
if you study Roman law, anyone could plead to go to Caesar, right?

1177
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:45,000
So if there was a plea to see Caesar, he would have to be held in a carcer,

1178
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:48,700
which is a citadel, or it's where you get the word incarceration from,

1179
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:54,780
and he could be shipped off to Rome, or they had places, you didn't have to go to Rome,

1180
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:59,040
but other places in the empire that were considered, just like you have a district court, right?

1181
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,960
They're not all in Washington, D.C., anyway, it gets technical.

1182
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:03,940
So he didn't want any of that mess.

1183
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:08,640
Also, there's evidence, historic evidence, writings, and whether it's true or not,

1184
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:13,080
that he had pretty much gotten familiar with him in the past.

1185
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:16,740
Pontius Pilate got familiar with Yahshua,

1186
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:23,840
and his comments, as preserved today, are that he didn't see him to be speaking out against Rome or anything like that.

1187
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,000
He kind of liked him.

1188
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:30,260
He didn't know if he struck him to be like a philosopher or someone, right?

1189
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,520
So he had previous interaction.

1190
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:37,400
Now, the interesting part here, this is where the switch happens,

1191
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:44,060
but there is no switch, because if you read in the book of, I think it's Mark and Luke,

1192
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:47,940
it gives the interaction, those two books give the interaction in different ways.

1193
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:54,980
I don't see it as being, I don't know how they switched, it's just complete ignorance of what's in the text.

1194
01:05:55,700 --> 01:06:01,400
Pontius Pilate states to the Judean authorities that, you know,

1195
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:05,100
I'll discipline him, scorch him, whatever the words they use in the versions,

1196
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:08,420
and I'm going to return him back to you to use your law.

1197
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:12,820
And in one of the books, there's a retort where he says, how can we do it under Caesar?

1198
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:17,360
You know, the Judean authorities says, well, we're under Roman Empire, how could we use our law?

1199
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:18,840
And he says, I'm making this exception.

1200
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:31,140
So he's handed over to the Judeans indirectly to the point where you have Judean jurisprudence being applied,

1201
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:33,080
not Roman jurisprudence.

1202
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:38,760
So in this case, this is where it gets complicated for people, right?

1203
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:44,680
This is where it gets complicated, because through the rest of the quote-unquote sentencing and execution,

1204
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:45,980
there are Romans involved.

1205
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:50,160
Like, for example, there's a Roman that puts a spear through his side and all that, right?

1206
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:50,620
Right.

1207
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:52,060
Okay, so why?

1208
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:54,860
Well, why were the Romans involved?

1209
01:06:55,580 --> 01:07:03,920
We just went through kind of a slow iteration that Rome was ruling over Israel, right?

1210
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:05,740
Now, what does that mean?

1211
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:08,760
They were the occupying force and the occupying authority.

1212
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,620
And let's give this as a very basic analogy.

1213
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:17,160
Let's say you're in the United States of America and you're listening, right, or whatever country you're in.

1214
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:22,760
And your country was invaded 100 years prior, let's say the U.S. by, I don't know,

1215
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:26,220
do you want to call it the Germans or the Chinese or whatever?

1216
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,640
Let's just use the Chinese for now.

1217
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:36,000
So the highest authority in the land is the CCP, okay?

1218
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:37,880
They're sitting in Washington, D.C.

1219
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:42,020
They have their own buildings, and each state has their own CCP governor,

1220
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:49,580
and your local officials also are CCP, alongside your existing president or maybe not,

1221
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:52,360
or your existing whatever, Congress.

1222
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:54,180
It's totally possible, right?

1223
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:54,700
Okay.

1224
01:07:55,520 --> 01:08:00,300
Okay, so let's say you have something, a public event.

1225
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:04,340
It's the Super Bowl or the Fourth of July.

1226
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:10,960
When these events are held, like in the Super Bowl, you'll have police helicopters, military snipers.

1227
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:14,480
You know, they're prepared for trouble, right, and security that the government puts up, right?

1228
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:14,720
Sure.

1229
01:08:15,439 --> 01:08:18,340
But in this case, you could still have the Super Bowl by permission,

1230
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:23,319
but it's going to be all CCP, army, police, whatever.

1231
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:26,260
Let's say you want to do the Fourth of July.

1232
01:08:26,819 --> 01:08:32,080
You still do your fireworks show, but guess who lights the fireworks?

1233
01:08:32,439 --> 01:08:34,520
Someone from the CCP.

1234
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:35,660
Right, okay.

1235
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:36,160
Right?

1236
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:40,380
So let's go to a prison where they still have capital punishment.

1237
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:46,660
When they're going to put the guy in the chair or the lethal injection or hanging or firing squad,

1238
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:51,140
guess who's running that part of the prison and who's going to pull the switch?

1239
01:08:51,859 --> 01:08:52,420
CCP.

1240
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:54,500
You see?

1241
01:08:55,340 --> 01:09:03,200
Anything that's going to put authority or, like, for example, all these things that I mentioned are military or paramilitary.

1242
01:09:03,399 --> 01:09:08,120
The helicopters offering security at the Super Bowl are military.

1243
01:09:08,819 --> 01:09:16,740
So if you're already occupied by the CCP, everything in your military and high-level paramilitary is going to be CCP,

1244
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,460
even though your own people are there.

1245
01:09:18,819 --> 01:09:19,580
Very simple.

1246
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:29,660
So we switched over to Judean jurisprudence, and we know that it was the Law of Moses.

1247
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:38,580
And to say it's the Law of Moses and its capital punishment, it's lapidation, which is the technical term for stoning.

1248
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:44,700
And then we can get into the rest in great detail or stop right here.

1249
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:45,200
What do you think?

1250
01:09:46,859 --> 01:09:50,140
I think that should do it, really.

1251
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:59,220
I just have a quick question, though, because, look, what you're saying is, just to complete the full ring on this analogy,

1252
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:04,280
the CCP, you go to them, you say, okay, you're the occupying force, tell us what to do.

1253
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:07,020
This guy has disrupted stuff, basically.

1254
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:11,420
That was the general complaint that Pilate heard, from what I understand.

1255
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:17,780
And he said, look, I can deal with him about disruption, but the rest of this has nothing to do with me.

1256
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:21,200
It could. It could.

1257
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:27,940
But you decide to use the prevailing culture and the prevailing laws before you occupy.

1258
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:30,080
That's done often also.

1259
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:31,280
Why don't you deal with him?

1260
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:34,900
Because, again, like you said, first of all, it's a big pain in the neck.

1261
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:42,320
And to put him into that system, maybe he thought it wasn't a very good case against what was laid out as the Roman law.

1262
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:44,640
So that's that, right?

1263
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:48,420
And this could be the CCP says, well, look, he's not saying anything against the state.

1264
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:50,620
He disrupted the Super Bowl, right?

1265
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:52,120
Going back to the other part of the analogy.

1266
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:56,760
But, you know, really, a little disruption, all right, we'll give him tickets for that.

1267
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:57,880
We'll punish him a little.

1268
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:02,580
But, you know, maybe you guys should deal with him your way about this, since this is your case.

1269
01:11:02,580 --> 01:11:04,100
And that's exactly what happened.

1270
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:09,700
And it doesn't have to be a long-winded, long-running conversation or detail or footnote,

1271
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:16,020
because this is an account from those that were there or nearby, let's say.

1272
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:17,500
Let's continue real quick.

1273
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:18,980
So what happens?

1274
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:29,880
What happens with this is if we look at the book of Deuteronomy, a disobedient son is you're nailed to a tree.

1275
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:36,060
And also consider in the book of Joshua anything that's considered accursed.

1276
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:38,680
Being nailed to a tree is the worst way.

1277
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:46,400
It's a method of being stoned, because typically stoning was you would be beaten up so you don't run during the arrest, right?

1278
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:50,680
Well, actually, when you're arrested, you're kicked in.

1279
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:54,020
You're pretty much beaten up the whole time.

1280
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:57,880
So the Christ being beaten as he was was not unusual.

1281
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:03,080
As a matter of fact, growing up in the 70s and 80s, it was very typical.

1282
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:07,680
If you were of color and arrested in New York, you were beaten up.

1283
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:09,620
It was almost like a guarantee.

1284
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:10,480
You know what I mean?

1285
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:11,300
Yeah.

1286
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:12,160
Yep.

1287
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:21,020
So in this case, the beating and all of that punishment I didn't see as being unusual.

1288
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:26,980
Anyone that understands jurisprudence or police, it's very common.

1289
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:34,600
The interesting part, though, is that what people miss out on this is when it's a stoning,

1290
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:40,020
there's no talk about it other than in some cartoonish way.

1291
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:45,800
Or maybe when there was more stuff going on in the Middle East, let's say between 2003 and 2010,

1292
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:50,120
the kind of alternative media threw some things in there.

1293
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:54,280
You know, oh, they're stoning people in Afghanistan or Iraq or something like that.

1294
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:56,660
But people are not aware of it at all.

1295
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:03,800
Let's say you go somewhere in the future, and let's say society continues like it is,

1296
01:13:03,860 --> 01:13:05,640
which it's not, but let's just say it does.

1297
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:10,920
And you bring up an electric chair, let's say, a thousand years from now.

1298
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,720
People will just think it's just a piece of furniture.

1299
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:15,740
Like, oh, I never heard of that furniture, right?

1300
01:13:15,820 --> 01:13:17,120
It's an electric chair.

1301
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:17,600
Get it?

1302
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,560
If we have an electric blanket, what's an electric chair?

1303
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:26,440
They're not really familiar with its purpose or its methodology or how it was done.

1304
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:29,800
Hey, mom, I heard about an electric chair.

1305
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:30,660
Can we get one?

1306
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,180
You know, kind of like that.

1307
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:35,220
It has no bearing and no significance.

1308
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:39,420
Or even now today, or actually, again, growing up in the 70s,

1309
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,560
it was very common to say, what happened to this guy?

1310
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:43,480
Oh, they gave him the chair.

1311
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:44,160
Right?

1312
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:44,620
Remember that?

1313
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:45,140
Yeah.

1314
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:46,700
You don't hear that anymore.

1315
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:47,420
No, you don't.

1316
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:51,080
But to be given a chair, now if somebody looks at that a thousand years from now,

1317
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:52,460
well, okay, somebody gave him a gift.

1318
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:54,440
You don't know what, yeah.

1319
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:54,860
Right.

1320
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:56,080
Very far removed.

1321
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:57,980
So here's the thing.

1322
01:13:59,740 --> 01:14:01,560
This was a public spectacle.

1323
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:03,140
Now, there's a lot of things.

1324
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:04,980
We're just going from what's in the text.

1325
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:10,640
There's a lot of twists and turns and dual meanings in this.

1326
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:16,520
When you are stoned in a public fashion, you have to be with a lot of people.

1327
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:18,960
The higher up you are, just like if you're doing a rock concert,

1328
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:20,080
you don't do it at ground level.

1329
01:14:20,180 --> 01:14:22,060
You need what's called a stage, staging.

1330
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:29,480
So he and two others, I'm bypassing a lot of things here in between,

1331
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:33,080
because there's no reason to belabor the point.

1332
01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:36,160
Well, and it gives a good basic outline anyway that's relatable.

1333
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:40,640
Anybody can follow this, even given what they've been given in information,

1334
01:14:40,820 --> 01:14:43,060
like you said, in films, stories, books, all together.

1335
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:46,460
Yes, because we're not giving information.

1336
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:49,600
If you want all the information, you go and read it however you want.

1337
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:50,660
Here's the interesting thing.

1338
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:55,340
You can go to someone who really believes in the crucifixion and the J-E-S-U-S,

1339
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:57,620
and they could read.

1340
01:14:58,020 --> 01:15:00,320
Actually, I think I mentioned someone on his YouTube channel.

1341
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:03,140
He said they've read the Bible 50 times and have the notes to prove it,

1342
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:04,500
and they don't know what I'm talking about.

1343
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:07,620
This would be new to them also, and they've read it 50 times.

1344
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:09,740
So if you go to a quote-unquote Christian,

1345
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:13,400
he could read the Bible every day of his life for the rest of his life,

1346
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:16,360
however long it is, long or short, and he won't see what I'm saying.

1347
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:17,560
It's just amazing.

1348
01:15:18,020 --> 01:15:19,340
They won't be able to put it together.

1349
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:23,960
But we know, let's just say from a knowledge point of view,

1350
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:26,360
it's an almond tree, okay?

1351
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:33,320
So start looking up references on that almond tree, almond branch, not olive, right?

1352
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,340
And we know that he was front and center,

1353
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:41,120
and also the people were passing by from the third to the ninth hour

1354
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:42,860
or the sixth to the ninth hour was six hours,

1355
01:15:42,940 --> 01:15:44,900
so third to the ninth hour doing what?

1356
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:46,040
Passing by doing what?

1357
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:49,060
Waving, playing dice, what?

1358
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:50,020
Right?

1359
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:54,160
And he's high up on a tree, and he's front and center, one tree,

1360
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:57,040
and one man on his left, one man on his right.

1361
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:02,080
And if you read in the Psalms, all the flesh was torn off of his body

1362
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:04,360
because if you know that part of the world,

1363
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:08,920
the rocks are like decomposed granite and various types of shale, very sharp.

1364
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:09,940
Yep.

1365
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:15,220
You ever toss a playing card across the room, how it floats?

1366
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:17,340
And if that were to hit you really hard, right?

1367
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:21,660
Imagine that being made of stone, like pieces of broken tile almost.

1368
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:27,360
So he was front and center, and he passed first,

1369
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:32,900
and the man on his left got hit only on the right side,

1370
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:38,100
and the man on his right on the same tree only got hit on his left side.

1371
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:44,280
So their legs were severed to die because you don't die when you're nailed.

1372
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:48,200
And the nailing part, he carried a stake.

1373
01:16:49,620 --> 01:16:52,460
Many people, again, don't have the comprehension,

1374
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:56,160
and they think it was a stake like you put a fence post in the ground.

1375
01:16:58,180 --> 01:16:59,960
The body is very frail.

1376
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:03,300
You can literally pull people apart with not a lot of force, right,

1377
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:06,780
once the ligaments are torn and the skin breaks.

1378
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:10,580
So in order to be in such a position where you don't move,

1379
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:13,640
what would happen was you would be nailed to something

1380
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:17,140
that looked like a railroad tie on the ground,

1381
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:20,560
and then a rope is put around that railroad tie

1382
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:23,300
and pulled up, thrown over a branch like a lynching,

1383
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:26,600
and the individual is pulled up to the height

1384
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:30,920
that the crowd would have access to on their volley of rocks.

1385
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:34,920
And once it gets to a certain height that they think is the crowd,

1386
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:36,480
you know, it's high enough for the crowd,

1387
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:41,800
they tie the rope off and they put a nail through your feet

1388
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:43,600
to keep you in position, right?

1389
01:17:44,380 --> 01:17:46,440
And that's basically what you see.

1390
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:51,460
Now, the stake that he carried was, they do that out of shame

1391
01:17:52,620 --> 01:17:54,620
because it was a shaming also.

1392
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:55,980
It's a public execution.

1393
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:59,360
And the same thing is done in modern times.

1394
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:03,880
I remember, again, in the 1970s when people were being executed

1395
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,720
in a gas chamber or electric chair,

1396
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:09,920
they made sure that it was in the news prominently

1397
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:13,180
for at least two or three days or even a week before the event.

1398
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:14,060
Do you remember that, Chuck?

1399
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:17,240
Yeah, when they reinstated the death penalty in, what, 78?

1400
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:18,540
It was Gary Gilmore.

1401
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:20,680
That was the big one.

1402
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:22,300
It was in the news every day.

1403
01:18:22,820 --> 01:18:24,640
Oh, they're going to execute him in three days.

1404
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:26,280
Oh, they're going to execute him in two days.

1405
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:27,420
It was constantly.

1406
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:29,760
Right, and what they showed you was the crowd outside,

1407
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:32,460
you know, people that were anxiously awaiting his death

1408
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:34,680
versus people that were protesting, all that.

1409
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:36,680
Right, but what they do in public executions,

1410
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:41,120
it's very, very, very common that it's announced days before.

1411
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:44,640
There's the shaming aspect that's part of human culture to do that.

1412
01:18:45,140 --> 01:18:48,840
It sort of justifies the ends.

1413
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:53,600
It's a means to the end, you know, so shame you to the point

1414
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:58,420
where you're completely, when you lose all integrity,

1415
01:18:58,580 --> 01:19:00,080
there's no integrity left, right?

1416
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:03,440
Well, the other thing that is always assured with any sort of execution

1417
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:07,040
is that there are official witnesses that are selected

1418
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:10,060
and placed in a position so that they can view this directly

1419
01:19:10,060 --> 01:19:14,620
to be able to relate to the rest of the world that this happened,

1420
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:15,820
this person died.

1421
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:17,920
Well, that's the purpose of a public execution.

1422
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:18,960
It'd be a deterrent.

1423
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:19,220
Right.

1424
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:23,040
You know, whenever there's a crime problem and it's the same crime,

1425
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:26,520
I just say you need a public execution, not meaning a public execution,

1426
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:33,020
but an execution without the follow-up and the shaming has no effect on society.

1427
01:19:33,220 --> 01:19:38,820
It actually does on a higher level, like I said earlier on other sonics

1428
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:40,440
that I've been saying for three decades now.

1429
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:43,640
By the way, I've been speaking like this since the early 2000s.

1430
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:48,280
2010 is one decade, 2010s to the 20s is two decades,

1431
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:50,940
so 2020 and beyond is three decades, right?

1432
01:19:51,140 --> 01:19:53,340
So this is three decades of Greek speak now.

1433
01:19:53,380 --> 01:19:54,080
It's kind of crazy.

1434
01:19:55,960 --> 01:20:01,900
But the shaming aspect is when there's a certain crime repeatedly,

1435
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:04,060
what you need is a public execution.

1436
01:20:04,660 --> 01:20:06,220
That doesn't mean kill someone for stealing.

1437
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:11,660
If there's a lot of bike theft, you just find a bike thief and make a mockery of him

1438
01:20:11,660 --> 01:20:15,460
to the point where the mockery and the shaming is the deterrent, right?

1439
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:23,440
But from a lawful standpoint, the reason why you don't have prison in a lawful,

1440
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,460
you have jails, jails to protect people.

1441
01:20:25,660 --> 01:20:30,380
You don't have prisons in a lawful society because the payments are meted out.

1442
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:36,900
In other words, if you steal, you have to give back double what you stole

1443
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:38,080
or is it three times?

1444
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:38,720
I think it's double.

1445
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:41,580
And if you're totally broke, well, that's okay.

1446
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:42,600
You work as a servant.

1447
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:43,500
You work it off, right?

1448
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:44,320
There is no jail.

1449
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:46,480
If you murder deliberately, you're put to death.

1450
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:50,140
If it was an accident, what they call second-degree or third-degree murder,

1451
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:51,740
you can no longer live in that town.

1452
01:20:51,740 --> 01:20:53,880
There's a city of refuge, on and on and on and on.

1453
01:20:53,940 --> 01:20:55,860
There is no prison in a lawful society.

1454
01:20:56,040 --> 01:21:01,720
When you have prisons, the earth spirit, let's just say, the aspect of the earth,

1455
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:03,300
is saying, why are you keeping this?

1456
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:05,300
Why are you putting them in prison?

1457
01:21:05,380 --> 01:21:06,060
It doesn't help.

1458
01:21:06,180 --> 01:21:09,620
You have to have them mitigate the crime or put them to death, you see?

1459
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:13,340
So the very fact that there are prisons and people being held for life

1460
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:16,760
or all this stuff is going to bring problems on the earth,

1461
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:21,200
meaning you're going to have poisonous crops, droughts, earthquakes,

1462
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:22,460
all this other stuff.

1463
01:21:22,580 --> 01:21:24,100
The earth will react, right?

1464
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:26,480
I've discussed this loosely in the past,

1465
01:21:28,340 --> 01:21:32,680
because the earth and the sun are addressed directly as sentient beings.

1466
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:39,500
Our well-being is running alongside how the earth and the sun

1467
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:42,780
and all that perceives what we do from a lawful perspective.

1468
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:47,160
So these little points, we could keep going, by the way.

1469
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:50,940
Just the robe that was given to the Christ,

1470
01:21:51,060 --> 01:21:53,880
they cast lots for it before the event happened, right?

1471
01:21:54,260 --> 01:21:56,460
Why couldn't they just take it and leave?

1472
01:21:56,580 --> 01:21:58,900
Well, you know, they wanted to make it fair, cast lots,

1473
01:21:59,020 --> 01:22:01,120
but why was that point made?

1474
01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:08,600
Because when you are hanging from a tree, it's an accursed thing, right?

1475
01:22:08,620 --> 01:22:09,580
I'm giving hints here.

1476
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,360
You could look up these verses in the Bible.

1477
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:16,020
And anything that's an accursed thing is to be burned in several places.

1478
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:17,280
The Book of Joshua is one.

1479
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:19,300
I think there might be another one in the Book of Numbers.

1480
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:23,580
So at the end of this execution,

1481
01:22:24,820 --> 01:22:27,860
the three men that were nailed to the almond tree,

1482
01:22:28,060 --> 01:22:29,820
that tree would be set on fire,

1483
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:34,720
and they would be effectively cremated with all of their belongings as well.

1484
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:36,260
You see?

1485
01:22:36,860 --> 01:22:40,120
That's why you have in the story Joseph of Arimathea,

1486
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:44,620
the wealthy man who had premade himself a grave out of stone,

1487
01:22:44,980 --> 01:22:49,040
ran over the palisade from the Mount of Olives

1488
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:53,380
over to Pontius Pilate, who was on Fort Anatolia,

1489
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:55,180
which they call the Dome of the Rock now,

1490
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:56,940
to ask permission for the body.

1491
01:22:57,060 --> 01:22:58,620
He had to do it very fast, right?

1492
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:01,440
And the body was taken down.

1493
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:04,720
So when someone—here's more fraud and on and on and on.

1494
01:23:04,940 --> 01:23:07,420
When they say this is the piece of wood from the cross,

1495
01:23:08,540 --> 01:23:10,320
first of all, there's no cross, right?

1496
01:23:10,460 --> 01:23:11,160
A crucifix.

1497
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:13,880
And second of all, everything was burned, right?

1498
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:17,200
There's something called the menorah or the seven-branch lampstand,

1499
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:21,320
which was ordered to be made during the tabernacle days,

1500
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:26,360
and it also was something that proceeded along all the way until the temple days,

1501
01:23:27,820 --> 01:23:32,120
was to be made out of a piece of gold and have the likeness of an almond tree.

1502
01:23:32,660 --> 01:23:35,560
And what does the menorah or the lampstand do?

1503
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:37,000
You have fire, right?

1504
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:37,420
Right.

1505
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:39,100
And it had seven arms, right?

1506
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:41,620
So you have three men, two arms each in the air,

1507
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:44,600
plus the center one, the nerikadim, the center one.

1508
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:45,420
Okay?

1509
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:49,880
So actually when you look at a menorah—by the way,

1510
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:55,320
one that is biblical as it's directed to be built,

1511
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:58,460
prescribed in the Book of Exodus, for example,

1512
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:01,800
or throughout how to make this,

1513
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:03,920
one that doesn't exist.

1514
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:06,520
You won't find a true aspect of that.

1515
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:11,020
All you have to do is find out the directions of how to build the lampstand

1516
01:24:11,020 --> 01:24:13,340
and what it should look like with an eight-year-old that could sketch

1517
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:15,440
and have him sketch out as you're reading it,

1518
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:18,320
and it will be pretty accurate because it's very simple,

1519
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:22,060
and you'll see that there isn't one in existence today that looks like that

1520
01:24:22,060 --> 01:24:23,060
or functions like that.

1521
01:24:23,660 --> 01:24:25,640
So, quote, unquote, all of the Jewish people,

1522
01:24:25,740 --> 01:24:28,740
when they put their things up and they light them the way they do,

1523
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:32,780
it kind of loosely resembles, but I'll tell you for sure,

1524
01:24:32,780 --> 01:24:35,540
there is no menorah, quote, unquote,

1525
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:39,300
as it is prescribed to be built in the Bible in existence on the Internet.

1526
01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:43,160
The same goes for the Ark of the Covenant, by the way.

1527
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:45,660
I know what I'm saying sounds ridiculous, doesn't it?

1528
01:24:45,660 --> 01:24:46,160
But it's true.

1529
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:49,580
All you have to do is go to, like, some fourth graders

1530
01:24:49,580 --> 01:24:51,400
that are good at sketching and drawing,

1531
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:56,220
and while you're reading the text on prescribing how to make these things,

1532
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:58,740
have them draw it out, or a professional artist.

1533
01:24:58,880 --> 01:24:59,960
They'll probably charge you much,

1534
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:03,000
but you don't need more than a 10-year-old to draw it out,

1535
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:05,640
and you'll see that it won't look anything like what's on the Internet,

1536
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:07,660
all these relics and objects, right?

1537
01:25:08,060 --> 01:25:09,440
It's kind of bizarre, isn't it?

1538
01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:13,060
Well, it is, and there's also this other relic that supposedly,

1539
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:16,400
you know, it's a cross between two things.

1540
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:19,340
The sacred spear aspect, right,

1541
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:24,380
which some people say is the spear, literally the spearhead of destiny,

1542
01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:28,420
which was, you know, the spear that actually poked him.

1543
01:25:28,420 --> 01:25:31,920
And then other people say it's made actually from the nail.

1544
01:25:32,540 --> 01:25:33,800
Now, the nail could have survived.

1545
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:37,960
Now we're going to get into what, I'm not saying you,

1546
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:42,660
but what shoe size Santa Claus has, or who's wrong and who's right.

1547
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:46,160
Yeah, well, that was what I was leading to, but yeah.

1548
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:50,280
But the spear of destiny, the one that's ridiculous is the Holy Grail,

1549
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:52,160
the cup that he drank from.

1550
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:55,560
Because, first of all, it wasn't the Last Supper.

1551
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:59,000
I think I mentioned him in the last one.

1552
01:25:59,140 --> 01:26:00,160
I'm not going to mention his name again.

1553
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:01,220
Actually, this time I won't.

1554
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:08,320
But he did a video on how the Last Supper painting by da Vinci, I think it was,

1555
01:26:08,420 --> 01:26:09,780
is really the Zodiac.

1556
01:26:10,740 --> 01:26:13,680
And he just insisted on telling me about this for about an hour and a half,

1557
01:26:13,700 --> 01:26:17,040
and I stopped and said, you know, there is no Last Supper in the Bible.

1558
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:18,500
It was the Passover.

1559
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:23,360
And as a matter of fact, one of the ordinances in the Passover,

1560
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:27,840
you eat lamb and flatbread, matzah, right, no yeast, and bitter herbs.

1561
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:29,000
Guess what?

1562
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:31,520
You're standing up.

1563
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:33,900
You're supposed to do it standing up.

1564
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:40,220
So the Last Supper, it shows a bunch of guys sitting down.

1565
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:41,140
Sitting down, yeah.

1566
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:46,120
So that is really the Last Supper, but it's 0% biblical,

1567
01:26:47,180 --> 01:26:51,880
negative 1, negative 100% biblical, right?

1568
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:56,700
The interesting part in that is when the Christ said during the Passover,

1569
01:26:56,960 --> 01:27:02,920
the Passover, this is my body and this is, right, it was very confusing.

1570
01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:05,480
Take this as my body and this as my blood.

1571
01:27:06,380 --> 01:27:06,500
Why?

1572
01:27:06,660 --> 01:27:09,460
Because if he's known as, quote, unquote, the Lamb of God,

1573
01:27:09,540 --> 01:27:14,360
in the ordinance of the Passover, part of the ordinance is what?

1574
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:18,560
None is to remain till morning, meaning the end of the day.

1575
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:24,880
And if anything is remaining, you're supposed to burn it, throw it in the fire.

1576
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:32,360
So he's telling them, he's giving them these metaphors that he is sort of like a Lamb of God, right?

1577
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:34,720
Indirectly, he doesn't say that.

1578
01:27:35,380 --> 01:27:39,640
But he's considered that, and they're saying if you're going to die,

1579
01:27:39,740 --> 01:27:42,600
you're going to be burned up in their minds because they know the ordinance.

1580
01:27:42,740 --> 01:27:43,860
They know the law, they know.

1581
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:48,540
And he's telling them, no, no, look, I'm bread, not the Lamb.

1582
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:49,200
Right?

1583
01:27:49,700 --> 01:27:50,200
You get it?

1584
01:27:51,020 --> 01:27:53,320
This is kind of advanced, but it's so simple.

1585
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:54,640
Right?

1586
01:27:55,820 --> 01:27:58,500
Because he was not burned in the New Testament.

1587
01:27:58,720 --> 01:27:59,820
The Christ was not burned.

1588
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:01,580
No, he's taken to the tomb.

1589
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:02,080
Resurrected.

1590
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:02,460
Right.

1591
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:03,060
He's taken to the tomb.

1592
01:28:03,460 --> 01:28:03,900
Resurrected.

1593
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:05,500
And he's telling them this.

1594
01:28:05,740 --> 01:28:09,400
He's telling this to them, he's hinting, he's giving hints during the Passover.

1595
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:15,640
This bread is my body because the ordinance of the Passover is no Lamb is to remain till morning.

1596
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:18,520
If there is, it is to be put into what?

1597
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:19,200
The fire.

1598
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:22,440
So they're like, oh my gosh, he's going to be killed and then burned.

1599
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:25,560
He's like, no, no, I'm the bread.

1600
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:27,060
Right?

1601
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:29,860
Anyway, what I just said is very advanced.

1602
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,800
I've never heard anyone describe it this way.

1603
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:33,720
Right?

1604
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:36,320
Give you another example of how simple this is all.

1605
01:28:36,420 --> 01:28:39,740
It's very advanced because of being maybe the only one saying it.

1606
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:43,280
But anyone could see this, and I'm not reading into it, I'm reading out of it.

1607
01:28:43,660 --> 01:28:43,820
Okay.

1608
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:44,760
Here's another thing.

1609
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:57,220
One of the Ten Commandments, the ones that were written on stone, is that you are to ransom a donkey, a male donkey, with a lamb.

1610
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:59,620
And if you don't, you break its neck.

1611
01:29:00,180 --> 01:29:07,480
So before the Passover, when he entered Jerusalem, he was to enter on a donkey.

1612
01:29:08,020 --> 01:29:08,200
Right.

1613
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:10,440
And it was a young one.

1614
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:13,740
He even said, this one has never been ridden before.

1615
01:29:15,340 --> 01:29:19,740
So did that donkey have, was that donkey ransomed with a lamb?

1616
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:20,840
Yes, it was.

1617
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:22,640
You see?

1618
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:30,020
So you have these dualities in there that satisfy one thing and satisfy the other.

1619
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:34,880
Because if the Christ was burned, he would satisfy the ordinance of the Passover.

1620
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:40,760
But it wouldn't satisfy the resurrection directly as it was done.

1621
01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:42,200
You see?

1622
01:29:44,580 --> 01:29:45,480
So I don't know.

1623
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:47,700
These things, I mean, here's the thing.

1624
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:52,960
I have an affinity, in other words, I like reading the biblical text and the scripture.

1625
01:29:55,240 --> 01:30:00,700
And I like to project the knowledge of the scripture instead of just the information.

1626
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:03,700
Because again, information, here, I'll give you an example.

1627
01:30:04,340 --> 01:30:09,900
They did the Warren Commission for JFK and they did the 9-11 report or whatever for 9-11.

1628
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:13,000
That is packed full of information, isn't it?

1629
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:15,580
Aren't they full of information?

1630
01:30:15,860 --> 01:30:16,040
Sure.

1631
01:30:16,740 --> 01:30:16,960
Yeah.

1632
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:20,600
And what kind of knowledge of the event do you have when you read that?

1633
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:21,420
Nothing.

1634
01:30:21,660 --> 01:30:22,420
Next to nothing.

1635
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:24,460
Next to nothing that's usable.

1636
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:30,980
Pure example, you know, a study of Jack Ruby's mother's teeth in the Warren Commission volumes.

1637
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:32,700
That's there, by the way.

1638
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:33,760
Lots of information.

1639
01:30:33,980 --> 01:30:35,160
Lots of information there, though.

1640
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:41,880
I mean, look, if you're a dentist and you want to understand this guy's mother's teeth, I mean, great information.

1641
01:30:42,940 --> 01:30:48,360
So the point of view that I brought up is unique to Greek-speak.

1642
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:53,360
It's knowledge that one gets from reading the scripture.

1643
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:57,480
By the way, there's no deflection here.

1644
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:02,080
You notice I haven't said you have to go back to the original language at this point on anything, did I?

1645
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:08,300
You could read the piss-poor versions that the Illuminati put out for you, and you will get 100 percent everything that I've said.

1646
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:09,880
No, it's still there.

1647
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:11,220
It's still all there.

1648
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:13,280
It's almost like a hologram.

1649
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:20,020
When you tear up a hologram, a little piece still resembles the entire – you can still project the entire image through it.

1650
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:23,060
So I haven't really got into anything.

1651
01:31:23,140 --> 01:31:30,580
I don't think we will on this episode about the – forget about the versions.

1652
01:31:31,180 --> 01:31:33,680
Very little value, but the story does come through.

1653
01:31:33,820 --> 01:31:37,860
Knowledge comes through, but the information that you're getting from the versions doesn't.

1654
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:43,100
If you want more direct information, you're going to have to go to the Aramaic, not the Greek.

1655
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:45,040
Well, you have to know all of it.

1656
01:31:45,540 --> 01:31:48,940
You have to know all of it, actually, right?

1657
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:56,140
But if you know where the mistakes are, it makes it even – that's the reason why you go back to the original language,

1658
01:31:56,140 --> 01:32:00,620
is to know where the mistakes are and what is incorrect, because we're English speakers, let's say, or whatever,

1659
01:32:00,820 --> 01:32:03,000
whatever language the version is in.

1660
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:07,080
But once you start studying what was in the Aramaic,

1661
01:32:07,100 --> 01:32:14,940
you're going to see even more of a different picture on information that's given around this subject that we're discussing right now.

1662
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:20,380
So in essence, most people say, what about the three holes in Golgotha or whatever?

1663
01:32:20,380 --> 01:32:29,220
Well, the first thing, the Knights Templars made those three holes there to sell tickets, right, back during the days of the Crusades.

1664
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:36,560
Second of all, executions were to be done according to the biblical ordinance outside of the city.

1665
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:43,100
Those three holes that they have drilled in the stone to tell you where the three crosses were, guess where they are?

1666
01:32:43,700 --> 01:32:45,340
They're in old Jerusalem proper.

1667
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:48,420
So again, it doesn't hold.

1668
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:54,820
This sounds a lot like probably what you do with the JFK research or other people have done with the 9-11 stuff,

1669
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:59,080
which 9-11 stuff is too much of a whatever.

1670
01:32:59,380 --> 01:33:02,560
It's really bad out there talking about what they talk about.

1671
01:33:02,820 --> 01:33:12,260
But part of doing this kind of study or discussion, I don't like mentioning what's incorrect.

1672
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:18,280
Oh, by the way, on the last episode, I kept saying and I meditated on this.

1673
01:33:18,340 --> 01:33:21,320
Why do I keep saying, do not correct your enemy when they're making mistakes?

1674
01:33:21,660 --> 01:33:28,440
I believe it's, do not disturb your enemy when they're making mistakes, is the original quote on that.

1675
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:30,560
That sounds actually better.

1676
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:33,060
Yeah, that's actually what it is from memory.

1677
01:33:33,220 --> 01:33:33,380
I don't know.

1678
01:33:33,460 --> 01:33:38,340
Someone will probably look it up and probably find that more true to the original comment.

1679
01:33:38,340 --> 01:33:40,280
Do not disturb your enemy because you know what?

1680
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:41,120
You're not going to correct them.

1681
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:42,460
But I just kept saying in a debate.

1682
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:45,300
So I don't like bringing up what's incorrect.

1683
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:52,920
You notice even when I go on a long dissertation on 9-11, I never start making fun of all the other people at all.

1684
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:57,800
There's no reason to or making fun of attorneys or doctors, what they're actually saying.

1685
01:33:57,800 --> 01:33:58,280
Not at all.

1686
01:33:58,580 --> 01:34:04,440
You just go right to the point because when you start going and trying to counter what doctors tell people

1687
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:11,960
or attorneys tell people or priests or whatever or 9-11, when you start saying what they're saying is wrong,

1688
01:34:12,460 --> 01:34:14,780
that's just more information to counter information.

1689
01:34:15,480 --> 01:34:17,280
The thing is, where's the knowledge?

1690
01:34:18,060 --> 01:34:18,360
You see?

1691
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:19,760
There's no knowledge in that.

1692
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:22,540
So the knowledge is understanding the methodology.

1693
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:27,540
Again, to go back, if you're going to build a 100-story building, is it 10 times more than a 10-story building?

1694
01:34:27,660 --> 01:34:29,560
Yes, it is, generally speaking.

1695
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:30,740
Right?

1696
01:34:30,860 --> 01:34:31,560
But not really.

1697
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:40,520
Because each floor, the first floor of the 100-story building is going to hold 99 times more, not just 10 times.

1698
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:42,000
See, the overall building is 10 times.

1699
01:34:42,820 --> 01:34:43,260
Right.

1700
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:46,560
But the first floor has to hold 11 times.

1701
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:47,120
Right.

1702
01:34:47,780 --> 01:34:48,060
You see?

1703
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:52,400
So that's where the knowledge comes in.

1704
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:57,700
So one thing out of this, and I got kind of excited, is let's just hit this on the chat

1705
01:34:57,700 --> 01:35:00,860
and talk about what's on the chat about the Christ again.

1706
01:35:01,180 --> 01:35:06,400
Because if anyone's ever listened to Greek speak where I have more than an hour, I'm going to bring this up.

1707
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:08,680
Not more in the early days, but more recently, always.

1708
01:35:08,940 --> 01:35:10,860
You know, what's this guy knelt to a cross wearing a diaper?

1709
01:35:10,980 --> 01:35:11,780
You notice what they're doing.

1710
01:35:12,900 --> 01:35:18,900
And one of the metrics with that also, just like using the word J-E-S-U-S, is that symbol.

1711
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:23,480
If you believe in that symbol or whatever, that's part of the metric.

1712
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:24,220
They got you.

1713
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:26,100
They're like, this person is totally ignorant.

1714
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:28,120
They're going to buy into all the rest of this stuff.

1715
01:35:28,660 --> 01:35:32,360
And I bet you every time we do something, they're just going to hit the snooze button.

1716
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:33,280
Get it?

1717
01:35:33,740 --> 01:35:33,860
Right.

1718
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:35,180
Yep.

1719
01:35:35,220 --> 01:35:39,160
So every 10 years or every five, we're going to hit them with something, and they're going to just buy into it.

1720
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:50,040
So either way, metrics or not, information or not, this was basically an exercise in what the difference between knowledge and information might be.
