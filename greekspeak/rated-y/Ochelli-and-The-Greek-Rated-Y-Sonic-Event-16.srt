1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:14,920
Ocelli and the Greek rated Y number 16 the sonic event this one is okay put it

2
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,240
into a little a little bit of a different order and I guess the the

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,780
Greek says to me wants to recap the last one just a bit and I I think that we're

4
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:30,520
going to wind up revisiting that subject a bit more in the very near future but

5
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:36,800
you know the the the Christ concept and that what I always refer to as a

6
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,880
construct but I know it goes a lot further than that and obviously if you

7
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,420
listen to the last one you know but anyway yes so we want to we want to

8
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:52,840
recap that and then move on to something else so Greek yeah how are you this fine

9
00:00:52,840 --> 00:01:01,020
day doing okay yesterday was like I say in Spanish the 15th and here's the

10
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,280
synchronicity we didn't mention we recorded at least on my end it was what

11
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,780
they call April 15th which has a lot of date other historical memorializations

12
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:15,560
around it but the 15th is also the day the Christ was born by the way right of

13
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,300
the seventh month right there's a lot of religiosity around there trying to make

14
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,380
their own Christ's you know you've heard of that there's even songs about that

15
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:28,160
right well yeah and I've also heard about September 11th which septum would

16
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:33,880
be correct in the seventh month and give or take maybe the 11th wouldn't be too

17
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:43,780
far off yep it was uh it was the 15th day of the month of the seventh month

18
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:50,880
around 3 BC but on September 11th as it's reckoned on the Julian Gregorian

19
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,620
calendar because you know how Microsoft runs layers like if you have a

20
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:59,640
Microsoft computer chances are you're still running protocols from Windows 95

21
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,260
yeah or 98 or 98 you'll see in there sometimes yeah yeah it's still an Emmy

22
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,280
and all this is still running under there that's how the Julian Gregorian

23
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,760
calendar works Julian is basically a day count Gregorian was a monthly count

24
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,560
sort of a monthly count even though it's still considered arbitrary well

25
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,680
without getting into the calendrical yeah September 11th reckoning but

26
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,560
biblically in terms of like a date stamp you the way you do date stamps

27
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:36,340
chronologically are using astronomical features and secondly would be a feature

28
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:41,480
that would not change right so it doesn't have to be an astronomical

29
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:47,560
feature you could pick something else that doesn't change well based on the

30
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,220
geology geographic changes on the earth you know if you look at a map from the

31
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:57,400
1500s there's no Great Lakes right if you look at the map from the 1500s

32
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,120
Antarctica is not covered with ice yeah I was just yeah I was trying to think

33
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,000
to myself what would be geographically something that doesn't change yeah you

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,280
know you're not gonna get it I'm not coming up with anything for 500 years

35
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,080
but but several thousand years you could still rely to a certain point if

36
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,500
you start going back five six thousand years the North Star was different it

37
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:23,360
wasn't Polaris it was trick it was the draconian Draco which is also a time

38
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:30,160
when that dragon of old kind of realized the population of humanoid types were

39
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,680
were gaining and eventually they'll stop fighting and work together for a common

40
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:43,080
reason boy what the what the hell is the Greek talking about okay so so yeah

41
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:52,120
just go back to what we as those said the sc6 or I'll go different day this is

42
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:58,960
number 16 so we want to get something different and so let's just say to recap

43
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,440
what it was thinking it's always a question and a subject that's not not

44
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,160
going to go away about the Christ right this is what I have to say about it I

45
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,960
think before we got on I started saying you know here secretly I'll share some

46
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,360
everybody cover your ears I'm looking to meet someone that's like me like the

47
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,519
Greek but not a carbon copy not a clone but someone that's like me so we get

48
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:26,520
together and jam all right what does that mean so imagine you're Eric Clapton and

49
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:33,260
you're doing guitar lessons to nine to thirteen year olds and that's all you're

50
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:39,660
doing you're going to go nuts you want to find a Jimi Hendrix or a Jimmy Page

51
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,780
so on and so and there's some quote-unquote kid in Tennessee right in

52
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,600
the eighth grade that could play guitar that we never heard of they could play

53
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,340
guitar better than all those guys you know what I mean right but we never

54
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:57,140
heard of them so secretly all right you could ever uncover your ears guys all

55
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:02,140
right so that's what I'm looking for but at the same time when you start

56
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:06,380
operating on a certain level in life everything is part of the scenery

57
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:13,000
there's a level of indifference let it be it's there for a reason right it's a

58
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,700
manifestation it's not a cause all to in itself right like that you know the word

59
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,360
accidents I hate that word because there really isn't an accident if you look at

60
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,880
something that's supposedly random or an accident really really closely you'll

61
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,680
find out so many reasons why it happened that are actually logical and

62
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,020
coherent that that word accident no longer applies you know what I mean so

63
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,640
everything is there for a reason everything's supposed to be that's fine

64
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,560
so everything is part of the scenery and the scenery that I've been discussing

65
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:55,060
for three decades now is akin to observations of a cult-based society now

66
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:59,240
does a cult have a number limit on it it's probably if it's what do you gotta

67
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,600
have two or more people three or more people for a cult what do you think a

68
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,860
hundred or more people is no real right no there's no real numerical yeah how

69
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,360
about how about several billion or hundreds of million does that make it

70
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,520
not a cult anymore no the language changes people stop calling it a cult if

71
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,720
it gets big enough but other than that yeah right but I don't know if it's

72
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,640
quite like a ship or you know the difference between a boat and a ship just

73
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:29,320
the ship is larger right well the real easy way to give it is the way I've

74
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,980
been saying it I used to use that analogy a lot no difference to a boat

75
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:39,260
in a ship and yeah ship is larger but this is the the underlying concept that

76
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:44,680
you could put a boat on a ship but you can't put a ship on a boat okay right

77
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,900
you see a big ship you got little lifeboats on it right but you can't put

78
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:52,440
the Titanic let's say on a lifeboat right so it's in so certain things go

79
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,880
only one way and being happy with that by their description all right so we

80
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,240
have this cult and also you know I'm not going to get I could get into what a

81
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,620
cult is if we were doing the old ONG I probably would right right and probably

82
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,320
come up with some new stuff but essentially one of the most critical

83
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,940
things that you'll notice of a grouping known as a cult the thing that sets it

84
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,240
apart from other groupings haha it really doesn't because they're all cults

85
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,160
right is that you can't question anything and you can't ask for any more

86
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:26,360
information that's already been given right so if something isn't given it

87
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:33,900
doesn't exist and if it's an insistence on its production is pursued the

88
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:38,920
individual insisting on it is ridiculed or eliminated or worse right

89
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,380
marginalized would be a something in between okay so you're living in this

90
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:48,020
society so the stuff that I've been putting out for all these years publicly

91
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:53,080
privately in person on the internet whatever before Skype there were

92
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,240
conference calls I don't know if you guys remember that I've got a conference

93
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,880
called number right yep yep and everybody 99 sorry of which 99 people

94
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:09,320
okay kind of thing and sometimes I get on these early 2000s conference calls

95
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:15,140
and I announced myself and be someone like you know from the Carolinas Oh the

96
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:21,780
Greek is the Bible guru I love the Bible guru I was like oh my gosh oh my

97
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:30,000
gosh you know you know I mean so it's the Bible guru oh my gosh you know it's

98
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,419
like wait okay enjoy the scenery you see what I mean so all right so what happens

99
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:39,100
here is the efforts that I've been making especially on the last one when

100
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:43,820
we finished the recording I said you know I kind of let my mind go after I

101
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,300
started stop talking about the building because deliberately I wanted anyone

102
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:52,620
listening to that to feel annoyed right you know pregnant pauses and just kind of

103
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,780
like oh right because that's what it's a subject that is going to annoy anyone

104
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:05,360
the reason why it is so is because the cult aspect being aside it's because

105
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,320
it's a it's a subject that is a reflection on one's ability to see

106
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:17,220
everything as part of the scenery or not go back to what is written by this

107
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,280
individual and by the way there's a lot of spiritual wisdom writings

108
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:27,100
knowledge writings not information but knowledge I think I covered a little bit

109
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:32,820
the difference in information and knowledge what easiest way to do that

110
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:40,100
you have information which could either be a liar or truth right but the lie with

111
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:49,340
knowledge if you know it's a lie it's the truth now you see what I mean if

112
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:54,480
you know a lie is a lie is it still a lie well no because it will know because

113
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,940
it informs it but it does inform you because if you're aware of what right it

114
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,480
is then you know where to place it I mean that's the way it is exactly like

115
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,420
the people that believe who shot they told you who shot JFK and what happened

116
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:14,640
on 9-11 that actually think it's they don't they never really go beyond

117
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,380
thinking if it's true or not they just accept it that's just information but

118
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:24,620
once you know it's a lie that's the truth of the matter you see so so the

119
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:30,420
aspect of knowing only has truth by the way information could be you know what

120
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:34,800
they call misinformation and now with the that disgusting YouTube platform in

121
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,580
Google if you put out anything let's say even licensed doctors can't talk about

122
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:43,140
what happened on right they say it's medical misinformation right so the

123
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:48,500
truth is now misinformation right so but you have knowledge of that and the

124
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,620
people of knowledge of that say when you watch a YouTube video don't say this

125
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:57,060
because I'll get the channel whatever you know nuked or turned or a block to

126
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,200
I don't what they call it strikes or well there's lots of different things that

127
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,940
happen but either way they know that it'll be suppressed yeah yeah so they

128
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:11,780
know the truth so so so knowledge is only about truth and where information

129
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:17,500
is not right so what's happening here there are other wisdom writings that you

130
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,640
could find but there's something about what you find whether you I'm not

131
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,340
talking about whether you believe it or not whether it's real or not or whether

132
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:27,740
it was written by Shakespeare or not or whatever there is a level of wisdom that

133
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:32,280
wraps around the cortex of the brain or the part of the mind or the part of your

134
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:39,420
self that is profound when you read for example the being known as the biblical

135
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:45,100
Christ from the prophetic nature from the prophets all the way to what was

136
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,860
written in the New Testament regardless if it is what it is right so so there's

137
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,820
a so whether you're getting that information from the Bible or the Christ

138
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:58,380
it doesn't matter right because it's something that has to be known and that's

139
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:03,320
that's really what it speaks on so here's what I really want to land on the

140
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:10,640
recap is you have this cult known as humanity and within there you have a

141
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,260
department or a section that is known as religion and this tends to fall within

142
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:19,280
those categories right right and that goes with everything like if you want to

143
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,700
know again about 9-11 or JFK or how the human body works they tell you go look

144
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,580
at the category of medicine and what you're going to get is major league

145
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:32,540
bullshit right that's part of the scenery so when you let's say indulge in

146
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:37,360
Greek speak and you get the hints that I give and you start looking at direction

147
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,760
you see that it's diametrically opposed to what's put out to the rest of the

148
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,440
people well now you're getting knowledge because before you thought the

149
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,780
information was good enough but now you see there there's contrasting

150
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:55,160
information on the same thing so you're gonna have to figure out on your end

151
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:03,760
that now you're delving in about knowing not just being informed right so

152
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,800
and that's all I got to say about that on the recap okay I would suggest yeah

153
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,620
I would suggest that uh it's a never-ending subject so why why go why

154
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:19,260
go down that you either know or you don't know right and and just just to

155
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:23,000
finish it off like this I'm an Old Testament kind of guy because they

156
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,300
choose to be I never said because it's the only way to be that you ever heard

157
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:32,480
me say that no never right even if you read the biblical text it tells you if

158
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,320
someone has a certain covenant you know respect it basically right respect it

159
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,820
that they have that covenant but it doesn't mean you're gonna let them walk

160
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:43,260
in and trample mud into your brand-new carpet right if that's part of their

161
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:47,160
covenant right no no for instance look I mean you're just real basic all right

162
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,020
somebody chooses to live in in such a way that they are barefoot everywhere

163
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:55,940
they go well that's that's fine that's their way of choosing to live but when

164
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:59,220
they when they come to your house and you say this is a note take your shoes

165
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,680
off and cut before you come in there and you have their shoes up but here's the

166
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,440
reason why you tell people to take their shoes off before they come in so they

167
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,840
don't trample the stuff that was on the sheet but now they're barefoot they

168
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,180
don't come inside at all till they wash their feet and correct that's where

169
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:18,680
they don't have shoes to take off right see the reason you have a no-shoe house

170
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:24,340
is to keep the street out of the house but so that's another perspective that

171
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:29,100
makes that to me being barefoot is not good but you know what I go sometimes

172
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:34,400
several days without wearing shoes because I want to be grounded right as a

173
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:39,040
matter of fact if you have minor pains aches health issues I'm gonna say it

174
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,960
works for everyone go ahead if you're living in Canada where they have like

175
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,500
nine months of snow or ten months of snow or whatever I don't know you might

176
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:52,740
adjust if you're if you eat enough pine needles and burdock but what I'm saying

177
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:58,420
if I have any minor quote-unquote discomforts if I walk barefoot for three

178
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:04,940
days I'm talking winter time too they go away goes away my fortitude and my

179
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,520
strength inner strength and physical strength goes up marketably enough to

180
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:16,360
say that it'll help by doing that well you know I have chronic pain and to be

181
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:22,760
honest with you sometimes when that becomes particularly intense I do find

182
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,480
it useful for a couple of days at about the beginning of the day the truthful

183
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,420
beginning of the day around that solar noon time if the grass is available if I

184
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:36,520
can just go and walk in the grass barefoot and kind of just stand there I

185
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:42,340
don't have to do anything other than it is it is helpful it it it turns it down

186
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:46,960
it doesn't get rid of it it's not like a cure-all or anything but it does allow me

187
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:52,920
to have greater control over the pain level throughout the rest of the day if

188
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:57,220
I start my day that I give a real interject a short interjection if you go

189
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:02,180
into biology class 101 and University I don't know if they still do this this is

190
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:07,820
stuff that I studied 40 years ago they get into what's called protozoa just

191
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:11,640
protozoa study you know which is single-celled organisms and you have to

192
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:16,240
bring in your own samples and what they direct students on doing for amoebas is

193
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,400
you get some grass and you put it in a jar of water clean water rainwater

194
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,460
distilled water you wait three days you take the water out filter it and got

195
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:28,780
your amoebas right right but here's the thing no matter how close you look at

196
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:32,160
regular grass before you put it in the water and the water that you put the

197
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,760
grass in there's no amoebas present anywhere right but they never tell

198
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:41,740
people that the amoebas are actually let's say the genesis of the amoeba comes

199
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:47,300
from cut plants or especially grass a monocot in water they're generated out

200
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:51,360
of nothing and amoebas are their own distinct life-form it's not like right

201
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,080
you know part of the grass it's completely different than the grass and

202
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,960
the water right you see so when you're stepping on the grass that energy that

203
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:04,480
forms the amoeba will help perhaps stimulate cell formation in the body I

204
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,780
suggest that you walk on gravel dry gravel wet gravel doesn't matter dry

205
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,780
gravel is better because the piezoelectric effect most gravel has

206
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:17,119
enough quartz in it you know that crunchy sound you hear when you're

207
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:22,380
walking on gravel and if you're not used to it you're like oh oh you know even if

208
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:26,800
it's rounded gravel because each one forms like this little massage section

209
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,580
in the bottom of your foot and remember each one of your feet is taking half

210
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,620
your body weight or your full body weight when you're walking right right

211
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,960
crunching that quartz together if you know piezoelectrics is you know you

212
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,460
don't know what it is do this but don't do this because anytime you buy a

213
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,280
blender they have that red octagon we talked about yesterday on the I've seen

214
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,860
that by the way on instruction manuals now you open it and they have a red sign

215
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,560
it says stop on it right I don't know if you've ever seen that recently in

216
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:59,640
printers and things get yourself yeah get yourself a blender and you'll see the

217
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,840
red stop sign on the instruction don't do this and they show you the blender

218
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:07,280
with sugar cubes in it a lot of times you want to tell you don't do it do it you

219
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,180
know it's just like people that were anti-depressants have a orange sticker do

220
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:15,780
not take with alcohol you ever see that right it's really bright dang you know

221
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:19,700
caution really I said oh you know that means you got to take you let me get a

222
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,720
couple of these you got to take when we have alcohol here we definitely have to

223
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,120
take it with alcohol right because they don't want you to have a good time just

224
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:29,600
like they they tell you red meats bad for you why cuz it's delicious when it's

225
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,040
charbroiled right yeah I think they have to stop putting those I think they have

226
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:37,220
to stop putting those orange stickers on the painkiller bottles actually yeah

227
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,360
that's right because they figured out that no one's watching it when they see

228
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,800
it it actually means get the alcohol all right so what you do is you get the

229
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,220
blender and you put sugar cubes in it turn off all the lights if it's if you

230
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,500
can't go into the closet and close the door or put it in the cabinet close the

231
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:56,940
door with a camera hit the go button low medium high and it will be a light

232
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:02,780
show not because it's sugar it's because it's in a crystalline form when those

233
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:06,240
crystals are smashed have you ever seen there's a YouTube video sugar cubes in a

234
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:12,760
in a blender I never seen it no I haven't oh yeah it's kind of like you

235
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,220
know those ultraviolet lights those purple black lights yeah and white

236
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:19,900
lights right yeah lights up like that it looks like a lava lamp but you know with

237
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:25,380
sparks yeah okay and that's sugar cubes right and that's a blender imagine you're

238
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:29,740
walking on gravel what it's doing right and also that electric field that

239
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:34,280
develops pumps goes down into the earth and the earth reciprocates reflex right

240
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:38,960
just like pushing on a waterbed okay you push down on one side it push comes up

241
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,560
on another and then when you let go comes up where you pushed it right

242
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:46,460
complex electrical fields you can measure up to 2,500 volts walking on

243
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:53,820
gravel okay right at a low current so barefoot can't take the shoes off to

244
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:58,640
come in the house washing washing your feet we're gonna talk about hygiene

245
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,220
what's is the third time's a charm we taught tried maybe two or three times

246
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:09,720
already that's true but yeah okay but let's but let's let's just cut to the

247
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,180
chase right and like you say all the time why not give the important part

248
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:19,380
first in case the battery dies on the cell phone yeah it's yeah ultimately it

249
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:24,040
has nothing to do with anything physical you're not going to quote-unquote be a

250
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:30,000
bathing or washing away anything that is physically been told to you that causes

251
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,020
harm organic or inorganic it's a state of being it's it's an independent state

252
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:41,460
is what it is so people get sick and they're looking for a bug that caused it

253
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:49,240
right well the presence of the bug is not what causes it right because first

254
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:53,120
of all if you pick up a certain pathogen in the inside the blood of the they say

255
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,940
we did a blood test we found this right right that means the body created it

256
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:02,840
unless it was directly injected into the body you know hypodermic Lee right so if

257
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,700
the body creates it well your own body it's your own damn fault then right so

258
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:10,760
what happens when you have let's say E.coli or something in the blood those

259
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:16,680
are not harmful it sounds crazy right what is harming you is that E.coli being

260
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:23,060
a living organism eats and poops right okay okay so you when you have a garden

261
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:28,620
and you have a goat if you let the goat go in the garden for a few days and you

262
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,640
come back on your way to the garden you're gonna see these little pellets

263
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,340
everywhere they look like little brown pellets right and you're gonna go and

264
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:40,160
you see your gardens gone it's missing what happened to the garden well the

265
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:46,720
pellets are what the goat makes right and the the poop and the garden is gone

266
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:52,500
because it's what the goat eats right so you got E.coli let's say what they

267
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,600
identify as E.coli in the body it eats doesn't it yeah so what is it eating

268
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,440
things in its indirect environment and then it after it eats what does it do

269
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:09,060
that's to get rid of the waste product right so what it ate has an effect on

270
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:13,560
the body right what it removed took away right the actual digestion process

271
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:19,040
has an effect on the body then the poop that's eliminated into the body has an

272
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:23,440
effect on the body right because most things inside a waste are not alive

273
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,920
although sometimes there are things that seem to be alive it could be it on

274
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:32,900
another level it is yeah okay we'll talk about silent spaces maybe if we could we

275
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:37,360
have time sure this is gonna be a short one folks okay so it's not the bug the

276
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,960
presence of the bug it's what it does and doesn't do and when it's finishes

277
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,760
when it finishes doing what it's doing that you have the illness but remember

278
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:53,520
if you have anything found in the blood the body created it right right so this

279
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,620
is basically it so in a sense that in a sense give it another analogy there's a

280
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:05,120
couple and I know them very well and they know Greek speak very very well and

281
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:11,280
he never gets sick winter summer whatever and she always gets sick in the

282
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:18,320
winter right and he's always telling her did you wash your hands or when she does

283
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,200
something with food or whatever she leaves a little bit of a mess a little

284
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:27,540
bit of a mess you know or when she goes out and whatever she'll come inside and

285
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:32,180
you know not you know be conscious of it and she's she constantly gets sick

286
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:36,940
every winter just about and he doesn't and it's they both shower twice a day or

287
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:41,840
once a day they both have similar hygiene general hygiene habits but one

288
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:47,220
gets sick and the other one doesn't almost like clockwork and when the the

289
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:52,920
guy it stays really on top almost from a nagging perspective on her she doesn't

290
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:57,660
she happens to skip a year and not get sick because it's not the major things

291
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:03,720
laundry and washing your hands when they're dirty or whatever but it's the

292
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:09,880
real minor minor minor intricacies of hygiene that makes her susceptible to

293
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:14,920
getting colds that last for weeks and months and he does you see because

294
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:20,220
typically when you tell someone to go wash up or have to wash up there is a

295
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:25,900
visible presence or noticeable presence of a requirement to do so right that's

296
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,560
pretty obvious like today I was working on some stuff I said I got grease on the

297
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:35,200
keyboard shucks you know right but you know right so yeah that's noticeably

298
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,860
right the stuff I want to talk about on hygiene is the stuff that's not noticeable

299
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:44,840
and what's not noticeable is the interaction that we have as a living

300
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,720
being that has other living beings that have other living beings when other

301
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,660
living beings inside of them like the Russian dolls right and there's a chain

302
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:58,960
reaction that sets off whether they're all going to behave and you're going to

303
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,140
live peacefully or whether you're going to be in trouble or one of the orc

304
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:07,940
because by the way when the E.coli is thriving if you asked if you interviewed

305
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:12,200
the E.coli how are you doing they're sitting we're doing great now let's zoom

306
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,580
out and interview the person who's got that ask them how are they doing they're

307
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:22,360
gonna say feel like shit right right so so one of them is in harmony and the

308
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,020
other one's not so it's about keeping everything in harmony because you know

309
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:29,420
there's so you could go look I remember it was real spooky in the 70s on the

310
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:34,140
science magazines they would show these creatures that look like they're from

311
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:38,640
outer space on a smooth wrinkly surface almost like a crater and you saw like

312
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,660
something look like a look like a stalk or a trunk of a tree coming up and you're

313
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:46,600
like what the hell is that and say that's your skin magnified and that's a

314
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,860
dust mite living on your skin remember that right right yeah and so you can't

315
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,860
get rid of those actually the more you wash the moisture and heat makes them

316
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:58,880
grow even more I was like ah right enough to make you crazy right so it's

317
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,520
not the presence of it it's what condition it's in is if it's working and

318
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:07,360
are you actually creating them there was a TV show in the 70s if I remember where

319
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,820
the guy ends up going into the shower and they get they tell him exactly that

320
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:17,060
and he ends up smacking his skin all over the place trying to just yes in some

321
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:20,280
cases it's for some people if they can't handle it's better that they don't know

322
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:26,020
it right right so I mean think about the information that's that's the thing

323
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:29,720
that's where faith and knowledge also is another thing I talked about

324
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:35,500
information but faith you notice there's a modality in society they everything is

325
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,820
done on faith the money the science like trust the seance I mean trust the

326
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:43,040
science and all this other stuff it's all based on faith you can take you

327
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:48,340
expect me to take it on faith alone yes absolutely right so when then when it

328
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:51,700
comes up to matters of faith what kind of quality information you think you're

329
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:57,120
gonna get on that no good because everything else is fake I still can't

330
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,540
believe by the way we're talking about hygiene that in this day and age I grew

331
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:07,280
up hearing that that people still think they absorb I mean no one is really okay

332
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:12,120
all right everybody just take a break I just take a break for a minute because I

333
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:17,100
just got hit with something that I you know let me put it this way how many

334
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:22,600
people don't have access to what anatomy looks like like cross-section

335
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,400
of intestines cross-section of skin walking through like I think high

336
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,860
school biology they have posters where they show the cross-sections of these

337
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:34,140
things right of course medical or everywhere everywhere and it's studied

338
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:39,680
why isn't there at least a small movement of people saying that hey how

339
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:46,520
does anything go through that there's no way why why isn't there like need I say

340
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:51,960
one other person saying that what's going on here but I said just had a

341
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:56,560
moment it's like if I can't if I don't spend 99% of my energy holding my

342
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:01,800
mentality together I'd go insane if I focused on that right you see what I

343
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:06,720
mean okay anyway let's just jump out of that because it is insane it is

344
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:13,900
completely insane how that's not being discussed or anyway and by the way

345
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:20,220
one I'm sorry the same conundrum I face all the time though when with the pieces

346
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:25,980
of paper you know why does this have value okay I get what it symbolizes but

347
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:29,020
in reality the thing in and of itself doesn't have value it's a piece of

348
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:34,480
paper you know well no the paper could be fine because you know you can get a

349
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,160
piece of paper that says that you just got five numbers in a row and you could

350
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,780
go pick up your $350,000 prize yeah but that's because it represents

351
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:47,820
something else it's you know but there you go exactly it's really the

352
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:53,000
merchants fault it's up to the merchants to educate give you an example the

353
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,640
education's end time in history is never done in the schools you know I'll give

354
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:02,540
you a quote who said this everything taught in school is a lie Socrates said

355
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:07,740
that 2,500 years ago okay so I don't want to hear about people saying how since

356
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:12,300
Ronald Reagan the education system has gone down it's kind of propaganda is that

357
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:18,140
right so anyway it's the merchants because back in the days you got

358
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,880
information on the market you ever heard he's getting on a soapbox right yeah

359
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,860
that's at the market because when you the soap maker showed up everybody went

360
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:30,800
and bought the soap and boxes empty boxes on the floor you pile stack them

361
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,860
up and you rise slightly above head level so people could hear you right

362
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:41,000
it's because the soap maker sold out first right okay is because it was yeah

363
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:47,160
it was not like common anyway so many things came to mind just with the soap

364
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:55,920
maker there but get it the subject design okay so yeah so uh so these

365
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:00,420
things like the couple that one gets sick the other one does it they both

366
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:07,760
have observably similar hygiene levels but it's not enough for one to stay to

367
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:15,620
avoid quote-unquote yearly cold let's say that lasts for weeks basically look

368
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:19,640
the act of induction has to do with what it is that you're involving yourself

369
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:24,020
with right this is how this fits together in my mind is that yes and so

370
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:28,780
what what you choose to interact with causes induction to occur that's what

371
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:32,740
the bottom line is whether you take it in it goes in the body now you're

372
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:38,660
interacting with it in an intimate way intimate right but if not the things

373
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:42,760
that you're encountering one way or another all together whether it's the

374
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:48,980
air or the people or whatever sure these things all it's induction it's contact

375
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:55,500
but but try to try to attach it conjunct it with dwell time certain things have

376
00:30:55,500 --> 00:31:00,060
an immediate dwell time contact time other things have a longer dwell time in

377
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:04,280
order for it to induce just like the induction stovetop you know the glass

378
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,540
stovetop pot of boiling water the pot of boiling water put your hand right on

379
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:12,240
the stovetop it's room temp put the ball pot right over it starts boiling again

380
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,640
but if it hadn't gotten to that boiling how long even with an induction top you

381
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,740
put you know tap water or room temperature water in a pot you don't

382
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:22,900
turn it on and it starts boiling immediately you have to wait the dwell

383
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:27,640
time of induction for it to get to that temperature okay so there's an aspect of

384
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:35,340
that as well not never discussed right so you get poop on you dog poop on your

385
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:39,520
shoe it will get into your blood if you leave it on there long enough even though

386
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:44,140
it's on your shoe quote unquote a barrier right because of the depends on

387
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:48,900
the object to what kind of a field effect does it have I think we spoke about how

388
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:53,080
people think neodymium magnets the really strong ones are better and depends

389
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,120
on what you're doing they're so strong because they have a

390
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,660
condensed field density and it's very small around the magnet but it's very

391
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:03,400
powerful once you get into it it's the cheap ferrite magnets whose field

392
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,100
actually goes far beyond the body of the magnet that is actually more usable for

393
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:12,120
water you see so you have to comprehend what you know again you know saying

394
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:17,600
neomagnets or dog poo or whatever an initial reaction is again borrowed from

395
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,140
what you've seen other people say and all you have to do is fool a few people

396
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:26,580
as long as they're sociable and good communicators you'll have the entire

397
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:31,800
society saying what they say in no time right right pretty much I remember that

398
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:37,060
with back in the 80s Jenny Hilfiger her brother's Tommy Hilfiger she they

399
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:41,540
thought she was going to be the big designer should put up all this clothes

400
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:44,560
and stuff and I've go down to Times Square people that were very not just

401
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:48,600
look good like models and hang out in Times Square and the thing was you just

402
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,340
didn't have to be quote-unquote good-looking like a fashion model you

403
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:55,040
also had to be a good communicator so when some thought someone asked you

404
00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:00,200
something you would convey enthusiasm you'd be good communicating to where

405
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,700
they could where they should look forward so they can't forget no don't

406
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:06,320
forget the name and tell your friends you have to be a good communicator to

407
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:12,480
convey all these points in a very short interaction right so I've seen that for

408
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,220
also people promoting clubs back in the day in New York you gave you put out

409
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:21,280
these things called flyers right or concerts you know small and you just

410
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:25,040
didn't give them I mean you wanted them out there in society but it was a plus

411
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:29,240
and a real plus if you found someone who was a good communicator so not only

412
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,080
did they hand you the flyer but they are all actually to make you feel

413
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:38,160
enthusiastic about it right right and this is the mechanism that's being used

414
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:45,060
against you with information and there's no mechanism as such regarding knowledge

415
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:49,940
so back to the hygiene and the dwell time in the contact yeah the induction

416
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:53,260
is everything is touching everything let's just think of it this way you

417
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:58,600
hear people say oh you know I can do someone who had skin problems and kind

418
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,880
of looked at and said you know what you need more time in the Sun they were

419
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,180
terrified they were like no no going in the Sun causes skin cancer right where

420
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:11,219
do you think they got that from if that were true 90% of the population would

421
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:15,040
have been gone 90 years ago because 90% of the population spent 90% of

422
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:21,040
the time in the Sun 90 years ago right so regardless so anyway person goes in

423
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,780
the Sun and they get that solar energy we're no matter whether you think it's

424
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:28,639
just right above in the sky really small or 900 million miles whatever they tell

425
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:33,360
you 9 mean 80 million whatever yeah it doesn't matter you see it you're still

426
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:39,659
getting it and you know basically cleared up on them right so you're

427
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:43,440
touching the air which is touching the rocks which is you know everything is

428
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,960
touching something else because it's proven that air can act as a solid if

429
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,880
you're moving fast enough go down a car I roll down the window in a car that's

430
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:55,719
going you know 100 kilometers an hour and stick your palm out forward you feel

431
00:34:55,719 --> 00:35:00,080
a force right right pushing it back right or sailboats or whatever sail the

432
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:05,140
size of sails are designed by you know how much the boat weighs and that's how

433
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:08,400
much air will catch right and so it'll counteract right so all these things have

434
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,340
mass and weight and are capable of inducing I think Chuck you said the air

435
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:19,380
very much so and like sunlight and all any anything you can imagine the humidity

436
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:23,900
in the air here's another thing the the water droplets in the air they're not

437
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:28,520
gas by the way water does not have a gas phase I heard people say water has three

438
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:33,540
phases liquid solid gas it does not have a gas phase there's a vapor phase it's

439
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:38,360
the only it's the only element understanding call it a compound it's an

440
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:42,140
element that cannot be sublimated sublimated means turned to a gas you

441
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:47,500
know like carbon for example sublimates goes from solid to gas but there is a

442
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:53,980
gel state they never talk about okay so hygiene what where where is the subtle

443
00:35:53,980 --> 00:36:01,960
the real subtle aspects first of all it's a there is a mental aspect to it

444
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:07,940
that one must decide whether they want to lead a clean life which is when I

445
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:14,760
bring up I'm an Old Testament person to someone who's semi-educated as one

446
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:21,220
older woman and she says yeah my grandmother and my mother always wanted

447
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:27,600
us to eat clean when I told her I was an Old Testament kind of person so right

448
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:33,520
away she referred she got that as clean food you know and you know the diet what

449
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:38,420
dietary recommendations are in the Old Testament right right so it doesn't mean

450
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:43,080
you know clean the way we I mean what a cow you could have cow goat sheep and all

451
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:47,620
that but choose the cut right but cow could be dirty what is what you can have

452
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:51,360
a steak and drop it on the floor it's no longer you know it's we mean clean what

453
00:36:51,360 --> 00:37:04,880
does that mean clean in in the Quranic let's say Islamic cognate it would be

454
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:11,540
considered permissible not clean it would be called halal where unclean they don't

455
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:19,440
say that it would be unpermissible which would be haram right so they don't use

456
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,960
that term so if there's a way to get away from discussing hygiene clean and

457
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,900
unclean you notice I haven't used those terms right but essentially that's what

458
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:34,980
it is there is a state of mind that one must have that the only way this is what

459
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:39,920
I've noticed all these years the only way one can achieve good mental hygiene

460
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:45,240
physical hygiene spiritual hygiene is that is through an indifferent approach

461
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:49,140
that you view everything happening around you as part of some kind of a

462
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:53,760
surrounding that has to be but it doesn't mean you don't have to influence

463
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:59,700
it okay right and it works this way let's say you want to go to a roller

464
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:05,260
coaster ride and they stop you and they say you have to wait for the next one

465
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:09,940
this one's full okay or you have another occasion where you go to the roller

466
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:14,940
coaster ride and they say okay come sit down but the moment you sit down they put

467
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:18,780
that rope chain across and they say okay that's it ready to go everyone's on and

468
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:22,900
you're the last one to get on the road right right or how about you go to the

469
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:26,560
roller coaster ride and you're the first one on there and you're sitting there

470
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,800
while you get your seat waiting for it to load up completely you see all the

471
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,800
different possibilities with the same roller coaster ride sure right and then

472
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,820
there's a point where you can say I'm never gonna go on that thing they make

473
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:45,180
makes me miserable right and still observe all those conditions or not so

474
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:48,380
there are so many I gave that as a because that's how I am I would never go

475
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:51,360
on any of those rides they make me miserable if it had a steering wheel I

476
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:56,360
might right I used to hang out with skydivers and they're like oh yeah well

477
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,780
just you could do it for free you want you know I said no why would I engage in

478
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:04,300
something that makes me miserable why intentionally I know it makes me

479
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:10,840
that's like oh yeah but all the cool kids are doing it go ahead stay cool you

480
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:16,600
know okay so viewing everything as scenery and objective also gives you

481
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:22,980
more clear head clear thinking give me an example you have someone a certain

482
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:28,600
personality or approach oh my gosh I'm dirty oh I gotta wash this off wash it

483
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:34,120
off wash it off wash it off oh maybe I gotta watch it again watch it again I

484
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:38,980
think get it off hey you know what I mean yeah a neurotic kind of thing do

485
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:42,120
you think they're gonna maintain hygiene no matter how hard they try

486
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:47,060
you know they can't because there's no way they can't no matter what they do

487
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:52,320
they're gonna wind up dirty so in their nose right now by the way the recording

488
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,400
the Skype is that we're reconnecting so I don't know if you could hear me or not

489
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:59,360
you probably could I can hear you fine you're fine okay yeah because I have a

490
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,860
big screen and a tone that's telling me that it's reconnecting so I'm gonna keep

491
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:07,000
speaking no interruption other than what I just said so you heard me you hear me

492
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,340
give the impression of a very nervous person do you think that they could wash

493
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:13,280
and have the best hygiene in the world do you think they're gonna be helpful or

494
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:18,820
have a healthy appearance no my answer was no because they're in a constant

495
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:25,880
state of believing yeah that they're not yep so yeah yeah or their approach to

496
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:29,280
the hygiene is actually making them more unclean than they were before you see

497
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,700
what I mean now here you got these children you know between let's say five

498
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,960
and nine years old at a first time at a farm and they're running around and you

499
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:40,320
call them in for lunch and here comes the boy he's barefoot he's got mud all

500
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,600
the way up to his knee on one leg the girl's got mud on her dress and dirt on

501
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:48,960
her face and all that are they unclean are they dirty no you see what I mean

502
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:54,280
they just need to be washed off a little bit or you know it's a big difference is

503
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:59,760
so so how do you approach the hygiene if you view your surroundings as constantly

504
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,560
being dirty you're going you're not going to do well either but you know

505
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:08,500
what there's a fine balance where they are right depending on what you want to

506
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:12,480
do and what you're going to prepare yourself for for example if you're going

507
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,380
to lay down and sleep your bedclothes you know you spend one-third of your

508
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:20,680
life sleeping let's say generally you know and right now for me it's about a

509
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:24,280
quarter of my life could you know divide the day right how many hours I sleep

510
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:29,180
let's say I try to get it down to less than that but it's you know so anyway

511
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:33,840
your bedclothes sheets and all that should be clean I used to wash them every

512
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:37,900
other day everything just goes right in the laundry so you have four or five sets

513
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:42,980
right you just keep them rotating sure that's a pretty whatever it's just like

514
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:47,140
to think think of your bed sheets and your clothing as very similar to your

515
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:52,760
clothes the clothes that you wear you know I mean sometimes I wear from

516
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:58,860
welding and hammering on stuff I wear the same jeans for a couple days but I

517
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:01,840
don't keep wearing them to where they're so stiff I take them off and they stand

518
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:08,620
up on the corner by themselves right or they smell bad right so consider your

519
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:12,760
bedclothes your towels things that you come in contact with and all that as

520
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:17,600
being fresh and clean most people of course you know know this but I'm

521
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:22,540
leading somewhere else with this one one thing would be a disservice to talk to

522
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:26,780
speak on hygiene without mentioning basic hygiene protocols where they

523
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:33,180
involve soap right I want to just say this several examples I've been around

524
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:36,860
quote-unquote by the way let me just put this out because the mindset is

525
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:43,000
important if you ask me what a version of hell would be for me is to live in to

526
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,700
spend the rest of my life for a week living with a middle class or upper

527
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:50,820
middle class or even better than that or whatever it doesn't matter

528
00:42:52,480 --> 00:43:00,520
Midwest American white family would be a nightmare for me because of the culture

529
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:06,900
right I would much rather be around with Polynesian cannibals that I warded off

530
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:11,760
and told them that I was the wrong blood type or whatever right okay it is a

531
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,640
complete nightmare to be around quote-unquote white American people

532
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:20,900
because of the level of brainwashing that they have everything they say and

533
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:25,860
think comes from the TV culture or school university church kind of culture it's

534
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:28,560
all the same it's all exactly that you know they're all in agreement right

535
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,860
right of course yeah they're all in a hundred percent agreement so give an

536
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:37,720
example once this is not everyone but this is just an example it's very

537
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:47,120
typical boys having a bowl of cereal spills it the mom wipes it up the chunks

538
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:50,740
of the cereal and the milk and then she goes under the sink and pulls out a

539
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:54,540
bottle of what's called fantastic all-purpose cleaner sprays the table

540
00:43:54,540 --> 00:44:00,820
down well it still has setting of other people eating and wipes it I was like oh

541
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:09,640
my gosh she just chemical bombed the kitchen right no regard because she's

542
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:16,120
been told that whatever it needs to be clean and she has been brainwashed right

543
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:19,940
that you do you see the picture you know again yeah I don't know if you ever

544
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:23,160
sprayed that stuff those household cleaners what it smells like and what it

545
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,740
is right yeah it goes everywhere while you're eating okay so I just want to

546
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:30,540
bring that up as an example because this is more common see I thought that

547
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:35,820
was a very unusual it's happened many years ago but it's not it's very typical

548
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:40,300
it's very common but I'm very common what I want to suggest though since the

549
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:44,840
spray bottle was brought up whenever you're using soaps that you buy and

550
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:48,280
purchase whether it's laundry soap anything that's in a liquid not a bar or

551
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:55,680
powder dilute it several reasons why they're always concentrated now when I

552
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,820
said all the soaps are always concentrates not as much as laundry soap

553
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:03,380
like when you buy a gallon of laundry soap there's only about two tablespoons

554
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:07,700
of real detergent in there the rest of it is fillers and water and the reason

555
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:12,920
they do that is because that industrial detergent is so powerful that if they

556
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:17,720
sold you a small container instead of the gallon and told you to put two drops

557
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:21,780
in a big tub of water how many people would really do that some people would

558
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:24,380
say look at this tiny little container I think I got to put the whole thing in

559
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:30,360
the washtub right they'll never be able to wash it away those commercial laundry

560
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:33,520
soaps have a tiny amount of real detergent in them the same thing with

561
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:39,740
liquid bleach it's only 2% sodium hypochlorite right if they sold you

562
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:42,700
sodium hypochlorite real bleach in a gallon that would be enough for ten

563
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:46,000
families for a year if they used it every day you know what would happen

564
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,360
very dangerous same with hydrogen peroxide and all these things the reason

565
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:55,400
I'm saying to digest all to digest to dilute all of your other soaps is

566
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:00,220
because they buy in bulk and if they and they're selling you a concentrate even

567
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:04,080
though it's been diluted from an industrial purpose perspective it's when

568
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:08,940
you buy it it's still a concentrate because if they made it less concentrated

569
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:12,520
now the cost of the shipping is more than the cost of the package and also

570
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:18,180
they'll be buying less of it in bulk and the price will actually go up right

571
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:21,340
so you think most people say well if they made it more dilute the price should go

572
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:24,560
down no actually it'll go up because now they're just cost all their cost is in

573
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,900
shipping and they're not going to get as good of a price because you see what I

574
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:33,800
mean kind of goes in reverse at a certain point so okay that's one point

575
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:37,920
dilute all that stuff because the more diluted is easier the less water also

576
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,580
you're gonna need to wash it off and wash it away give you an example what I

577
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:46,720
do here one instead of going into the the dynamics on how I got into this

578
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:51,220
conversation how important it is because I see examples constantly around me

579
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:56,440
I want to just bring up what I do and in this case do what the Greek does right

580
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:00,460
a lot of times I tell people don't do what I would do right you'll get in

581
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:05,720
trouble sometimes I just do what I would do right and in this case do what I would

582
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:10,880
do what I do is whenever I have any kind of a liquid soap in a bottle with a cap

583
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:16,960
I immediately replace it with a spray and they're all number 28 threads pretty

584
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:22,760
much okay yeah the 28 bottle cap right okay and dollar store or real cheap

585
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:26,560
spray don't get find out which spray nozzle works for you okay so I have a

586
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:32,600
hydrogen peroxide bottle I use that a lot for cleaning you know the woman with

587
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,800
the fantastic on the breakfast show because the milk it gets sour you want

588
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:39,220
to clean it right right right I use hydrogen peroxide for that it has to be

589
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:45,040
in a dark container so let's say the pet throws up I grab of inside the house or

590
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:49,360
something I grab a plastic bag wrap it around my hand with a paper towel so when

591
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:53,160
I pick up the stuffed paper towel I have the paper the plastic bag as a barrier

592
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:58,120
wrapped around my hand another plastic bag ready to go I spray with what the

593
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:04,000
other hand hydrogen peroxide over the area right it's an oxidizer and see if

594
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,660
things foam up or not you wipe it down and you wipe it again and now you have

595
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:13,020
plastic bags to go throw away outside by the way your inside garbage can is not

596
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:19,100
magic if you have a cigarette ashtray or pet vomit or poop or bad food stuff

597
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:23,180
you don't put it in your kitchen wastebasket it's not like this container

598
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:26,740
that if you put it there it's gone forever no it's still in your house

599
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:31,560
outside outside with all that stinky stuff and stuff that's very active

600
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:37,780
active garbage okay if you have to keep active garbage empty containers in the

601
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:42,200
house give them a little short rinse or spray peroxide or whatever the other

602
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:45,660
thing to do is if let's say you have a milk container and it's got to be

603
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:50,080
inside in the garbage when it's empty just squeeze the bottle and before you

604
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:54,760
let go of the bottle put the cap on so when you tighten the cap on as it tries

605
00:48:54,760 --> 00:49:00,740
to expand what does it do inside the bottle tries to create a vacuum so it

606
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:03,900
won't expand keep expanding it'll expand within its own sphere and the vacuum

607
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:08,460
prevents things from growing okay so it'll be much fresher than if you just

608
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:12,100
put the lid on a few days later you try to open it it's like all these

609
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:17,640
toxic gases come out right oh absolutely yeah I do that just to save space but yeah

610
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:22,620
but it has the same effect yeah it's for from a sanitary point of view as the

611
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:26,040
bottle tries to expand well it will it's in a vacuum you know so it'll keep

612
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:31,100
self-contained it won't be gases trying to escape in the room so I use the

613
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:35,040
hydrogen peroxide very often in the kitchen let's say I did some food prep

614
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:39,940
and I've got like a butcher block countertop on one side a ceramic on the

615
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:45,200
other I've got a sink or whatever the spray either on the cloth I use

616
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:50,580
microfiber cloths cut in quarter quarters as a washcloth or on directly

617
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:54,340
on the counter and wipe the hydrogen peroxide with water right and that's I

618
00:49:54,340 --> 00:50:00,260
don't use a commercial soap that Johnson & Johnson sells or whatever there's no

619
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:04,900
the hydrogen peroxide is a form of water by the way right it's very clean this

620
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:08,820
doesn't leave a residue doesn't have a fragrance doesn't cause cancer right on

621
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:14,860
and on and on very very clean it's also a very powerful oxidizer right okay so

622
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:19,620
the other thing dishwash soap get the stuff that doesn't have fragrance if you

623
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:24,440
have the stuff that has fragrance mix it slightly with the one that doesn't have

624
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:29,120
fragrance there are seventh generation I think is a brand they're all over the

625
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:34,220
world fragrance free dishwash soap what that does is if you have soap dishwash

626
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:37,240
soap that has a fragrance in it you'll notice that when you're done with your

627
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:40,520
dishes and drying them or whatever they there's a slight fragrance on the dish

628
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:45,800
still right yeah and it will it affects the flavor of food and all that that's

629
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:49,460
why if I go to someone's house and I bring a sample of water and they give

630
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:53,340
me a glass I pour a little bit of my water in their glass shake it around and

631
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:57,580
dump it out so what you do that for to get the soap out there's no soap in my

632
00:50:57,580 --> 00:51:04,700
glass you know I'm like yeah there is you know I take it as a presumption so

633
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:10,800
what I found is I have for mechanical work dawn or equivalent dollar store

634
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,880
equivalent is just as good for cutting grease if you ever been to a mechanic

635
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:18,640
shop you'll see they have commercial dishwash liquid everywhere yeah right

636
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,340
because it cuts grease really well and it was a marvel that it came out and

637
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:26,240
became popular in 70s this is the fragrance in there will not be relieved

638
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:30,000
but I found that if I have what they call the natural vegetable based soaps with

639
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,440
no scent I have a container of water where I first you put your I put equal

640
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:40,360
parts of the non scented soap with the scented soap and then I into the water

641
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:43,960
that's already in the container you want to add it to water if you add the water

642
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:48,240
after it'll foam up you won't succeed in getting any water in there so always add

643
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:55,620
your soaps concentrates to water I noticed that if I do that it prevents the

644
00:51:55,620 --> 00:52:01,920
scent from the scented soap to migrate and linger and it actually washes it

645
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:08,540
away so what I do for dishwash soap is I have a spray bottle that I fill 75% of

646
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:15,760
the way up with water and then I add the two different types of soap and not even

647
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,420
a quarter teaspoon of each and that and so instead of adding typically like you

648
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:24,000
see people add dishwash soap to a rag or a brush never do that I have it already

649
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,040
pre-diluted in a spray bottle and what's great about that if you have a

650
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:30,860
sink full of dishes and they're rinsed you got the spray bottle to spray the

651
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:35,500
dishwash soap on all of them and get to work without the tap running right mm-hmm

652
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:40,640
see how convenient it is and and by the way this this you will if you buy a

653
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:44,140
dishwash soap or whatever size every month or every so often you'll be buying

654
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:49,420
it only twice a year now and you'll get things just as clean so the soap if I

655
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:54,420
start promoting this the soap mafia which I'm sure exists yeah won't like it

656
00:52:54,420 --> 00:53:00,240
right okay so you're gonna save on soaps now so far we haven't left the kitchen

657
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:06,240
there's something called borax 40 40 mule power it's a born aided yeah soap

658
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:11,740
it's mineral soap okay I can't extol the virtues of it enough you can even take

659
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:17,020
it internally the stuff that they sell in the car in the box right is in turn you

660
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:21,340
can take it it's pure enough it has some calcium residue in it I've said it

661
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:25,140
doesn't have heavy metals it doesn't have any zinc it doesn't have the reason

662
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:28,320
why I'm saying is in other countries where they do have a borax type solution

663
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:32,560
I found zinc and other things in it that might be toxic but the one that you get

664
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:38,360
here basically it's the mind in Nevada the borax some people take it a small

665
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:42,240
amount of it in water and it says it gives them a lot of mental clarity and I

666
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:45,480
did research it and some people say yeah it does open up blockers in the

667
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:50,560
brain and things like that so I more power to you so what I do is I have a

668
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:54,960
half-gallon container that was like from cranberry juice or something or some

669
00:53:54,960 --> 00:54:00,180
orange juice from ten years ago I saved those you got it if you guys know what

670
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:03,600
polyethylene bottles are the ones that coke bottles and the soda bottles come

671
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:07,480
in yeah okay those are five layers of plastic it's you know when you buy

672
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:11,080
distilled water or a milk container it's not really see-through it's that soft

673
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:15,760
plastic that's single-layer low-density polyethylene the Pepsi and the coke

674
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:20,480
bottles are supposed to hold 300 pounds pressure and they're five layers of

675
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:25,040
polyethylene and it's it's really clear very very strong and they don't break

676
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,720
down in the Sun if you leave it in the Sun and squeeze it'll make our squishy

677
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:31,880
sound you'll see the layers delaminating by the way that's what train cars are

678
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:35,460
made of that's why I gave the analogy if you're if you got a two liter of coke in

679
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:38,360
your shopping bag and you walk into the house and it falls and it's the sidewalk

680
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:41,940
you just pick it up put it right in the bag it might dent but it doesn't ever

681
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:46,660
explode or pop open I've seen them run over by cars and they didn't explode as

682
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:50,940
long as the cap holds on that's how the railroad cars are made so when you hear

683
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:57,760
of a spill well you know anyway I've got one of those bottles and I've got some

684
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:01,900
water filled up with water with let's say a half gallon of it gets a half a

685
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:06,080
cup of borax powder and I shake it up and I keep it under the sink so remember

686
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:12,200
when I said earlier I put diluted dishwash liquid in a spray bottle well

687
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:17,280
the water base was that diluted it wasn't water from the tap or filtered

688
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:22,920
water it was water with borax in it it could be two tablespoons to a quart or a

689
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:27,860
half a cup to a gallon play around with it don't shake it up if you if you're

690
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:30,720
going to pour it into a spray bottle and you take it out from under where you

691
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:34,680
have it in storage pre-mixed make sure the sediment stays on the bottom don't

692
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,620
shake it up and then pour it in it'll clog your sprayer and you won't be able

693
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:41,540
to unclog your sprayer you have to throw it away so if you see sediment on the

694
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:46,180
bottom of a pre diluted borax solution don't shake it until you're finished

695
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:49,880
using it so let's say I have the half gallon bottle under the sink and I pour

696
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:54,680
that into my dishwash spray bottle I don't agitate it I just want the clear

697
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:58,560
liquid that's on top and now when I'm done pouring in my spray bottle I

698
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:01,260
noticed the level has gone down significantly I go to my tap and

699
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:04,840
replenish it you could replenish it three or four times before you have to

700
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:08,980
add more borax to it when you replenish it put the lid on and shake it up you'll

701
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:12,060
it'll look like one of those snow globes in there you know all the stuff settling

702
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:17,000
and flying sorry leave it under the counter wherever you have it and that is

703
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,980
a wonderful wonderful clean now I don't need to get into boronated water but by

704
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:26,520
the way where they blow the nukes and they tell people it was a terrorist right

705
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:29,800
you'll notice that they where they had the underground nuclear in a pot they

706
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:35,720
put a memorial and it usually has a water pool like the one in the Murrow

707
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:40,220
building in Oklahoma City yeah they have a pool there they also have a pool

708
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:45,200
there's one place in I think in Middle East they said it was a car bomb they

709
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:49,460
now have a pool as a memorial there there's a reflecting pool at 9-11 there's

710
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:53,220
a reflecting pool at they're proposing another one at the Kennedy site by the

711
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:57,000
way oh well I don't know if they blew a nuke there but they recently blew a nuke

712
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,740
at a cow ranch by the way a dairy cow ranch they killed 18,000 cows you see

713
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:05,120
that explosion you know how you know it's a nuke a micro nuke it said you

714
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:09,620
have what's called a pyroclastic flow just look up pyroclastic flow it does

715
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:15,500
not happen with standard chemical explosions anyway yeah by the way we

716
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:19,880
never got into how the Boston bombing was to take the new movie the attention

717
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:23,840
away from the fire at the library at the Kennedy Library did we ever get into

718
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:29,300
that no I don't think we did yeah okay all right so they that water that's in

719
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:32,820
this a reflection pools is boronated water so in case there's a leak of

720
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:36,120
radon gas coming through at high pressure that smells real bad it'll

721
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:40,580
smell like chlorine gas which they did have a leak like that at 9-11 by the way

722
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:44,660
a few years ago it's a really bad smell coming out World Trade Center area what

723
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:48,920
it smell like like really strong chlorine gas that's ionized radon gas that could

724
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:54,320
kill you by the way mm-hmm yeah so they that's boronated water all those pools

725
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:58,140
have boronated water because it has it has an ability and affinity for what

726
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:02,380
we're talking about here to absorb that real nasty stuff okay so that's pretty

727
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:07,060
much a basic hygiene protocol because you know it's really hard to discuss

728
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:11,580
hygiene it's the consciousness of hygiene and everything that you do

729
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:16,600
actually without bringing up use the use of soaps and I know just about everyone

730
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:21,280
who is listening to me majority are using soaps the way they come in

731
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:26,040
packages right you can dilute laundry soap just dilute it all right and the

732
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:33,020
only thing I have to say about bar soap ever is don't drop it so anyway yeah

733
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:38,180
that's it and so all the liquid soaps dilutes shampoos now they're very

734
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:42,260
technical if some shampoos especially the high-end ones if you add water you

735
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:46,480
ruin the formulation too much water won't work and they might you might get

736
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:50,900
get separation a lot of them have certain things that need to remain in

737
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:55,280
suspension if you add water you'll notice it to start separating and it's

738
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,960
not a good thing especially if you're spending like $50 for an 8 ounce bottle

739
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:03,740
of shampoo and by the way that might sound unnecessary but a $50 8 ounce

740
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:10,380
bottle of shampoo is worth every penny I'm telling you just like I think you

741
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:14,260
and I was talking yesterday I'm working on this amp and it sounds like a Krell

742
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:18,120
KSA 50 we're looking at Krell amps and they're like 30 grand and I said you

743
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:22,060
know what it sounds expensive but it's worth every penny it's kind of hard to

744
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:25,280
tell people that want one and can't afford it or don't want to afford it

745
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:29,800
because you can't afford it if you work on three jobs for a year right yeah well

746
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:33,760
in certain things like the Bugatti Veyron is another car it's a three

747
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:37,320
million dollar car but it's worth every penny why because it goes from zero to a

748
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:42,540
hundred back to zero in five seconds right most people don't they only tell

749
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:46,840
you goes from zero to fifty or zero to a hundred how about no I used to I

750
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:50,420
remember being around people souping up cars I'm like yeah for it's fast but how

751
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:55,200
does it stop oh we had a real problem we felt we're gonna die I said see see if I

752
00:59:55,200 --> 01:00:00,260
were to soup up a car I'd do it all on paper and the first thing I started would

753
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:04,700
start wrenching on is the brakes before I did the engine to get a brake system

754
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:08,740
that would be compatible and the Bugatti Veyron is the only one that can

755
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:13,520
do that zero to a hundred back to zero in five seconds right so so it's worth

756
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:17,760
every penny there's nothing else that can do that not even close so there's

757
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:21,440
certain things that sound exorbitant and if we lived in a different society we

758
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:24,520
wouldn't see it as you went oh I want that I can't afford it wouldn't be that

759
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:29,420
way and it would be you would just make one yourself or know someone that makes

760
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:34,720
something like that or it wouldn't be just this one so I wanted to bring up

761
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:37,700
the soap thing because I know it's something that sits in the bottom of my

762
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:41,560
back of my head I have never been to anyone's house by the way that handles

763
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:47,580
soaps and solutions the way I do and also has sharp knives in other words if

764
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:51,260
I go to anyone's house and I recall neither what they call the food prep

765
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:55,900
area and ask them where they keep their knives none of them are sharpness

766
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:59,760
serrated edge knives are not considered sharp knives they're serrated edge

767
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:04,060
knives right okay and if you use that and you think you're happy because it

768
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:09,740
cuts everything your cutting board looks like the fuzzy dice people hang on their

769
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:14,900
rearview mirrors on those hot rod cars you know I'm talking about you will not

770
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:19,240
have anything that looks like a cutting board it looks like faux fur okay and

771
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:24,060
that's really nasty so for obvious reasons hey I've got faux fur as a

772
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:27,900
cutting board you want to come over and eat no really here's another thing we're

773
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:32,020
gonna do one on food but this I'm very well known for this if you invite me okay

774
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:36,120
when I first met my wife we were still dating yeah meet at 6 o'clock to have

775
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:41,420
dinner and I show up at 5 to 6 and we had to go somewhere else because you're

776
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:48,080
almost late or I was 5 after 6 and she says you're late what were you doing I

777
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:52,640
said I had something to eat and she goes what we're going up for dinner how dare

778
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:56,840
you have something to eat I said you'll see and we went over I never knew these

779
01:01:56,840 --> 01:02:00,180
people but I said who are they Mexican Italian white Chinese versus they're

780
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:07,080
white okay I ain't no white people's house so anyway we get there you know

781
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:10,580
American white you know and or English white in England I wouldn't do that

782
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:16,300
either or whatever you know so we get there and like an hour like we leave how

783
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:20,020
do you feel she goes oh I feel kind of bloated I don't feel that good having a

784
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:23,800
more time she goes I think you're right yeah this is by the way this is normal

785
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:27,300
you know how many Rolaids and Pepto-Bismol commercials were beat you

786
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:32,020
know everywhere how many even now if you turn on television how many indigestion

787
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:35,980
and stomach problem right you're gonna get right commercials for drugs for that

788
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:41,040
right never addressing the real reason right right the other thing is when I

789
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:44,300
used to get invited to white people house for dinner let's say invite me over at

790
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:48,340
5 o'clock I show up at 4 o'clock with a bag on my side in my bag there's a

791
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:52,500
cutting board my knife some seasonings that I use and salts and things like that

792
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:55,200

793
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:59,280
gracious guest you always have to you know give something as a guest you know a

794
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:03,220

795
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:09,100
what's that and I said you know I show up early you're kind of early and yeah

796
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:12,300
thank you very much for this bag what's that yeah where's the kitchen where's

797
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:16,240
the kitchen I say where's the kitchen like well why just sit down a living

798
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,700
room we'll have dinner ready in about an hour when everybody gets here I said

799
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:22,320
no no where's the kitchen let me see the kitchen I said what are you making what

800
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:24,960
are you making oh yeah why don't you want to sit down in the living room okay

801
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,560
this is what you want to make time okay let me see what you got and I start

802
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:31,500
cooking and making the meal myself I spend the first 10 minutes making it

803
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:36,840
getting it hygienically correct by the way you know they'll be like a potted

804
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:40,500
plant in the corner on the countertop and you know pot of plants that had that

805
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:45,060
little district just strain underneath to you know the little dish if you take

806
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:47,860
that dish out hold it to your nose it smells like puke right because that's

807
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:50,840
what plants do plants love that you know if you put plants and shit they thrive

808
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:54,320
right and if you don't put plants and shit they create their own shit right I

809
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:59,340
don't know if you're familiar with this but anyway I take the potted plant and I

810
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:02,300
put it on a chair all the way off to the side so no one sits on it and I wipe

811
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:06,340
that area with hydrogen peroxide and I start wiping the whole countertop down

812
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:11,740
right and and get things ready and I make dinner and everyone loves it now at one

813
01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:15,900
time I got busted and my wife also she still laughs about it I went over it we

814
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:21,380
were invited to someone's house and woman's name was Sandra and Eric anyway

815
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:26,360
it was really cute I showed up early I said where's the kitchen and she says I

816
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:31,620
know what you're doing you're gonna sit down I know what you do you're gonna try

817
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:35,000
over here and try to cook my meal but I'm gonna make my meal right and I was

818
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,700
really proud of her being confident she knew that you know word got around that

819
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:42,100
if you invite me over to dinner I'm gonna show up early and I'm gonna cook it

820
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:47,500
right okay so but she did the right thing I critiqued it I critiqued certain

821
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:52,060
things I said is it clean in there you know and I'm not you notice how I'm not

822
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:56,120
I don't sound like who was it the odd couple Felix or whatever he was the

823
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:59,920
hypochondriac you know right he ever touched anything with a handkerchief I'm

824
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:04,520
not like that at all right if I see children on a farm playing in the dirt

825
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:10,020
in the mud and by the way you know cow patties are sterile right you know cow

826
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:15,680
and horse patties are in war times of war if you someone had an injury and it

827
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,680
was going to go infected you took cow patty or horse patty and put it right

828
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:22,740
on the injury right because the as urea in there that sterilizes prevents

829
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:29,060
anything bad from growing gangrene and things like that right so anyway if I

830
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:32,220
saw children playing around in that stuff I wouldn't see it as being dirty

831
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:38,120
as an unclean unhygienic way as a matter of fact children that were you'll never

832
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:43,300
hear of children that grew up on farms having quote-unquote allergies not until

833
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:48,140
recently it was always the children that were from the cities that had quote-unquote

834
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:54,820
allergies right and severe so you this this clean part here the hygiene part

835
01:05:54,820 --> 01:06:00,800
it's a mental state you must view the world as a surrounding in order to

836
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:06,520
achieve hygiene and what that means is if you're always viewing everything as

837
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:11,880
part of the surroundings and the scenery is there anything you're you're able to

838
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:16,360
pick up more information and you're not going to really skip over things you see

839
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:21,160
what I mean or negate things because it's the scenery it's just scenery and

840
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:25,080
things that you might end up when you start doing that you might end up taking

841
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:29,720
things subtle things that no one notices a little more to mind and things that

842
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:34,080
people think are really important you will discount right because remember

843
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:37,860
what people don't pay attention to or do pay attention to is from the

844
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:43,300
brainwashing that they've gotten you see they don't view most people don't view

845
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:47,160
their environment and their surroundings as scenery you take it very

846
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:51,520
for example recently someone wanted to get into an argument with me because he

847
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:56,120
accused me as being a Republican because I said I want nothing to do with it I was

848
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:59,880
like what are you talking about dude March the 9th 1933 there is no country

849
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:04,660
you're living in like aftermath you did the government doesn't even exist

850
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:09,820
legally it doesn't exist in law and it doesn't even exist legally you have

851
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:14,060
these private attorneys pushing making doing all this crazy stuff to give the

852
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:18,800
impression that the government exists legally he's saying it's illegal no it

853
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:23,980
it doesn't exist legally to be legal or illegal there is nothing going on it's

854
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:28,100
all the show and they accused me as being a Republican you see because they

855
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:33,920
couldn't factor in what I was saying they just had to go to their defaults

856
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,800
they didn't even analyze what you're saying they just went to one of the

857
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:42,680
adults yeah yeah one person was honest though an older guys like 76 years old

858
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:46,640
he said Greek I'm not saying we're saying is wrong but it's I don't really

859
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:51,480
want to change what I've been taught I'm happy with what they taught me wow that's

860
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:57,000
great and he was very not noncombative just recently you don't want to talk

861
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:01,780
about it but you know I'm gonna have to stick with what I thought I'm happy with

862
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:06,480
that that's cool that's admirable it's honorable actually the Bible biblical

863
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:10,060
teachings are very much like that but you know what to expect from that person

864
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:17,700
right you're not gonna expect anything gonna be like very low level very low

865
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:23,859
quality constantly right yeah but you know what it is at least mm-hmm so in

866
01:08:23,859 --> 01:08:27,680
essence the hygiene thing I don't know how to put it otherwise other than the

867
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:34,000
getting into which we'll get into more hygiene regarding regarding cooking

868
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,580
because a lot of that you know you know you keep them meet separate vegetable

869
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:42,540
separate these things separate why right and all these are and also prep and all

870
01:08:42,540 --> 01:08:46,140
that the thing also I want to get into I talked about bedclothes laundry is

871
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:51,680
important what's more important than getting the getting laundry clean is

872
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:55,180
important but what's getting laundry clean is getting any kind of soap

873
01:08:55,180 --> 01:09:00,920
residue out I always tell people if you have a way to peek into the washing

874
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:04,300
machine as the cycle is still going it doesn't have to be spinning but while

875
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:09,120
the water cycle the wash cycle is on do me a favor every third or fourth load

876
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:12,100
that you do don't put any soap in there and just throw it in there with some

877
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:15,880
baking soda or something watch how much how much how sudsy the water gets right

878
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:19,279
where do you think that came from you didn't add any soap to the load right

879
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:22,920
right so where's all that soapy suds coming from guess what right in there to

880
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:27,720
begin with yeah you're wearing it yeah so there's ways to alleviate that

881
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:33,319
there's so many things you know on the practical hygiene but I think that's a

882
01:09:33,319 --> 01:09:37,620
wrap for today fair enough I mean every now and then I take clothes and I just

883
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:42,439
put them in the bathtub so to speak and I just wring them out and I know that

884
01:09:42,439 --> 01:09:48,000
that soap comes out of them you know that's what that discoloration in the

885
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,279
water is if you do it if you actually do this if you just take your clothes just

886
01:09:52,279 --> 01:09:54,740
you know when you're done wearing them or whatever and you don't think they're

887
01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:58,160
even very dirty just throw them in there I mean the color of your sweat is not

888
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:02,840
that odd color you'll notice it's the it's it's soap I mean you can smell it it

889
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:06,560
can be yeah in some cases it's other things depending on what you're working

890
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:12,420
on but or working with could be your own body yeah but I'm saying if you just

891
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:16,180
if you just sat around all day okay and then you throw your your pants and your

892
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:20,360
shirt in there all right not not not stuff that was you know and and you

893
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:22,900
didn't get a lot of food on it you didn't get anything with any sort of

894
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:28,020
color on it or any sort of scent on it you know what I mean you'll you'll get

895
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:32,900
soap out of you out of your clothes you will yeah because it was already there
