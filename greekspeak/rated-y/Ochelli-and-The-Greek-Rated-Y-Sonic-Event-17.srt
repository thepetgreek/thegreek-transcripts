1
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:14,810
Sonic Event 17, here on Ocelli and the Greek Rated Y, and this ought to be, as per usual,

2
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:17,670
another unusual conversation.

3
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:18,830
Why is that?

4
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:24,950
Because you don't get this information anywhere else, because, unfortunately to the Greek's

5
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:29,670
dismay, there are not others like him out there saying what he's saying.

6
00:00:31,409 --> 00:00:34,010
Anyway, that's where I'll begin this one, Greek.

7
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,130
How are you feeling today?

8
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:41,010
Well, feeling interesting, because I'll tell you, we just said, is this 17?

9
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:48,410
And yeah, it's 17, and lawful timekeeping, it's the 17th day of the second month, right?

10
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:49,550
Interesting.

11
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:55,930
Now, 15 was done on the 15th of the Pope's work schedule, right?

12
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:56,410
Right.

13
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:03,910
So, because there's a four-day lag, or, you know, you can't really, it's really hard to

14
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:09,410
surmise, let's say, you know, go from Celsius to Fahrenheit, there's no conversion, and

15
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:12,850
what really makes it difficult is the noon-midnight day start, right?

16
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:19,090
One lawful is noontime start, the other one is midnight, so you end up not having anything

17
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:19,510
direct.

18
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:24,490
But it is, yeah, the 17th day of the second month, when this gets up, hopefully will be

19
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:29,310
soon enough, not to mess anyone up who's trying to do lawful timekeeping, it appears to be.

20
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:35,050
Yeah, the whole thing about this, we were just chatting about, you know, I don't get

21
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:38,730
into anything technical, I try to talk about stuff that's just right in front of everyone,

22
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,150
or easily accessible.

23
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,470
Lawful, you know how I keep redefining what lawful is, it means you don't have to buy

24
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,170
anything, right?

25
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:47,910
Right.

26
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:52,510
You don't have to subscribe to someone else's protocol for, you know, whatever.

27
00:01:53,670 --> 00:02:01,530
So I would suggest it being lawful to notice what is around you is just that.

28
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:10,790
Well, and I'll say this, because you don't automatically notice some things around you,

29
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:14,750
I don't think that is something to, I don't mean you, Greg, I do mean just the general

30
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:22,010
you, it is not really your fault, I mean, it's sort of like this is not the way things

31
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,030
are structured for you to notice what's obvious.

32
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:29,510
So what's interesting to me is when I first started to work with you a bit, you know,

33
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,010
doing the Sonics, it was a little different.

34
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:36,670
And I said to myself, you know, listening to the information that you were imparting,

35
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:42,130
I said, okay, this is not what I'm used to hearing at all.

36
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:47,330
And I don't automatically dismiss things simply because I don't recognize them.

37
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:52,530
Of course, we talked about recognition in an earlier Sonic, but, you know, on the Rated

38
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,350
Y series here.

39
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:58,990
But I didn't dismiss it, but I didn't accept it automatically either.

40
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,650
I said to myself, well, let me see what I can observe.

41
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:09,550
And upon doing that and observing things, I found that I had not fully observed them

42
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,750
in the same way that I had previously.

43
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:18,030
It's sort of like the whole idea about, well, you've been telling me for probably eight

44
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:23,430
years personally, okay, about, well, the day begins at solar noon.

45
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:29,370
Okay, you've been telling me that all this time, it doesn't mean that I really examined

46
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,990
that or attempted to apply it.

47
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,950
Now, I did that recently.

48
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:36,210
And when I did, it created some changes.

49
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:42,290
Not just in the way that I was reckoning time, but it created other changes.

50
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:48,630
And I don't know fully how to articulate that, but it gave me a different sort of orientation

51
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,630
to be able to examine other things.

52
00:03:52,130 --> 00:04:01,230
So it seems to me as though when you change one orientation of your perspective, you alter

53
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,890
everything else after that, right?

54
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:09,770
So this is, I don't know if I'm setting this up properly for you to knock it down, but

55
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:10,410
I think so.

56
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:11,290
No, no.

57
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:11,830
That's fine.

58
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,750
Seasonal eating is another one.

59
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,190
And then eating clean, Old Testament is another one.

60
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,510
It's a benchmark moment.

61
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,830
Everyone's got their own place that they like to pivot or start from.

62
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:35,230
They call it the chocolate foot in sports, the foot that you prefer to use, launch or

63
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:35,830
use first.

64
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:40,990
And I think in cycling, the one that you put onto the pedals on the cranks first is called

65
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:41,770
the chocolate foot.

66
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,490
But everyone's got their own way.

67
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,010
And then there's, of course, the time.

68
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:52,130
Some take a really long, some get it right away, some take a little longer, some never

69
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:52,610
get it.

70
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:58,930
But it doesn't matter either way, as long as it makes some change.

71
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:02,110
Because people are always wondering, when is the change going to come?

72
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,950
Oh boy, what change?

73
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:13,310
Speaking of which, speaking of change, I mentioned I wanted to do a little bit of a recap on

74
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:16,170
the crucifixion debacle story thing, whatever.

75
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,010
Right, because that keeps coming up in the chat as well.

76
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:28,010
Yeah, yeah, that's a really good example, as an example of an example, on how culture

77
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:32,270
shapes one's mind and thought regarding anything.

78
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:38,390
And the more important the thing is, the harder it is to change it once you accept it a certain

79
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,870
way, right?

80
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:49,350
So, one of the things that I always do is, when I discuss it, let's say, it's not whether,

81
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:55,030
this is not like flat earth, round earth, or any other argument, pro or con or denial.

82
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:59,890
A lot of people, for example, in the past have said, oh, Greek, you're denying the crucifixion.

83
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:04,910
And I'm like, well, are you saying that from a point of rational logic and reason?

84
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,150
And he says, yes, you are.

85
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:11,410
I said, well, in logic and reason, you cannot deny something that doesn't exist or didn't

86
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:11,750
happen.

87
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:16,090
In other words, you have to show it exists, right, before you can deny it.

88
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:21,170
That's why when people call me a Vax Denier, right, or never called me other people, well,

89
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,630
you can't be a Vax Denier because there is no such thing, right?

90
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:31,370
So anyway, what's interesting about it is, when I bring up and broach this topic and more

91
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:34,650
than broach the topic, let's say, get into it, I don't give specifics.

92
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:35,570
Why?

93
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:42,890
Because when you hear people sounding off reference points in the Bible, to me, it always

94
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,490
left such a bad taste in my mouth.

95
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:47,530
Even when I thought the Bible was written by Shakespeare, I had not read it.

96
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:48,270
I just went along.

97
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:54,470
I was comfortable with what some respectful person said, and I was just happy with that.

98
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:58,450
I didn't feel like reading it, so I just said, you know, whatever.

99
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:03,790
But then when I read it, I discovered, just like anything else, if you read any reference

100
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:08,190
material on any subject, you'll find that it's very contrasting to what you were told.

101
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,150
Any reference material, by the way.

102
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,410
So again, back to the story here.

103
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:21,030
Whenever I heard anyone citing verses from a Bible, you know what it sounded like to me?

104
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:28,070
Like that jingle, McDonald's, I think, two old beef patties, special sauce, sesame seed

105
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,330
bun.

106
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:29,470
Oh, yeah, yeah.

107
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,070
You know that tempo?

108
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,650
Yeah, I know the tempo.

109
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:36,870
You know, I don't have that memorized, but I recognize it when I hear it, for sure, yeah.

110
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,490
You recognize the tempo, right, of a jingle.

111
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:43,730
So when people mouth off these, you know, this is in the Bible, blah, blah, blah, blah,

112
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:46,470
I was like, oh my gosh, I never want to do that publicly.

113
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:46,910
I never.

114
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:51,170
Okay, so this is semi-public, not public, whatever.

115
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,850
I wouldn't consider it to be public.

116
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,690
So guess what the Greek is going to do?

117
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,430
I'm going to read some Bible verses.

118
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,230
Okay.

119
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,930
It's the Bible guru going to read some Bible verses.

120
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:01,550
Okay.

121
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,350
That cracks me up, by the way.

122
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:07,010
I love that from the Skype call you referenced.

123
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,930
What was it, last Sonic or the Sonic before?

124
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:09,450
Yeah, the conference call.

125
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,070
Yeah, I would refer to the Bible guru.

126
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,690
I love the Bible guru.

127
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,830
You know, oh boy.

128
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:17,390
Okay, so.

129
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,590
Now, he may indeed love you, by the way.

130
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:24,410
I mean, that may be a legitimate, he actually loves you and the sound you make.

131
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:27,310
He might really, truly love that, you know?

132
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,690
I mean, oh my gosh, I'm sorry, guys.

133
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,530
Yeah, yeah, I really like keeping to myself, but, okay.

134
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:39,730
All right, so I've also mentioned, let me just preface this, it is a chronological, it's

135
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:46,430
not a chronographic, it can be considered a chronographic book, but as you go further

136
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:48,710
down into the text, it gets more and more advanced.

137
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:54,490
So let's say, you've heard that back in the, quote unquote, American colonial days, they

138
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,590
used the Bible as a form of education, right?

139
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,030
In single room, right?

140
00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:59,090
Schoolhouses.

141
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,530
It was a math, the three R's, read and write and arithmetic.

142
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:08,230
And simple, look, simple sort of pragmatic reasoning was that it was one of the most

143
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:11,670
printed books, therefore very accessible, you could afford one, et cetera.

144
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,210
So of course, there were Bibles around.

145
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,850
Yeah, or you already had one, you didn't have to buy a textbook.

146
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:16,930
That's it, right.

147
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:17,570
Yep.

148
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:18,970
So it was very economic.

149
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:25,890
All right, so as we go further down, and I realize this actually from contrasting that

150
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:31,430
aspect of the Bible as an educational tool back in the days, with actually what's going

151
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,050
on in the Bible.

152
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:37,470
So I've always situated myself, and I, since the beginning, I realized that by the time

153
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,630
you get to what's called the New Testament, you've graduated from high school.

154
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:45,250
And the New Testament is graduate studies, basically.

155
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:50,090
And as you get further down, it gets to doctorate level graduate studies.

156
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:56,950
So I'm going to bring up some stuff on that level, which is the writings of Paul and others

157
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:59,250
around that time, Shaul.

158
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:06,570
By the way, I recently received a very beautiful hardbound Aramaic New Testament.

159
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,350
So thank you very much.

160
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,150
So I'm going to read something that's from the Book of Acts.

161
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:19,570
I didn't go through and see what kind of filtering or if the translation is correct, but I did

162
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,810
read it in Greek about a week ago.

163
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:25,150
And I'm looking at the English, and it's pretty close.

164
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:30,370
So we'll just, and I haven't studied it in Aramaic, but it's pretty, I looked at any

165
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,370
kind of major change, but it is stoning.

166
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,630
What did I just say?

167
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:35,190
Okay.

168
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:43,870
So if you go to the Book of Acts, Chapter 14, between the verses of 19 and 22, and this

169
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:49,750
is, I believe, a King James Version, then some Jews, which I would say Judeans, came

170
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:53,890
from Antioch and Iconium and won the crowd over.

171
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:58,790
They stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, thinking he was dead.

172
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:00,270
Okay.

173
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:05,310
So we have a situation in the Book of Acts.

174
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:12,510
Now, a few years later, or more than a few years later, in the writings of Paul, in the

175
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:18,030
Book of Galatians, which is actually a very pivotal book, because, well, actually, I'll

176
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:23,950
just say it without, it's another can of worms here, the laws in the Bible were never done

177
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:27,270
away with, and if you read the Book of Galatians, it's very clear, right?

178
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:38,930
But if you go to Galatians, Chapter 6, Verse 17, he says, these are a lot of context, but

179
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:43,130
I'm just reading the verse, so if you want the context, you could read the chapter.

180
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:47,390
But the verses are contextual to what I'm showing here.

181
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,570
So Galatians, Chapter 6, Verse 17.

182
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:59,330
From henceforth let no man trouble me, for I bear on my body the marks of our Mashiach

183
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:02,110
Yahshua, says Lord Jesus.

184
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:02,990
Okay.

185
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:06,390
Okay, so let me just put these together one more time.

186
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:14,310
Acts 14, 1922, Then some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and won the crowd over.

187
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:18,150
They stoned Paul, and dragged him outside the city, thinking he was dead.

188
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:23,550
Paul is the author of Galatians, Chapter 6, Verse 17.

189
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:30,910
From henceforth let no man trouble me, for I bear on my body the marks of our Yahshua

190
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,370
Mashiach.

191
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,010
Okay.

192
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:33,790
Okay?

193
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,670
So, all right.

194
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:46,470
When stoning takes place, you want to kill someone, and it's usually, it's capital punishment,

195
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,870
and it's usually violent.

196
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:53,670
People get all worked up, and you have a barrage of stones coming at you, hit you in the face,

197
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,230
some hit you square, some don't.

198
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:56,870
They're going to leave a mark.

199
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,110
Certainly.

200
00:12:58,810 --> 00:12:59,050
Yep.

201
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,330
Some people are blinded from it.

202
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:05,210
Other people, you know, you could lose a jaw, if the stone is big enough, it'll tear your

203
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:05,990
jaw right off.

204
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:13,030
Okay, so he had obviously been stoned to the point where he was unconscious, and they thought

205
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:13,670
he was dead.

206
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:18,850
So they had a clear, pretty good, clear shot of what you would visibly see on his body,

207
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:26,570
meaning hands, face, neck, head, and here he says, look how I bear the marks of Yahshua

208
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:27,110
Mashiach.

209
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:27,770
Right.

210
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,710
Or he says, Lord, J-E-S-U-S.

211
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:30,170
Right.

212
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:37,390
All right, so in this society, people wouldn't recognize what surviving a stoning would look

213
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,830
like, but back then they did.

214
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,210
So I just wanted to bring that up.

215
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:47,530
These are little, he doesn't say I bear the marks of stoning on my body, he just says

216
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,890
I bear the same marks as Yahshua Mashiach.

217
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:50,570
Right.

218
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:51,510
Right?

219
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,650
You see?

220
00:13:52,650 --> 00:14:00,790
So it's kind of like back in the day, I remember a Vietnam vet showing a bullet wound.

221
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:05,310
It just looks like a little, you can barely, if it's clear through, it's just like a puck

222
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,370
mark on a scar.

223
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:07,030
A dent.

224
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:08,150
A dent.

225
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:08,610
A dent.

226
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:09,050
Yeah.

227
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:14,390
And the guy, I remember this really tall guy who had a glass eye, he was in a shootout

228
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:14,870
in the ghetto.

229
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,170
He says, look, I've got them too.

230
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:17,770
Right?

231
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:21,150
So one guy got it from Nam, the other guy got it from living in Brooklyn.

232
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,250
Similar marks, though.

233
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:29,570
Well, let me ask you a question about this, though, because I already hear an argument

234
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:34,670
in the back of my head that probably somebody could make, and I'm just curious.

235
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:41,310
And I'm not trying to argue with you, because I think you're correct, but here's the thing.

236
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:50,110
Bearing those marks, could that not be that he's bearing those marks because he is a follower

237
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,130
of the same?

238
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:54,590
So therefore, that's the marks you get from being that follower?

239
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:54,930
No?

240
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:56,090
Nope, nope.

241
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,770
It's not a ritualistic thing.

242
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:58,230
Okay.

243
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,570
Actually, they were forbidden in law.

244
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:03,190
You're not supposed to mark your body in any way.

245
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,810
Don't make me read it in context.

246
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:07,750
No, no, no.

247
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,750
It's just a matter of...

248
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,910
No, I'm just joking.

249
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:16,850
The full context is very slight, slightly relevant to it.

250
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:27,970
He gets into talking about bearing the stake of the Christ and circumcision and uncircumcision,

251
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:33,350
what counts in Israel and Elohim and all this other stuff, and then he's pleading with the

252
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:33,850
crowd here.

253
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:34,650
Well, actually, he's pleading.

254
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,110
He's trying to make...

255
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:40,230
It's a sermon, actually, is what it is, but it's very egocentric.

256
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:45,730
It's about his perspective and his accomplishments that he expects others to make.

257
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:49,130
That's why he brings up the marks on his body.

258
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,370
Well, see, but that's the thing.

259
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:54,670
You wouldn't voluntarily get the marks from stoning, so you bear them because they are

260
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,030
there.

261
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:56,810
You might show them.

262
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:57,350
No, because he survived it.

263
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,770
You survived them, right.

264
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:01,050
And people do that when they're scarred.

265
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:01,410
Okay.

266
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:02,230
Right.

267
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,230
It used to be...

268
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,170
Well, here, let me just...

269
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,830
This is the point why I brought this up.

270
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:08,090
Sure.

271
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:15,550
Because I could spend literally a very long sonic showing all of the verses that I have

272
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:22,110
found that I believe are pertinent without reading into it what I want it to mean, but

273
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,010
reading out of it.

274
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:23,890
It's very simple.

275
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:31,050
And there are no less than 50 verses from the Old Testament all the way through the

276
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:38,850
New Testament that refer to the Judeans handling and being responsible for the capital punishment

277
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:46,290
of the Christ and the methodology and the things that you should be aware of, all the

278
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:49,490
way to the almond tree, right, even in symbolism.

279
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:56,250
Nowhere does it say at any point, the sky is blue, like in a science book, right?

280
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,750
But you should surmise...

281
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,430
By the way, they don't.

282
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:04,710
If you ask a PhD physicist or a naturalist or anyone in university why the sky is blue,

283
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:07,170
they tell you it's because it reflects the blue from the ocean.

284
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:10,990
Anyway, yeah.

285
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:18,790
So there are so many hints towards this that are supposed to be the framework for what

286
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,270
happens.

287
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:24,950
And I just wanted to bring this up because this is something, as you progress towards

288
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,890
the graduate level study, right?

289
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:32,570
Remember, this is the Book of Galatians, so this is like master's degree, PhD thesis type

290
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:33,150
stuff, right?

291
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,030
On that level.

292
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:42,490
So you have to be very well grounded in all of the rest of it that is clearly in the proximity

293
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:47,870
of the Judean culture, you see, not the Roman culture.

294
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:56,010
So what's interesting about all of this is how much information can be given through

295
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:58,250
so many hints, right?

296
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:04,950
Because what I'm suggesting here is that even if you have a very firm statement, like the

297
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:09,850
crucifixion is very firm in the King James translation, all the English translations,

298
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:14,950
they make it very firm, as if they emphasize that word crucifixion, and then immediately

299
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,690
dangles something in front of you.

300
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,710
This is what it is, right?

301
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,430
And they show you the symbol, right?

302
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:29,890
So this is a very, very, very strong, strong propaganda effort that's been made for a very

303
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:30,510
long time.

304
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:37,570
The interesting thing also, if you understand the setting here with Paul, by that time,

305
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:48,930
meaning mid-first century, there was already a tremendous movement in messiahship, people

306
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:51,170
claiming to be the messiah, right?

307
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:59,030
And the crucifixion being confused with what happened, and crucifixions, by the way, are

308
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:03,970
torture vices, they're not capital punishment, ever.

309
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:10,050
Capital punishment, by the way, in Rome was beheading.

310
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:11,630
You could look this up.

311
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:13,490
It's just beheading.

312
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,050
It's the other anomaly.

313
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:21,370
If you were to be condemned to capital punishment, they just cut your head off in Rome.

314
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,970
They don't nail you to a crucifix.

315
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:34,790
The most popular application of the crucifixion in Roman culture was to slaves, disobedient

316
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:39,990
slaves and revolutionary slaves, like the Spartacus story, right?

317
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:41,590
Sort of like that.

318
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,990
So understanding that.

319
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:46,630
But here's the interesting part about the whole thing.

320
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:49,810
Everything is like this to a certain degree.

321
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:57,110
I compare what's going on with the crucifixion debacle or story that's been put on people

322
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,270
with 9-11 very firmly.

323
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:04,050
It's almost an identical plot narrative, right?

324
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:10,690
One, being pragmatic, 9-11 was just a textbook nuclear demolition.

325
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:17,890
There actually was a website called nucleardemolition.com, and it comes up and it goes away, it comes

326
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:18,650
up and it goes away.

327
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:22,230
So if you have a big structure and you want to take it down safely, you know, we have

328
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:24,770
all the licensing and approvals and all that.

329
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:28,370
Okay, anyway, with examples on how it's going to work.

330
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:32,990
But we're told it's something else, right?

331
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:37,690
It's so radically different, but it still sounds appealing and plausible, right?

332
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:44,190
And it seems like the people who believe the 9-11 narrative, whatever it might be or was,

333
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:49,810
are very, very relaxed and comfortable about it.

334
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:55,390
The same thing with people that are happy with Christmas and the crucifixion and Easter.

335
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:58,930
They're very, very relaxed about it.

336
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,930
It's like, don't shake my tree.

337
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:02,490
Here's the other thing.

338
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:10,910
There's a guy named Dr. Ernest Martin, Ernest L. Martin, and in one of his books, I think

339
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:15,970
I might have it somewhere here, I haven't read it, but if you look up Ernest L. Martin,

340
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:20,770
he talks about the Christ was not crucified, he was death by lapidation.

341
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:28,190
He doesn't like using the word stoning too much, but lapidation is the technical term.

342
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:35,410
Now, what's interesting about someone like him who is trying to make a living on selling

343
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:40,910
books to quote unquote Christians or whatever he did, he's passed now.

344
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:49,790
He was an offshoot of the Armstrong movement, whatever his name was, Wide World Church of

345
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:52,370
God and all this other stuff, the splintered group or whatever.

346
00:21:53,970 --> 00:22:01,390
When that church grew very large in Pasadena, I think California, back in the 60s and 70s,

347
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:06,070
they were shut down by the Attorney General because they were telling people, if you're

348
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,010
a Christian, you shouldn't vote.

349
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,210
God chooses your leaders.

350
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,990
Anyway, there were many reasons.

351
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,850
They were just getting really, they were growing very fast.

352
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:19,970
Most of them hightailed it here to Tucson to leave California.

353
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:25,870
So when I moved here and I started getting interested in biblical studies, I ran into

354
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:32,950
one of the men that was, more than one, and that was part of that movement from the 1960s

355
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:33,250
and on.

356
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:40,810
And when I brought up, you know, even Ernest Martin, who was part of this group, states

357
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:45,670
lapidation, stoning, he says, yeah, but, you know, we can't really stress that because

358
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:49,330
if we stress that, no one will buy our books.

359
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,030
Ah, okay.

360
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:59,590
And when it came to lawful timekeeping, oh, what you're saying is going to divide us.

361
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,790
No one will listen to us.

362
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:05,750
Nothing like, oh, Greek, let's look at what you're saying, if it's true or not.

363
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:06,330
No, no, no, no.

364
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:09,510
All self-interest, you know, I understand it.

365
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,370
I totally understand it, right?

366
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,950
But that's not me, though, right?

367
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:23,170
So I just wanted to bring up the point again, just maybe to wrap up on the crucifixion stoning

368
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:23,550
thing.

369
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:31,650
If you look at those that are known to be, let's say, very academic in the field of biblical

370
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:37,330
study, especially the New Testament, well, when you say biblical study, unless you're,

371
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:43,090
excuse me, going to a Judean side, which the Judean side, if you're a biblical student,

372
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:47,710
also they do, unless it's very orthodox, let's say, will also study the New Testament.

373
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:56,010
I have yet to find any academic at all, in private, that would not agree that it was

374
00:23:56,010 --> 00:24:00,810
a stoning, with the caveat to himself in the conversation, but we can't really talk about

375
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:03,350
that, or it doesn't really matter overall.

376
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,750
Very, very interesting.

377
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:11,010
So, yeah, and that's what I've got to say about that.

378
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:19,990
Well, there you go, I mean, I've encountered the it-doesn't-really-matter answer before.

379
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:20,850
Right.

380
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:23,550
Well, it's a series of things, it's not only that.

381
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:29,330
It's a series of properly identifying, like, let's go back to 9-11.

382
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,130
How many Osama bin Laden's are there?

383
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,170
How many times did he die?

384
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:34,030
How many times was he killed, right?

385
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:39,530
But there's only, will the real Osama bin Laden please stand up kind of thing, right?

386
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:43,270
Remember, there was a show like that, Will the Real Whatever Please Stand Up, right?

387
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:44,390
Yeah.

388
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,930
Yeah, so everything is just misidentification out there.

389
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:54,070
Well, there was a TV show called To Tell the Truth, which was pretty funny, where that

390
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,250
was the end of it, right?

391
00:24:55,350 --> 00:25:00,330
There was three people would say they were the same guy, and then that would happen,

392
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:04,750
and then, of course, that's sort of a cultural trope, actually.

393
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:05,270
Yeah.

394
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,970
And even Eminem used it, right?

395
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:08,690
Yeah, there you go.

396
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:13,410
So the thing is, if you're going to invest something as important as, quote-unquote,

397
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:19,450
your faith to the faith, because it's not faith, it's the faith, don't you want to have

398
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:21,310
your identification correct?

399
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:26,390
I mean, if you're going to invest in something, don't you put it in a lockbox?

400
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:29,630
Don't you want to have the key or the combination to your own lockbox?

401
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:30,210
Yeah.

402
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:30,450
Right?

403
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,190
It's pretty interesting.

404
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:37,690
So, yeah, and by the way, you're not going to win people over talking this way, by the

405
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:37,890
way.

406
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,190
No, that's a guarantee.

407
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,430
No one's going to come rushing over.

408
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:40,970
Yeah.

409
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,330
Yeah, that's a guarantee.

410
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:46,130
You do not win friends with this.

411
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,150
No.

412
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:54,910
Or a following, by the way, because it displaces the entire center of gravity of everything

413
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:57,130
that people think and know about Christianity.

414
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:02,850
The same thing with the nuclear demolition, right?

415
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,690
And here's the thing that's real interesting.

416
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:07,170
How many people are silent?

417
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:11,990
You know, like 9-11, for example, there are thousands of people involved in orchestrating

418
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:12,370
that.

419
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:13,510
Thousands.

420
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:18,450
Maybe tens, I wouldn't say tens of thousands, but pretty close.

421
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:21,770
How many come out and, you know, are speaking?

422
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:22,550
None.

423
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:23,790
Right?

424
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:24,730
Very few.

425
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:25,630
The same thing with this.

426
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:26,690
Same thing with...

427
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:32,650
I always found to use 9-11 and the biblical Christ as quite the parallel.

428
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:39,030
And we've covered, you know, like, for example, in the Exodus, you know, when they crossed

429
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:45,610
the Sea of Reeds, not the Red Sea, the Sea of Reeds, they walked on it as if it was dry

430
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,050
land, right?

431
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:50,910
And it's not like the movie where they're walking on the bottom.

432
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:51,190
I don't know.

433
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:53,490
You ever walked on a dredged lake, right?

434
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:57,390
Well, you go knee deep in the silt and the sludge, right?

435
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:58,670
So, yeah.

436
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:03,550
So, anyway, and the book states very clearly that when the pharaoh tried to cross in the

437
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:09,690
morning, in the morning, when the sun is out, basically stated, that he fell to the bottom

438
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,270
like stone.

439
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:13,210
He fell to the bottom like lead.

440
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:17,990
Well, if they're walking on the bottom, how can he fall to the bottom if he's already

441
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:18,550
on the bottom?

442
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:19,450
Yeah, right.

443
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:25,850
I mean, this is another thing that will really get people, get their ire going.

444
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,210
They'll be like, Greek, you're nuts, man.

445
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,110
We saw it in the movie.

446
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:29,190
You know?

447
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:31,330
I was like, okay, yeah.

448
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:32,530
Yeah.

449
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:34,490
So, things are radically, radically different.

450
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:39,510
Speaking of radically different, one of the other things we spoke about in the recent

451
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,590
Sonic was hygiene.

452
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:44,110
And I didn't even mention that people should wash their bum.

453
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:46,130
I didn't even mention that, right?

454
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:49,890
No, we didn't get into the washing very much.

455
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:52,010
No, we talked about a great many other things.

456
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:59,430
You gave a great many interesting hints about how to properly clean a few things.

457
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:00,590
Yeah, sort of.

458
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:01,370
But we didn't get there.

459
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:02,710
It's perspective.

460
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,130
It's perspective.

461
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:08,690
Remember, okay, by the way, wash your bum if you're, you know, if you're listening.

462
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:10,590
Yeah, it's very important, but there's an order to it.

463
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:17,970
From the top down, face, armpits, groin, feet, right?

464
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,510
Why am I saying this?

465
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,930
Camping in the desert.

466
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:28,470
If you're active, you're going to need a gallon of water a day for drinking, right?

467
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:31,570
Because of respiration and evaporation, okay?

468
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,330
You still want to wash.

469
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:42,010
They have these little screw bottle tops you put on a 28-millimeter bottle, you know, the basic water bottles.

470
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:42,450
Right.

471
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:46,030
With lots of little tiny holes in there.

472
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:49,110
They're like, you know, number 30 holes, really small.

473
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:56,110
32 ounces, 24 to 32-ounce bottle that you leave in the sun to get hot, by the way.

474
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,330
You take a nice hot shower.

475
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:01,210
It's plenty, believe it or not.

476
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:03,570
A 32-ounce shower.

477
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:05,450
I call it a bottle bath.

478
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:10,490
And just leave the bottle in the sun.

479
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:12,770
It gets really almost hot to the touch.

480
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:14,250
Put it in a bag.

481
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:14,990
Keep it warm.

482
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:17,370
You know, you want to wash before the sun goes down.

483
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:21,850
32 ounces will do it, but you got to have a very fine spray.

484
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:26,210
We're not talking about, you know, let's say dumping, decanting the bottle.

485
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:30,910
You know, you have one of these, you know, the bottle cap's got like 100 tiny holes drilled in it, right?

486
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:33,350
So it's a very fine spray when you squeeze the bottle.

487
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:37,750
Yeah, I've only been able to accomplish that by hand with a gallon, honestly.

488
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:40,910
But that's because the holes are larger.

489
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,690
No, no, large holes.

490
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,350
The holes are larger.

491
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:48,170
Use the point of something and just kind of, you know, poke holes.

492
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:48,430
Oh, gotcha.

493
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:48,770
Yeah.

494
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:54,530
Well, you could use a needle, a hot needle, and spend about 15 minutes putting as many holes as possible.

495
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:55,790
Finer the spray, the better.

496
00:29:56,330 --> 00:30:00,430
And just like the shower states, it starts, you know, gravity, let's say, guides it

497
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:04,430
so you got head, face, then armpits, then groin, then feet.

498
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,010
The feet is kind of de facto.

499
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:12,050
If you're standing there and the water's running, even running off, you're going to get your feet clean.

500
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,710
But that's basically it.

501
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:18,790
There's something in the old nurse's handbook when patients were brought in,

502
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:25,430
this is from the 1800s up until the early 1900s, it was all based on hygiene.

503
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:33,190
Even the success of surgeries and childbearing and recovery, convalescence, was all based on hygiene.

504
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:39,930
What they stated was when a new patient came in and they were going to be in a bed,

505
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:47,030
that the nurses first had to examine them for lice, and some people might laugh about that,

506
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:49,770
but that still is a problem, by the way, in public schools.

507
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:53,850
You might even see in some newspaper articles there's a lice breakout, right?

508
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:55,570
Even these days.

509
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:57,270
Right, still, yes.

510
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:57,710
Yep.

511
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:03,930
So they examine for that, and if there's any question, the hair is cut to a quarter of an inch or less.

512
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:13,130
The next thing they do, or while that's happening, is fingernails are trimmed to remove any debris or matter that's under the fingernails.

513
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:13,570
Right?

514
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:14,310
Right.

515
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:19,790
So down where there's no cuticle, well, there's no overlap on the finger.

516
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:33,570
And then they're washed from the waist down thoroughly, and the toenails are also clipped and feet are washed.

517
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:42,450
I think they even say with the feet you add a small amount of iodine to the water, and this is before the iodine was colored red.

518
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:44,990
Dyed red.

519
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:50,090
The reason they dye things like that is so you don't use them internally or other things.

520
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:53,070
They say, oh, so the doctor can see where he's putting it on.

521
00:31:53,130 --> 00:32:00,570
No, no, because they know it has properties that for some in the right combination would be, quote, unquote, a miracle cure kind of thing.

522
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:00,830
Right?

523
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:04,050
So they deliberately adulterate things.

524
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:10,010
So this is just like a hint that when I read that, I was like, wow, I've seen people go into a hospital,

525
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:15,630
and they don't trim their fingernails or cut their hair, and they're just sitting there with antiseptics sprayed in the air or whatever.

526
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:28,870
So hygiene gets down to that point where ultimately in old days when you acquired people as property, you basically shaved all their bodily hair off to start fresh.

527
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:30,650
Right.

528
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:34,370
So, yeah, interesting stuff from that perspective.

529
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:43,490
But I did not get into just the direct washing, and the reason why I didn't, I guess, is because it's obvious.

530
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:43,870
Right?

531
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:45,270
Maybe it's obvious enough.

532
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:46,250
It should be, yeah.

533
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:47,010
Yeah.

534
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:54,390
One of the questions that was interesting from Vandy was about being in balance.

535
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:59,650
What's interesting is I did bring up, like, for example, I think it was E. coli.

536
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,790
It's not the bug that hurts you.

537
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:06,390
It's what the bug eats and gives off that hurts you.

538
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:06,650
Right.

539
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:09,050
From almost a chemical aspect.

540
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:12,970
That balance is maintained, again, by induction.

541
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:20,790
If you have anything in a high population, by the way, all these bugs are found in the body already.

542
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:27,890
It's when they, what would you call when something gets out of hand, when too much of something, right?

543
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:29,270
Overwhelms.

544
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,110
Overwhelms.

545
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:34,090
Yeah, overpopulation of it is when you have the problem.

546
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:44,910
But the balance is upset thusly, because since I brought up the E. coli, typically E. coli you'll find it in natural form.

547
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:49,810
It grows on the surface of flesh where the dermis has been removed.

548
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:52,810
It doesn't grow on the dermis, only on the muscle tissue when it's exposed.

549
00:33:53,850 --> 00:34:02,450
So let's say you get a steak, right, from beef muscle and you leave it exposed.

550
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:13,989
E. coli through induction and through, I guess you might call it biogenesis, starts to appear just like amoebas appear in grass when it's in water on the surface of the meat in very, very small amounts.

551
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:24,469
And typically the meat will be, at that point as the E. coli population starts to increase, the meat will be prepared for eating.

552
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:29,330
Maybe a salt bath, maybe it'll be baked, grilled or fried, right?

553
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:32,350
And that eliminates the E. coli on the surface then.

554
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:34,590
It keeps the balance very low.

555
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:38,139
You're not going to get too much induction from that after it's been cured.

556
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:40,770
Cured and cooked, yeah.

557
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:43,550
Cured and cooked or cured or cooked, right?

558
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:48,429
Because the curing, the salt, the brine, all this other stuff and spices will retard the growth.

559
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:48,890
Right.

560
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:53,949
Typically when you have these E. coli breakouts, it's from ground beef.

561
00:34:55,030 --> 00:35:06,490
Because if you've ever seen how ground beef is done, they put all the steaks or meat cuts on a tray and there's a big grinder, meat grinder that they feed it into, right?

562
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:10,930
Little by little and get whatever mix they want or prescribe.

563
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:26,150
Now what happens if that meat is not treated well or eaten quickly or not kept at a low enough temperature, remember all the meat that was fed into the grinder already has the E. coli growing on the surface.

564
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:29,570
But now that you ground it, now it's on the inside.

565
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,890
Now it's mixed in the meat.

566
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,110
It's all over the place.

567
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:33,390
It's not just on the surface.

568
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:33,970
It's everywhere.

569
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:34,430
Right.

570
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,170
It's everywhere.

571
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:42,890
And not only that, when you're done grinding the meat, you have a big lump of ground meat that now you have more E. coli growing on the surface.

572
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:44,830
And you've got it growing inside.

573
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:45,170
Okay.

574
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:46,930
So you start out with some on the surface.

575
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,110
Now you mix that in.

576
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:48,710
So it's in.

577
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:49,130
It's out.

578
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:50,010
It's in the center.

579
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:50,970
It's on the side.

580
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:56,090
And now this new surface that has come together develops more.

581
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:56,650
Okay.

582
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:57,490
It makes perfect sense.

583
00:35:58,370 --> 00:35:58,530
Yeah.

584
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:01,910
That's why typically they say you shouldn't eat ground beef out rare.

585
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:02,550
Right.

586
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:07,950
Yeah, it should be well done or whatever, unless precautions are taken.

587
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:10,370
A lot of salt is used in the area, so on and so forth.

588
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:14,270
So what I'm giving here is an example of a form of balance.

589
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:25,910
I would say the situation first where it's just on the surface and the meat is prepared either with salt or brine or thrown on the grill or fried or whatever, it's in balance with what we can handle.

590
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:26,270
Right?

591
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:26,610
Right.

592
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:40,010
It's also sort of in balance if you grind it into the meat and once it's ground in, it's kept at a low enough temperature so more won't grow or, of course, it's cooked and treated again in sausage or whatever.

593
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:40,430
Right.

594
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:49,710
But when it gets out of balance is when you don't treat the ground meat well and it keeps growing again, but now you've got a double whammy because it's mixed in.

595
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:50,770
It's not just on the surface.

596
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:51,070
Right.

597
00:36:51,790 --> 00:37:01,790
So this is where your imbalance happens when you understand, let's say, the terrain or the environment, and it all happens by induction.

598
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:14,250
Because if you eat that ground beef that, let's say, is tainted and the vermin is found in the blood, for example, it's usually found in the stool is where they do a stool test.

599
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:24,630
But if it's in the blood, your body starts to create these guys in larger numbers, and it's much harder than if it just stayed in the stool.

600
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:25,010
Right.

601
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:25,510
You know what I mean?

602
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:26,990
And it wasn't inducted.

603
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:29,990
And then you're really out of whack, as they say.

604
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:30,550
Right.

605
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,610
And in that case, then you have to be more extreme.

606
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:39,990
Now, one thing I hearken to is macrobiotics, the Yin and Yang principle.

607
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:48,150
I don't lean on it too heavily because people think I'm pushing Asian or Oriental philosophy or science on them.

608
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:58,850
But unfortunately, it's the, quote, unquote, Oriental side of this philosophy, let's say, or process has been preserved there.

609
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:02,990
It has not been preserved very well in the Western sector of the world.

610
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:03,450
Right.

611
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:10,330
But to lean on that, understanding Yin and Yang, one day we'll probably get into it.

612
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:15,390
Maybe we'll get into it a little bit now because it does pertain, because that has to do with balance.

613
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:18,530
Now, Yin is considered soft, expansive.

614
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:19,790
Right.

615
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:25,070
And Yang is considered hard and contractive.

616
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:25,710
Right.

617
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:30,830
And this is typically when you're just looking at objects in the room or foodstuffs.

618
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:39,470
But when you start moving into the energies, the non-tangible Yin and Yang, it gets really complicated quickly.

619
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:51,090
Because when you have, for example, an energy or a condition known as cold, that is very Yin.

620
00:38:52,310 --> 00:39:00,090
But when you affect something with a lot of cold, let's say a piece of meat that's soft, does it become more Yin?

621
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:01,450
Or does it become the opposite?

622
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:02,270
It becomes Yang.

623
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:05,330
Because when you start chilling meat more and more, it doesn't get softer.

624
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:06,410
No, it gets harder.

625
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:07,150
It gets harder.

626
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:08,350
Well, it gets harder.

627
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:12,950
So a very Yin force like cold will freeze things and make them harder.

628
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:16,010
Even a piece of metal is harder when the temperature goes down.

629
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:16,190
Right.

630
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:18,190
As the temperature rises, the metal gets softer.

631
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:19,010
Right.

632
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:19,350
Right.

633
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:26,690
So the Yin, let's call it a force, because it's a force in motion also.

634
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:29,710
If it stops moving, it's no longer an energy.

635
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,630
It has manifested.

636
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:32,830
It's arrived.

637
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:35,010
Right.

638
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:38,050
So cold, which is Yin, will turn things Yang.

639
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:42,170
Now, heat, fire, is very Yang.

640
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:43,950
But it makes things Yin.

641
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:46,390
Let's go back to, let's say, a piece of metal.

642
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:47,930
We have a really hard piece of metal.

643
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:51,450
And we're going to put a Yang energy on it, which is fire.

644
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:53,710
We keep heating it, keep heating it, keep heating it.

645
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:54,590
What happens to that metal?

646
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:57,190
Does it get harder because it's being hit with Yang energy?

647
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:57,950
No.

648
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,070
It goes the opposite.

649
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,730
It gets softer and softer until it melts.

650
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:03,710
You see how it works?

651
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:05,150
Yeah.

652
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:07,910
It leads to two really interesting questions.

653
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:10,290
And I'm not sure if this is the appropriate time to ask them.

654
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:11,450
But I'll throw them there anyway.

655
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:16,470
One thing is, look, at a certain point, yeah, things get softer.

656
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:22,490
But they also become more difficult to manage and more difficult to be contained.

657
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:26,990
Because, okay, a soft piece of metal, you can pick it up, you can bend it,

658
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:28,930
yeah, it becomes malleable, right?

659
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:31,670
Well, it depends on what level of Yin it is.

660
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:35,550
Like if you're working with copper, 80 degrees, 85 degrees is an excellent,

661
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,570
you know, for hammering copper, you know, shape it.

662
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:38,930
Oh, yeah, you can begin to shape it there.

663
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:39,370
Yeah, sure.

664
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:39,910
Yeah.

665
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:42,990
But if you go higher in temperature, it gets harder again.

666
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:44,050
Right.

667
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,850
You have to go then much higher for it to soften again.

668
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,990
So everything has its zone where it fights back.

669
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:48,590
Yeah.

670
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:48,890
Okay.

671
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:51,830
That's what I was going to ask about it fighting back and forth,

672
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:54,330
because there's that that goes on.

673
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:54,830
Yeah, go ahead.

674
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:59,570
They call them latent points, you know, like the water has that at 98.6.

675
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:07,190
If you look at a graph of as you add equal amounts of heat to a given amount of volume of water,

676
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:11,250
you'll notice that the temperature and the expansion of the water is pretty linear.

677
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:13,870
The graph shows at 45 degrees.

678
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:17,630
As you add more temperature, the water keeps expanding very evenly.

679
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:21,450
But once you get to about 98, 98.6, it bottoms out.

680
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:23,630
You keep adding heat, the water does not expand.

681
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:27,070
Keep adding more heat, the water's still not expanding for quite a while.

682
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:32,270
And then you add, once you get to a certain point of heat again, it starts expanding again.

683
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:33,610
Isn't that an interesting coincidence?

684
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:34,690
Mm-hmm.

685
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:35,750
Right?

686
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:37,430
No, it's interesting.

687
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:43,950
But I'm just saying there's a certain difference in resistance that's not exact to, like,

688
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:46,870
it's not like, okay, so every 10 degrees you go up, you're going to get.

689
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:47,670
It's not linear.

690
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:48,570
It's not linear.

691
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:53,530
Everything based on its melting point will have a resonance going backwards on where

692
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:55,830
it will have a point where it's not linear.

693
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:56,470
Right.

694
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:58,170
And that gets a little more complicated.

695
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:03,790
But what I wanted to state, ultimately, when you're speaking of balance in the human body,

696
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:06,810
the yin is the life force.

697
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:11,490
So when you're eating food, you could have food that's yin and food that's yang, right?

698
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:16,590
Like meat would be yang and sweets and sugars would be considered yin, right?

699
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:22,090
But all of it, all of your intake, all of your food and water and breathing is actually

700
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:24,370
you're feeding the yin part of the body.

701
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:26,970
Yin is where the life is, the motion.

702
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:31,990
See, when you're alive, you're soft and you can move around a lot, right?

703
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:32,350
Right.

704
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:35,450
But when you're not alive, you're typically not that soft.

705
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:38,650
You dry up like a mummy, right, and you're not moving.

706
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:39,250
Right.

707
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:40,590
So yin is motion.

708
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:41,610
Okay.

709
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:44,290
You can move anywhere you want, pretty much.

710
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:45,110
Okay.

711
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:50,670
So there's the yang component in the body which protects the yin.

712
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:54,730
So it would be the energetic armor, the energetic field.

713
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:59,990
Very much like a yang expression would be, let's say you're having a conversation with

714
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:04,870
someone and they're joking around and they fake a punch and you flinch and try to defend

715
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:06,990
yourself, right, without even thinking about it, right?

716
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:07,190
Right.

717
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:08,850
You pretty much do it automatically.

718
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:12,930
That's the yang being triggered in the body to protect the body, right?

719
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:13,510
Okay.

720
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:14,870
Even if you're just playing around.

721
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:15,990
Sure, sure.

722
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:19,310
So it also works all the way to death.

723
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:23,970
I've always given, maybe I'll give the example now.

724
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:29,990
When you work with people on health matters and things like that, you always get the grandma

725
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:32,750
that's really ill and she's in hospital or hospice, right?

726
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:33,290
Yes.

727
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:34,490
You always get that story.

728
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:34,890
Sure.

729
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:35,990
Or parent.

730
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:39,350
And they're in there for weeks and weeks and months and months.

731
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:44,890
They try all kinds of stuff and really the person is quite old and they've really, let's

732
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:50,830
say, not considered these things and there are protocols that the allopathic medicine

733
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:53,110
people say they should do.

734
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:54,410
So there's really no helping them.

735
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:59,290
But you get a call and they're getting worse and worse and worse.

736
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:03,270
And the call is, they're calling everyone and all the friends and relatives to come visit

737
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:06,450
grandma because she's sitting up in bed after three months in hospice.

738
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:07,530
She's sitting up in bed.

739
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:09,350
She's bright and alert.

740
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:15,970
And she's so alert and so physically well, she can get up and walk around a little bit

741
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:17,950
that they think they're going to take her home.

742
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:18,830
It's a miracle.

743
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:20,290
Well, yeah, it's a weird thing.

744
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:25,570
It's often done and they say it's a good thing to go do that because...

745
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:27,450
Yeah, but let me hear this out.

746
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:32,490
Well, they do it for the outside perspective really fast all the time because let's just

747
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:33,550
say it's your grandma, Greek.

748
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:37,350
They'd want you to come there and do that because they'd say to you, look, it's good

749
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:40,450
for you to see her like this to remember her like this.

750
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:41,210
Sure, sure.

751
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:41,550
Yeah.

752
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:42,430
Oh, yeah, I got it.

753
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:42,630
Yeah.

754
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:44,190
From a compassion.

755
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:46,790
But I'm getting this call also.

756
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:47,370
Right.

757
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:48,970
So my question, this is Yin and Yang now.

758
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:51,830
My question is, how is her skin tone?

759
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:57,270
Does it look like you remember her or does she look really, really shiny like you rubbed

760
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:58,210
her down with Vaseline?

761
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:04,510
She goes, oh, Greek, you know, she does look really shiny like you rubbed her down with

762
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:04,950
Vaseline.

763
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:05,670
How do you know?

764
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:10,630
I said, well, she's probably going to be, whatever you're going to do, do it with her

765
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:14,610
now because she probably will pass in the next few hours or by morning.

766
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:17,210
And you're like, Greek, how dare you say that?

767
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:19,410
You asshole, bye.

768
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:20,510
Right?

769
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:21,050
Yeah.

770
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:22,590
And guess what happens?

771
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:24,610
Okay, what's going on?

772
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:30,370
As this person is laying in bed getting worse and worse and worse and worse, the Yin is

773
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:31,350
leaving the body.

774
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:33,630
The Yang is still there.

775
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:37,210
So the first thing that leaves is the Yin.

776
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:39,530
The last thing that leaves is the Yang.

777
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:42,910
Yin is spread out, soft, malleable.

778
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:45,130
Yang is hard and focused.

779
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:50,130
So this person, all their Yin is being drained out of their body for weeks and months.

780
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:55,910
And when all the Yin is just about gone, because a little bit Yin is left to perform

781
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:58,650
the exiting of the Yang, because the Yang can't do it on its own.

782
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:01,550
If it's just Yang, you're just a mummy.

783
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:02,950
You're just as stiff like a twig.

784
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:09,530
So a little bit of Yin is in reserve to allow the Yang to escape the body.

785
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:15,290
So what happens is Yang is focused, very directed, energetic, upright.

786
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:20,390
So when all the Yin is gone, the Yang says, it's my time to go also.

787
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:22,190
That part of the energy field.

788
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:23,670
And what happens?

789
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:25,970
It manifests all of its glory.

790
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:27,650
The person is, what is Yang?

791
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:29,250
Upright, firm, directed.

792
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:30,690
What does the person do?

793
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:34,730
Sits upright, firm, directed, very clear, right?

794
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:36,290
Okay, so.

795
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:39,910
What I always note at that time, because I've been called in for these kind of things as

796
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:45,250
well, is a very hard, fixed, very solid focus.

797
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:47,970
The eyes are very focused at this time.

798
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:53,030
And although people tell me I'm absolutely crazy for seeing this, I do see it.

799
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:57,470
There is a bit of light which comes from the eye.

800
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:01,630
Literally, some people notice it, but it's a subconscious thing.

801
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:04,710
They don't literally see light, but they say their eyes are lit up.

802
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:06,530
Yeah, exactly.

803
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:11,070
The body, the Yang, which is light, by the way.

804
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:12,970
The most Yang light would be a laser beam.

805
00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:14,750
So it would be like a laser beam focus.

806
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:15,130
Yeah.

807
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:20,230
It's a very solid, fixed focus that comes from the eyes at that time, which would be

808
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:22,710
uncharacteristic of recent events.

809
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:24,470
Their eyes are not fixed.

810
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:25,610
They're wandering around.

811
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:28,810
People talk about eyes rolling around in their head.

812
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:30,290
They use different descriptions.

813
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:35,030
But the truth is that when you see this person sitting up, and all of a sudden, a lot of

814
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:36,570
people see it as, oh, this is a great improvement.

815
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:39,730
And I go, no, that is the indicator that...

816
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:42,270
It's the last call.

817
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:44,130
That's the last bit of strength.

818
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:45,950
And it literally, I can see light.

819
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:49,710
So I know it's, I don't know how to describe it, but I see a bit of light.

820
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:53,650
Well, that's where the oily, the Vaseline-coated skin look comes from.

821
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:56,930
And if you touch the skin, by the way, it's not oily at all.

822
00:47:57,370 --> 00:47:59,310
But they look really, really shiny.

823
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:05,770
Even if grandma's got completely wrinkled up, not a smooth surface on her face, it will

824
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:06,970
look really, really shiny.

825
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:13,010
Because the skin, being the most yin organ in the body, is now completely depleted.

826
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:14,770
The body's completely depleted of yin.

827
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:19,830
And it's asking the skin, please produce, you're the most yin, give us some of your

828
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:20,090
yin.

829
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:24,630
And the skin says, no, I'm going to just produce what I do normally, all my normal

830
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:27,530
functions, which is produce all these oils and urea and all that.

831
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:31,950
But what's interesting, the intensity of the material that's produced on the skin

832
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:37,050
at this point does not feel oily to the touch or sticky, but it takes on this very

833
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:41,070
high sheen, almost as if it's, when something is shiny, it reflects a lot more

834
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:42,550
light also, you see.

835
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:46,890
So for some reason, the skin gets very shiny, in almost all cases.

836
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:51,720
So this is how life ends.

837
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:56,400
For another example, shallow breathing is very yin.

838
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,440
A sharp breath or an exhale is yang.

839
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:08,060
When someone passes, sometimes their last breath is a pretty strong inhale or exhale.

840
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:13,480
I've been around when someone passed and it was just shallow all the way down.

841
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:20,200
So this is not something true for every case, but it's something to be aware of.

842
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:23,280
There's a lot of factors that can come in regarding the breath.

843
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:30,220
But the nature of it and the outward appearance, I don't think is what's actually,

844
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,220
you're not actually observing how it's really going.

845
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:34,080
You know what I mean?

846
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:41,680
I brought this up because it's a perfect example for how the yin and yang interact

847
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:45,300
in the body in terms of balance, because the question in the chat was regarding

848
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:50,740
balance, and I gave, let's say, the quote-unquote story about how the E. coli

849
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:53,360
worked in the body, being out of balance through induction.

850
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,920
And then ultimately, balance is the balance of these two forces.

851
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:02,800
But what happens when something goes out of balance means that one of them is missing.

852
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:08,340
Just like in a storm, what defines a hurricane is you have two arms that are counter-rotating.

853
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:11,640
If you eliminate one of the arms, it's not a hurricane now.

854
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:13,360
It's just one arm. It's just a storm, right?

855
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,720
Yeah, it's a storm. It's a strong wind in one direction.

856
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:21,400
Yeah, you need both arms to make, okay, so the balance to a hurricane is extremely balanced.

857
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:28,520
That's why when I did weather work, notably, I chased hurricanes and eliminated them.

858
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:35,540
I had about 3,000 to 5,000-mile range, a very confident 75% chance of elimination of a hurricane.

859
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:40,880
And I developed a method, went back and forth with Trevor James Constable.

860
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:44,380
I said, look, he was like, aim at the eye, and I was like, no,

861
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:48,320
I'm just going to take out one of the arms because if one of the arms goes out, then it's no longer a hurricane.

862
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:49,260
He's a brilliant idea.

863
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:52,920
And that was my methodology instead of going for the eye.

864
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:57,240
But the balance, again, it's just a balancing there.

865
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:02,540
So in this case, the yin, one part of the balancing act has to go first.

866
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,120
Very rarely do they both go together.

867
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:04,780
They can.

868
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:09,120
This goes with every system of health, by the way.

869
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:14,600
For example, what I state, I've been using this as an analogy.

870
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,280
I discovered this in the 1980s.

871
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:24,100
Where you have socialized medicine that had a union-based platform for the socialism, where they were allowed to strike,

872
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,340
well, the doctors were socialists.

873
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:35,960
You made more as a bellhop at a Hilton hotel than you did as a surgeon, right, in some countries back in the day and probably still now.

874
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:40,080
Well, when the doctors went on strike, the morgues were empty.

875
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:41,900
People stopped dying.

876
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:46,340
And when the doctors went back to work, the morgues started filling up again.

877
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:54,660
So there was a direct correlation between an active medical community, meaning medical technicians, and a steady flow at the morgue.

878
00:51:55,180 --> 00:52:03,000
Now, some people might say, just like the crucifixion, well, Greek, I want to argue that maybe where the ambulance workers and the drivers also.

879
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,900
Oh, so maybe the bodies were happening, but nobody was picking them up, kind of argument.

880
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:12,920
Yeah, I said, look, if the strike is more than three days, you're going to put them in a cab to take them to the morgue.

881
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,080
Yeah, nobody's going to, right.

882
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,600
Yeah, you're not going to, yeah.

883
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:22,140
If Grandma dies in the house, you might keep her until the next day, but you ain't keeping her past that.

884
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:25,380
You're going to find a way to get mobile.

885
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,720
Yeah, so it's amazing what I've heard through the years.

886
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:29,960
That's why it's like, I don't argue.

887
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,960
I say, you want to argue with me so you could win?

888
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:32,860
And they're like, yeah, of course.

889
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:33,820
Oh, you won already.

890
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,180
Oh, you can't do that.

891
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:35,760
You have to.

892
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:36,980
No, I just did.

893
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:38,200
Leave me alone, please.

894
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:40,420
I got better things to do, like sleep.

895
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:47,440
Yeah, so there's a direct correlation between all of these things.

896
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:52,360
You could look at, all right, what is the balance here, what the doctors are doing?

897
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:58,400
They're pretty much destroying your yin is what they're doing with all of the drugs and all that.

898
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,280
So the body's yang is always last to leave.

899
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:09,600
And what's interesting, when you look at with their methodologies, you ever notice or heard protocols,

900
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:15,880
when someone is dying from treatment that they give, they try to resuscitate them with adrenalines and amphetamines,

901
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:18,820
just stuff that wakes you uppers, right?

902
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:19,240
Right.

903
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,800
Oh, that'll bring them back, right?

904
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:25,760
So even they're using the same principle in their wackadoo system.

905
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:26,440
Right.

906
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:33,320
Because, look, they inject people for chemotherapy, they get water from the toilet at Chernobyl,

907
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,380
and they inject it into your body, right?

908
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:42,120
And when you pass out from that, they inject you with amphetamines or adrenaline, right, the yang.

909
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:48,580
So it's kind of hard to escape the balancing.

910
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:54,020
Because they're still working within this confine of this environment, this universe, this simulation,

911
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:56,360
the current medical system.

912
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:02,340
So if you want to just look at, let's say, natural causes or the causes through the Western medicine,

913
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:06,920
which, by the way, the Eastern world is also adopting, it's still the same.

914
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:12,620
You could see when someone is dying from their treatment, they apply yang principles in the end.

915
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:14,160
Very interesting.

916
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:16,820
So the balancing act is what it is.

917
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:21,700
But once you understand induction, you start to go more into the finer realm,

918
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:26,020
which is actually, the finer realm is what makes everything.

919
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:31,800
So once you start, I call it the formative zone, where all things are formed,

920
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:35,340
once you start delving there and knowing what's going on,

921
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:41,020
then you will develop a sensitivity and a sensibility for it, right?

922
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:43,940
Because you have to be sensitive, because it's not in your face,

923
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:46,000
it's not something you could put in a jar, close the lid.

924
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:49,700
And then you have the sensibility, right?

925
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:55,360
Like, for example, a sensibility would be like, oh yeah, there's a quote-unquote airborne virus,

926
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:57,700
let's just put on a dust mask, that'll help us, right?

927
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,000
That's not sensible, right?

928
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:05,060
So the sensitivity and the sensibility.

929
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:12,360
By the way, when it comes to pandemics, real ones, I think I'm just going to do a quick repeat.

930
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:15,520
If the water is cut off and the sewer lines are not working,

931
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:19,180
so what I mean by water is cut off, the taps don't work,

932
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:24,100
and you have trucks bringing, tanker trucks bringing water to people,

933
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:27,900
and they're standing out in the street with pots and pans to get water, right?

934
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:29,820
Like Flint, Michigan, but, yeah.

935
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:31,140
Yeah, yeah, kind of.

936
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:34,640
Or, and the sewers don't work, in other words, you're driving down the street,

937
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:38,240
and here's a manhole cover and all this fecal matter is coming out of the manhole cover,

938
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:40,440
all over the street, right?

939
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:40,960
Right.

940
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:44,980
Kind of like if you ever go to a rainstorm in Mexico, it's kind of like that.

941
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:48,540
Sometimes the, as it starts raining, the system gets overcharged,

942
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:51,240
and anybody flushes their toilet, well, here it comes up to the street,

943
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:52,940
through the sewer that's overflowing, you know?

944
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:57,680
So it was going on in Lake Charles also, Louisiana.

945
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:05,820
Anyway, I just told them a bunch of passcodes that you have to untie the storm sewer from the main sewer.

946
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:15,800
But anyway, when you start seeing that happening, now that's the setup for a pandemic, you see?

947
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,560
And it'll still take weeks and months to develop.

948
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:24,240
Okay, but once something like that is developed, like the plague,

949
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:31,540
where people's skin basically exploded in a few days, literally,

950
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:34,740
it just soars internally as well.

951
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:38,180
And if you look at what was going on with the hemorrhagic fever,

952
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:41,000
they called the Spanish flu, which is the American army flu, really,

953
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:45,820
where your lungs basically got, it's almost like a tuberculosis kind of condition,

954
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:49,480
where your big holes, Swiss cheese lungs kind of thing, immediately,

955
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:51,980
once it sets on, it only takes a few hours.

956
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,740
Things like that, once they set into the population,

957
00:56:57,660 --> 00:57:01,740
the induction is so strong that the concept of sterilization

958
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:07,440
and those precautionary methods are sort of very difficult.

959
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:10,120
You almost have to get out of dodge.

960
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:11,640
So what do I mean by this?

961
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:15,380
With the bubonic plague, if you had something, let's say garments

962
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:18,860
or something you wanted to clean and sterilize from the bubonic plague,

963
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:23,240
you would have to boil it for no less than 15 minutes.

964
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:26,500
Not 14 minutes, 15 minutes.

965
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,120
That's how tenacious this inductive power is.

966
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:34,940
It's almost as if, once this sets into our program, meaning this reality,

967
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:37,800
it has like a crystalline form to it.

968
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:41,200
It's not this little virus bug thing, you know, whatever.

969
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:46,620
It almost has a crystalline nature to it, which is very, very, very tough, you see.

970
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:48,080
And what do crystals do?

971
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:51,600
They're known to be energy transfer and information transfer.

972
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:54,740
You hear about advanced societies,

973
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,980
well, look, even the earthy, crunchy, airy fairies,

974
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:58,380
you know, hold on to this crystal, right?

975
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:00,080
It gives you, you know, has information.

976
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:05,440
So I just wanted to throw this out there because I see some stuff like that

977
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:09,460
being resolved in this society, but not now.

978
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:11,940
You'll see it coming weeks and months before.

979
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:13,840
And here's the other thing.

980
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:18,920
If there was a real pandemic, it would be completely denied,

981
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:22,660
and the people that were shouting that it's real would be what?

982
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,000
Not disqualified, but what do you call it when you smear people?

983
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,140
Call them conspiracy theory.

984
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:29,520
What do you call that?

985
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:33,240
Well, there's a lot of disparaged.

986
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:34,820
Yes, yes, thank you.

987
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:36,000
Disparaged, I was looking for that.

988
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:41,000
Yeah, they would be disparaged until it finally sets in about a year later.

989
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:42,420
Oh, those people were right.

990
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:50,780
So hygiene in this case is also being aware of what you should get into

991
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:55,580
and what not get into and recognize the signs where, in other words,

992
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:58,820
let's just say hygiene may not take care of certain things on the extreme.

993
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,500
But in the meantime, in the day-to-day,

994
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:04,280
I brought up what we brought up in the last Sonic,

995
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:10,160
because I think it was in a form and in a way that people usually haven't heard it.

996
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:12,740
No, absolutely true.

997
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:15,980
And one thing to remember about the hemorrhagic fevers and those kind of things,

998
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:19,980
you know, the Ebola's and so on and so forth, is that at the end of the day,

999
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:24,580
the only way that this hasn't become a massive problem,

1000
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:26,400
to my understanding, and maybe I'm wrong,

1001
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:32,440
is that, you know, it moves so quickly, so aggressively,

1002
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:38,640
that you don't even have time to connect with the outside world fast enough

1003
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,440
in order to spread it quick enough.

1004
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:45,060
In other words, the reverse is the only way to deal with it is to contain it.

1005
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:48,800
And then it does what it does in a particular area.

1006
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,580
Right, if it's too aggressive, it won't spread,

1007
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:54,540
because it will just kill everybody and it will send off an alarm.

1008
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,840
And if it's too benign, it won't spread again,

1009
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:00,180
because if it's too benign, you'll have just pockets of people.

1010
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:05,200
There are some of these, again, what they call the Spanish Flu,

1011
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:07,260
the American Army Flu, and the bubonic plague.

1012
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:08,690
And there are a set of other pandemics.

1013
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,900
You know, there was a smallpox pandemic in the U.S.

1014
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:17,500
that got to its peak in the colonies in 1776,

1015
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:23,160
and that was a perfect time to start what they call the American Revolution.

1016
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:25,940
A lot of the ships that were sent over,

1017
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:28,320
they started fighting on Long Island, the Battle of Brooklyn.

1018
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:34,060
A lot of the Polish and English troops did not want to disembark.

1019
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:36,200
They were like, hey, why'd they send us over here?

1020
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:38,600
Don't you know that there's a smallpox pandemic here?

1021
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:41,660
I ain't getting off this ship, right, kind of thing, demoralizing.

1022
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:42,160
Right.

1023
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:47,400
So one of the things I did mention is when you do have a pandemic, there's war.

1024
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:51,740
And it didn't really directly correlate with the, quote-unquote, Ukraine War,

1025
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:52,780
because it's not really a war.

1026
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:58,440
It's almost like what the U.S. did in Vietnam, sort of,

1027
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:00,170
except they wanted to demilitarize.

1028
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:04,240
But anyway, yeah.

1029
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:08,420
So I guess I thought about hygiene again,

1030
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:10,140
because I didn't say wash your bum, you know,

1031
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:12,220
and I just wanted to throw these things in here.

1032
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:18,620
Well, it is important and does seem to be the key.

1033
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:22,200
You know, that is actually my argument most of the time.

1034
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:26,960
It's a little incongruous, but it's the argument that people tell me quite often.

1035
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:29,740
How can you possibly argue against, you know, vaccination?

1036
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:34,520
And what they're talking about is, you know, how do you argue against that?

1037
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:36,160
How do you argue, what's the matter with you?

1038
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:40,680
Don't you realize that that, you know, it cured, it eliminated this and that,

1039
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:41,260
and the third thing.

1040
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:41,960
It didn't.

1041
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:45,240
And I always say, and you can correct me if I'm wrong,

1042
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:49,020
but I always say the only reason why any of that stuff was ever controlled

1043
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:51,960
or not allowed to spread is because of hygiene, really.

1044
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:57,080
It was, you know, being able to take the waste away and bring in clean water.

1045
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:04,100
These were two important elements, and not leaving things to fester and grow.

1046
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:07,020
And the seasonal changes will wipe it out.

1047
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,220
Also, when you go through a series of hot and cold cycles,

1048
01:02:11,620 --> 01:02:15,440
that's why most of them don't last for a few years unless they're reconditioned.

1049
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:21,200
And also, you know, the champion of the VAX idea is polio,

1050
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:23,680
and polio had nothing to do with a virus.

1051
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:28,820
It had all to do with the bug spray, what's a DDT.

1052
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:33,140
And it's very simple to find, I hope, still.

1053
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:39,940
If you go online and doctors, I think no less than a dozen doctors went to Congress

1054
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:43,760
and spoke on the floor of Congress when they were in session about banning DDT

1055
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:49,320
because of the palsy and nervous degenerative nerve.

1056
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,240
They had all these terms for it, and based on their studies,

1057
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:55,240
it was basically crippling people.

1058
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:57,760
And there was a woman who wrote a book on it.

1059
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:00,860
Sorry, severe nerve damage is what I was saying.

1060
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:02,000
Yeah, exactly.

1061
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,540
And it affected not everyone equally and not everyone the same

1062
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:13,240
because you had all ages and all ranges of people coming down with certain maladies.

1063
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:15,500
So they banned it, and the polio went away,

1064
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:19,360
but they're still championing the vaccine over that.

1065
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:23,580
Now, there was a few years ago, more than a few years ago, about a decade ago,

1066
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:26,740
the Zika thing with the mosquitoes going on,

1067
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,920
and they were spraying for mosquitoes, and guess what happened?

1068
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:30,860
Children couldn't walk.

1069
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:33,780
They were crippled again, and they called it something else,

1070
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:39,240
and they developed a vaccine for that, which, of course, made it even worse.

1071
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:47,440
It seems to keep on happening is what I meant to say.

1072
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:49,020
I just said it twice, but yeah.

1073
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:54,720
And if people are not aware of the pranking, then it's very easy to repeat, right?

1074
01:03:54,720 --> 01:04:05,400
So anything in the chat that's of notoriety other than the massive topic of slave speak

1075
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,520
or slave, what is it called?

1076
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:09,560
Neuro-linguistic programming was announced.

1077
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:10,120
It was a book.

1078
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:12,260
I think there was a book written about it.

1079
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:18,040
NLP was a popular thing that people lectured on and wrote about for a little while.

1080
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:23,680
Slave speak was the term I mentioned and kind of cued a couple of conversations in there,

1081
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:28,580
but I think the general idea, we'd have to do a separate one on this,

1082
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:37,760
but the general idea that's focused on how the language is used in order to create circumstances

1083
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:46,120
that are not necessarily what people would interpret to be the circumstances that are created by the language.

1084
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:50,080
Simply applying names to things is one thing, right?

1085
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:52,900
But also the structure of the language.

1086
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:57,660
People like to use the term weaponized speech, right?

1087
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,320
This is a big thing nowadays.

1088
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:02,860
Well, yeah, speech is at all times weaponized,

1089
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:09,240
and I think the way that the common use of language, the way it's constructed,

1090
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:13,720
and you talk about this all the time, but I think a focus on it would be good.

1091
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:23,340
Also, a little ways back, somebody brought up a list of, oh boy, of terms for you because you had mentioned.

1092
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:24,040
Yeah, that was great.

1093
01:05:24,260 --> 01:05:25,900
That was a breath of fresh air, yeah.

1094
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:30,060
Yeah, these were the, what did you call it, metric terms, right?

1095
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:30,220
Metrics.

1096
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:34,120
If you use those words, you're considered just fine.

1097
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:37,820
Right, and it's a great list, actually.

1098
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:41,420
Of course, you had the J-E-S-U-S word in there.

1099
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:44,640
I'm now going to pull to the list real fast.

1100
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:51,240
Reptilian rights, justice, the Constitution, hell, Monday through Sunday, January through December,

1101
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:56,640
virus, blood pressure, God, Lord, rapture.

1102
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:58,860
One word missing from this, by the way.

1103
01:05:58,920 --> 01:05:59,900
I'll finish it, though.

1104
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:00,920
Let's see.

1105
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:02,220
Petrol.

1106
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:03,640
Ooh, what is this?

1107
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:08,380
Oh, petrol, some fossil fuels, okay.

1108
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,280
Fossil fuels, for sure.

1109
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:14,060
Love, woke, Santa Claus, Xmas, okay.

1110
01:06:14,820 --> 01:06:18,880
Anarchy, fallen angels, and mine and yours.

1111
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:20,460
Mine and yours is there.

1112
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:25,320
That's great, but I think it's also good to mention the conjunctions

1113
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:31,000
because when you are identifying something as mine, it may be different.

1114
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:36,140
Okay, when you're talking about my government, right,

1115
01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:40,240
that always gives me pause because how is it yours?

1116
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:41,340
I always ask, you know.

1117
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,160
How is it yours exactly?

1118
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:47,460
Much like when people were screaming, you know, they stole my vote.

1119
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:55,820
And I go, well, look, for you to claim it's yours, right, that kind of implies possession.

1120
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,380
And why are you voting at an election?

1121
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:00,500
Why are you voting at an election?

1122
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:02,900
Shouldn't you be electing at an election?

1123
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:04,120
You elect, okay.

1124
01:07:04,860 --> 01:07:05,820
You're not an elector.

1125
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:12,880
They even tell you you're the voters and the electors decided that, yeah.

1126
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:17,740
Just to recap real quick, it just means you're confident in the system.

1127
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:21,940
That's why it's called a vote of confidence or a vote of no confidence, right?

1128
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:25,900
Right, but the interesting thing is when it's yours, it's just very interesting.

1129
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:26,840
They stole my vote.

1130
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:30,720
I say, how do they steal something that you do not have possession of?

1131
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:36,160
See, because to me the idea of theft is that you took something that didn't belong to you.

1132
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:37,640
That's what it is.

1133
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:38,440
It's not yours.

1134
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:39,680
You took it, right?

1135
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:42,960
So who owned it?

1136
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:46,260
You're saying my vote, so you're describing the thing as yours.

1137
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:50,140
That means that you believe you owned it, right?

1138
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:52,900
Well, here's a simple thing.

1139
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:56,320
If you create something, it's yours.

1140
01:07:56,320 --> 01:08:05,980
You can give up control to it, but in a sense, if it's in the stipulations of the control that the ownership,

1141
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:16,020
now you're giving that over, then it's still not right for whoever takes it over to say it's theirs

1142
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:19,460
because they didn't create it, but it's theirs for use.

1143
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:20,520
You see?

1144
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:25,840
So you cannot say something that you did not create is yours.

1145
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:29,899
You're just basically using it, and that's one of the memes regarding the Rockefellers.

1146
01:08:29,979 --> 01:08:32,460
It says, own nothing, control everything, right?

1147
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:35,300
Remember, this is a common meme that was put.

1148
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:41,060
Well, what in the world could you truly own then?

1149
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:46,279
I mean, I would argue that maybe you could control and own your children.

1150
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:48,180
Control is different, though.

1151
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:50,500
I mean, that could have been registered.

1152
01:08:51,779 --> 01:08:57,720
By the way, just to throw something out, when people have problems with the child trafficking,

1153
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:00,620
it's called Child Protection Services, right?

1154
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:04,460
It's very well known that internationally it's a child trafficking ring.

1155
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:12,880
By the way, there's dozens of almost mainstream articles written about it that are factable, let's say, if that's a word.

1156
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:17,500
Just tell them, this child does not have a birth certificate.

1157
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:21,220
There is no birth certificate on this child or this offspring, and they run.

1158
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:22,120
They're told.

1159
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:23,899
That's one of the key words.

1160
01:09:24,939 --> 01:09:34,840
Also, from an attorney that I noticed, I didn't say lawyer, they do family court with child stuff.

1161
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:37,560
And I said, you know, that's all based on the birth certificate.

1162
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:38,560
She goes, yeah.

1163
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:43,920
And I say, if the birth certificate's in question or there is no birth certificate, you have no case.

1164
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:44,979
She goes, yep, absolutely.

1165
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:45,460
That's right.

1166
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:48,680
It's all based on the birth certificate, right?

1167
01:09:48,819 --> 01:10:00,400
So I kind of tested these things back and forth, and it's essentially words, paper, what's called – well, it's in law.

1168
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:03,580
You can sign over something to someone, right?

1169
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:07,060
I mean, that's essentially what's going on.

1170
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:10,800
Okay, what's going on here is you made it.

1171
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,780
You have – it's yours.

1172
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:14,940
But you're going to sign it over to us.

1173
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:18,940
And when you sign it over to us, now you have to pay a tax or a rent for using it.

1174
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:19,740
How does that sound?

1175
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:20,880
Right.

1176
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:21,260
Right?

1177
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:23,500
Now, this is what happened in Afghanistan.

1178
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:30,100
The Army set up Army-protected tents in all the villages, the main villages, and told people –

1179
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:34,920
that's why if you look at Afghanistan, all the Toyota pickup trucks, Nissan trucks or whatever,

1180
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:37,160
none of them have license plates on them, right?

1181
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:37,840
No, of course not.

1182
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:42,800
Right, but the American Army set up these tents and told people,

1183
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:46,940
why don't you come here and give us all the vehicle information, VIN number and all that,

1184
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:48,680
and you can register it with us.

1185
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:54,120
And they're backwards people supposedly, but they were like, okay, so when I register it with you,

1186
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:58,620
now I'm basically taking my rightful ownership of it over to you,

1187
01:10:58,660 --> 01:11:02,660
and then I have to pay a tax or a use fee for using my own truck, right?

1188
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:03,400
Mm-hmm.

1189
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:06,000
And no one showed up.

1190
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:06,900
This word got around.

1191
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:08,240
That's what they're – don't even bother going.

1192
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:14,960
They want you to sign over your children, sign over your land, your house, your goats, your cows, your car to them,

1193
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:20,580
and then you have to pay – they call it a tax, and they take it away because you didn't pay the tax.

1194
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:21,600
There's no such thing.

1195
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:26,460
In other words, taxes are for foreigners in ports and duties.

1196
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:31,840
If you live somewhere and you're paying a tax on anything, it's because somehow you transferred over anyway,

1197
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:32,880
and now you have to rent it.

1198
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:40,940
So they pretty much got laughed out of the country, this aspect of the legal thing they try to put out of Afghanistan.

1199
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:45,520
They laughed them all out, and there's someone that lives here, this part of town,

1200
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:49,700
that talked about how they just basically – all the Afghanis laughed at them.

1201
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:52,460
But I said, here they take it very seriously, and they'll sign over it.

1202
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:53,860
He says, yeah, Americans will sign anything.

1203
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:54,900
They sign over their children.

1204
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:56,020
They sign over their cars.

1205
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:57,040
They sign over everything.

1206
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:01,240
It's a pretty rough place because here's the thing.

1207
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:06,560
If you drive around, quote-unquote driving, operating an engine-driven wagon without a plate and all that,

1208
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:10,580
they're going to go into seizure, what's called letter of mark.

1209
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:13,500
It's an old thing, and they're going to pirate it.

1210
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:19,320
They're going to throw you in jail or give you fines for not having signed it over to them.

1211
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:22,700
So, yeah, welcome to – what is it?

1212
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:26,420
Was it home of the free?

1213
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:28,120
Land of the free, home of the brave.

1214
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:30,980
Yeah, or land of the slave or whatever.

1215
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:38,280
So, yeah, it's probably the worst it's ever been since about 75, 80 years ago.

1216
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:42,260
And still – but they're not making a big deal about it anymore.

1217
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:44,760
There were a lot of patriots that made a big deal about it.

1218
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:58,100
Brother Ali would say, you know, welcome to the American snakes, land of the thief, home of the slave is what he would say.

1219
01:12:58,800 --> 01:12:59,380
There you go, yeah.

1220
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:00,420
I like that one better.

1221
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:02,080
This is the war brother Ali from back in the day.

1222
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:05,970
But, brother, I don't know if you're familiar with the musician.

1223
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:07,520
Okay, cool.

1224
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:14,220
Oh, the musician, okay, because there's a Moorish from the 1920s.

1225
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:16,240
Yes, yes, that's another guy.

1226
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:19,660
I think that's where he got, you know, decided to pick the name from.

1227
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,260
He's mirroring the philosophy as well.

1228
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:23,160
Right, right.

1229
01:13:23,660 --> 01:13:25,980
You know, but most people don't know that.

1230
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:26,640
They just hear him.

1231
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:29,260
He's kind of like, you know, hip-hop, jazzy, rock kind of guy.

1232
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:30,480
I got you, contemporary.

1233
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:31,500
Contemporary, yeah.

1234
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:34,820
But the concept remains the same.

1235
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:35,660
Right.

1236
01:13:36,020 --> 01:13:40,060
And it's fascinating because you bring up this whole thing about not having the plate and not registering and all that.

1237
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:40,900
Here's the problem.

1238
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:41,720
You try it.

1239
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:44,420
It's not worth it.

1240
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:45,840
No, it's really not.

1241
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:47,580
Here's the other thing.

1242
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:51,940
I've had people communicate with me about Greek.

1243
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:52,360
What do we do?

1244
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:53,580
The system is so corrupt.

1245
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:54,560
It's so saddening.

1246
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:55,440
It's so vicious.

1247
01:13:55,780 --> 01:13:56,740
It's so whatever.

1248
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:57,480
I want to leave here.

1249
01:13:57,540 --> 01:13:58,940
I said, no, well, you can do that.

1250
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:00,480
You can live in it.

1251
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:02,360
But, you know, shield yourself from it.

1252
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:11,740
Or if you loosen your moral grip or heighten your moral grip where you have even better insulation, dive into it.

1253
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:12,560
Right.

1254
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:14,100
And you could benefit from it.

1255
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:15,860
You could become very wealthy from it.

1256
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:16,960
Right.

1257
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:18,380
But it's a personal decision.

1258
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:24,560
When I say to dive into it and use it to become wealthy from it, it's a simple analogy would be during the Depression,

1259
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:28,160
the Monopoly game board was so popular it made them very wealthy.

1260
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:29,100
Right.

1261
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:31,400
Because it was a play on the times.

1262
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:31,720
Right.

1263
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:34,500
There's constant stuff going on.

1264
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:41,000
But if that's your interest, just because things are bad, quote, unquote, morally and ethically,

1265
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,860
doesn't mean you can't prosper from them.

1266
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:46,220
But you're going to have to, you know, it depends again.

1267
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:48,620
Well, your definition of prosperity.

1268
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:50,060
Your definition of prosperity.

1269
01:14:50,540 --> 01:14:50,640
Right.

1270
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:50,880
Sure.

1271
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:57,820
Which, you know, to some people might be an accounting of how many zeros you have on your bank account.

1272
01:14:58,260 --> 01:14:58,740
Well, look.

1273
01:14:58,740 --> 01:15:01,760
They're doctors that were pecker choppers.

1274
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:04,540
They cut off your pecker, right, and hollow it out, whatever.

1275
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:07,980
They weren't too busy, let's say, 25, 30 years ago or even 10 years ago.

1276
01:15:08,060 --> 01:15:08,820
Now they're really busy.

1277
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:09,760
Oh, no.

1278
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:10,460
That's very true.

1279
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:11,220
Yeah.

1280
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:16,300
But, you know, what if, so you think he's busy because he decided to.

1281
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:17,000
Right.

1282
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:17,480
Or she.

1283
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:18,660
So.

1284
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:20,540
Or they are them.

1285
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:21,440
They know what's going on.

1286
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:22,320
Or they are them.

1287
01:15:22,860 --> 01:15:23,280
I'm sorry.

1288
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:23,960
It's a joke.

1289
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:26,220
But anyhow.

1290
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:30,540
No, I think this is a great point to end on.

1291
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,280
Is there anything else, though, that we missed?

1292
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:33,740
I mean, outside of wash your bum.

1293
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:38,960
Yeah, well, we started off with just something I usually don't do.

1294
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:39,440
Right.

1295
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:44,040
And there's just a lot more if anyone wants to read it with comprehension.

1296
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:46,520
I think that's something I haven't mentioned in a long time.

1297
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:47,240
No, very good.

1298
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:48,080
It's primary Greek speech.

1299
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:50,720
Comprehension is where it's at.

1300
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:51,600
Well, very good.

1301
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:59,240
And I see this as very solid because the analogy, most things are analogous to one another.

1302
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:00,920
There is a great deal of synchronicity.

1303
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:10,620
I think it's a very interesting order to just think about the very simplistic idea of the order in which someone washes themselves and then consider that.

1304
01:16:11,380 --> 01:16:16,940
Because, you know, one thing that is consistent is the order of things as they are in the universe.

1305
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:20,340
You know, people point out, well, there is a sequence.

1306
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:26,200
And, you know, even if you look at the segments that come into your bones, into your hands and everything, there is a consistency here.

1307
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:31,180
So I think that it's relevant on a much larger scale.

1308
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:36,940
Yeah, one thing I want to throw in there also, I've said this many times, I'm an Old Testament kind of guy.

1309
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:42,440
There's lots of stuff about washing, and it's very specific, by the way.

1310
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:46,540
What's great, the computer is a great tool for study.

1311
01:16:46,540 --> 01:16:50,820
Of course, a lot of it is mistranslated, and you're going to have to go back to an interlinear.

1312
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:58,440
And if you're serious about the subject, see if it really says what it's supposed to be saying in English or whatever corresponding language you're reading.

1313
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:02,960
But you'll see that it applies to certain things.

1314
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:05,260
I'll give a quick example before we go.

1315
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:11,620
There are things that were deemed unclean, people in certain states, things that were just unclean.

1316
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:20,000
And when a piece of pottery was touched with something unclean, it would not be ever rendered clean again.

1317
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:21,880
It had to be broken, right?

1318
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:25,020
So you basically cherished your pottery.

1319
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:27,960
You were careful who touched it and what happened, let's say, right?

1320
01:17:27,980 --> 01:17:29,040
Because you would lose it.

1321
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:33,020
It would be for unclean things, or you'd make it a piss pot, let's say, right?

1322
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:35,520
If it became unclean.

1323
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:40,980
But here's the interesting thing, that stone does not become unclean.

1324
01:17:40,980 --> 01:17:44,260
When I say stone, I mean not stoneware, but stone.

1325
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:50,380
If you actually cut a pot out of stone, I actually have a granite pot.

1326
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:51,920
It's a cooking pot.

1327
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:55,420
And you put it in the fire in the oven for half an hour.

1328
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:56,960
And it's about an inch thick.

1329
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:57,820
It's made of granite.

1330
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:04,120
And you take it out of the oven, and it holds that heat for a very long time.

1331
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:07,520
So you bring it to the table, and whatever you put in there, you cook in it.

1332
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,040
And it just keeps cooking, right?

1333
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:12,220
You've seen certain things tableside.

1334
01:18:12,340 --> 01:18:15,680
They have a thick cast iron base, and they put the food on it,

1335
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:16,980
and it's cooking while you're, right?

1336
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:17,560
Oh, yeah.

1337
01:18:17,980 --> 01:18:20,840
I've even seen, I forget what country it came from,

1338
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:25,860
but there was this circumstance in New York where they had like a slot,

1339
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:30,980
a modular slot in a table where they would bring out sort of a stone oven.

1340
01:18:31,660 --> 01:18:33,600
I can't remember what ethnic food it was.

1341
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:34,460
Sorry?

1342
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:36,020
Without any coals.

1343
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:37,060
It's just preheated.

1344
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:37,520
No, no.

1345
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:41,340
It's just a preheated piece of stone that gets placed into a, you know,

1346
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:43,120
a prearranged spot in the table.

1347
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:44,820
I'm sure you've seen this.

1348
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:46,180
I only saw it once.

1349
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:47,700
You just put strips of meat on it and things,

1350
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:49,600
and it just keeps cooking for about 20 minutes.

1351
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:49,920
Yeah.

1352
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:51,800
So I have this.

1353
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:53,960
It has a very interesting feel to it.

1354
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,960
It's a real stone material pot.

1355
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:59,140
Now, my point here is, again, for being clean.

1356
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:00,460
The pottery had to be broken.

1357
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:07,100
But stone was immune to that in what they call Old Testament or Torah law.

1358
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:11,580
So what's interesting is certain societies like the Essenes,

1359
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,640
when they held water instead of keeping them in terracotta pots

1360
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:20,280
where if they were rendered unclean, they would have to break these big pots,

1361
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:24,680
they actually took the time to make the pots out of stone,

1362
01:19:24,780 --> 01:19:26,760
which are immune from being unclean.

1363
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:31,640
So regardless of who touched the stone or what the situation was,

1364
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:36,320
the water or whatever contents were held in these stone vessels

1365
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:37,920
was always rendered clean.

1366
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:38,680
Very interesting.

1367
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:40,980
Well, it could be rendered clean.

1368
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:43,840
I mean, for instance, somehow through mishap,

1369
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:47,540
you ended up with animal blood inside of your water jar.

1370
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:50,720
If it was made of pottery, that's the end of that jar.

1371
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:54,140
You would, well, the terracotta would have to be broken

1372
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:57,140
or it would be rendered as an unclean pot, right?

1373
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:59,080
You'd still use it for other things.

1374
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:00,900
Well, like you said, a piss pot or whatever, yeah.

1375
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:04,540
Yeah, but the stone pot, you just exchange the water.

1376
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:05,940
You could clean it out.

1377
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:07,620
The vessel itself remains clean.

1378
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:11,880
So I was thinking about our talk about hygiene kind of getting into that,

1379
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:17,720
but just to recap, again, just if you study what's in Torah,

1380
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:18,340
it's very interesting.

1381
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:23,380
A body of water that has an input and an output is clean,

1382
01:20:23,380 --> 01:20:25,240
even if something unclean is in it.

1383
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:28,480
So taking a bath, that's one thing that escaped the mind.

1384
01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:33,980
If you're taking a bath and you want the water to be, let's say,

1385
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:36,260
considered spiritually clean according to Torah,

1386
01:20:36,740 --> 01:20:39,960
you would have water dripping into it from a spout

1387
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:45,880
and the stopper slightly open where some water leaks out at the same time

1388
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:51,860
and that water then is clean versus taking a bath in a basin where no water.

1389
01:20:51,860 --> 01:20:55,180
See, even if the water is coming in, it has to flow out.

1390
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:56,720
So if you're in a basin situation,

1391
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:00,740
the water would have to flow in to the point where it overflows out.

1392
01:21:00,820 --> 01:21:02,400
Then it's rendered clean again.

1393
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:05,660
But if you're just sitting in a water and nothing's coming in,

1394
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:08,300
nothing's going out of the container, it's unclean.

1395
01:21:08,540 --> 01:21:13,600
It's not cleaning, I should say, according to biblical law.

1396
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:18,720
So by the way, to make this even easier,

1397
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,820
that's why most of the laundry was done where?

1398
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:27,360
Down by the river, which was usually fed by a spring of some sort.

1399
01:21:27,620 --> 01:21:31,860
It had water coming in and water would exit through, yeah.

1400
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:34,260
And it also makes basic sense.

1401
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:38,080
So, yeah, following these things are quite interesting.

1402
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:42,300
And they do work, by the way, for therapeutic reasons,

1403
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:45,460
both psychological for the mind and the body.

1404
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:49,820
I've had several people from back in the day say,

1405
01:21:50,220 --> 01:21:55,220
in Greek, I always just took a bath and turned all the fill water off

1406
01:21:55,220 --> 01:21:56,760
and had the stopper shut.

1407
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:58,880
And since I heard you say that,

1408
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:01,860
I let the water drip in and the stopper slightly open,

1409
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:03,140
and I feel so much better.

1410
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:05,940
I was like, are you sure it's not like some kind of placebo or something?

1411
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:08,560
She goes, no, I could feel the difference because I would take baths

1412
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:12,320
for relieving aches in my hips and my legs, and it sometimes worked.

1413
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:14,120
But when I do this, every time it works.

1414
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:15,160
So I was like, okay, great.

1415
01:22:16,940 --> 01:22:17,740
Well, there you go.

1416
01:22:17,740 --> 01:22:21,840
What are your thoughts on using something like Epsom salt

1417
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,980
or whatever in those sorts of baths?

1418
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:24,720
Sure, sure.

1419
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:28,620
But that would be, again, an additive to the water.

1420
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:32,300
No, in those kinds of baths, no, it wouldn't last very long.

1421
01:22:32,860 --> 01:22:32,960
No.

1422
01:22:33,620 --> 01:22:37,820
What you would do there is after your Epsom salt bath,

1423
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:40,020
because it's the finish that counts, right?

1424
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:45,900
I would finish with when you're finished sitting in the bath with the Epsom salt.

1425
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:48,300
Because when you do an Epsom salt bath properly,

1426
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:50,940
you need about a pound of salt easily.

1427
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:56,840
It should be pretty saturated for it to work well, the magnesium.

1428
01:22:57,960 --> 01:22:58,060
Right.

1429
01:22:59,020 --> 01:22:59,300
Yeah.

1430
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:02,480
But I would finish off with some water trickling out or a shower.

1431
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:02,900
Yeah.

1432
01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:06,280
But actually sitting in a therapeutic bath like that,

1433
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,120
it wouldn't be rendered clean.

1434
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:11,380
I always shower afterwards.

1435
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:13,560
I have no explanation for why,

1436
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:16,160
but it always works better if I shower afterwards.

1437
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:17,400
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1438
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:22,060
The Epsom salts don't work on dry –

1439
01:23:22,060 --> 01:23:24,880
in other words, if you have dry Epsom salt on skin,

1440
01:23:24,980 --> 01:23:26,040
it's just going to dry your skin.

1441
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:26,940
No, yeah, yeah.

1442
01:23:27,060 --> 01:23:27,520
No, no, no.

1443
01:23:28,060 --> 01:23:31,880
I have constant back and leg pain, so that's –

1444
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:33,800
Since we're on the – oh, okay.

1445
01:23:35,420 --> 01:23:37,660
Since we're on the thing about bathing

1446
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:41,720
and how many times have I mentioned induction,

1447
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:43,840
check this out.

1448
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:47,160
Don't pee in the pool, right?

1449
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:48,140
No.

1450
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:51,160
People get into a pool, swimming pool, right,

1451
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:53,840
and they tell you don't pee in the pool, right?

1452
01:23:53,940 --> 01:23:54,220
Why?

1453
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:56,860
You get into a body of water,

1454
01:23:57,180 --> 01:24:01,240
and via induction, water is created in the body

1455
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:04,860
to replace the water that's already there,

1456
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:06,020
and it goes to the bladder.

1457
01:24:06,020 --> 01:24:09,200
It's created again in the bladder, goes out.

1458
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:10,700
Same thing if you're sitting in a bath.

1459
01:24:10,780 --> 01:24:13,720
Sort of explains why you have the instant feeling

1460
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:17,500
like you might want to pee as soon as you go into a bath or a pool.

1461
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:18,240
That's why.

1462
01:24:18,620 --> 01:24:18,820
Exactly.

1463
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:19,520
It's induction.

1464
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:22,540
That's a perfect example for induction.

1465
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:23,840
Even people who are –

1466
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:26,100
if you're dehydrated and you're in a bath,

1467
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:27,720
you will feel like you will have to pee.

1468
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:29,620
It will not necessarily hydrate you

1469
01:24:30,540 --> 01:24:33,120
because there's a very fine balance on blood hydration.

1470
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:34,760
It has to go through the mouth,

1471
01:24:36,260 --> 01:24:39,800
touch the roof of the mouth, the throat, and all that,

1472
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:43,280
and then, of course, for it to be produced in the blood.

1473
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:46,480
That's why people are severely dehydrated or unconscious.

1474
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:50,460
They put them on an IV to get it into the blood,

1475
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:51,760
but that only works for so long.

1476
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:55,400
So I just wanted to bring up that point of peeing in the bath

1477
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:56,300
or peeing in the pool.

1478
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:58,180
It's induction that induces that.

1479
01:24:58,280 --> 01:24:59,100
It's not –

1480
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:00,820
I remember a medical person once said,

1481
01:25:00,820 --> 01:25:03,400
Greek, what about the physical pressure on the bladder?

1482
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:05,460
I looked at them, and I'm like, what about induction?

1483
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:06,380
He says, yeah, you're right.

1484
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:07,740
I'm like, don't tell me I'm right.

1485
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:08,860
Do you know this?

1486
01:25:09,460 --> 01:25:11,260
That's one of the things that I –

1487
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:13,120
when people say you're right,

1488
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:15,740
it doesn't really help the overall situation.

1489
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:16,760
No, it doesn't.

1490
01:25:17,140 --> 01:25:19,380
But peeing in the shower, not so bad

1491
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:21,480
because it goes right down the drain.

1492
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:23,140
You will have induction there as well,

1493
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:25,820
but not as much when you're submerged

1494
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:28,080
because of the soft areas.

1495
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:30,000
From the outside of the body,

1496
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,200
most induction happens in the very soft areas,

1497
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:34,420
which would be between the toes, between the fingers,

1498
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:37,060
the armpits, the bend in the arm,

1499
01:25:37,180 --> 01:25:39,500
like the opposite part of your elbow or the wrist.

1500
01:25:39,820 --> 01:25:41,800
No, the parts that are less exposed

1501
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:45,060
to things on the outside rubbing against them.

1502
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:45,840
Sure, of course.

1503
01:25:45,980 --> 01:25:47,300
Typically, typically, yeah.

1504
01:25:47,860 --> 01:25:49,340
That's where you have the most –

1505
01:25:49,340 --> 01:25:52,240
yeah, interesting stuff.

1506
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:54,400
So I think that'll be it for 17.
