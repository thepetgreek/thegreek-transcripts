1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:14,540
Ocelli and the Greeks, Sonic Event 18, and we are going to begin in yet again another

2
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:20,080
unusual place, and we always do because this is an unusual thing, which is why you subscribe.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,040
Anyway, just before I pressed record, we were talking about restaurants and places to eat,

4
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,140
and, Greg, it sounds like that's the same thing.

5
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:32,420
Oh my goodness.

6
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:39,420
No, no, you eat at a regular, you just eat out or you eat, but a real restaurant is where

7
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:39,980
you dine.

8
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:41,980
There's a difference.

9
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:42,260
Dining?

10
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:46,680
So when someone says, I just went out to eat, okay, I don't really ask, was it good?

11
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,980
Because I know it's all right.

12
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,840
You know, you were hungry, now you're not.

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:50,320
Right.

14
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:58,400
But when you say we dined at so-and-so, oh, what did you have, how did they prepare it,

15
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,620
what was their special, who was cooking tonight, who was the chef tonight?

16
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:03,840
Big difference.

17
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,360
You know how I used to say most American children are raised, they never had real milk, they

18
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,500
never had real cheese, they never had real bread, you know, like that comes out of plastic

19
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:13,980
and all that.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
They never really had that.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,100
All the way, I think, I still met people in their 50s and 60s that still have not had

22
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,760
real food.

23
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,420
I know it sounds kind of crazy, right?

24
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:26,400
No, it's not.

25
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,640
But this is something that, yeah.

26
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:33,340
Yeah, not too crazy, because look, it's rare to me to meet somebody who's actually had

27
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:39,140
real, I mean, the big difference between, I mean, anything, milk is one of those primary

28
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:39,580
examples.

29
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,400
They don't know what to do when they actually have real milk because they're used to that

30
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,360
stuff that's in the plastic bottle and has been cooked and God knows what else was actually

31
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:48,760
in it.

32
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:54,700
That was planned, by the way, because people, you see, a quick way to survive is to get

33
00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:00,080
milk from an animal to stay alive and to thrive off-season, let's say, or stay alive.

34
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:06,360
They decided that they're going to put Americans through a hard time in the 1800s and the 1930s

35
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,700
and again, and they said, well, we've got to screw up their food supply before we, right?

36
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,920
Because if we give the Americans a hard time, they're just going to flip us the bird and

37
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,920
say, we have cows, right?

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,780
But if we screw up their cows, when it's bad, they're going to go to their cows and they're

39
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,560
not going to get much.

40
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:29,860
This was proven in Korea when, after the Korean War, they introduced processed milk and the

41
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,220
average height and the average weight went up 20, 30, 40% because the average Korean

42
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,080
was about five foot zero, right?

43
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,520
Now the average Korean's five foot seven, five foot eight.

44
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,060
So tall, they're big, because they got experimented on with processed food.

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,900
The expensive nature of it, and most countries, by the way, when they buy milk, by the way,

46
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:55,460
by the way, in South America, you might buy it liquid in a container, but it originated

47
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,720
as powder somewhere.

48
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,460
So the dairy gets deliveries of powder milk and they add water to it and then they fill

49
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:05,680
jugs and they bring it to you, especially places like Mexico and whatever.

50
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,040
Now someone might say, well, I live in Bolivia or I live in Mexico, I live in, we get it

51
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,420
from a cow.

52
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,360
I'm not talking about that.

53
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,960
I'm talking about the supermercado.

54
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,320
Cuando compras leche en la tienda, okay, es de polvo y agua.

55
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,300
So when you buy it in the store, it's powdered in water.

56
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,460
Now here's the thing.

57
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,960
This has come up several times.

58
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:32,340
Like tonight, I had a beautiful salad and a roast chicken on mesquite wood and the chicken

59
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,820
was salted in water for about half a day, then rinsed and then hung to dry.

60
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,700
And this has happened about four times last year when I mentioned to people, if you're

61
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,640
going to have a steak or a roast or a turkey or a chicken, hang it to dry for a few hours,

62
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,220
half a day.

63
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,100
A day is even better.

64
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,020
In the fridge, out of the fridge, doesn't matter if it's, you should brine it.

65
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,520
And the response that I always get back is, no, Greek, because I want the meat to be juicy.

66
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,140
And I go, oh, slap my forehead, not at all.

67
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,400
What's wrong with these people?

68
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:03,840
Right?

69
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,120
There's nothing wrong with them.

70
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,680
It's interesting because I've actually seen people like they take basically a bottle of

71
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,060
Italian dressing.

72
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:14,920
Oh, no.

73
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,620
I don't want to hear that.

74
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:15,820
Please.

75
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,040
I'm still digesting.

76
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:17,519
Okay.

77
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:18,320
Yeah.

78
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:18,660
Okay.

79
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,800
So, okay.

80
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,120
This is why you dry the meat.

81
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:21,660
Okay.

82
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:28,460
There's something called, there's a scientific term for it, but if you have water, the temperature

83
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:32,660
can only, at present, the temperature can only go to the boiling point of water.

84
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,300
And once all the water is burned off, then the temperature can rise.

85
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,340
You could do this with a pan.

86
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,260
Got one of those laser thermometers.

87
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,600
Get a big-ass cast iron pan and start warming it up.

88
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,780
Put some water in there.

89
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:49,680
And not until the last drop of water is evaporated will it go above 212 degrees Fahrenheit or

90
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,660
100 degrees Celsius.

91
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,740
It's amazing how that works, right?

92
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:59,140
So when you're doing an animal in the fire or in the oven or whatever, even frying, that's

93
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:03,500
why frying is so delicious because it's rapid, you want to rapidly crisp the outside.

94
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:11,260
And usually that takes between 400 to 475 degrees, mind you, very rapidly.

95
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,540
And then lower the temperature so it cooks the inside up to whatever, 120, 130, 140,

96
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,140
whatever, how you like it.

97
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:18,940
Okay.

98
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:25,560
So now, if the meat is full of moisture and you put it on the fire and you want to get

99
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:32,120
a sear on it, well, it ain't going to get above 220 or 210 until all the moisture is

100
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,580
gone, right?

101
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,560
So now you're boiling and steaming the meat, you're thinking you're getting a sear.

102
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,520
Now a lot of people think, yeah, well, I put it right on the hot cast iron that's dry or

103
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:40,820
the grill.

104
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,800
Yeah, but this is different.

105
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,980
It's not the same to get it evenly on the entire surface.

106
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:52,760
So when you, actually there's some, I've caught in through my history of looking at the stuff

107
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:57,620
that they show people to learn how to cook, oh, just pat it with a paper towel first,

108
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:57,940
you know?

109
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,220
No, dry it out.

110
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,640
Dry it so it's dry to the touch.

111
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,380
In other words, if you hold it in your hand and give it a gentle squeeze, it should not

112
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,800
release, it should not feel moist, it should feel just as dry as your hands were if they

113
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,200
were dry.

114
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:09,720
Right.

115
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,920
You're not going to end up with a bunch of liquid on your fingers if you do that.

116
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,200
Yeah.

117
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:13,680
Yeah.

118
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,200
Right.

119
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:21,540
And now when there's no moisture that's above the humidity level of the room on whatever

120
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:27,900
you're cooking, once it goes into a 400 degree, above 350 hopefully, you always want to start

121
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,220
at very high and then lower it down, right?

122
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,500
That's how you get that beautiful sear, that color, that crispiness, that seals it.

123
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,280
You know, people cook a steak and all the, I said, you know, what are you doing?

124
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:37,680
What are you doing?

125
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,480
What do you mean what I'm doing?

126
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,200
I said, all the juices are going into the fire.

127
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,400
He said, that's all your flavor.

128
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,040
The steak is crying, it's leaking like crazy.

129
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,260
That's all your flavor.

130
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:51,780
I said, when I do steaks or anything on a grill, there's not one drop, not one drop.

131
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,140
There might be some fat that might melt, but never drop.

132
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,220
You see?

133
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,960
Same with a chicken or whatever.

134
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,180
Right.

135
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,520
So I see people cooking, I said, what are you doing?

136
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,080
Look, it's dripping.

137
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,200
He says, yeah, I'd always like that.

138
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,040
I said, it means you always dump the flavor out.

139
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,740
Ah, I see.

140
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:03,420
Okay.

141
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,280
You see?

142
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,660
Because the reason why is because it was wet to start with.

143
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:07,260
Right.

144
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:07,500
Right.

145
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,400
So we'd get into that.

146
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,500
So, yeah, these things are not discussed.

147
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,580
I think I've sent you pictures also of baked goods, pizzas, right?

148
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,680
I think because you appreciate a good pizza probably where you are, you probably can't

149
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,220
get one, right?

150
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:19,480
Right.

151
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,040
Exactly.

152
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:20,880
Yeah.

153
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:29,680
Well, I've got some people here, some fellow has sent me pictures of wonderful pizzas from

154
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,460
a food, I think I might have done on a Skype a while back, and you thanked me for it and

155
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:35,760
all that.

156
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,580
But there's more tips I want to give on that.

157
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:45,140
I'll go against any pizza dough method or pizza, whatever, like if I gave it to, you

158
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:49,800
know, the best pizza in the world, the most snobby pizza people in the world are the Napoletan

159
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,700
in Naples.

160
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,460
It's very precise.

161
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,960
If you don't do it that way, forget it.

162
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,160
If one of those chefs had my pizzas, he says, it's not Napoletan, but it's excellent.

163
00:07:59,640 --> 00:07:59,840
Right?

164
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,340
How do I know?

165
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:00,860
Okay.

166
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,920
And it's a very simple way to make the dough.

167
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:10,320
And here's the thing, when you do the classical baking school methods, you have to use a certain

168
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,920
flour, you got to use a certain water, you got to, all right, no.

169
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:19,760
With this method, you could use any flour, literally, even like just junk, all purpose

170
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,640
flour from Walmart, it'll still come out wonderful.

171
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:28,880
But you got to follow a few easy steps, it's a no-knead method, there's no kneading at all,

172
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,440
you don't have to do work, anyone can do it, really.

173
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:38,539
If you can walk, and if you have light in the room, and you got loose, most of the fingers

174
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:40,460
on your hand in one eye, you can do it.

175
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,659
I mean, it's so simple.

176
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,280
It helps to have good water, though.

177
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,600
Well, yeah.

178
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,560
The water should be clear, it shouldn't, this is what I tell people, this is how you know

179
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:56,440
if your water, you pour a bowl of water out of the tap, put it on the table, wait 10 minutes.

180
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,980
You can cover it with a plate or something, or a lid of some sort.

181
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,460
Wait 10 minutes, and when you remove the plate, sniff it.

182
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,320
Whatever you sniff at that point is in the water.

183
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,740
If it smells like sewer gas, guess what?

184
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,200
You got sulfur in your drink.

185
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,900
If it smells like chlorine or bromine, guess what you got on your water, right?

186
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:20,120
Now, I'm a little sensitive to it, and what makes, I ask people, what makes a really good

187
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,480
chef?

188
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,500
And they think, oh, usually the most common thing is the ingredients.

189
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,240
I'm like, what do you mean?

190
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,820
What do you mean the ingredients?

191
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,380
If I give them to your wife or my wife, the ingredients are going to be wasted, going to

192
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,960
be ruined, right?

193
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,500
It's not the ingredients, no.

194
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:38,760
You have to have a very good sense of smell and a very good sense of taste.

195
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:44,440
The better your sense of smell and your sense of taste, the better you'll be at cooking.

196
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,200
So I have an old adage where, you know, when someone is a little, you know, fried, you

197
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,480
know, is not too strong of a person, let's say, say we're going to leave you behind with

198
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,120
the women and children, and you're going to cook.

199
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,900
I regret saying that because I didn't ask him if he had a good sense of smell and taste.

200
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,620
But anyway, bad joke.

201
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:12,200
So, yeah, it's so if if you can smell like a dog, if you can smell through concrete, you'll

202
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,300
be a really good chef. And that's what really discerns the really good chefs is their sense

203
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,980
of taste and their sense of smell.

204
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,780
So I just want to bring up those points in case anyone wants to roast anything, any animal.

205
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,880
By the way, I've talked about calories often, right?

206
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,780
By the way, we're not going to focus on food and all that, but I brought this up, you know,

207
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,120
the calorie thing for anybody that's new here.

208
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:41,660
Real short, unless you're pooping, charcoal calories are irrelevant for food value, right?

209
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:47,740
Because calorie in order for the caloric measurement to hold as a as a whole measurement or

210
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,340
an applicable one, the contents are carbonized.

211
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,980
So the contents you pass are not carbon irrelevant.

212
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,680
The other thing is protein and carbohydrates.

213
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,380
What they're there's no such thing as a protein, by the way, it's just the name.

214
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:04,840
You could look it up in all their clinical whatever.

215
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,160
They're not testing. No one's ever found or tested for a protein.

216
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,940
That's what I don't like. Carbs are like protein.

217
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:14,220
That's all urban myth, urban legend stuff, right?

218
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,960
What they're telling you when they say they have a protein, it's an amino acid.

219
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,320
That's all. And an amino acid is a trace aspect of it.

220
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,120
Everything's got amino acids in it.

221
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,620
Carbohydrates. OK, I got a hamburger bun.

222
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,160
That's carbohydrate pasta, right?

223
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,740
Carbos, carbs, carbo loading.

224
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,120
Right. OK, but carbohydrate is also gasoline.

225
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,780
Oh, no, that's hydrocarbons, Greek.

226
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,900
OK, so there's no they don't know what they're talking about.

227
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:47,780
You'll find amino acids and carbohydrates both in in plants and in animals.

228
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:52,920
Almost sometimes, for example, I think it's you don't want to do.

229
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,500
Here's a shocker. You're ready.

230
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:01,780
OK, whenever you eat or drink, especially drink, it has to be activated through the liver.

231
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:07,660
So if you in other words, the liver gets activated based on what you eat, what you drink and how much

232
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:12,580
your liver can only handle three to five ounces of input at a time.

233
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,260
Hmm. That sounds crazy, right?

234
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,160
Because that's a quarter pounder, right?

235
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,260
Sixteen ounces, quarter pounders, four ounces.

236
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,240
Right. Yeah.

237
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:26,460
I was thinking three ounces is only what a quarter of a can of soda.

238
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,340
It's small. Yeah, yes.

239
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,820
Well, well, look, that's all your liver can handle at a time.

240
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:37,100
And when you start putting more than that every 10 or 15 and a half, 30 minutes, by the way.

241
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:43,640
When you write, when you put more than that, the body gets complicated, very complicated.

242
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,980
That's why you look at European dinners.

243
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,600
They last hours.

244
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,400
They sit there, small dishes, small plates, you know.

245
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,940
Right. So this is the old so they leave a little food on their plate.

246
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,400
You know, it doesn't mean they're going to throw it away.

247
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,620
Yeah, so it's very interesting how all these things work.

248
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,400
Somehow we'll have to get into that because this is crucial in the way people function.

249
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:14,560
When you drink water, three to five ounces at a time, doesn't matter how thirsty you are.

250
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,120
Right. Unless you're desperate for, you know, drinking a whole thing or whatever.

251
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,940
So, I mean, this is very, it sounds very unusual, but this is how the body works.

252
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:30,040
Give me an example. When you look at military canteens or how people, when they traveled, how they brought what food and drink.

253
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,660
They had a they had a wine skin, right, or skin or a canteen of some kind.

254
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:40,080
Sometimes it was a pot, metal or terracotta, or it was an animal skin.

255
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,820
Now they have canteens of every type.

256
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,000
Right. That's all you need. Why?

257
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,840
Because you're not going to sit, you know, the canteen holds 40 ounces, a big one, let's say.

258
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,440
Right. You know, that's enough for the whole day.

259
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,900
Just sip on it. Right. Right.

260
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:57,880
You see. So this, this, this, this massive consumption of liquids, foods and all this.

261
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,980
Yeah, it's it's tearing people apart.

262
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,240
I'm not talking about fasting.

263
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,700
We're just talking about, you know, you should eat when you're hungry and drink when you're thirsty.

264
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,520
Yeah. Think about it.

265
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,580
That's what I wanted to bring up tonight.

266
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,980
Oh, also from the chat.

267
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,600
Yes. Let's talk about sainthood and all that stuff.

268
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,360
Yeah. Francis of Assisi came up in the chat.

269
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,360
Yeah. Same category as Mother Teresa, Dalai Lama.

270
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,280
I think they're going to canonize Mother Teresa.

271
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,080
Right. The criminals at the Vatican.

272
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,720
Yeah. I think I read that.

273
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,260
Yeah. Yeah. Who's the other one?

274
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,860
Gandhi. OK.

275
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,880
In the 80s. This is information I've had in the 80s and 90s.

276
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,420
This is 30 plus years ago.

277
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,340
OK. Should I go down the list real quick?

278
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,100
Well, you start with Gandhi, though, because Gandhi is one of those guys.

279
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,180
I have read some stuff on him.

280
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,440
And, you know, it's it varies because it's very interesting.

281
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,300
Some of the things he did, the statements he made.

282
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,800
And then you get into some of the stuff about his personal life and his business

283
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,900
life, which was supplying young boys to the English, the what are they called?

284
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,380
The cafe?

285
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:13,540
The people that ran from England, let's say, that were in charge of the colonial

286
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,200
but I think it was which city it was.

287
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,140
I don't want to get in trouble by mentioning stuff that's wrong.

288
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,440
But I'm paraphrasing here.

289
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:27,320
For most of his life, most of his life, he was an interceder to supply

290
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:33,560
the proclivities of the British men for young Indian boys.

291
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,180
OK, that's what he did.

292
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,820
And when they go missing, of course, they would not be returned.

293
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,100
He would have to come up with excuses and payments to the families and things.

294
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:45,000
Right. Not not not part of the A&E biography.

295
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,580
But yeah. No, you don't get that.

296
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,440
Total scumbag. Right.

297
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:54,400
The other one, Mother Teresa, I'm not going to give the figure was in the 150

298
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,000
million, 50 million. Somebody needed that in the Vatican.

299
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,460
She goes, I'll raise it by selling children.

300
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,880
She got more than that.

301
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,060
And she was a horrible, horrible individual.

302
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,020
Right. Dalai Lama.

303
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,440
By the way, that that accent, he doesn't have an accent.

304
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,840
He sounds like an American.

305
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,520
He just plays that accent because people think it's more spiritual.

306
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,780
Right. Another scumbag.

307
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,840
CIA acid.

308
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,620
OK, so if you go back to all of the saints, it's exactly the same.

309
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:31,560
These are the Vatican and these religious authorities are not going to put good

310
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,640
people in front of you ever, never, ever, ever.

311
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,220
That's why they change the identity of the biblical Christ.

312
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,440
Show you show you a guy nailed to a cross wearing a diaper.

313
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,680
Right. Right. Or

314
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,780
Mother Mary and baby J.S.

315
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,480
U.S. in the May.

316
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:53,300
You're right. And the three wise men that never happened either like that.

317
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,580
The there was two or more Madre that came from the East.

318
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,700
These were bad motherfuckers.

319
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,400
And he was the Christ was two years old in his father's workshop.

320
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,660
I mean, that's really easy.

321
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,680
I could you could look that up right now while we're while we're while I'm

322
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,599
speaking, you could have looked it up and read the verse.

323
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,060
But we don't do that here. Right.

324
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,660
Right. So or anyways, nobody should be doing that.

325
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,300
Right. Well, the and an interesting thing that was brought up there is this

326
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:26,660
other you know, I love how one report of one thing is supposed to back up the

327
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,520
report of another.

328
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:33,440
All right. There were stigmata, stigmata, stigmata, because it's not stigmata.

329
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:34,900
It's stigmata.

330
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,340
Totally different. I know.

331
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,400
Potato and potato.

332
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,800
Right. There are the same tomato and tomato.

333
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,860
Stigmata and stigmata are not the same.

334
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,760
Stigmata means like a scar.

335
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,960
OK. Right. But stigmata is this Catholic thing.

336
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,400
Well, that's where the hands are supposed to bleed.

337
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,220
And you're supposed to bleed in the positions where allegedly supposed to be

338
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,080
nice. Yeah.

339
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,020
But well, what what a scar versus.

340
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,740
OK, so that's what that means.

341
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,740
The scar. OK.

342
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,300
But stigmata means something else.

343
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,080
OK. Like gay.

344
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,640
You know, if you're gay, you're happy, period.

345
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,160
Could be now. Happier man sleeping with a man.

346
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,900
Yeah. It's that it's that much.

347
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,080
It's that much of a difference, actually.

348
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,300
And in the same category.

349
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,540
It's bizarre. Yeah.

350
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,360
Well, look, it is bizarre.

351
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:33,280
That's that's a little tough to swallow, because I mean, it's it's like, oh, we

352
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,240
just talked about being gay. Now you're going to swallow.

353
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:39,280
Hey, you know, when in Rome.

354
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,120
So, of course, of course, I got a real lascivious joke for that.

355
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,900
Maybe it's even too lascivious for this.

356
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,600
But anyway, we're all adults here.

357
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,680
No, I don't want to say it. All right.

358
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,220
Fair enough. But anyway, you got you got to break the tension once in a while.

359
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,920
I mean, you will.

360
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,360
The thing is that our first date.

361
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,100
No, it's not. Not for you and me, but for somebody listening.

362
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,840
You know, there's a third party present here.

363
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,640
And I guarantee you some of them.

364
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,060
This is tense because, you know, you just turned a whole bunch of stuff on their

365
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,620
head. Mother Teresa's scumbag.

366
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,860
I know I was raised on it.

367
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,480
Not really. You take it or leave it.

368
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,980
The the I was raised in a Greek Orthodox Greek.

369
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,420
And I have relatives in Greece.

370
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,120
And I talked to him and I'm like, oh, my gosh.

371
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,160
Just in Greeks, it's a story.

372
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,020
And I see go. Yeah.

373
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,980
Yeah. If you ski, I thought, right.

374
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:31,140
It means if you're Greek, your family and your religion are the most important things

375
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,280
to you. Right. And I'm like, oh, my gosh, I got to go.

376
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,700
I got to go rearrange my sock drawer.

377
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,040
Please leave me alone.

378
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,440
Why are you calling me?

379
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,520
You know, is there anything wrong with them?

380
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,020
No, there's nothing wrong with them.

381
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,280
It's just not for me.

382
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:50,960
So, well, I figured if you're going to go for what they give you, oh, my gosh.

383
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,880
Oh, my gosh. You're you're not.

384
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,900
No, it's not happening.

385
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,340
But here's the perfect part.

386
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,100
So Thanksgiving is not your thing.

387
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,680
Your family, I guess.

388
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:04,120
You know that that day was pretty close to Abraham Lincoln, they say.

389
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,280
And then Roosevelt brought it back.

390
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:11,860
And but I know around that time it was popular to hang thieves and things like that.

391
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,980
So that were that misgivings and things.

392
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,800
No, it's all fake. Of course.

393
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,500
But but what they put out.

394
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,520
But here's the beauty of it.

395
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:25,680
They tell you within the context and within the story, if it's mainstream media, it's

396
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,860
very accurate because all you got to do is reverse it.

397
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,180
Right. And that's that's how accurate they are.

398
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:36,020
And when I say 180 degrees, it's like might be 179 or 181, but close enough.

399
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,700
You're out of phase. Right.

400
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,800
So anyway, like, you know, when they say there's terrorism, it's really an exercise

401
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,180
and they tell it. Right. But when they say they had an exercise that they didn't

402
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,740
announce, it's real. It's real terror.

403
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,640
Do you remember the helicopters that were flying?

404
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,720
I shouldn't talk about this.

405
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:56,480
I'll just bring up the point. I won't tell you what happened because I was asked not to

406
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:02,100
say. I think it was the Obama days in L.A.

407
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,240
people were freaking out because there were low flying helicopters in downtown L.A.

408
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,260
between the office towers and lots of military helicopters.

409
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,760
Remember that? They said it was an exercise.

410
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,140
Yeah. Black Hawk helicopters.

411
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,880
Don't worry about it. Do you remember that?

412
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,900
Yeah. And there was there was even some gunfire.

413
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,340
That was not an exercise.

414
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,820
That was not an exercise.

415
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,160
Right. That was something that they were able to handle.

416
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,440
And that's all I'm going to say.

417
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,400
And it was international.

418
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,500
Oh, yeah. Well, that's all I'm going to say about it.

419
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,640
I'll give you a fun thing, too.

420
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,140
Just, you know, current events.

421
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,720
You know, Tucker Carlson and Don Lemon both got let go by their networks today.

422
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,600
They were both fired. That's the headline.

423
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:40,400
Yeah. And the funny thing is, I'm telling you now, that's because they have a new job

424
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,160
and they've been given new jobs.

425
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,140
It's not really that they were fired.

426
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,420
They had more jobs in the equation.

427
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,360
So, you know, but I'll get it.

428
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,220
Dog bites man is not worth news, worth printing.

429
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,280
But man bites dog is right.

430
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,680
Exactly. Yeah. Saying that they're fired is worth making a story.

431
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:04,040
Saying you got another job is why waste the time or the pixels in this case?

432
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,200
The pixels. Right. They'll have a new job by next year.

433
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,620
Right. And believe me, it'll be according to the season.

434
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,160
They'll have jobs. You watch.

435
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,040
Each of them will have brand new jobs according to the season.

436
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:18,320
It'll make sense. And their new positions as talking heads.

437
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,780
Will be established. I mean, there's an order to everything.

438
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,960
I agree. Oh, there is. And by the way, just go back.

439
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,360
When I say when they say it's terrorism, it's an exercise.

440
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,140
And when it's an exercise, it's really terrorism.

441
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,560
You know, when I say it's when it's terrorism, it's really an exercise.

442
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:36,960
People nod. Yes. But when I say when they have an exercise, it's really terrorism.

443
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,760
Right. They shake their eyes open.

444
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:44,200
I'm like, what do you mean, Greek? Yeah, because you're never going to get all these

445
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,900
exercise unannounced because it's a it's a it's an action.

446
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:52,580
To put something down because it makes them look bad if something happened that wasn't part of their plan.

447
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,760
And they're very good at stopping them.

448
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,480
And it shows me that how how many people are.

449
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,520
I shouldn't say I have access.

450
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,140
I do. And I'm privileged.

451
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,820
I get a lot of privileged information.

452
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,500
And very often when someone tells me, if I tell you this, you can't share it.

453
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,000
All right. And I'm like, yeah, that's why I can't.

454
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,520
I have to keep my right.

455
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:18,140
The only time I did share something like that was when Trevor, we were talking about

456
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,900
hurricane abatement. He sent me a package of all of his notes.

457
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,380
And he says, I don't want this going out.

458
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,000
I don't want this design going out.

459
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,660
I said ever. He says, well, as long as I'm alive.

460
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,280
And I said, oh, so while you're alive, you don't want it.

461
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,400
But when you're alive, it's OK.

462
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,160
He says, yeah, when I'm when I'm no longer alive, I'll be on my next journey.

463
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,820
Do what you want. Well, he passed away in 2016.

464
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,100
So anybody wants to know about Trevor, James Constable and what I do for hurricane

465
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,320
abatement, have at it.

466
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,540
I've already put a lot of the stuff out there.

467
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,000
People are building devices.

468
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,600
These I can say what it is.

469
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,420
It's a double mirror with silk.

470
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:57,160
It's using silk. And it's a I haven't gotten into a lot of people who have the room to

471
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,920
use the big guns, the big water guns to go, you know, the other side of the planet.

472
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:04,040
There's methods to do, you know, for timing and all that.

473
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,980
So that, you know, I'll share that.

474
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:12,940
But just to harken back to what I was saying about terrorism and exercise and exercises

475
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,440
are real terrorism. Yes.

476
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:21,240
If if the exercises that you see, you've seen this many times in this city

477
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,500
or whatever, how low flying helicopters and troops on the ground.

478
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,320
And we called the Pentagon.

479
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,600
We call it no response.

480
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,200
But at the end of the day, they said they were doing and conducting an exercise.

481
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,940
And that's it. Right.

482
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,660
Yep. Nope.

483
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,960
That was they were fortunate.

484
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,400
Let's say so far they've been fortunate where nothing got picked up.

485
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,540
A few things did get picked up.

486
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:44,080
I don't need to get into which ones they use your imagination.

487
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,200
Maybe we'll do a talk. I have to make a list.

488
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,820
It was a recent one a few years ago.

489
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,960
I had to deal with an RV exploding in Nashville.

490
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:56,180
Right. That was one that that they missed and they covered up very sloppily.

491
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,420
But the yeah, this.

492
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,520
OK. That was international also.

493
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,840
It wasn't alone, whatever.

494
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,120
Oh, anyway, think about it.

495
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,540
I wasn't aware of that part of it.

496
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,760
But OK. Oh, yeah.

497
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,480
Yeah. Yeah.

498
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,560
They they always throw the wacko element in there to distract you.

499
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,560
Like this guy believed the reptilians run the world and all that, which they do.

500
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,720
But they made that the emphasis. Right.

501
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,700
Yeah, I know. It's just like they're panning Bobby Kennedy, Jr.

502
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,340
now because, you know, he's a conspiracy theorist when he really wasn't.

503
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,540
And he actually hasn't embraced conspiracy at all.

504
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:32,260
But he's been willing to call out the drug manufacturers.

505
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,640
So they dip him in that.

506
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,780
Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's today I was listening to something.

507
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,160
Sky Gills or something saying that, oh, the IRS is a money laundering operation.

508
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,080
I'm like, I've been saying that for like 30 years, man.

509
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,560
Where have you been now? I got some new information.

510
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,400
I'm like, what do you think?

511
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:53,100
That's why all of the gas stations in big cities are owned by ex-military and ex-cops.

512
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,620
Because you can roll because if you're ex-military,

513
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:01,500
you know, officer or an ex-cop, you know, more than just doing a beat.

514
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,400
You have a lot, you know, a lot of people that have tons of cash.

515
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,960
They have to move from all, you know, the ones, the public thinks you

516
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,420
you're supposed to be busting them, but you're actually protecting them.

517
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,160
If people don't know what's going on, it's the opposite.

518
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,980
So if you know, you know, a gas station pulls in one, two, three million a month,

519
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,880
they might clear 50 grand.

520
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,860
Right. So if you have a bank account, let's say, and you have 10, 20, 30 thousand

521
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:30,180
and you run a quarter of a million dollars through there, that's going to flag you.

522
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,840
But if you have a gas station that's running two, three million dollars a month,

523
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,020
you're making shit profit, nothing really.

524
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,440
Maybe if you make five, ten thousand dollars a month, you're fortunate out of two

525
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,740
million. Right. Oh, yeah. I mean, if you're making like nine cents on the gallon, I

526
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:47,220
mean, it's not, you know, it's a great example.

527
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,700
Huge volume. You have a huge gross coming in.

528
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,660
Yeah. So the bank is used to seeing your balance one, two million, three million, one

529
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:58,120
of that. So if someone runs a half a million in cash through there, it doesn't flag

530
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,100
anything because you last month you're one and a half million.

531
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,900
Now you're two million. You're already at three million.

532
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,040
You see what I mean? Oh, it's pretty simple, though.

533
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:08,700
If you look at laundering, these money laundering operations are these high, high

534
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,580
volume, high gross, but very low net businesses.

535
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,660
Right. And that's what I'm saying about the gas station is you got, you know, say

536
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:18,280
30,000 gallons of gasoline easily through a medium sized city.

537
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,040
You could run through that. Yeah, exactly.

538
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:26,060
So if you do that in a day and you make six cents on the gallon, your profit is low.

539
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,880
But you need 30,000 times, let's say, three bucks.

540
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,160
It's one hundred thousand a day.

541
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,640
Right. So you're pulling in three million a month.

542
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,840
Right. You're probably going to net for yourself if you're the owner, let's say

543
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,720
five thousand or maybe ten thousand.

544
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:44,240
If you're lucky for out of three million, which is shit, you know, return.

545
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:49,380
Right. You don't care because you're ex-cop and ex-military and you got friends that

546
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,760
run. They have tons of cash that need to net.

547
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,600
They need to run it through other accounts and they can't show up to the bank with a

548
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,620
bag full of cash.

549
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:01,720
So they run it through you and you get a percentage of that.

550
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,940
It works between two or five percent, the smaller the amount, the higher the

551
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:10,740
percentage. And but then again, if it gets too big, they they bump the up the

552
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,840
percentage again because the risk now is higher.

553
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,740
Well, the risk is much higher because if you had a million dollars to that equation

554
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,620
we just gave you, that's not not even noticeable.

555
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,800
I mean, that's nothing. Yeah, they could run it.

556
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,860
But if you say, Chuck, someone wants to run a million through your account, forget

557
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,740
it. You know, you'll have the FBI at your door.

558
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,440
Exactly. So these are all money you could.

559
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,620
What I'm saying is easily validated and verified.

560
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,520
All the big gas stations are ex-military and ex-cops.

561
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,740
Not all of them, but ninety nine point nine percent because they are they know the

562
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:42,620
circles. They know all that, you know, you know, like the big the biggest the

563
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,480
biggest. What was it?

564
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,580
Hash dealer in New York, you know, he knew he was going to get busted and the cops

565
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,420
come in his door at 1 a.m.

566
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,640
This is back in the 80s and the 90s or late 80s.

567
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,400
And he says, come on, we're going to see the judge.

568
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,420
And he figures at 1 a.m.

569
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,640
So they take him to the judge's house.

570
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,420
The judge makes tea and he says, listen, I know who you're using for transport.

571
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,020
I want you to use my friend Omar.

572
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:10,800
So this is people are so this goes back to the saints and the church and it's the

573
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:15,780
same thing. They the most wicked, most disgusting things are happening.

574
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:21,520
This is in scripture, by the way, what people what the general society considers

575
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:27,580
to be whatever is really the lowest of the low, you know.

576
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:33,320
So anyway, like years ago, I remember this woman, she was having problems.

577
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:38,600
She was a schoolteacher, administrator, husband, their whole family, like her mom,

578
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:42,240
her dad, her husband, her whole family worked in the school administration board.

579
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,400
And she had a problem child in and he wasn't academically fit.

580
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,180
You know, he was into not even sports.

581
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,320
He was just a troublemaker.

582
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,320
I said, yeah, if he's like that, he'll probably be president one day because they

583
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,360
pick degenerates. And and she looked at me and she didn't.

584
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,800
She says, you think he could be president?

585
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,160
She missed the whole part that I called her son a degenerate.

586
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:04,020
But anyway, yeah, yeah.

587
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:11,140
So anyway, a return to energetic thinking actually wrote that down because.

588
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:17,940
The there's a separation, but not much.

589
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:24,380
You know what I mean? Let's say we call things inorganic, OK, things that are not

590
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,340
alive like rocks. And how can you say that?

591
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,140
We're not sure why. It's easy to prove that a rock can be suffocated.

592
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,660
Right. I think I've gone over that.

593
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,100
Basically, take a piece of natural stone, cut it in half with a diamond.

594
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:39,120
So don't smash it with a hammer or a diamond blade.

595
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:44,400
So it's nice and smooth and cover it in epoxy coating, which is not clear coat because

596
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:49,240
that has pores and it's something that doesn't have pores and put it away.

597
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,760
And the other one don't do anything to it.

598
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,060
Rinse it off, put it away.

599
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:58,320
After about three months or half a year, cut them both in half again and you'll see

600
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,400
the one that was completely epoxy coated is a slightly different color, slightly

601
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,920
different mineral content.

602
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,300
It's not as hard.

603
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:10,700
Right. Where the one that wasn't coated is almost identical to how it was before you

604
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,980
started. Why?

605
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,900
Because the one that was epoxy coated, you actually suffocated the rock.

606
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,860
Literally now, but it's inorganic.

607
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:25,660
OK. A rock might have a thought once every thousand years for a few seconds, which is

608
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,300
more than most people admit, by the way.

609
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:31,480
But it might have a thought a thousand years ago for five seconds.

610
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,180
Hey, look at that rock. And she's real pretty.

611
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,240
I want to move next to her.

612
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,000
Oh, thought goes away. A thousand years later, gets his next thought for a few seconds.

613
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,260
Oh, where's that pretty rock?

614
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,220
I don't see her anymore.

615
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:46,700
Why am I down here? A thousand years later, another thought for three seconds.

616
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,600
OK. Doesn't that qualify as being alive?

617
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,060
Yes. But to us, it doesn't.

618
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,680
Not at all. Here's the other thing.

619
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:57,520
You ever grow up in a neighborhood where you have a lot of big trees as a child, you go

620
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,240
back and visit as an adult and say, well, I thought that tree was big.

621
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,420
It's not so big. Right.

622
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,280
You ever notice that? Or I remember this apartment building down the other street here

623
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,880
was really big. It's not so big now.

624
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,920
What happened? Right.

625
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,660
Is the world getting smaller?

626
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,280
You heard that before?

627
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:18,300
I always thought it was perspective because, you know, you just because you were smaller

628
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:22,080
at the time when you saw it, it appears bigger to you, you know.

629
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,960
Well, you actually saw more than the tree and more than the apartment and more than the

630
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,740
rock and more than your parents.

631
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:32,580
I mean, when you actually saw scary stuff in the closet, it was really there, just not

632
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:37,340
there the way you are told it's there when you're an adult, the same way you're told

633
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,420
like a rock is not organic when you're an adult.

634
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,060
Right. Right.

635
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:46,020
Let's be fair to rocks, you know, give them a fair shot, you know, just because they have

636
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:49,100
a thought for three or five seconds every thousand years doesn't mean that they need

637
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:52,980
to be tossed to the side as as inorganic.

638
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,740
OK, it's funny for someone who got a big gravel delivery.

639
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:01,020
But anyway, yeah.

640
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:05,760
By the way, when you when you move heavy materials with a shovel, you know, oh, my

641
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,360
back's killing me. Oh, I'm so tired.

642
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,620
I shoveled sand, gravel, cement.

643
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:14,260
Right. OK, you see guys at work, you know, unless you're doing this all the time, even

644
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,540
then you have to know how to pace yourself.

645
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:19,000
Or here comes the Greek and he's got a little baby shovel, a little baby spade.

646
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,700
Well, it's not short handle because you don't want to lean over.

647
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,600
It's got a long handle. It's a garden spade.

648
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:26,980
It's very narrow. It's like six and a half, seven inches wide, nine inches tall.

649
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,880
It's kind of flat versus a regular digging spade, you know, which is pretty, pretty

650
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,240
large. Well, he's got the little baby shovel.

651
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,920
What are you doing with that? So watch because I'll be I'll be shoveling this at a good

652
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,620
rate all day long. I'm not lifting that much.

653
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:42,400
Right. And you're like, you know, dropping a shovel down, you know, picking up two kilos

654
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,740
at a time. You can only do that for 15 minutes.

655
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,640
And if you try to do it for more without any breaks, you're going to really feel it at

656
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,940
the end of the day. Right, right.

657
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:53,580
But I got this little baby shovel and I'm doing high RPMs, you know, it's kind of like

658
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:57,140
if you look at someone who doesn't know how to ride a bicycle when they're going on an

659
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,120
incline, they're like stomping on mashing.

660
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:03,460
It's like they're mashing potatoes where someone knows how to use the gears or has

661
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,560
them. We'll go to a lighter gear and they're just spinning away.

662
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,860
Da da da da da da da da.

663
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,120
Right. OK, so it's like it's a form of gearing.

664
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:14,020
If you're going to be doing moving heavy objects for a long period of time, use a

665
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,580
smaller tool, smaller.

666
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,300
Right. So you want to lose weight.

667
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:22,139
Don't sit down with a box of cereal and a big quart of milk and a tablespoon.

668
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,960
Get the little Demitasse spoon.

669
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,719
Right. Demitasse is like a quarter of the size of a teaspoon.

670
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,780
You can eat your Cheerios with that one bite at a time.

671
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,960
Watch what happens. After like 15 of those, you'll be full.

672
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,560
You know what I mean? If you eat real slow.

673
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,040
Right. Same thing is true.

674
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:43,080
The opposite is true when you're working or the same is true.

675
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:47,980
Use a smaller tool where if if possible, when you're lifting heavy and moving heavy

676
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,560
material for a long period of time.

677
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:52,880
The same thing here. We have something called caliche.

678
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:56,420
Very, very hard dirt. It's basically bottom of a lake bed.

679
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:02,200
All of the southwest was under was basically underwater about 2000 years ago.

680
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,020
Anyway, you can't dig here.

681
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,200
It's very so I use a small you see people with big shovels and stuff.

682
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:13,000
Right. I just got this little pick and a small, tiny shovel.

683
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,420
And three hours later, I've got, you know, hold deep enough to bury someone.

684
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,760
Why would you have to do that? But anyway.

685
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,960
And yeah, like a dog.

686
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,020
Yeah, you still got to bury a dog five, six feet.

687
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,740
It's best. Yeah.

688
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,120
Thinking energetic thought.

689
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,100
Let my mouth run away there.

690
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:39,660
You go back and you find things that they look they don't look as big and it's about

691
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,920
perspective. Exactly right.

692
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:43,760
So what kind of a perspective do you have and how can you maintain it here?

693
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,440
Give an example. We all start off.

694
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,960
I don't like seeing kids.

695
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,660
Right. Because, you know, well, some a lot of them are kids, by the way.

696
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,480
There are very few children that are left.

697
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:59,720
They have this thing in the Western culture, mostly in America known as the kids

698
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:05,500
culture, right? The Disney, the toys, the shirts, the parks, the, you know, fast foods.

699
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:09,860
Right. When do you switch over from Santa Claus, let's say, to know Santa Claus?

700
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,840
When do you switch over from that to the other?

701
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,360
You see, when does the perception change?

702
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:19,420
Some people want to argue and say, oh, between eight, nine or six and seven.

703
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,300
Some children are like, no, there's no switch.

704
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:25,120
It seems like it's personal preferential or it's just when do you change your

705
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:28,120
perception? But it's not just your perception, but the people around you.

706
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,980
Right. Because I've seen, quote unquote, these what they call disabled, whatever

707
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:39,000
adults the guy thinks he's thirty five or a big old fat white boy living at home

708
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,880
with his mom's mom takes care of him like a baby.

709
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,240
Have you seen that? Yeah, mentally.

710
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,400
Yeah. OK. Right.

711
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,080
Well, when does that what does that perception have to do with it?

712
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:50,960
Right. Well, then it's because he's being accommodated to be like that.

713
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,720
Right. Right. Well, it's kind of difficult to do it.

714
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,660
You know, I've seen somebody try and do that the other way.

715
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,380
OK. There are some people that are incapable.

716
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,400
I mean, they're just not, you know.

717
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,700
Mm hmm. No, I understand.

718
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,840
But we're all incapable, right?

719
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,980
To a certain point. At a certain point.

720
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,860
Yeah. Yeah. When you're when you're growing.

721
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:15,760
But when you've grown and you're incapable and you have your all your physical

722
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,600
whatever, it means you missed the boat somewhere and it needs to be retrained.

723
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,720
It's kind of like when a child can't walk.

724
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,680
When do you stop helping him walk?

725
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,260
How many tries? You don't stop.

726
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,920
You just keep going. Right.

727
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,300
Something went awry.

728
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,460
A lot of these cases.

729
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,740
Anyway, there's a perception here.

730
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,460
And when your perception changes, when do you decide no more Santa Claus?

731
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,800
Right. What I've seen is the child is eight or nine and wakes up.

732
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:44,740
Mama, where's Santa Claus?

733
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,180
You know, what's wrong with you?

734
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,660
Your little baby is no such thing as Santa Claus.

735
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,280
But last year she was saying Santa Claus.

736
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:53,060
So, you know, oh, my gosh, what's going on here?

737
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,820
Right. Well, that's why when parents have rebellious adults, I say you need to

738
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,260
apologize to children for all the lies.

739
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,320
You know, I don't rely on my children.

740
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:03,560
You know, Santa Claus, Tooth Fairy, birthdays, it's all lies.

741
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:07,660
Did you ever apologize or you just kind of transition them over just without talking

742
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,860
about the transition either?

743
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,540
Right. Right. You see?

744
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,440
So this is like basic thinking.

745
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,180
When do people and why?

746
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:20,860
OK, the why this child culture was put on society is very obvious.

747
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,840
The same reason they took nutrition out of food and all that.

748
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:27,420
Right. Is because to make them ill prepared.

749
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:33,280
Right. Because children are just small people, inexperienced, small people.

750
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,560
This was known and abused, by the way, in the 19th century.

751
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,340
If you look at factories, there were five year olds.

752
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,820
You know, if you if you can hold a tool, you were put to work.

753
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,360
It could have been as young as five.

754
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:48,600
Right. They tended not to go younger than five because you weren't considered alive

755
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:56,540
unless you were five years old, because the typical age for breastfeeding was up to

756
00:38:56,540 --> 00:39:01,340
five years old. And if you died before five, it was considered infant mortality.

757
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,020
Right. Not childbirth death, but infant mortality.

758
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,120
Well, even today they have the what they call the WIC program.

759
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,780
It's for women and infant children.

760
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,920
And when do they stop counting as infants at five?

761
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,780
OK, so keep that tradition.

762
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,900
Yeah, it's more than a tradition.

763
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:25,640
Slaves also when when a woman had a child less than five, the slave was counted as just

764
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:29,180
the woman. Right. But they knew if it was near five, you get a bonus.

765
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,360
You know, it's like getting the car with the CD player.

766
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:38,520
Anyway, I think we've gotten into slavery, which is, you know, slavery is a legal

767
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:42,620
condition and it's lawful and it's people as property.

768
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:46,280
Right. So if you're numbered, if you have a number that's specific to you, a serial

769
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,920
number, your property.

770
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:52,160
So the slavery issue never needs to be discussed because it's like, why is you know,

771
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,760
the sky is blue. Did you know that?

772
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,680
Right. No need to have a sonic on that.

773
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:03,820
But the energetic thinking part is very interesting because the trees, let's say I

774
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:07,220
noticed the apartment building that went back was a lot smaller than I imagined it.

775
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,000
But the tree, I can imagine, kept growing.

776
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,900
Right. Usually it was an elm.

777
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:16,880
I think so. Yeah. But it seemed a lot smaller because when I was younger and on my own

778
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,580
perceiving these things, because I was able to perceive what I did on my own.

779
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:24,340
Of course, people point things out to each other.

780
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:28,940
But while I perceived them on my own, they perceived really large because I was looking

781
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:33,040
at not just the physical structure, but I was looking at everything that went into it

782
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,100
also. Right.

783
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,520
Well, I would say a field does that, too.

784
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:44,220
If you visit a field later in life, you'll notice that it is much.

785
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:46,820
Smaller, much smaller.

786
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,420
Yeah. Yeah. Typically.

787
00:40:48,820 --> 00:41:00,180
Yeah. So on the aspect of the energetic thinking, it should be rationalized that those

788
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:05,420
things have not changed so much, but we perceive them differently because of all the

789
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:11,160
overlays that we have as we as we change and we continue thinking in our minds.

790
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:18,280
You know, I've always brought up the idea like when you recognize something, cognize

791
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:22,040
is to have knowledge and recognize you're getting now.

792
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:27,300
So what you're taking in, you're comparing it to everything that it might be similar to

793
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,840
that you've taken in in the past.

794
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,820
And this is how the human mind works, just like a computer.

795
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,000
Right. Same thing.

796
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,040
It just compares things.

797
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:39,880
Right. Well, this is one of those reasons why memory is not a reliable recording device,

798
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,400
because you remember something as much larger.

799
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,900
And like you said, because the perspective, it changes.

800
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,200
And it's not that your memory is wrong.

801
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,920
It's just that it's been it's been affected by what you've taken in since.

802
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:59,780
Sure. And what happens is, especially when you I think more and more now, I'm not so

803
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:04,500
timid when I say this and I always suggested it, but now I don't suggest that I just say

804
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:08,580
it is fact and truth that it's all external input.

805
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:13,320
I wanted to send you an audio today and we had problems opening it, but I think I have

806
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,600
to put it up on the cloud and you grab it from the cloud.

807
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,440
Right. Probably.

808
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,660
See how easy. OK.

809
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,720
All of your memories, all of your thoughts, all these things are not in the brain.

810
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:27,620
They're processed in the brain, just like a transistor radio or radio playing jazz at

811
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:30,060
the picnic table. If you broke the radio, opened it up.

812
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,580
There's no jazz band in the radio.

813
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:38,060
It's broadcasting and transmitting devices now transmit more transmit more than receive.

814
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:40,860
I should say it's it's it's receiving.

815
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,700
That's why they're called receivers.

816
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:52,500
We do so much receiving that we have found I have found by speaking with people that

817
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,720
I ask them very nonchalant.

818
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,660
Do you ever get a time when you don't have any thoughts?

819
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:02,480
I'm like, sure, I see. I mean, I mean, not just thoughts, but I mean, like no voice in

820
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,580
your head, like you're not there's absolutely nothing going on, like you're not thinking

821
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:09,380
of anything or when you're looking at something or in a room or whatever, you're not

822
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:13,080
pointing things out to yourself, you know, whether it's your own inner voice, whatever.

823
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,800
You ever get a time where you could just clear your thoughts and have all that chatter

824
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:19,040
stop? They're like, you know, that's that's really interesting.

825
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:22,620
Actually, no, because wherever I go, I kind of like relate to myself mentally.

826
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:26,100
What's going on? I said, yeah, I'm not saying don't relate to yourself.

827
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,620
What's going on is, but is there a chatter behind it?

828
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:30,620
And they're like, yeah, there is.

829
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:33,820
I said, yeah, you'd better stop it because the chatter in your head is bothering me.

830
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:37,940
Right. But anyway, you know, are the voices in my head bothering you?

831
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,960
You know, so.

832
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:46,180
What happens with that chatter is I'm going to suggest that ninety nine percent of it

833
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:49,080
is not you. It's coming, it's just noise.

834
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,980
It's ambient noise and crosstalk.

835
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,400
What I mean by cross, but it's more direct and crosstalk.

836
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:55,700
Let's start off with crosstalk.

837
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:00,720
Crosstalk is back in the day with landlines when you go down in the basement, let's say

838
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,680
an apartment building, all the telephone lines come in.

839
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,460
It's like a trunk, hundreds and hundreds of wires.

840
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:10,780
You ever pick up a landline and in between dial tones or when you, you know, when you

841
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:15,320
start dialing the dial tone stops, stop dialing for a little while and put your ear to the

842
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,780
earpiece and just listen real quiet.

843
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,860
You hear other conversations going on.

844
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,400
Right, right, right.

845
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,520
It's called crosstalk.

846
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:26,960
That's because the wires are next to each other and the signals through inductance is

847
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,580
jumping off. It's very low level.

848
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,060
That's how taps work, by the way, they tap into the line.

849
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:41,100
But this crosstalk that's happening is directed towards you, just like the cell phone.

850
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:45,620
You know how indiscriminate landlines where, you know, it's on the wall, pick it up,

851
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,600
whatever, you know, they don't want number it's calling from.

852
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:51,080
But now you have a cell phone that's got not just the number, but it's got more

853
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,660
information. It's your personal thing.

854
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:56,520
It's almost like a digital ID, which is what they're talking.

855
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:00,420
When you get a digital ID in the future, by the way, it's going to be a number.

856
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,680
It's going to replace the phone number.

857
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,360
It's going to replace the Social Security.

858
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,860
It's going to replace the address, everything.

859
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:09,400
Right. So you just give that one number and that's your entire being there.

860
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,520
Right. They're trying to figure out how to present.

861
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,140
This already exists, by the way.

862
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,000
If you have an FBI file that they're going to use that number.

863
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:22,680
By the way, if anybody, if the FBI has a file on you, that's going to be your digital

864
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:26,260
ID. So if they've had a file on you for a few decades already, that's they already got

865
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:28,820
one for you. I already have one.

866
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,600
Yeah. So whatever number they have on your file is your digital ID.

867
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:37,740
That's so in other words, they're going to be pretty busy because they could probably

868
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:43,440
somewhat a group like that is going to have to sort it out, you know, through the AG,

869
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:48,900
Attorney General. But OK, so this crosstalk that I'm talking about is not indiscriminate.

870
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:55,760
There is a direct focus on everyone's mind that makes you think that it's your thought.

871
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:02,520
And it's not. It's and it's custom tailored to you based on what culture

872
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:07,280
you live in, your familial experience, your religion, your education and then your

873
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,880
personal proclivities.

874
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:14,440
Right. Like I've known people that he says, oh, I love my wife.

875
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:18,160
And when I'm out in public with him, he's looks like he's undressing other women with

876
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,340
his mind. I can tell I could see right through it.

877
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,920
I'm like, shouldn't be doing that.

878
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,320
He's like, what do you mean doing what I said?

879
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,540
Undressing women with your mind.

880
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:25,880
We're here trying to order a bagel.

881
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:28,540
He's like, he's like, God damn Greek.

882
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:32,220
How can you tell? I said, well, I don't know if everybody else could see it, but I could

883
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,000
see it, you know.

884
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,140
Right. So these guys.

885
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:40,280
So whatever proclivity you have, whatever desires you have.

886
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:43,640
And I'm talking about your most inner desire revealed to those that are sensitive

887
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:49,060
enough, just like if you're having a sensitive phone call on a cell phone, a very

888
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:52,280
sensitive. Do you think it could possibly be listened to?

889
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:56,060
Of course it won't be your neighbor or somebody else that maybe it is.

890
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,000
But, you know, right.

891
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:59,360
But there is equipment that could do that very easily.

892
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:04,420
Anyway, what I'm trying to say, this is a hard thing to tell people, is that your

893
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:05,760
thoughts are not your own.

894
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:11,780
It's what you decide to take in as a thought or recognize while things are

895
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:18,980
happening. The media, mass media and alternative media, so much as we say, are

896
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:23,880
masters at manipulating this, by the way, making you think things are said when

897
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:24,820
they really haven't.

898
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:30,800
One perfect example is when they did 9-11 two minutes later that a guy we believe

899
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:35,940
it alleging that is a possibility as a suspect is Osama bin Laden.

900
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,320
Five minutes later, everybody on the street saying Osama bin Laden did it.

901
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,320
And I said, well, where'd you get that?

902
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:43,340
The television said it.

903
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:47,320
I said, no, you didn't. He says is a possibility alleging that he's might be a

904
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,420
suspect possibly.

905
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,120
Oh, shut up, Greek.

906
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:51,680
What's wrong? They said he did it.

907
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:54,800
I'm like, oh, my gosh, these people listening.

908
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,280
You see what I mean?

909
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:59,580
No, I've seen that hundreds of times with all kinds of things.

910
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:00,600
That's what they said.

911
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:02,680
And I go, no, that's not what they said.

912
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:08,140
They said, you know, the people that are promoting things in school and the mass

913
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:10,000
media, pretty much religion is the same.

914
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:14,980
I had some Jehovah's Witnesses come to the door and it says, we're from the

915
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:17,820
whatever, whatever Jehovah says, oh, you're in the Jehovah's Witness Protection

916
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:19,540
program. And I started laughing.

917
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:20,720
Right. One of them started laughing.

918
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,480
But the senior one didn't find that funny.

919
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,720
And she goes, oh, no, we're here to tell you about Jesus Christ because

920
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,160
Armageddon is coming soon.

921
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:31,100
I said, hmm, Megiddo is in Israel.

922
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,880
It's not coming here right away.

923
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:37,120
And I said, don't you guys have me flagged, you know, you know, corporate

924
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:40,980
corporate to not come here because, you know, I teach this stuff.

925
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:43,540
Right. But not not your stuff.

926
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:47,200
But I said, oh, so you got the fear porn going pretty good.

927
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,080
I see. And I said, hold on a second.

928
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:52,400
So I came out with like a stack of Bibles, not a stack of Bibles, concordances

929
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,080
and Hebrew and Greek stuff and all this other stuff.

930
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:59,080
And I said, you ever knock on anybody's door and they and they study this stuff

931
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,680
and teach this stuff? And they're like, no.

932
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,780
I'm like, so you want to talk about Armageddon or Armageddon?

933
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:07,900
And she goes, well, you know, it's what we believe in.

934
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:09,220
I'm like, all right.

935
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:14,960
Right. OK, so this is not this is not what they're used to.

936
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:21,260
So what I'm trying to say is they have even though they're going and knocking

937
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:27,000
on hundreds of doors all day long at the end of the day, they're going to say

938
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,180
everybody is pretty much the same except for one or two or three.

939
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:33,160
How can that be possible?

940
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:38,140
How can it be possible that they show you the towers being nuked?

941
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,380
You don't know that. But, you know, the jet fuel burned them.

942
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:46,520
Right. And they presumably allegedly suspected possibly Osama bin Laden and the

943
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,520
people five minutes later say it was definitely.

944
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:49,700
But they don't know what ever said.

945
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:50,820
How does that happen?

946
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,960
How does that transition happen?

947
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:58,320
The media is a master at doing that because they know that if they use terms that you

948
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:02,540
don't use, you're going to ignore them and you're only going to lock on to the terms

949
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:04,420
that they're that they're using, like a name.

950
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:06,700
It's like, oh, they're going to tell us who did it.

951
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:10,500
Right. And they're ignoring he's alleged suspect and all this other stuff.

952
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:13,160
Right. But the same thing goes on right now.

953
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:14,660
Been accused of sitting in jail.

954
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:19,760
I've been accused as a constant one, because when they say someone has been accused, I

955
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,760
go, OK, so there's been an accusation made.

956
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:25,780
That doesn't mean sure that that's been proven or it's known.

957
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:28,900
And I've been accused of stealing rocks from the moon.

958
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,480
Well, I'm not at it. Yeah.

959
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:33,820
Let them have at it. But that's the thing is, you'll see something like that and

960
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:35,940
somebody will tell me, well, they said they did it.

961
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:38,680
No, they didn't. They said they were accused of doing it.

962
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,580
Right. Because you go to the well to get water, not popcorn.

963
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:47,200
Right. So what they're doing is they're going to the TV to learn, but find out why

964
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,420
and who did what. They're not listening, you see.

965
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:54,480
So what there was a heavy amount of programming to get people to rely on the

966
00:50:54,480 --> 00:51:00,400
bullshit. Same with the church, not one particular church, all of them, all of them.

967
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:04,860
There's no exception. The same with the attorneys and the same with the doctors with

968
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:06,080
very little exception.

969
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:07,580
They're the only doctors.

970
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:12,180
There's some attorneys that you need attorneys for corporations, by the way, because

971
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:13,480
the corporation can't speak.

972
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,980
That's why I tell people like I think we were speaking to someone who just started

973
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:18,400
corporations that you screwed up.

974
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:22,120
If you're going to do a corporation, you go look at what Ikea done.

975
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:25,640
Right. That's how you set it up.

976
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:30,860
But anyway, you have a trust that's held by another trust that starts the corporation.

977
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:34,520
Right. You don't go and you know, anyway.

978
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,420
So all these things, where was I?

979
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:44,560
Oh, the how they get you to to the attorneys, you need an attorney to represent in a

980
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:47,680
legal court, the corporation, unless whatever.

981
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:53,000
And the doctors, you don't need any doctors at all except for emergency medicine.

982
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:54,840
That's it. The rest.

983
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:59,780
And and by the way, if someone needs surgery and it's not elective or if it's

984
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:01,380
ambulatory, that's emergency medicine.

985
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,080
You don't need them at all.

986
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,420
They don't know anything.

987
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,560
And here's the thing.

988
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:10,760
When it comes even to emergency medicine, they don't know anything at all.

989
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,880
Very little. Just enough to keep you alive.

990
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:19,660
There's micro surgery and there's chemicals that will keep you from passing out into

991
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:25,940
oblivion. By the way, when when you die, you you're one of some some people, most

992
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:30,940
people, I should say, if you don't die violently and in trauma, severe trauma, you

993
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:33,800
still have some consciousness and you realize you have consciousness.

994
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,000
But there's no breathing.

995
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:41,260
There's no feeling of body of warmth, sensation, you might sense that you're laying

996
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:46,260
down on the ground or in a twisted mess, but you don't feel it and you know you're

997
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,280
not breathing. So how can you be thinking?

998
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:54,000
Right before whatever, you got to be careful.

999
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:58,800
That's one of the things that I'm so harsh about is, believe it or not, if you're a

1000
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:03,420
staunch Catholic, when you die, if you think you did something wrong.

1001
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:08,620
You're going to hell and it's going to be just like the hell they show you in church.

1002
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:12,860
Or if you're a Christian or whatever and you think you're good, you're going to go

1003
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:15,420
to heaven, it's going to be just the fairy tales they tell you.

1004
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:21,900
Right. If you're in ancient Greece and you think that you when you die, you're going

1005
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:25,400
to go down to the River Styx and you're going to see Morpheus and you need a coin

1006
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:29,380
and all. You're going to see all that they're going to play out in your mind,

1007
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,620
everything that you believe in.

1008
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:33,640
That's why I tell people, careful what you believe in.

1009
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:41,180
I'm very venerable. Part of this mass media thing is to tell to respect other

1010
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,040
people's faiths and religions.

1011
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,120
And the Bible says that to leave them alone.

1012
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:50,540
Right. But the thing is, what I'm saying, if you read scripture, it says someone's

1013
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:51,440
whatever, just leave them alone.

1014
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:52,580
Don't talk about their gods.

1015
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:54,780
Don't talk about whatever. Yeah, that's that's fine.

1016
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:57,020
I know it says that in scripture, but that's not what I'm doing.

1017
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:58,680
Yeah. Among the Greeks, you go to Tartarus.

1018
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,200
Wasn't that the thing?

1019
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:01,160
Yeah. Tartarus.

1020
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:07,200
First, yeah. The river of forgetfulness and Morpheus.

1021
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:07,940
And anyway.

1022
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:11,980
Yeah. So but but here's the thing.

1023
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:16,640
What people think is in the law book, you know, what's called the Bible is not in

1024
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:22,260
there. So I'm telling people, if you think your morality is based on something that

1025
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:25,480
you've been told about, you better check it because it ain't so.

1026
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:31,320
Right. Just like there's a guy I listen to about the Treasury's corrupt, the IRS is

1027
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:32,880
corrupt, the politicians are corrupt.

1028
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,180
You know, they're embezzling millions and billions of dollars.

1029
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:40,460
I'm like, no, they're not asshole, because the money comes from your signature.

1030
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:46,040
You're just a sore ass, you know, just go to the bank with a pen and whatever number

1031
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,700
you want to write, one hundred and fifty million.

1032
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:50,140
They're going to honor that, but they're not going to give it to you.

1033
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:52,680
They're going to take it. Right.

1034
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,000
Yeah. So anybody can do this.

1035
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,380
I don't want to hear about the government or politicians embezzling hundreds of

1036
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:02,060
millions. Look, if you got a pen, you can do it, too, but you're not going to get

1037
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:04,900
it. They're getting it because they're part of the inside thing, you know, because

1038
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:06,140
they're part of a racket.

1039
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:07,700
That's why it's called racketeering.

1040
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:12,760
So that's why when let's say I go shopping somewhere and the checkout, you want to

1041
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,260
donate to this, whatever.

1042
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:15,820
I'm like, what's wrong with their hands broken?

1043
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:20,000
Like what? I'm like, well, you know, money comes out of your signature.

1044
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:23,720
If it's an orphanage, all you got to do is give all if they're 18 years old, give them

1045
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:27,540
some pens and whatever they need for food or money or expenses, they just write it

1046
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:29,580
down, blah, blah, blah, and get it.

1047
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,240
What? I don't need to donate for that.

1048
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,800
Anybody could generate funds from your signature.

1049
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:35,400
This is the law. This is how it works.

1050
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:37,400
But then it doesn't work that way.

1051
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,080
They're not going to give it to them. I'm like, yeah, that's right.

1052
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:42,620
So what are you doing here? Where once you get pitchforks and torches like the end of

1053
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:45,460
the Frankenstein movie, you see, it's not my fault.

1054
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:47,180
Right. I don't care.

1055
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:53,340
But anyway, so there's something going on with mind control.

1056
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:56,080
You notice I haven't said neuro linguistic programming.

1057
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,540
I haven't said mind control and all that stuff, because that's part of the alternative

1058
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:03,800
media. The MK ultra just means mind control ultra.

1059
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:06,620
And the control is spelled with a K instead of a C.

1060
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:08,380
Presuming. Right.

1061
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,460
Because it's the Germans, the Germans.

1062
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,040
All right. Deutsch.

1063
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:17,660
So what I'm saying here has nothing to do

1064
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:21,220
with all the mind control and all the brainwashing.

1065
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:25,460
Because, look, the elements of brainwashing are fine.

1066
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,500
But I don't I wouldn't call it.

1067
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:31,760
I would prefer not being brainwashed, but I would prefer washing my brain.

1068
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:36,300
Right. Why don't you wash your brain instead of being brainwashed?

1069
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,800
Because brainwashing sounds dirty.

1070
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:41,780
But washing your brain sounds clean and proper.

1071
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:42,820
It sounds intentional.

1072
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,480
Yeah. Intentional and positive.

1073
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,580
Where brainwashing sounds negative effect.

1074
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,520
So notice I haven't used any of that because that's not where I'm going with this.

1075
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:53,660
Where I'm going with this is mind your thoughts.

1076
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:54,940
And you've been told about this.

1077
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:59,860
Even in scripture, it says who wants to go into the man, the man's thoughts and his

1078
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:00,780
heart? It's wicked.

1079
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:07,100
Now, it's not it's that is not a direct condemnation of people, but the

1080
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:11,940
thoughts and what they feel is it's a condemnation of there's a big difference

1081
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:15,680
there. When you read that, I think it's in Jeremiah 17 or something.

1082
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:17,140
Don't hold me to that.

1083
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:21,580
That's always the concept they go into where it's, you know, not because you say, OK,

1084
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,560
well, look, the person's never done anything wrong.

1085
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,520
And you go, yeah, but.

1086
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:29,780
But their thoughts are wicked because they're being input and they're and they're

1087
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:32,820
putting up with it, just like the people that put up with whatever.

1088
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,000
Right. Right.

1089
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:40,000
So it doesn't mean the people are wicked, but what's passing through them is it's just

1090
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,980
like there's a little rascals.

1091
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,320
Don't drink the milk. It's sour.

1092
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:47,440
If I say little rascals, we lost like 90 percent of the people here.

1093
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:50,080
Right. Yeah. I bet you a lot of people have no idea what that is.

1094
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:52,140
Yeah. OK. Don't drink the milk.

1095
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,300
It's sour. Do you remember that?

1096
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:54,320
Yeah. Yeah.

1097
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:57,260
OK. Does that mean that milk is bad?

1098
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,360
No. This particular milk is sour.

1099
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:00,760
You're. But here's the thing.

1100
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:06,560
When you spend your entire life from raised in a children's kids culture or at five

1101
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,460
years old, you're holding a shovel in a coal mine.

1102
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:12,800
Right. And you're beaten to death if you don't work, by the way.

1103
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,860
And it's very easy to say that he fell down.

1104
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:17,720
Right. Of course.

1105
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:23,360
There's a lot of stuff going on like that more than anyone wants to believe.

1106
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,060
But if you look into it, you'll find it.

1107
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,040
Not that I'm looking for it, but I come across it.

1108
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:36,730
What I'm trying to say and to really, really implore here is that just because it

1109
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:39,250
sounds like your voice in your head, it's not you.

1110
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:41,510
Not until you know how to shut it down.

1111
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:43,790
Now, I've gone into this in the past.

1112
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:48,790
It's very important when the mind is busy, the body must be still.

1113
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:56,290
And when the body is OK, when the mind is busy, the body is still.

1114
00:58:56,550 --> 00:58:59,110
And when the body is busy, the mind is still.

1115
00:58:59,390 --> 00:59:04,510
Give you an example. You ever see like a gable roof that's got quite a good slope on

1116
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:07,910
it. You're nailing shingles and you got to really careful because if you start falling

1117
00:59:07,910 --> 00:59:09,390
off the roof, there's nothing to grab on.

1118
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:10,550
You know, land on your ass. Right.

1119
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:11,850
And the thorn bushes or something.

1120
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:15,830
If you want to if you just pull up in somebody's driveway and you want to have a

1121
00:59:15,830 --> 00:59:18,370
conversation while they're nailing shingles up there, what do they say?

1122
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:21,210
Hold on. I'm going to nail these next few shingles.

1123
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:22,310
Then I'll come down and talk.

1124
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:24,130
What? We can't talk. You can hear me just fine.

1125
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:28,550
Because he's he's got to mind the angle of the roof so he doesn't fall over.

1126
00:59:28,630 --> 00:59:32,250
He's got to lay the shingles just right, because if he doesn't, if he leaves a waffle

1127
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:34,510
print with the hammer too deep, guess what it's going to do?

1128
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:35,330
It's going to leak. Right.

1129
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:39,910
Right. So he's got to do all these physical things and he can't carry a simple

1130
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:42,350
conversation because his mind has to shut down.

1131
00:59:43,370 --> 00:59:44,170
OK, here's the opposite.

1132
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:49,930
They had all these degenerate guys from India as they were not all from India.

1133
00:59:50,330 --> 00:59:53,610
They gave them new identities as gurus and they sent them over here.

1134
00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:56,790
They had even the Beatles prop them up and other people.

1135
00:59:57,430 --> 00:59:58,770
There were these are total degenerates.

1136
00:59:58,910 --> 01:00:04,650
They're not gurus to get the American culture to to sit in a cross-legged style,

1137
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:08,510
all the hippies in the 60s and slow down their body and then slow down.

1138
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:11,850
They're sitting stationary now and to slow down their mind.

1139
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:16,310
There's no way the minute you cross your legs and close your eyes and try to meditate,

1140
01:00:16,470 --> 01:00:18,430
your brain is racing so fast.

1141
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:20,490
You're getting crosstalk from people next to you.

1142
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:24,730
So they were trying to tell them they weren't doing it right unless they stopped

1143
01:00:24,730 --> 01:00:25,950
their brain while their body stopped.

1144
01:00:26,050 --> 01:00:28,030
That's how you make an entire generation insane.

1145
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:34,690
You see, so when you're busy, let's say you're running a marathon, you can't think.

1146
01:00:35,930 --> 01:00:38,590
But when you're sitting still, let's say right before you go to sleep,

1147
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:42,070
all these thoughts, very easy, very easy to come up, right?

1148
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:45,070
Well, that's why clearing your mind, actually using something like,

1149
01:00:45,190 --> 01:00:48,190
you know, the whole like raking the garden, you know,

1150
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:51,090
like when you rake the rocks and you do the Zen garden thing.

1151
01:00:51,450 --> 01:00:54,470
That's why that makes a little bit of sense because all of it does.

1152
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:55,350
All of it does.

1153
01:00:55,410 --> 01:00:57,590
Going for a walk with a dog, right?

1154
01:00:57,790 --> 01:00:59,410
Or actually, that's too relaxing.

1155
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:01,230
If it's too relaxing, the mind goes again.

1156
01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:03,630
But if you're, let's say something critical,

1157
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:08,450
let's say like when I run power tools, you know, when I have a 12-inch cross saw,

1158
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:11,250
you know, I really respect that.

1159
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:14,310
You know, I don't have one of those saw stop things for the saw table.

1160
01:01:14,430 --> 01:01:15,710
That's where you put your finger on it.

1161
01:01:16,370 --> 01:01:19,730
It works a capacitive discharge like the phone stops the blade automatically.

1162
01:01:19,830 --> 01:01:21,730
You got to buy a new section.

1163
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:25,330
It's really funny, you know, when you put, if you ran your hand over a table saw,

1164
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:27,170
cut your hand or finger off indiscriminately.

1165
01:01:27,370 --> 01:01:29,570
If it's, the stuff that I use is very sharp.

1166
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:32,810
I mean, I could cut a two-inch thick plank and it doesn't, you know,

1167
01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:34,690
hardwood and it goes through just like butter.

1168
01:01:37,150 --> 01:01:40,510
It's a really good demonstration saw stop where they have the saw going

1169
01:01:40,510 --> 01:01:44,090
and the guy puts a hot dog there like it's your finger and it stops, boom, right away.

1170
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:47,130
You know, it just barely cuts the hot dog, right?

1171
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:49,870
Because if you know anyone that works in a cabinet shop, you know,

1172
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:51,410
let me see everybody who works here.

1173
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:52,410
Everybody raise your hand.

1174
01:01:52,470 --> 01:01:54,610
You can have at least two people with missing digits, right?

1175
01:01:57,170 --> 01:02:02,470
So anyway, when I do stuff like that, the mind is totally empty.

1176
01:02:02,970 --> 01:02:05,490
So like sometimes if I tell the wife, listen, I got to just think,

1177
01:02:05,730 --> 01:02:09,930
I'll just fire up the chop saw for five seconds and, you know, because it scares me, right?

1178
01:02:10,010 --> 01:02:15,010
I mean, not scares me, I'm very respectful of it and, or the cross saw or the table saw,

1179
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:21,630
let's say, and it clears the mind because I have to focus on the physical, right?

1180
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:26,110
If you're watching a very violent action movie, you can't think about the,

1181
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:27,930
you can't make the telephone bill, let's say.

1182
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:30,410
Now that goes, that just goes right out your, you know what I mean?

1183
01:02:31,430 --> 01:02:36,650
Video games, you're playing an intense video game, all of your worries go away, right?

1184
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:37,410
Right.

1185
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:42,230
Okay, so keeping the body and the mind busy slows down the mind.

1186
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:44,690
But here, what I'm talking about is something different.

1187
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:45,390
Okay.

1188
01:02:46,090 --> 01:02:48,430
Oh, by the way, let me just reinforce this with what's going on.

1189
01:02:48,450 --> 01:02:52,270
When you stop the body, the mind starts to race, okay?

1190
01:02:52,630 --> 01:02:56,170
So if you lay down in bed before, and you can't sleep because you have all these thoughts,

1191
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:58,430
that's good, and you're probably picking up on other thoughts.

1192
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:05,670
Just like teenagers, okay, just, if you know anyone who runs ham radio or CB radio,

1193
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:09,830
the length of the antenna is very important, and the equipment spacing, wiring, all that stuff.

1194
01:03:10,110 --> 01:03:10,250
Right.

1195
01:03:10,770 --> 01:03:15,230
When you're, when you start to mature and get bigger, and you get more gray cells hopefully,

1196
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:18,350
and your body changes, you pick up different frequencies,

1197
01:03:18,430 --> 01:03:20,850
more like the frequencies that the adults pick up.

1198
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:24,790
And you just came from an adolescent to an adult, let's say you're an adolescent.

1199
01:03:24,790 --> 01:03:29,010
Now, some adolescents, I remember a 13-year-old that looked like grown men, right?

1200
01:03:29,170 --> 01:03:30,170
13, 14-year-olds.

1201
01:03:30,450 --> 01:03:31,430
And others were slow.

1202
01:03:31,590 --> 01:03:32,470
I was a late bloomer.

1203
01:03:33,370 --> 01:03:39,270
But either way, they stay up all night because all the adults with all the fucked up mental

1204
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:43,250
stuff going on are asleep, and their transmissions are shut down pretty much.

1205
01:03:43,310 --> 01:03:44,250
So the air is clear.

1206
01:03:44,890 --> 01:03:47,650
So the teenager's like, wow, isn't it great staying up all night?

1207
01:03:47,710 --> 01:03:48,450
Yeah, man.

1208
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:52,510
And they don't know that it's because all the fucked up adults are sleeping.

1209
01:03:52,730 --> 01:03:53,390
That's why.

1210
01:03:53,390 --> 01:03:53,990
Right?

1211
01:03:54,850 --> 01:03:56,150
You do experiments with this.

1212
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:59,630
This is in the American culture, Western culture more than other cultures.

1213
01:03:59,730 --> 01:04:01,830
But it's also prevalent in other cultures as well.

1214
01:04:02,650 --> 01:04:05,030
It's in the Mahabharata as well, somewhere.

1215
01:04:05,170 --> 01:04:08,170
I remember reading where the young people, there was hard to wrangle them because they

1216
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:10,470
wanted to be up in a certain time, in a certain place.

1217
01:04:11,370 --> 01:04:11,770
But anyway.

1218
01:04:12,110 --> 01:04:16,790
I pretty much can't do any creative thinking until after midnight, generally speaking.

1219
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:21,570
So the thing is, this is basically how the convention works.

1220
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:23,010
The body is active.

1221
01:04:23,010 --> 01:04:24,270
The mind slows down.

1222
01:04:24,390 --> 01:04:25,570
The body slows down.

1223
01:04:25,690 --> 01:04:26,630
The mind is active.

1224
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:32,950
So what I'm saying is to get a neutral perception and stop all that, because there are people

1225
01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:37,510
that spend their entire lives from adolescence, when they become adults, until they die, and

1226
01:04:37,510 --> 01:04:38,930
they don't have any original thoughts.

1227
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:42,330
It's always like they walk into a room, and they're talking to themselves.

1228
01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:44,450
In your mind, you have an inner voice, it's called.

1229
01:04:44,890 --> 01:04:46,990
I'm telling you, that is not your inner voice.

1230
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:52,270
That is an overlay of what society or education and your proclivities have.

1231
01:04:52,270 --> 01:04:54,950
And also, you've got to throw in what condition you're in.

1232
01:04:55,010 --> 01:04:55,830
Let's say you're hungry.

1233
01:04:56,510 --> 01:04:57,550
How can I be so hungry?

1234
01:04:57,630 --> 01:04:58,850
It's not even lunchtime yet.

1235
01:04:59,010 --> 01:05:00,370
I had breakfast an hour ago, right?

1236
01:05:00,410 --> 01:05:01,430
Things like that.

1237
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:02,730
Or I'm feeling horny.

1238
01:05:02,890 --> 01:05:04,030
Or I'm feeling tired.

1239
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:06,990
Why do I feel like I want to go to sleep when it's two in the afternoon?

1240
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:07,650
Right?

1241
01:05:07,850 --> 01:05:08,690
Because you didn't do it right.

1242
01:05:08,770 --> 01:05:10,270
You're not noticing the day starts at noon.

1243
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:10,770
But anyway.

1244
01:05:10,870 --> 01:05:11,810
Yeah, that's the problem.

1245
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:13,450
That's a big deal, too.

1246
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:17,870
So all these things in your mind, I'm telling people, I've been telling them, when are you

1247
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:20,950
going to have an original thought, thought that is yours, that you have control over?

1248
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:22,070
I don't know how to do it, Creek.

1249
01:05:22,810 --> 01:05:23,810
I don't know what you're talking about.

1250
01:05:23,890 --> 01:05:24,930
That's always my thoughts.

1251
01:05:25,290 --> 01:05:26,330
Look, are you sure about that?

1252
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:28,570
Because I've found it to be contrary to that.

1253
01:05:29,430 --> 01:05:32,490
Just because it sounds like you and you think you're just very familiar with it.

1254
01:05:33,090 --> 01:05:34,270
Go talk to someone who's never...

1255
01:05:34,970 --> 01:05:36,570
You tie shoelaces all day long.

1256
01:05:36,650 --> 01:05:37,910
They say, well, which one do you tie first?

1257
01:05:37,910 --> 01:05:38,530
The left or the right?

1258
01:05:38,590 --> 01:05:39,590
People got to think about it.

1259
01:05:40,550 --> 01:05:40,710
Right?

1260
01:05:41,390 --> 01:05:42,070
Switch it up.

1261
01:05:42,690 --> 01:05:43,510
So here's the other thing.

1262
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:46,850
If you run into someone as an adult who's never tied their shoelaces and you got to

1263
01:05:46,850 --> 01:05:49,090
show them, that's really something they really have to work on.

1264
01:05:49,090 --> 01:05:53,390
So I'm trying to say, start working on your thoughts and disseminating them.

1265
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:56,910
And once you start clearing your mind enough, how are you going to clear your mind?

1266
01:05:56,950 --> 01:05:57,550
By being busy?

1267
01:05:57,650 --> 01:05:58,090
Not really.

1268
01:05:58,630 --> 01:05:59,370
We'll talk about that.

1269
01:06:00,350 --> 01:06:04,910
When you clear your mind and you'll notice your perception will change and you're going

1270
01:06:04,910 --> 01:06:10,530
to start developing who you are in your mind to yourself and this other stuff that's been

1271
01:06:10,530 --> 01:06:15,450
put on you from religion, family, culture, education, the way you're feeling, whatever

1272
01:06:15,450 --> 01:06:16,770
proclivities you've had.

1273
01:06:16,770 --> 01:06:20,590
Remember, I think we got in trouble for talking about women with big feet, you know?

1274
01:06:21,270 --> 01:06:22,710
So all this other stuff.

1275
01:06:23,210 --> 01:06:24,770
So that's not you.

1276
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:27,210
I mean, it is, but it's not.

1277
01:06:28,190 --> 01:06:30,830
So what I'm saying is take a break from that if you think it isn't.

1278
01:06:30,910 --> 01:06:31,730
Watch what happens.

1279
01:06:32,630 --> 01:06:36,050
Now, most people are going to jump in and say, so that means that I have to make the

1280
01:06:36,050 --> 01:06:38,190
body really active so the mind slows down.

1281
01:06:38,270 --> 01:06:40,430
No, because then it just slows it down.

1282
01:06:40,490 --> 01:06:41,850
It's still the same feed.

1283
01:06:42,390 --> 01:06:47,550
If you put Fox News on and you slow the speed down or speed it up, it's still Fox News or

1284
01:06:47,550 --> 01:06:47,930
CNN.

1285
01:06:48,870 --> 01:06:53,010
What I'm telling you, it's all external input and you've been caught in a trap is what

1286
01:06:53,010 --> 01:06:53,430
I'm saying.

1287
01:06:53,790 --> 01:06:54,450
We all have.

1288
01:06:55,190 --> 01:06:58,190
So what I'm trying to say here is you must change your perception.

1289
01:06:59,290 --> 01:07:03,770
That's why I brought up when you go to a place that as an adult that you remember as a child,

1290
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:04,990
everything looks smaller.

1291
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:05,630
Typically.

1292
01:07:06,150 --> 01:07:09,410
It has nothing to do with it shrinking or you being bigger.

1293
01:07:09,410 --> 01:07:11,410
It has to do with the overlay.

1294
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:17,350
So many years of overlay and input that you have that as a child you were fresh and you

1295
01:07:17,350 --> 01:07:22,570
saw more than the physical is why it seems so big and everything and everyone is much

1296
01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:23,770
bigger than you can imagine.

1297
01:07:25,290 --> 01:07:27,150
Is what I'm trying to say here.

1298
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:29,830
So one thing, again, to go back to perception.

1299
01:07:32,070 --> 01:07:38,050
What I do is it's been doing this for years and recently the reason what motivated me

1300
01:07:38,050 --> 01:07:42,450
I put on a Castaneda audio book, something about fire.

1301
01:07:43,170 --> 01:07:45,190
Talked about there's one other one, a short part of it.

1302
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:48,170
He talked about this and I told my wife said, you know, I do all this stuff.

1303
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:49,890
I never, I never got any instruction.

1304
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:51,850
Just like the emo stuff.

1305
01:07:52,810 --> 01:07:58,990
When I was teaching the emo stuff privately, I told someone, I think it was in town.

1306
01:07:59,070 --> 01:07:59,990
You have a person that was doing.

1307
01:08:00,090 --> 01:08:01,570
I said, you better stop doing that Greek.

1308
01:08:01,990 --> 01:08:02,670
I said, why?

1309
01:08:02,830 --> 01:08:03,330
Well, huh?

1310
01:08:03,350 --> 01:08:03,790
Excuse me.

1311
01:08:03,890 --> 01:08:06,630
Why would tell me why I should stop doing so strong about it?

1312
01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:11,350
Well, obviously you've been in some of the, the Taoist schools, some of the Qigong schools,

1313
01:08:11,430 --> 01:08:12,450
and you'll get in trouble if you do.

1314
01:08:12,530 --> 01:08:13,430
You're not supposed to say that.

1315
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:14,090
You know that, right?

1316
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:17,189
I'm like, no, I didn't go to any of the inner schools and all that.

1317
01:08:17,310 --> 01:08:18,109
No, no, no.

1318
01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:19,689
All right.

1319
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:24,010
So it was funny listening to Castaneda and saying the same stuff that I've been doing

1320
01:08:24,010 --> 01:08:25,210
and trying to impart to people.

1321
01:08:25,890 --> 01:08:26,870
It's all perception.

1322
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:34,170
So if you want to get this overlay, this crap that you think is you in your mind, just stop

1323
01:08:34,170 --> 01:08:34,850
it for a little while.

1324
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:35,430
And then you discern.

1325
01:08:35,430 --> 01:08:36,290
It might be you.

1326
01:08:36,470 --> 01:08:40,529
If you're happy with it, with your inner dialogue, and you think it's you chatting to yourself

1327
01:08:40,529 --> 01:08:41,450
and all that, that's fine.

1328
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:45,090
I'm not saying like you want to go to church and say a hundred Hail Marys and whatever,

1329
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:46,430
and bow down and kiss the Pope's ring.

1330
01:08:46,470 --> 01:08:47,130
That's fine with me.

1331
01:08:47,229 --> 01:08:48,010
It's on my business.

1332
01:08:48,450 --> 01:08:51,330
But I'm just trying to tell you, they're not representing what you think they are.

1333
01:08:51,470 --> 01:08:51,570
Right?

1334
01:08:51,609 --> 01:08:52,710
So let's get everything straight.

1335
01:08:52,870 --> 01:08:53,029
Right?

1336
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:56,490
It's kind of like when I talk about money, ain't no, it's not real money.

1337
01:08:56,590 --> 01:08:59,350
It's not even a bank note because the bank note is supposed to get something for it.

1338
01:08:59,390 --> 01:09:00,350
Take the dollar bills.

1339
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:01,010
They're bills.

1340
01:09:01,010 --> 01:09:02,550
Who's going to pay those bills, right?

1341
01:09:03,270 --> 01:09:03,450
Right.

1342
01:09:03,450 --> 01:09:04,569
If it's a bill, who's going to pay?

1343
01:09:04,569 --> 01:09:05,870
They don't make laws in Congress.

1344
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:06,590
They make what?

1345
01:09:06,850 --> 01:09:07,170
Bills.

1346
01:09:07,410 --> 01:09:08,290
And you're going to pay them.

1347
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:10,830
They're passing the bill, passing the beginning to you.

1348
01:09:11,910 --> 01:09:15,069
Anyway, because they're in debt, not you, but you could pass the debt just like you

1349
01:09:15,069 --> 01:09:15,850
could pass whatever.

1350
01:09:16,010 --> 01:09:19,090
Like Chuck, if you owed someone a hundred bucks and you were ready to come and break

1351
01:09:19,090 --> 01:09:22,050
your fingers for it, could I just give me their number?

1352
01:09:22,149 --> 01:09:22,649
I said, give me their number.

1353
01:09:22,710 --> 01:09:23,490
I'll pay it for you.

1354
01:09:23,529 --> 01:09:23,670
What?

1355
01:09:23,689 --> 01:09:24,370
He's going to refuse?

1356
01:09:25,229 --> 01:09:25,830
Of course he's going to.

1357
01:09:25,890 --> 01:09:27,010
I could fill in for you, right?

1358
01:09:27,109 --> 01:09:27,310
Right.

1359
01:09:28,109 --> 01:09:30,109
I could fill in and say, hey, leave Chuck alone.

1360
01:09:30,189 --> 01:09:31,010
I got the hundred bucks.

1361
01:09:31,050 --> 01:09:31,490
Who are you?

1362
01:09:31,790 --> 01:09:32,710
Well, I'm the Greek in here.

1363
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:33,350
I'm going to give you.

1364
01:09:33,430 --> 01:09:34,050
We're good now?

1365
01:09:34,050 --> 01:09:34,770
We good with Chuck?

1366
01:09:34,830 --> 01:09:35,770
Yeah, of course we're good.

1367
01:09:36,270 --> 01:09:37,410
You see, you could fill in.

1368
01:09:37,770 --> 01:09:41,770
So what is the United States is in debt and they're never going to get out of it.

1369
01:09:41,910 --> 01:09:43,790
So they pass it off to the people.

1370
01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:46,729
But the officials are not liable for it.

1371
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:47,830
This is a criminal enterprise.

1372
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:49,750
But this goes back to Babylon.

1373
01:09:50,350 --> 01:09:51,950
It goes back to Egypt, actually.

1374
01:09:52,910 --> 01:09:53,950
People think it's Babylon.

1375
01:09:54,110 --> 01:09:55,010
Sorry, I retract that.

1376
01:09:55,130 --> 01:09:56,050
It goes back to Egypt.

1377
01:09:56,590 --> 01:09:56,690
Okay.

1378
01:09:56,830 --> 01:09:58,330
So it's not like they're bad now.

1379
01:09:58,370 --> 01:09:59,330
They've always been bad.

1380
01:10:00,110 --> 01:10:01,930
You've heard me talk about George Washington.

1381
01:10:01,930 --> 01:10:05,750
He died at the first battle, you know, and then they found a guy with no teeth and that

1382
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:07,690
looked like him and had the personage of him.

1383
01:10:07,830 --> 01:10:11,130
And that's why all the history around George Washington after that battle is how we're

1384
01:10:11,130 --> 01:10:15,030
going to put teeth in this guy's mouth to pass him off as George Washington.

1385
01:10:15,150 --> 01:10:16,610
There's some nasty stuff going on here.

1386
01:10:17,150 --> 01:10:18,330
Founding father is my ass.

1387
01:10:18,830 --> 01:10:21,110
I'm doing the jerk off sign now while you say father.

1388
01:10:21,230 --> 01:10:24,270
You know, that was an old sign people used to do when something was whatever.

1389
01:10:25,050 --> 01:10:28,910
Yeah, when it does not serve its purpose.

1390
01:10:29,410 --> 01:10:30,210
Yeah, at all.

1391
01:10:30,210 --> 01:10:30,530
Yeah.

1392
01:10:31,090 --> 01:10:34,750
And if you use your if you're a righty, use your left, you'll think it's someone else.

1393
01:10:34,810 --> 01:10:38,770
But anyway, what's new to you anyway?

1394
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:40,270
Yeah, what's new to you is new to.

1395
01:10:40,490 --> 01:10:42,930
Yeah, it may not be new, but it's new to you.

1396
01:10:43,330 --> 01:10:45,470
So the thing of going back to perception.

1397
01:10:46,130 --> 01:10:51,790
So what happens is we when people admit to me that they have that is their voice Greek,

1398
01:10:51,850 --> 01:10:52,330
leave me alone.

1399
01:10:52,450 --> 01:10:52,970
That is me.

1400
01:10:53,050 --> 01:10:53,890
That is my inner voice.

1401
01:10:53,910 --> 01:10:58,150
It's very hard to get people to prime to the point where they actually can have a discussion

1402
01:10:58,150 --> 01:10:59,790
and dialogue about their inner voice.

1403
01:10:59,790 --> 01:11:01,490
Most people are like, get the fuck out of here.

1404
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:05,290
I know it's I don't know what you're talking about or what they're saying.

1405
01:11:05,370 --> 01:11:07,350
If you translate it is I don't want to get I don't want to go.

1406
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:09,930
I'm quite happy being, you know, the way things are.

1407
01:11:10,010 --> 01:11:10,170
Right.

1408
01:11:10,870 --> 01:11:16,050
So because it's perception back like when you were a child, what I'm suggesting is break

1409
01:11:16,050 --> 01:11:22,310
your stream of focus when you go into a room or a new situation to rec before you recognize

1410
01:11:22,310 --> 01:11:28,590
something right before you recog it, you will call it recogging for you.

1411
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:34,170
Don't focus on and don't look at it with the typical stare and visual stance you normally

1412
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:34,510
do.

1413
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:36,530
Try to unfocus your eyes.

1414
01:11:36,610 --> 01:11:39,670
Maybe use your peripheral vision when you first go into a room.

1415
01:11:39,790 --> 01:11:44,030
Don't walk in head on before you walk in, turn your body sideways and try to look in

1416
01:11:44,030 --> 01:11:48,070
there peripherally just from the peripheral vision, which you can't focus.

1417
01:11:48,430 --> 01:11:51,810
By the way, your peripheral vision is designed to pick up predators.

1418
01:11:53,470 --> 01:11:56,590
OK, that's where your safety is, your peripherals.

1419
01:11:57,010 --> 01:12:02,490
That's why I tell people, you know, when you're more than two people in a car, no stereo.

1420
01:12:02,790 --> 01:12:03,830
Don't listen to music.

1421
01:12:04,330 --> 01:12:05,490
Everybody's looking at the road.

1422
01:12:05,710 --> 01:12:06,950
Everybody watches all the road.

1423
01:12:07,210 --> 01:12:07,430
Right.

1424
01:12:07,510 --> 01:12:10,890
Because the driver could be focused on one thing and the other person's focused on another.

1425
01:12:10,990 --> 01:12:11,810
Here comes a car sideways.

1426
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:12,050
Boom.

1427
01:12:12,130 --> 01:12:12,750
Nobody saw it.

1428
01:12:12,790 --> 01:12:13,110
What do you mean?

1429
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:14,310
Nobody says two people in the car.

1430
01:12:15,190 --> 01:12:15,510
Right.

1431
01:12:16,490 --> 01:12:17,410
It's just like an airplane.

1432
01:12:17,530 --> 01:12:19,770
You know, I got the left, you know, it's a check five.

1433
01:12:19,890 --> 01:12:21,850
Check five means in the Air Force.

1434
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:23,050
It means I got your tail.

1435
01:12:23,330 --> 01:12:23,690
Right.

1436
01:12:25,650 --> 01:12:32,650
So anyway, start looking at things by not looking at them before you recog it.

1437
01:12:33,150 --> 01:12:35,270
Don't look at it straight on like you normally do.

1438
01:12:35,410 --> 01:12:36,930
Same with your hearing.

1439
01:12:37,230 --> 01:12:44,070
Practice hearing when you're having a conversation with someone in a room or put some music on

1440
01:12:44,070 --> 01:12:48,730
in the room that's pretty, let's say, not too loud, but fills the room with sound.

1441
01:12:48,950 --> 01:12:51,750
Try to focus on the sound outside of the room.

1442
01:12:51,790 --> 01:12:52,490
But I can't Greek.

1443
01:12:52,630 --> 01:12:53,330
I can only hear.

1444
01:12:53,330 --> 01:12:54,290
Well, it's too loud.

1445
01:12:54,330 --> 01:12:55,030
Then just turn it down.

1446
01:12:55,590 --> 01:12:58,650
So like, you know, let's say you have people in a living room and you have the television

1447
01:12:58,650 --> 01:12:59,550
on that volume.

1448
01:12:59,830 --> 01:13:04,070
But while you're there with them, try to focus on the sounds outside of the room.

1449
01:13:04,150 --> 01:13:05,350
It's kind of difficult, isn't it?

1450
01:13:05,430 --> 01:13:05,550
Right.

1451
01:13:05,630 --> 01:13:06,750
It is difficult to discern that.

1452
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:07,590
Very difficult.

1453
01:13:07,790 --> 01:13:09,250
But that's what I'm talking about.

1454
01:13:09,270 --> 01:13:10,090
The same with your sight.

1455
01:13:10,170 --> 01:13:12,470
When you're looking at something, look what's going on around it.

1456
01:13:12,490 --> 01:13:15,610
Or before you look at it straight, look at it from your peripheral.

1457
01:13:16,670 --> 01:13:17,470
What you might find.

1458
01:13:17,550 --> 01:13:19,910
He'll give some personal experiences before.

1459
01:13:19,910 --> 01:13:24,650
When I do this, when I walk into a new space, I'll walk ahead.

1460
01:13:24,730 --> 01:13:25,690
Let's say a new house, right?

1461
01:13:25,710 --> 01:13:28,130
You walk through the door facing forward.

1462
01:13:28,310 --> 01:13:28,630
I won't.

1463
01:13:28,650 --> 01:13:29,250
I won't do that.

1464
01:13:29,330 --> 01:13:33,030
I'll turn sideways about two feet from the entrance and look across the road.

1465
01:13:33,130 --> 01:13:36,010
But look, my face is pointing across the front of the house.

1466
01:13:36,090 --> 01:13:38,030
I should be looking inside like everyone else.

1467
01:13:38,170 --> 01:13:40,870
But I'm trying to pick up peripherally what's going on.

1468
01:13:40,910 --> 01:13:44,250
And here I see this giant shadow being run across the room.

1469
01:13:45,930 --> 01:13:46,330
Right.

1470
01:13:46,330 --> 01:13:46,930
Okay.

1471
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:50,150
A lot of people, once we've had this discussion,

1472
01:13:50,310 --> 01:13:52,050
they say, do you see like creepy crawlers?

1473
01:13:52,570 --> 01:13:53,510
Never in front of you.

1474
01:13:53,550 --> 01:13:54,710
Always on the peripheral vision.

1475
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:55,530
Right.

1476
01:13:55,610 --> 01:13:56,430
Things like flash.

1477
01:13:56,510 --> 01:13:56,790
Boom.

1478
01:13:56,950 --> 01:13:57,430
Run by.

1479
01:13:57,690 --> 01:13:57,910
Yeah.

1480
01:13:57,970 --> 01:13:59,270
I see that kind of stuff all the time.

1481
01:13:59,830 --> 01:14:00,230
Yeah.

1482
01:14:00,430 --> 01:14:00,690
Okay.

1483
01:14:01,590 --> 01:14:03,470
Now you see what's going on a little bit more.

1484
01:14:04,050 --> 01:14:08,030
When you start to focus this way, or let's say perceive,

1485
01:14:08,170 --> 01:14:10,430
by listening through the sounds that you should be listening.

1486
01:14:11,830 --> 01:14:15,370
By not listening to the things or looking at the things the way you used to.

1487
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:16,150
Right.

1488
01:14:16,630 --> 01:14:17,710
Use your peripheral vision.

1489
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:20,170
Don't focus when you see something new to recog it.

1490
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:21,630
Don't look at it head on.

1491
01:14:21,710 --> 01:14:22,090
Look at it.

1492
01:14:22,170 --> 01:14:26,690
Just turn your head away from it and try to look at it with your side of your vision.

1493
01:14:26,950 --> 01:14:28,770
Or the same with your ears or even touch.

1494
01:14:29,350 --> 01:14:32,410
If you go to some Asian cultures, when you tell them to feel this,

1495
01:14:32,710 --> 01:14:36,510
most Westerners will put their palm side down towards it and stroke it.

1496
01:14:36,870 --> 01:14:38,770
If you look at most Easterners, they don't do that.

1497
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:40,650
They use the back of their hand a little bit.

1498
01:14:40,850 --> 01:14:41,490
You ever notice that?

1499
01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:41,970
Yeah.

1500
01:14:43,050 --> 01:14:43,230
Yeah.

1501
01:14:43,230 --> 01:14:46,370
It's a cultural thing because the back of the hand is more sensitive

1502
01:14:47,290 --> 01:14:48,550
because it's less used.

1503
01:14:48,790 --> 01:14:50,550
Well, it should be because you're not gripping things with it.

1504
01:14:50,790 --> 01:14:51,150
So yeah.

1505
01:14:51,410 --> 01:14:51,810
Yeah, exactly.

1506
01:14:52,430 --> 01:14:56,070
But that sensitivity is reserved more for temperature.

1507
01:14:56,250 --> 01:14:59,030
When they take a temperature, even on TV, what do they do?

1508
01:14:59,110 --> 01:15:00,570
They put the back of the hand, right?

1509
01:15:00,950 --> 01:15:01,190
Right.

1510
01:15:01,190 --> 01:15:01,310
You see?

1511
01:15:01,410 --> 01:15:02,670
On the forehead, not the front.

1512
01:15:02,810 --> 01:15:04,190
Sometimes they put the front also.

1513
01:15:04,310 --> 01:15:05,070
It's not as sensitive.

1514
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:10,210
So your peripheral vision and your peripheral hearing is much more sensitive.

1515
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:12,310
So what will happen then?

1516
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:13,370
I'm not saying you should do this.

1517
01:15:13,550 --> 01:15:16,110
You see shadow creatures and things because they're always around us.

1518
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:22,410
It's just so you stop getting used to that recogging that you're always doing.

1519
01:15:22,510 --> 01:15:24,150
You're missing out on a lot.

1520
01:15:25,670 --> 01:15:33,210
Once you start focusing on not focusing or unfocusing, right, your visual and your hearing,

1521
01:15:33,710 --> 01:15:37,730
you're going to start to pick up on the emotional qualities of things.

1522
01:15:38,290 --> 01:15:45,790
You've heard me talk about often when I bring up the emo, traveling, all expenses paid.

1523
01:15:46,030 --> 01:15:51,050
Let's say I'm doing a project going from, let's say, Tucson to Louisiana on the way.

1524
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:51,930
I want to stop at a hotel.

1525
01:15:52,050 --> 01:15:53,050
I'm not going to sleep in the van.

1526
01:15:54,030 --> 01:15:57,890
Go to a nicer hotel and they give me the card, the key.

1527
01:15:58,470 --> 01:15:59,350
Very clean place.

1528
01:15:59,450 --> 01:16:00,110
I open the room.

1529
01:16:01,010 --> 01:16:03,250
Oh man, I think I want another room.

1530
01:16:03,330 --> 01:16:03,950
The room is perfect.

1531
01:16:04,070 --> 01:16:04,870
There's nothing wrong with it.

1532
01:16:04,870 --> 01:16:08,370
I'm not talking about the way I said about the Vegas guys with the ultraviolet light.

1533
01:16:08,810 --> 01:16:09,850
Nothing like that.

1534
01:16:10,690 --> 01:16:13,750
Well, I didn't walk in square.

1535
01:16:13,910 --> 01:16:16,530
I was like, oh, I don't have a good vibe with this room.

1536
01:16:17,290 --> 01:16:18,890
So I think I'm going to get another room.

1537
01:16:18,970 --> 01:16:20,850
I mulled it over for like 2.3 seconds.

1538
01:16:22,030 --> 01:16:24,030
That means one, two, and that was enough time.

1539
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:29,670
And as I'm walking down the hallway to get to the front desk, there's a couple.

1540
01:16:30,610 --> 01:16:34,150
Walks right by me as if I wasn't even there and they're arguing.

1541
01:16:35,490 --> 01:16:38,410
And the woman says, oh, look, the key still works.

1542
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:42,450
And it was the room that I just wanted another room from.

1543
01:16:42,990 --> 01:16:44,890
And she goes, I hope my fucking ring is here.

1544
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:47,570
I hope the goddamn you and your mom.

1545
01:16:48,210 --> 01:16:53,230
I'm like, oh, my gosh, no wonder the residue of that couple being in that room,

1546
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:55,750
even though it was clean, is still there is what I was picking up on.

1547
01:16:55,850 --> 01:16:57,350
The emo is lingering.

1548
01:16:58,410 --> 01:16:59,090
You see what I mean?

1549
01:16:59,230 --> 01:16:59,430
Right.

1550
01:17:00,450 --> 01:17:03,550
Most people are totally there's still sensitive.

1551
01:17:03,550 --> 01:17:05,850
They're just as sensitive, but they will ignore that.

1552
01:17:06,870 --> 01:17:09,170
Right now, was I right or wrong to do that?

1553
01:17:09,850 --> 01:17:12,550
Does it sound like a cycle instead of a hypochondriac?

1554
01:17:12,650 --> 01:17:14,750
Am I a psychokondriac, you know, or whatever?

1555
01:17:15,610 --> 01:17:15,810
Right.

1556
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:18,590
Should we coin that word?

1557
01:17:18,670 --> 01:17:20,430
Maybe I don't even know if I'm using a psychokondriac.

1558
01:17:21,030 --> 01:17:22,190
I never heard of it before.

1559
01:17:22,310 --> 01:17:24,390
I'm trying to think of no reference.

1560
01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:28,690
Yeah, well, you can make words all day, you know, like agnostic phobia.

1561
01:17:28,790 --> 01:17:32,390
If you know Greek, you can make up words like agnostic phobia means fear of the unknown.

1562
01:17:32,390 --> 01:17:32,750
OK.

1563
01:17:35,090 --> 01:17:38,310
Anyway, we have some people that are Greek speakers here also.

1564
01:17:39,010 --> 01:17:39,790
So here's the thing.

1565
01:17:40,110 --> 01:17:41,330
Did I do the right thing or not?

1566
01:17:41,670 --> 01:17:44,350
I'm not looking for approval, but most people would say Greek.

1567
01:17:44,430 --> 01:17:45,930
You did do the right thing, right?

1568
01:17:46,090 --> 01:17:47,110
Well, I don't know.

1569
01:17:47,990 --> 01:17:55,010
I might say it would be better for you to clear that and take control of that space.

1570
01:17:55,670 --> 01:17:56,670
Yeah, but who's working for who?

1571
01:17:56,730 --> 01:17:59,410
The hotel is supposed to be working for me, not me working for them.

1572
01:17:59,890 --> 01:18:00,870
Because remember, it's temporary.

1573
01:18:00,970 --> 01:18:01,510
I'm a resident.

1574
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:02,950
It's the only time that I'm a resident.

1575
01:18:03,630 --> 01:18:04,310
It's true.

1576
01:18:04,410 --> 01:18:07,370
But, you know, you could encounter the same thing in the next room.

1577
01:18:07,690 --> 01:18:09,170
Yeah, that's right.

1578
01:18:09,230 --> 01:18:09,830
But then you check.

1579
01:18:10,010 --> 01:18:12,170
But then what I didn't get into is I'm tired.

1580
01:18:12,250 --> 01:18:12,690
I'm traveling.

1581
01:18:12,810 --> 01:18:13,770
I didn't check the hotel.

1582
01:18:13,910 --> 01:18:16,330
You can also do the email on which hotel to go to.

1583
01:18:16,550 --> 01:18:17,010
That's true.

1584
01:18:17,370 --> 01:18:18,530
This has happened also.

1585
01:18:18,650 --> 01:18:20,170
We're a couple of parties, groups.

1586
01:18:20,470 --> 01:18:23,570
And we broke up and I said, I want to go to this one.

1587
01:18:23,910 --> 01:18:25,690
And you guys go to the other hotel.

1588
01:18:26,230 --> 01:18:28,990
When you go to somewhere like Palm Springs in the springtime.

1589
01:18:29,070 --> 01:18:29,290
OK.

1590
01:18:30,270 --> 01:18:31,090
It's all booked.

1591
01:18:31,090 --> 01:18:34,690
And anyway, how's the hotel?

1592
01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:35,510
It was more expensive.

1593
01:18:35,650 --> 01:18:35,990
It was crap.

1594
01:18:36,090 --> 01:18:36,850
I said, we had a great time.

1595
01:18:36,890 --> 01:18:37,530
Wasn't that great?

1596
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:40,610
You know, so you could pick up stuff with people, you know.

1597
01:18:40,850 --> 01:18:47,830
And anyway, what I'm suggesting here is if I go to a place to be where it's service oriented,

1598
01:18:50,510 --> 01:18:53,450
like very often I run into people, I do a negative comment.

1599
01:18:53,550 --> 01:18:56,050
It's like, oh, that's not someone I'd go to a fancy restaurant with

1600
01:18:56,650 --> 01:18:57,930
because they don't know how to act.

1601
01:18:58,370 --> 01:18:58,730
Right.

1602
01:18:59,010 --> 01:19:00,190
But a simple example.

1603
01:19:00,190 --> 01:19:03,890
You ever see somebody, someone who's not used to being in like a being served,

1604
01:19:04,610 --> 01:19:07,110
is when they're at a restaurant, they drop a napkin or a fork.

1605
01:19:07,270 --> 01:19:08,630
They want to bend over and pick it up.

1606
01:19:08,730 --> 01:19:09,510
I'm like, no, no, no, no, no.

1607
01:19:09,510 --> 01:19:10,170
Don't pick it up.

1608
01:19:10,610 --> 01:19:11,550
You have waiters for that.

1609
01:19:11,890 --> 01:19:12,850
But I dropped it.

1610
01:19:13,070 --> 01:19:13,490
No, no, no.

1611
01:19:13,530 --> 01:19:14,330
You're not at home.

1612
01:19:14,930 --> 01:19:15,190
Right.

1613
01:19:15,310 --> 01:19:15,710
You get it?

1614
01:19:15,810 --> 01:19:16,910
There's a big difference.

1615
01:19:17,810 --> 01:19:20,310
How many times you've been in a restaurant out and someone drops a napkin.

1616
01:19:20,350 --> 01:19:22,170
I'm not talking about your purse or your phone or something.

1617
01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:22,670
Right.

1618
01:19:22,710 --> 01:19:23,270
The phone you use.

1619
01:19:23,410 --> 01:19:25,170
I'm talking about the restaurant stuff.

1620
01:19:25,250 --> 01:19:26,030
You don't pick it up.

1621
01:19:26,590 --> 01:19:27,710
That means you're not used to being.

1622
01:19:27,710 --> 01:19:31,050
You don't think you've been waited on enough or, you know,

1623
01:19:31,210 --> 01:19:33,430
I'm not talking about growing up with a silver spoon.

1624
01:19:33,650 --> 01:19:34,050
I understand.

1625
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:34,510
Either.

1626
01:19:34,910 --> 01:19:35,130
Yeah.

1627
01:19:35,290 --> 01:19:39,370
It's just when you have to understand when you go to a place that offers a service,

1628
01:19:39,690 --> 01:19:40,370
are they doing that?

1629
01:19:40,690 --> 01:19:44,370
How many times have you gone to a place and you had good service?

1630
01:19:44,430 --> 01:19:48,350
And other times you didn't have good service in this place's work up to par,

1631
01:19:48,530 --> 01:19:51,830
you know, the similar, you know, one was good.

1632
01:19:51,890 --> 01:19:52,810
One was better than the other.

1633
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:54,410
I'm talking like McDonald's or Burger King.

1634
01:19:54,410 --> 01:19:57,990
I'm talking about here, you know, which are, which are on the same par.

1635
01:19:58,210 --> 01:19:58,430
Right.

1636
01:19:59,230 --> 01:19:59,450
Okay.

1637
01:19:59,530 --> 01:20:01,730
So, yeah, it would be very similar.

1638
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:09,010
You know, like if I go in to a McDonald's or a Burger King, which I haven't in a very long time.

1639
01:20:09,390 --> 01:20:12,270
And you, let's say you order a Big Mac and you open, it's all sloppy.

1640
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:13,950
The patty is off to one side, Liz.

1641
01:20:14,410 --> 01:20:17,810
And I said, you know, the reason I go, excuse me, I like to speak to you.

1642
01:20:17,930 --> 01:20:18,890
She's like, what's the problem?

1643
01:20:18,950 --> 01:20:21,530
I said, well, I don't really eat here very often.

1644
01:20:21,530 --> 01:20:23,570
The reason I came here because the picture looks so good.

1645
01:20:23,650 --> 01:20:24,590
And look how this looks.

1646
01:20:25,710 --> 01:20:28,250
It's because, all right, we'll, we'll fix it for you.

1647
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:30,010
They know this, but you see what I mean?

1648
01:20:30,050 --> 01:20:31,190
It doesn't look like the picture.

1649
01:20:31,550 --> 01:20:31,690
Right.

1650
01:20:32,410 --> 01:20:32,570
Right.

1651
01:20:32,610 --> 01:20:35,610
So it's either, either I'll take, I'll take it like it is,

1652
01:20:35,650 --> 01:20:37,770
but you got to take the picture down because that's why I came here.

1653
01:20:37,950 --> 01:20:40,290
You see, you see, you see what I mean about service?

1654
01:20:40,590 --> 01:20:41,830
Most people don't think like that.

1655
01:20:41,850 --> 01:20:43,090
Most people say, come on, it's fast food.

1656
01:20:43,190 --> 01:20:44,350
Now, of course, they're going to throw it together.

1657
01:20:44,430 --> 01:20:47,310
These guys are made of, what are you their attorney?

1658
01:20:48,370 --> 01:20:48,650
Right.

1659
01:20:49,130 --> 01:20:51,590
If you put up a billboard saying that you lend money

1660
01:20:51,590 --> 01:20:53,850
and you're a modern day bank, that's a lie.

1661
01:20:55,150 --> 01:20:55,250
Right.

1662
01:20:55,510 --> 01:20:58,070
You see, if you put up a picture and this is, you come in for this

1663
01:20:58,510 --> 01:21:01,610
and that's, you see, you got to, it's a service oriented business.

1664
01:21:01,670 --> 01:21:02,730
We're not, they're not trying.

1665
01:21:02,870 --> 01:21:06,090
They're supposed to have it done in the bag already.

1666
01:21:06,090 --> 01:21:06,370
Right.

1667
01:21:06,470 --> 01:21:07,930
Literally in this case.

1668
01:21:08,830 --> 01:21:10,950
So it's like this guy's Greek guy's a real asshole.

1669
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:13,250
But you know, some people might, some people say, you know, he's right.

1670
01:21:13,730 --> 01:21:17,710
So either way, I'm saying these things because the, the, they all add up.

1671
01:21:18,650 --> 01:21:24,870
So going back to the emo, this is, this all ties into the emotional part.

1672
01:21:24,970 --> 01:21:25,690
Because you know what?

1673
01:21:26,110 --> 01:21:28,590
When I went into that hotel room and noticed that I had to walk

1674
01:21:28,590 --> 01:21:30,330
and turn around and maybe try another one.

1675
01:21:30,990 --> 01:21:36,330
If you asked me to explain why using basic logic and reason and, you know,

1676
01:21:36,390 --> 01:21:37,430
Hey, Spock, what's wrong?

1677
01:21:37,710 --> 01:21:41,450
You don't have a good, you know, well, the room was dirty.

1678
01:21:41,990 --> 01:21:43,230
Something was unprepared.

1679
01:21:43,330 --> 01:21:43,930
It was missing.

1680
01:21:44,790 --> 01:21:45,010
Yeah.

1681
01:21:45,210 --> 01:21:48,290
Well, the UV light at the Bellagio, that blew my mind.

1682
01:21:48,290 --> 01:21:51,630
Cause you know, this, these were like, you know, 700, $800 a night rooms.

1683
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:54,450
This is where a floor you can't, you push the elevator button.

1684
01:21:54,550 --> 01:21:57,290
It doesn't go unless you have the card to go there, you know, that floor.

1685
01:21:59,110 --> 01:22:02,310
And he's out there with the ultraviolet lights.

1686
01:22:02,430 --> 01:22:03,090
It's a beautiful room.

1687
01:22:03,130 --> 01:22:03,650
He says, Oh really?

1688
01:22:03,750 --> 01:22:04,110
Look at here.

1689
01:22:04,190 --> 01:22:04,830
You see the nightstand.

1690
01:22:05,070 --> 01:22:06,090
See that splash right there.

1691
01:22:06,150 --> 01:22:06,650
That's semen.

1692
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:07,550
I'm like, Oh shit.

1693
01:22:07,930 --> 01:22:09,370
Oh my gosh.

1694
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:10,330
That right there.

1695
01:22:10,490 --> 01:22:11,110
That's blood.

1696
01:22:11,290 --> 01:22:12,150
He goes into the bathroom.

1697
01:22:12,330 --> 01:22:13,230
That that's urine.

1698
01:22:14,050 --> 01:22:15,230
Like, how can you tell him?

1699
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:16,430
He says, well, you know, that's what he does.

1700
01:22:16,870 --> 01:22:20,790
He has one of these companies that does, I don't know what they call it.

1701
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:21,570
Remedial work.

1702
01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:26,430
When, when someone gets shot in a hotel and they have to come and they tear out the walls

1703
01:22:26,430 --> 01:22:28,030
of floors and everything, you know, anyway.

1704
01:22:29,490 --> 01:22:31,530
He also has a power washing company.

1705
01:22:31,690 --> 01:22:32,970
I was like, Oh, it sounds real remedial.

1706
01:22:33,070 --> 01:22:35,530
The guy's doing like $25 million a month or something.

1707
01:22:35,570 --> 01:22:36,750
I was like, Oh my gosh.

1708
01:22:37,490 --> 01:22:37,810
Power.

1709
01:22:37,950 --> 01:22:42,170
He was doing like all the seven 11s in Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, you know, where they power

1710
01:22:42,170 --> 01:22:44,010
wash the oil stains out of the driveway.

1711
01:22:44,170 --> 01:22:44,410
Yeah.

1712
01:22:44,410 --> 01:22:44,570
Yeah.

1713
01:22:44,630 --> 01:22:44,930
Of course.

1714
01:22:45,350 --> 01:22:45,510
Yeah.

1715
01:22:45,510 --> 01:22:50,610
The contract for that contract for all the parking lots for like this mall, mall of the

1716
01:22:50,610 --> 01:22:52,510
main what's the big mall company.

1717
01:22:52,690 --> 01:22:55,970
And I was like, Oh my gosh, you know, anyway.

1718
01:22:57,410 --> 01:22:59,310
Yeah, not like that, but it's emotional.

1719
01:22:59,550 --> 01:23:05,730
So the emotional aspect of it is, you know, it, or you don't, you feel it or you don't.

1720
01:23:05,930 --> 01:23:13,090
And one thing we're going to talk about eventually is what this leads to is the emotional

1721
01:23:13,770 --> 01:23:14,130
change.

1722
01:23:14,310 --> 01:23:17,310
A strong emotional change will change your physical reality.

1723
01:23:18,150 --> 01:23:22,070
And a very simple way to say this, I'm just not going to talk about the emo, but I'm

1724
01:23:22,070 --> 01:23:22,590
just going to say this.

1725
01:23:22,590 --> 01:23:27,310
You have a mild mannered guy, you know, a real thin pencil neck guy, bachelor's degree

1726
01:23:27,310 --> 01:23:31,550
administrative at the post office for 20 years, got a really good pension.

1727
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:35,690
You know, he's got, well, like a G 15 salary, which is over 120,000, right?

1728
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:36,430
He's administrator.

1729
01:23:37,110 --> 01:23:42,530
Well, he takes a couple of days off, shows up at the office back at the post office with

1730
01:23:42,530 --> 01:23:44,450
a submachine gun and kills 20 people.

1731
01:23:46,170 --> 01:23:50,050
How can a guy do that without, without emotions taking over?

1732
01:23:50,150 --> 01:23:53,970
So that's what I mean about emotions can change your physical reality, right?

1733
01:23:54,330 --> 01:23:55,890
Or, you know, he's very mild mannered.

1734
01:23:56,670 --> 01:23:57,710
Why did he outburst?

1735
01:23:57,850 --> 01:24:02,310
Well, the logic and reason said, would say that's not possible, but emotion would make

1736
01:24:02,310 --> 01:24:02,990
him do it, right?

1737
01:24:03,370 --> 01:24:04,750
Well, it's a cascading thing too.

1738
01:24:04,890 --> 01:24:07,430
I mean, you move differently when your emotions are different.

1739
01:24:07,810 --> 01:24:08,690
You, you, that's right.

1740
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:11,370
So emotions, emotions are super powerful.

1741
01:24:11,370 --> 01:24:11,570
Yeah.

1742
01:24:11,670 --> 01:24:12,830
Your tone of voice changes.

1743
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:14,590
I mean, everything, everything gets altered.

1744
01:24:14,590 --> 01:24:15,650
It changes your reality.

1745
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:16,330
And here's the thing.

1746
01:24:16,430 --> 01:24:20,870
What it will lead to eventually is you will change other, you can influence people can't

1747
01:24:20,870 --> 01:24:22,390
change them, but you can influence them.

1748
01:24:22,970 --> 01:24:24,810
I had someone visit here a while back.

1749
01:24:25,830 --> 01:24:27,110
We were talking about the email.

1750
01:24:27,210 --> 01:24:27,930
This is about what?

1751
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:29,370
2014, 2015.

1752
01:24:29,670 --> 01:24:34,310
I think it was, we were already doing the original O and G and he says, you know about

1753
01:24:34,310 --> 01:24:34,510
this?

1754
01:24:34,590 --> 01:24:35,870
I said, yeah, I've been doing it for a while.

1755
01:24:35,910 --> 01:24:37,030
I didn't start talking about it.

1756
01:24:37,050 --> 01:24:37,970
He says, don't talk about it.

1757
01:24:37,970 --> 01:24:38,270
Greek.

1758
01:24:38,850 --> 01:24:39,910
I said, but yeah, talk about it.

1759
01:24:39,910 --> 01:24:40,950
I think, you know, I should talk about it.

1760
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:41,490
Why not?

1761
01:24:41,630 --> 01:24:42,630
I said, because it's very powerful.

1762
01:24:42,790 --> 01:24:43,670
I said, see that woman there?

1763
01:24:44,090 --> 01:24:45,350
I'm going to make her scratch her nose.

1764
01:24:46,330 --> 01:24:48,550
I'm not saying he's, he's saying that he does.

1765
01:24:48,690 --> 01:24:50,010
And he said, well, you see that one there?

1766
01:24:50,750 --> 01:24:53,990
She's just started eating, but I'm going to make her put her food down and go to the bathroom.

1767
01:24:54,050 --> 01:24:56,730
And if she doesn't go to the bathroom in 10 seconds, she's going to pee on herself.

1768
01:24:57,670 --> 01:25:01,190
And she, and she puts her food down and she starts walking in the bathroom.

1769
01:25:01,250 --> 01:25:02,830
Then she starts racing to the bathroom.

1770
01:25:03,530 --> 01:25:03,850
Right.

1771
01:25:04,250 --> 01:25:04,570
Okay.

1772
01:25:04,590 --> 01:25:05,430
How can you do that?

1773
01:25:05,490 --> 01:25:05,690
Right.

1774
01:25:06,190 --> 01:25:10,530
Cause this is just imagine two aliens like in a twilight zone, they show up and they start

1775
01:25:10,530 --> 01:25:11,610
making people in the diner.

1776
01:25:11,650 --> 01:25:12,210
They look human.

1777
01:25:12,810 --> 01:25:17,030
And the, um, they start making people doing all kinds of stuff just for their own fun.

1778
01:25:17,210 --> 01:25:17,390
Right.

1779
01:25:18,410 --> 01:25:20,110
Imagine a twilight zone like that.

1780
01:25:20,570 --> 01:25:23,310
We started playing around people in a Japanese restaurant like that.

1781
01:25:23,330 --> 01:25:23,850
It wasn't good.

1782
01:25:25,590 --> 01:25:27,450
So I was like, okay, proven, proven.

1783
01:25:27,510 --> 01:25:29,590
But I said, I want people to know about this.

1784
01:25:29,970 --> 01:25:32,070
I want people to work and cultivate it.

1785
01:25:32,110 --> 01:25:32,290
Right.

1786
01:25:32,330 --> 01:25:35,410
So if you just discovered there's a game called basketball, do you think you're going to go

1787
01:25:35,410 --> 01:25:38,250
to Walmart or circle K, get a basketball and start playing tomorrow?

1788
01:25:38,970 --> 01:25:39,830
You could try.

1789
01:25:40,550 --> 01:25:40,890
Right.

1790
01:25:41,890 --> 01:25:42,030
Yeah.

1791
01:25:42,090 --> 01:25:43,270
But you're going to have to practice for what?

1792
01:25:43,330 --> 01:25:45,530
Maybe at least a week or two or three or maybe six months.

1793
01:25:45,590 --> 01:25:49,450
You'll be, you could make it a recreational part where you enjoy it.

1794
01:25:49,510 --> 01:25:52,230
And see if you, if you suck at it in the beginning, you won't enjoy it.

1795
01:25:52,310 --> 01:25:53,870
People enjoy things cause they're good at it.

1796
01:25:53,870 --> 01:25:54,050
Right.

1797
01:25:54,290 --> 01:25:54,810
Oh, usually.

1798
01:25:54,930 --> 01:25:55,130
Yeah.

1799
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:55,910
Yeah.

1800
01:25:55,990 --> 01:25:59,950
So now what this leads to eventually, you know, influence people to start influencing

1801
01:25:59,950 --> 01:26:00,390
things.

1802
01:26:00,430 --> 01:26:02,610
I said, I'm going to give a couple of personal instance here.

1803
01:26:02,950 --> 01:26:06,750
There's something called PK psychokinetics where you move things with your mind.

1804
01:26:06,890 --> 01:26:07,230
Okay.

1805
01:26:07,650 --> 01:26:11,910
So about a month ago I'm scrubbing a pot, you know, I like to cook.

1806
01:26:12,110 --> 01:26:15,570
So when I, when I say I'm in the kitchen or whatever, you know, it's cause you know, you

1807
01:26:15,570 --> 01:26:16,570
got to clean up, right.

1808
01:26:17,210 --> 01:26:18,370
Even though it's two of us here.

1809
01:26:18,990 --> 01:26:24,690
So I've got this bartender's keeper, I'm scrubbing this big pot and I want to scour it a little

1810
01:26:24,690 --> 01:26:26,170
bit, get it clean.

1811
01:26:26,450 --> 01:26:29,170
And I'm running hot water and the, and I had turned the water heater up.

1812
01:26:29,230 --> 01:26:30,490
So the water is really, really hot.

1813
01:26:30,510 --> 01:26:35,170
I said, you know, I'm either going to turn on the cold water or I'm going to just turn

1814
01:26:35,170 --> 01:26:35,850
off the hot water.

1815
01:26:35,990 --> 01:26:39,590
Cause I have plenty of water here to work with, but I don't want to touch anything.

1816
01:26:39,690 --> 01:26:40,670
And this pot's so heavy.

1817
01:26:40,730 --> 01:26:41,870
I can't really lay it down.

1818
01:26:41,910 --> 01:26:44,110
I'm like, just go like that.

1819
01:26:44,150 --> 01:26:46,970
And then boom, I hear this loud sound and a click in front of me.

1820
01:26:47,010 --> 01:26:51,590
And the hot water valve shuts off and the water stops instantly mid flow.

1821
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:55,410
You know, when you turn off the valve and the water still flows for about half a second.

1822
01:26:56,150 --> 01:26:57,070
This was instant.

1823
01:26:57,190 --> 01:27:00,950
This was like the valve snapped shut and the water stopped in the spigot.

1824
01:27:01,030 --> 01:27:05,050
And I have one of those kind of fancy gooseneck spigots that come up real high and

1825
01:27:05,050 --> 01:27:09,730
curved, you know, and it's wall mounted, not counter mounted faucet.

1826
01:27:09,870 --> 01:27:12,110
It's everything I have is for ergonomics.

1827
01:27:13,130 --> 01:27:15,430
And I stopped and I froze.

1828
01:27:15,670 --> 01:27:16,790
And my wife said, what's the matter?

1829
01:27:16,870 --> 01:27:21,390
I said, uh, I don't know how to say this, but I just turned the hot water off with my

1830
01:27:21,390 --> 01:27:21,790
mind.

1831
01:27:22,630 --> 01:27:23,530
She goes, great.

1832
01:27:23,910 --> 01:27:24,670
Fucking cool.

1833
01:27:25,030 --> 01:27:25,950
You know, that's great.

1834
01:27:26,850 --> 01:27:27,270
Okay.

1835
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:34,730
The other day, uh, three days ago, four days ago, I'm gluing some, um, strips of

1836
01:27:34,730 --> 01:27:35,050
wood.

1837
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:38,790
I was making a laminate because I'm building loudspeakers and prototyping them.

1838
01:27:41,550 --> 01:27:44,750
Um, and I've got some, uh, tight bond, waterproof glue.

1839
01:27:44,850 --> 01:27:47,330
It's wood, wood glue, the yellow stuff, the really good stuff.

1840
01:27:48,210 --> 01:27:50,470
And, um, I didn't really, I wasn't mindful.

1841
01:27:50,630 --> 01:27:53,590
So the top, you know, you pull, you know, how wood glue or Elmer's glue, you pull the

1842
01:27:53,590 --> 01:27:56,770
top and, uh, you pour it out and close the top.

1843
01:27:56,870 --> 01:27:58,750
Well, when I, last time I closed it, it was really messy.

1844
01:27:58,850 --> 01:28:04,110
So it was all, I try to pull it as like, this is not, I have to soak it in hot water.

1845
01:28:04,110 --> 01:28:05,250
I can't get the thing open.

1846
01:28:05,370 --> 01:28:06,110
You know what I'm talking about?

1847
01:28:06,250 --> 01:28:07,410
Chuck, you ever worked with wood glue?

1848
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:09,290
Then it's hard to, yeah, it's hard to turn.

1849
01:28:09,290 --> 01:28:10,290
It got really crusty.

1850
01:28:10,330 --> 01:28:11,930
And I said, look, I'm doing some fine work here.

1851
01:28:12,010 --> 01:28:13,910
I gotta, I gotta, I can't neglect this.

1852
01:28:14,710 --> 01:28:18,930
It's $15 thing of glue and it's not worth, you know, I gotta just, let me just finish

1853
01:28:18,930 --> 01:28:21,590
the trim piece and, and, and mark everything off.

1854
01:28:21,630 --> 01:28:22,990
Then I'm going to take the glue.

1855
01:28:23,050 --> 01:28:24,290
I'm going to run it under some hot water.

1856
01:28:24,390 --> 01:28:25,030
Here's the hot water again.

1857
01:28:25,390 --> 01:28:27,850
I'm going to run it under some hot water and clean the top off.

1858
01:28:27,850 --> 01:28:28,070
Right.

1859
01:28:28,170 --> 01:28:28,430
Okay.

1860
01:28:28,790 --> 01:28:31,370
So I go back, I do the trim work or so, 15 minutes.

1861
01:28:32,130 --> 01:28:36,510
And I turn around, I have the, the wood glue right where it was.

1862
01:28:36,650 --> 01:28:38,070
I go to pick it up and it's so hot.

1863
01:28:38,170 --> 01:28:41,430
I had to put it down in my hand and the top of it was totally clean.

1864
01:28:41,690 --> 01:28:44,050
It was really hot as if it was in boiling water.

1865
01:28:47,460 --> 01:28:47,820
Okay.

1866
01:28:48,140 --> 01:28:49,100
I told my wife that too.

1867
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:51,280
She's like, oh, that is so fucking cool.

1868
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:54,580
I had not, I had just thought about doing that.

1869
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:58,520
So I'm starting to get these experiences because I'm working on this stuff.

1870
01:28:58,820 --> 01:28:59,840
And that's all I'm going to say.

1871
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:05,540
Normally don't share these things, but I think I'm onto something here.

1872
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:08,260
And here's, and here's the thing.

1873
01:29:08,300 --> 01:29:15,160
I almost don't want to say this or wish I hadn't because if I don't, if I start getting good at

1874
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:20,540
this and I can't figure out how to tell other people to do it, I'm going to wish I never said

1875
01:29:20,540 --> 01:29:20,760
it.

1876
01:29:21,020 --> 01:29:26,480
So I'm almost putting myself into place because that I have to figure out how it's done.

1877
01:29:26,540 --> 01:29:29,300
And other people, you know, you know what I say?

1878
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:34,820
I won't talk about anything unless I show people how they can technically access it.

1879
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:35,460
Right.

1880
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:39,280
Like if, let's say you hear me playing guitar and you're like, Greek, how the hell do you do

1881
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:39,380
that?

1882
01:29:39,420 --> 01:29:40,120
Well, you could learn too.

1883
01:29:40,180 --> 01:29:40,640
Do you want to learn?

1884
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:45,100
But you see, you could take guitar lessons now from someone else.

1885
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:52,000
But you see, so the interesting thing here is like with the weather work, you know, you

1886
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:56,140
hear about mystics and whatever doing weather, you could do with your mind using the emo.

1887
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:59,580
But technically, I could show you how to do it.

1888
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:03,980
And I think some of the subs here have good success with it.

1889
01:30:04,580 --> 01:30:07,580
You and I think I've mentioned this before when we were on with Danny.

1890
01:30:07,740 --> 01:30:09,880
Danny asked me to stop the rain because his brother was visiting.

1891
01:30:10,060 --> 01:30:11,880
And you're like, what the hell are you talking about?

1892
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:14,700
And then a week later, Danny's like, thanks a lot.

1893
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:15,820
There was no rain for three days.

1894
01:30:15,860 --> 01:30:16,460
I said, you're welcome.

1895
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:20,640
It took me, don't ask me, don't ever ask me to do that again because I lost a day and a

1896
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:23,120
half, almost two days of time just to do that, to sustain it.

1897
01:30:23,220 --> 01:30:24,680
You know, that was technical.

1898
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:25,800
It's not emo.

1899
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:28,020
That was setting up devices and all that.

1900
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:31,640
They caught it real bad in the Midwest, though, by the way.

1901
01:30:32,180 --> 01:30:35,380
You know, when you do stuff like that downstream, they're going to catch hell for it.

1902
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:36,500
Usually, not always.

1903
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:42,340
So anything about technically accessing is what I'm into.

1904
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:45,300
If you have a special talent, oh, have at it.

1905
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:46,160
I'm glad you do.

1906
01:30:47,060 --> 01:30:51,980
That means that no matter how much you tell people how to do it, they won't be able to

1907
01:30:51,980 --> 01:30:52,760
do it like you do.

1908
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:53,920
I understand that.

1909
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:59,160
Most things, whether it's playing guitar, weather work, whatever, the emo, all that

1910
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:03,620
stuff, if someone's interested, you could talk about it and have them technically, what

1911
01:31:03,620 --> 01:31:06,260
I mean by technically access, you do bullet points.

1912
01:31:06,620 --> 01:31:07,580
You know, this is how it works.

1913
01:31:07,660 --> 01:31:09,220
This is how you set yourself up, right?

1914
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:10,520
Just like playing guitar, right?

1915
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:12,340
You know, or whatever.

1916
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:19,740
So what I'm trying to say is for a long time, not just sitting in a Japanese restaurant

1917
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:26,000
10 years ago or 9 years ago or 8 years ago with someone that visited, making people scratch

1918
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,220
their nose or go to the bathroom.

1919
01:31:28,140 --> 01:31:35,240
I'm talking about if you can influence people that way using the emo and the PK, I think

1920
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:37,540
it's time to start influencing objects.

1921
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:43,660
And I've had these two recent experiences, and I've had more, but the other ones were

1922
01:31:43,660 --> 01:31:44,200
more subtle.

1923
01:31:44,380 --> 01:31:49,240
It can go either way, but these were in your face, like you're going to wake up, you're

1924
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:51,480
going to notice these, right?

1925
01:31:53,420 --> 01:31:55,400
Look, it's always better anyway.

1926
01:31:55,540 --> 01:32:00,680
I mean, to me, you know, anybody can tell me that they're capable of doing anything,

1927
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:08,160
but unless they can show me or they can show me how to replicate it, you know, it doesn't

1928
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:10,260
mean much to my mind.

1929
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:12,040
You know, it's like you could tell.

1930
01:32:12,180 --> 01:32:12,540
Exactly.

1931
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:16,200
Like I've heard people say, oh, I know how to, you know, how to do this.

1932
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:17,320
And I go, OK, do it.

1933
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:20,320
Otherwise, it ends up being like the size of your penis or something.

1934
01:32:20,420 --> 01:32:21,120
Well, right.

1935
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:22,600
It doesn't matter.

1936
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:23,860
That's what you got.

1937
01:32:24,140 --> 01:32:24,240
Yeah.

1938
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:24,840
Yeah.

1939
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:34,940
So anyway, I would suggest that there is an interesting, I don't know if you guys understand,

1940
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:36,680
there's spoon bending parties.

1941
01:32:37,220 --> 01:32:41,160
A lot of these psychics have, and they try to technically access it.

1942
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:44,820
You know, I've actually, a long time ago, there was a video on that.

1943
01:32:44,940 --> 01:32:46,180
I said, that's not how I would do it.

1944
01:32:46,180 --> 01:32:47,760
I don't think the approach is wrong.

1945
01:32:47,820 --> 01:32:50,980
Either of these people are doing it hit or miss or whatever.

1946
01:32:51,060 --> 01:32:52,200
But they had a big box of spoons.

1947
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:59,060
What made the video worth watching is at one point, they said, we did all the classes.

1948
01:32:59,180 --> 01:33:00,200
Well, no one bent the spoon.

1949
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:05,020
But when we took a break and we kind of got into groups together, got some wine, started

1950
01:33:05,020 --> 01:33:09,880
talking, going outside, and we started laughing and joking, the spoon started bending without

1951
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:10,460
even noticing.

1952
01:33:12,020 --> 01:33:12,860
Isn't that cool?

1953
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:13,640
Yeah.

1954
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:14,960
You see?

1955
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:19,400
Does that mean like in order to bend spoons, you got to think about it and then stop and

1956
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:20,080
laugh and joke?

1957
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:21,540
No, it didn't work.

1958
01:33:22,740 --> 01:33:24,040
So there's more to it.

1959
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:28,660
But what I know from making people scratch their nose or go to the bathroom at a Japanese

1960
01:33:28,660 --> 01:33:31,180
restaurant, that was pure emo.

1961
01:33:32,860 --> 01:33:41,240
And the level of setting yourself up for that is first, if you're used to and you're relying

1962
01:33:41,240 --> 01:33:45,860
on that inner voice in your head, which is not you, and it's not in your head, and you're

1963
01:33:45,860 --> 01:33:49,660
used to that and you're happy with that, you'll never even understand the weather work, the

1964
01:33:49,660 --> 01:33:51,460
emo work or anything like that.

1965
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:57,440
If you start to unfocus on that and discern what is really your thought and what you are

1966
01:33:57,440 --> 01:34:01,040
really recognizing, really, versus what you're told.

1967
01:34:01,160 --> 01:34:05,040
Remember the guy who said Osama bin Laden really did it?

1968
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:06,000
They saw it on TV.

1969
01:34:06,180 --> 01:34:06,680
He said he did it.

1970
01:34:06,740 --> 01:34:08,160
I said, I saw the TV, same thing.

1971
01:34:08,220 --> 01:34:10,480
He didn't say anything, but he didn't say he did it at all.

1972
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:12,000
Just the accused, right?

1973
01:34:12,860 --> 01:34:14,620
That's how big the difference is.

1974
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:22,660
So what the takeaway is, we've been told to focus a certain way, approach things a certain

1975
01:34:22,660 --> 01:34:24,800
way, it's not working very well.

1976
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:27,320
If it's working fine for you, that's fine.

1977
01:34:27,580 --> 01:34:31,880
But you're not going to be able to do the stuff that we're talking about right now if

1978
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:36,840
you're happy with what you think you have is happy or good enough.

1979
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:42,700
I'm not saying that everyone, this applies to everyone, but just about everyone, because

1980
01:34:42,700 --> 01:34:47,560
the voice that you hear and the thoughts that you have when you see something, go into a

1981
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:50,100
new situation or before you speak is not you.
