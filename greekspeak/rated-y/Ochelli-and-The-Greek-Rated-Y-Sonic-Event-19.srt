1
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:12,620
Sonic Event 19. Yes, it is 19. That's right. You never know quite what you're going to get.

2
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:18,220
And it's certainly not Forrest Gump's world. Welcome to it. And here we are. Greek, how are you doing today?

3
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:22,840
I'm doing all right. I wanted to say, you know, anybody who's been here for more than 15 minutes

4
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,660
should figure out what's going on here, meaning Earth, right, this world.

5
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:32,980
You ever hear me? I think I've that's part of the later Greek speak when I came up with the why bother model.

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,800
Right. You know, when I'm out in the public and they bring up a notion, you know, whether it's banking,

7
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:45,500
human body or, you know, any of the Greek speak points, all like 17 of them or whatever to someone in the public.

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:54,320
And they give me that look like they're contemplating. And before they decide too much on how much to contemplate,

9
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,740
I'll say, well, you know, anybody who's been on this planet for more than 15 minutes knows this. Right.

10
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,860
You've been here more than 15 minutes. And they're like, oh, what, what, what?

11
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,240
Is that the point at which you get the the the dog turn?

12
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:10,540
What I mean by that is, you know, the head kind of goes sideways and they, you know, did beers.

13
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:17,560
Yeah. But but here's the thing. I said, hasn't anybody have anybody use when they're older?

14
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,500
I always underage them. So when they're 60 or 70, I said, you're older than 35.

15
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,360
Right. And when they're, let's say, between 20 and 40, I said, you're more than eight.

16
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:31,300
You're older than 18. Right. The younger people, I don't mess with them that much.

17
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,920
And I don't get off on this, by the way. It's a part of my study.

18
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,060
You know, it's kind of like when you go out in the jungle and you study plants, you break off a leaf, put it in a book.

19
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:42,340
Right. You fold it to flatten out the leaf. Right. Preserve it. Dry it out.

20
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:47,380
So it's kind of like they cut their head off and I put it in a book, flatten it out.

21
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,340
Anyway. Well, that's one way of doing it.

22
00:01:51,440 --> 00:02:02,640
You know, I was taking a look at something my son was watching and he was watching a guy allow things to bite him and was a little confused by that.

23
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:09,840
And I said, well, you know, people always ask, what is the first thing they ask when they see something that's kind of dangerous or that they think is dangerous?

24
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,480
What happens if this thing bites me? So the guy showing you what else can you ask for?

25
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:22,380
And here's the thing is what I was going to address tonight is when you said your son, that's the sun in the sky. Right.

26
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,360
You get it. And you know how they say the son of God is the sun in the sky.

27
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,300
Anyway, you know, Maxwell, Bonacci, all these people, not to mention names. Right.

28
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,220
Talk about that. Right. You know how the diversion. Right. I get what you're saying.

29
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:40,380
Well, I do mean meaning Frankie, the child. Yeah, I know. But this is what people are being told.

30
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,900
You know, you meant no. Chuck really meant the sun in the sky. Right.

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,120
But you see what happens when you when you get people's attention.

32
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:55,460
You kind of manipulate it in a way that is not good for them, where I don't feel so bad telling people, you know, anybody who's been on this planet for more than 15 minutes knows this.

33
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,780
Right. You know, they're like, well, obviously, the guy, you know, they never say I'm crazy.

34
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:07,340
Sometimes someone will I'll catch them for my you hone in your peripheral vision from the side.

35
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:13,020
They were next to the person I'm addressing and they kind of walk behind me and they do the cuckoo thing with their finger around the head.

36
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:20,700
You know, I haven't seen that in a while. Yeah. Yeah. And the older usually the people that are older than 35 and I'll turn around.

37
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,760
I said, no, I'm not crazy. It just sounds like it. If you if you don't know.

38
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:34,840
Yeah. And the thing is to hone in your peripheral vision, because when you see magicians, you know, ledger domain, press the digitation.

39
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:45,180
It's even before you know how they do the trick, whatever the trick is, rabbit out of the hat, sawing a woman in half, whatever, whatever.

40
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:51,860
Yeah. Yeah. You see that they're overly gesturing for your attention in one way or another. Right.

41
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:58,480
With their hands and their body, the way they look, their facial expressions, it's like an over gesturing, like, look here.

42
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:04,680
Well, and here's the thing. If you don't look where they want you to look, you're still not going to see much.

43
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:09,820
But the whole thing is to keep you guided. So in case things don't go perfectly right.

44
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:18,779
Right. What I mean by that is if you look at how the news is being projected the last time, something that's still echoing, by the way, we're not going to go off on a tangent.

45
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:22,580
Like I saw I just went to the chat today. Sham on me. I haven't been there in about a week.

46
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:31,380
But you mentioned that Tucker boy or whatever, the 9-11 conspiracy denier or whatever, he he didn't get another job or anything like that.

47
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:36,660
It's all psyop. Right. You think I think you already know that. But he doesn't need another job right away.

48
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:45,220
Look, but here's the thing. He doesn't even exist. Him and his boss and everybody and all the computing, they all eat from the same dog bowl.

49
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:58,120
You know what I mean? So literally a dog bowl. So when they're and here's the thing, if he decides to go against whatever he'll when he goes to sleep at night, he's going to wake up somewhere else, if you know what I mean.

50
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,320
Yeah. So that's the thing. I don't think he's against anything. I think this is part of the plan.

51
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:11,300
Yeah. It's also it's all. Yeah, it's all. It's amazing. Where was I somewhere yesterday? I ran into a place that CNN on. I was like, oh, my gosh.

52
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:21,280
It's it's it doesn't matter. MSNBC also was in another place. I think it was a smoke shop or something. They put it on for a moment. It's and there's something that comes in.

53
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:29,860
You know how they say, be a good listener when people speak. Here's the thing. That's that's OK. Let's follow that real quick. Be a good listener.

54
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:35,640
So when the person speaks, you don't speak and you wait for them to say everything right. You just listen. Right. Supposedly. Right.

55
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:42,540
You know, that's like they talk. You talk. That's what a conversation is. Right. So but they want you to focus on what they're saying more.

56
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:50,940
Well, I when I say be a good listener is you have to be a good listener before they even open their mouth. In other words, reading people. Right.

57
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:59,480
And here's the thing. When you see what they put out in the public right now, it's so diversion and so far away from anything that makes sense.

58
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:07,040
It would be like someone doing hard drugs for the first time or a child puffing on a cigarette for the first time. It would be completely vile to them.

59
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:18,500
You know, right. They'd spit it out right away. So when you start to see things for what they really are, you you you start to see where you got to.

60
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:24,880
How did how did you get to that point? How can you see things for what they really are? Remember, it's still in time.

61
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:30,960
So when you start and as you progress, you get better and better, like going to the gym, right, or developing a muscle.

62
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:37,120
But the same thing, like the first day of the gym is just as important as where you are now. Three years later. Right.

63
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:46,420
It's just a everything stacks up one on top of the other. So when you look at all these subjects that are being brought up and one of the things I want to bring up, like I said, you mean the sun in the sky.

64
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:54,180
You're talking about the gods. Here's it in a nutshell. And this is this is where it's at. And this is where it's important about it.

65
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,900
So we're going to the more important part in the cell phone. So that in case we lose the signal later. Yeah.

66
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:05,320
OK. The most important part is it's part they're part of your education.

67
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,200
So if someone tells you to bow down to a statue that does, you don't get anything from other than bowing down.

68
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:17,640
Well, they've the next thing is, you know, it's like eating out of a spiritual doggy bowl. Right.

69
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:23,720
Basically, you know, but even the dogs, then they know you make that can, you know, the can popping sound.

70
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:31,800
They know they know enough that. Right. Or a certain bag crunching sound or whatever. It's it's on that level. Right.

71
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:40,680
So here's the thing. Who are the gods? Very simple. They they they each each group of gods has a name of their race, literally.

72
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:47,420
Right. And these were people that were around the everyday common or to met too many degrees.

73
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:53,400
They were sequestered. And just like a race that's gone away. Right.

74
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,560
When you say dodo bird or you say giraffe, you get a totally different feeling.

75
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,560
Yeah. One's a bird. One's a long necked animal that's still around. Right. There's the key point.

76
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:08,520
The dodo bird you get. Right. There's a certain tiger. There's, you know, the duck bill platypus.

77
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,740
I think they're still around. But some some just, you know, when you speak of an extinct animal,

78
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:20,600
you have a different feeling than one that still exists. Right. It's regardless of what kind of an animal it is.

79
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:28,280
So now I'm not saying that the gods are extinct. They're still extant, meaning around, but they're not mingling at all.

80
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:33,020
So the only thing that you have left is what do you get from them?

81
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:39,960
Now, if someone tells you to bow down or the Christians cross themselves, kiss an icon, light a candle, that's that's doggy bowl stuff.

82
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:47,000
You know, open the can, put it out. The dog eats it. You go out. That's basically how humans have, you know, from that perspective.

83
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:54,080
But in essence, what the gods are, they're in a systematic sense in human society.

84
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,840
They're part of your education. They're part of your legal system, meaning law.

85
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:05,360
Legal is all fiction, by the way, and presumption, which is OK to have, but it has to be substantiated in law.

86
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:13,100
And anyway, so so here's the thing. Your university, your education, your right or wrong morality,

87
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:18,740
which is your law and legal, basically presumption. If someone says, what if I do this?

88
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:23,400
You haven't done it yet, so it's not in law. Now it's legal. You know the ramification because it hasn't happened.

89
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,620
Right. It's in the fictional realm. That's what I mean by legal.

90
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:33,000
Your aspirations, where you draw your hope from and towards. Right.

91
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:37,160
It's called faith or the faith. Each religion has its own faith.

92
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:42,900
So you would say the Christian faith is the faith. The Jewish faith is the faith.

93
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,500
Right. Each one has the faith, not just faith. Right.

94
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:53,000
So where we're left right now is with a series of memorializations.

95
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,620
You'll pick your format, print or digital of certain information. Right.

96
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:04,720
Now, when you go to certain faiths, it'll be commentary by what people think it should be.

97
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,940
Right. Actually, all of them do that. The imams have the Muslim.

98
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:16,100
There's a there are more writings about the Muslim faith, let's say, that you're supposed to do as a Muslim in Islam.

99
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,800
Then you get out of the Koran. The same with Christianity.

100
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,840
I don't see anything the Christians talk about in the Bible at all. Nothing.

101
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:29,400
Zero guys. Zero. And if you don't see that, you're you're still doggy ball conscious.

102
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:37,600
There is in the Jewish faith, I would say one percent of what they do is biblical and close to zero.

103
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,260
OK. Islam as well, especially Islam.

104
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,700
But you've got to give more, quote unquote, credit to the Muslims than the Christians easily,

105
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:53,480
because at least the Muslims think you need to have a certain laws to follow, you know, permissible, not permissible.

106
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:59,380
With the Christians, anything goes right. You're washed in the blood of the lamb or you could do anything you want.

107
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,460
But, oh, you don't believe in that or you're going to hell. OK.

108
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,460
All right. But nothing. No reason at all. Right. Or just cross yourself, kiss an icon and whatever.

109
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,000
Eat a piece of bread, drink some wine and you're good. Yeah.

110
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,540
Is it Alpo time to even still have Alpo these days?

111
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:19,500
I don't know. I think so. You know, I got a quick question, though, because you said it's part of your education.

112
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,860
OK. The gods are part of your education. But that's a kind of a general sounding statement to me.

113
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,160
What do you mean specifically by that?

114
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,060
OK. You're breaking balls now, right?

115
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,960
No, I'm not trying to break balls. No, I got you. All right.

116
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:42,020
All right. What you eat. OK. What you get from your old Greek speak, old like from charity level Greek speak, you know,

117
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:48,080
would be what you eat, what you wear, how you keep time, how you do business, how you enter a relationship,

118
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,080
how you keep your house. All that comes from your God.

119
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,000
And the state and the colleges are going to provide that for you.

120
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,940
And they have a big statue of a goddess there to tell you where you're going.

121
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,940
They sure do. Yeah. So each one, everyone does.

122
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,480
So, yeah. So your education basically is all that.

123
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,340
Just like, for example, if you were raised by primates or apes, they would educate you very well.

124
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,040
This is how you scratch. You know, this is how you eat. This is how you sleep.

125
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:19,640
This is how you fight. And if you take that from your formative years to an adult, you will act just like they do.

126
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,900
Right. You got to groom each other. And this is how that's done.

127
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:29,220
Sure. So let's say education in a formal sense means some kind of formal training usually applied to animals.

128
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:37,720
What I say is your formative knowledge to your functional knowledge based in developing into your moral and ethical life.

129
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:43,280
OK. OK. What does that mean? You hear about these people that are like philanthropists.

130
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:48,140
I don't believe any of it, you know. But anyway, they make more money being philanthropists.

131
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,100
Anyway, I think I let me just say this is a slight tangent.

132
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:58,660
A billionaire wants to increase his business on a particular holding that he has.

133
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,020
So he's going to take a hundred thousand dollars out.

134
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:07,040
I'm saying, you know, credits to get a full page ad in The New York Times, which is, I think, two hundred thousand.

135
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,740
To promote his business. And I say, no, no, no, don't do that.

136
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:19,380
What you do is you make a big hoopla that you're going to show up one day and give a hundred thousand dollar check to this orphanage.

137
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:26,600
Right. And not just in New York Times, every newspaper that will get a hold that, sir, will print something.

138
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,660
May not be a full page, be maybe half a column, quarter column or whatever.

139
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,940
Right. OK. Two things will happen. You'll get in all the papers.

140
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:38,580
And the second thing is you're going to get more people thinking about you a certain way.

141
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,060
Because when you take out the full page, yeah, they're going to be some, quote unquote, people.

142
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,880
They say, look at this bastard, how much money they have.

143
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,100
You know what a full page ad in The New York Times costs. Right.

144
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,360
And they'll ignore everything you're doing.

145
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:55,360
So you'll actually get more profit, quote unquote, out of being a philanthropist, throwing away a hundred grand toward.

146
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,620
Right. Towards the orphanage, then towards the.

147
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,100
So that's what I mean by the moral and ethical life.

148
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:07,020
People, your moral and ethical life doesn't develop until you become like you go on your own, whatever that is,

149
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,020
until you're accepted as an adult, let's say, on the with a career.

150
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:15,040
When people ask you, when you see someone really young, they say, what do you don't say?

151
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,880
What do you do for a living? Right.

152
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:23,100
You presume they're in school, they presume they're living with their parents, you know, whatever. Right.

153
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:29,220
But when you meet an adult and more mature, you get to know them eventually.

154
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:34,220
What do you do? Right. You know, I mean, I'm in this. I'm in that. Right.

155
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:39,020
OK, that's your moral. That's where you that's when your moral and ethical life develops.

156
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,840
OK. And I mean that directly. So that your basic, basic, basic.

157
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,580
Hopefully you have humans that are well-cultured that show you how to wipe your bum when you're young.

158
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,640
Right. You know, girls always front to back and all that. Right.

159
00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:00,260
As a child, potty trained, tie your shoelace, how to act at the table. Right.

160
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:05,860
On and on and on and on. How to act amongst others within your culture, because it's different in every culture.

161
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,500
You have birthdays here where everybody goes and brings a present or a gift. Right.

162
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:16,100
Other birthdays in other countries and other cultures, you open your doors on your birthday, let's say,

163
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,500
and the village comes in and takes anything that they want from you.

164
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:24,720
Your house is. Are you familiar? OK. Right. I've heard of this. Yeah. Yeah. OK.

165
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,920
I don't think it's done anymore. But there's several cultures on the continent of Africa.

166
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:34,660
Yeah. Very different. Yeah. I was going to say, I'm not I'm not sure that's a current practice, but.

167
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,820
Yeah. Because they don't want their. You know why? Very simple.

168
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,360
One of the reasons would be that you could go and see these places.

169
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,980
Let's say they call them third world countries or whatever.

170
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,460
Or your ex-president called the third world shitholes or whatever.

171
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:54,160
Dirt floors, whatever, you know, they eat off the floor with it, you know, but they have stupid rectangles.

172
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:59,320
They literally do. Right. So I don't think, you know, hey, you got the latest iPhone.

173
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,100
Let me take. Right. They won't. You see, they're not going to give it up that easy.

174
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:05,760
So what the purpose of the gods is, is part of your education.

175
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:12,480
Now, also drawing faith and drawing hope on what you where to put your hope is another thing.

176
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:20,660
Right. And all these things. So all of the formulation that one can come up with has already been done.

177
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,560
When you have a comprehensive God that provides most of that. Right.

178
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:33,860
The problem with that is, is let's say you're not going to find more on this than in what they call the scriptures of the Bible.

179
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:39,960
More information on qualitative and quantitative application of everything I just said than the scriptures.

180
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:46,360
Now, if you go to, let's say, Tibetan Book of the Dead or something, there's quite a bit there to do on to help people pass to the other side.

181
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:50,060
Right. Well, you know, all these ceremonies all the way to a sky funeral. Right.

182
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:54,380
Would basically lay the body out, let the vultures eat it and the Bardo. Right.

183
00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:04,579
All this other stuff. Steiner wrote some things I cursory went over about, you know, when people die, they're still kind of around, you know, a little bit.

184
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,780
You know, they're fading out. Right. It's kind of like burning on a TV.

185
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:14,859
You turn off the TV and the room is dark enough. You can still see the last image that was on there burned in slightly. Right.

186
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:20,780
Yeah. Old TV used to do that. Yeah. Yeah. Sort of like that. But that's another discussion.

187
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,359
So the ultimate thing here is to understand that you're dealing with a culture.

188
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:31,720
And by the way, they're people. Right. People have a hard time. Right.

189
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:38,640
When I say the gods are human. Right. But they're not human as you consider a human.

190
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:45,460
Just like how many people would consider someone that was raised by gorillas human. Right.

191
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:52,600
Most wouldn't believe it or not. You know, if you got to know them, of course, you don't know them.

192
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,980
You say, of course, they're human. But when you got to know them, they would be more happy if you kept.

193
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:04,540
You would be a lot happier if you just put a leash on them and kept them outside for a few days till you figured out what the hell you're going to do with them.

194
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:11,280
Yeah. Because they're going to come inside and jump on the table and poop and hang from the chandelier.

195
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:15,100
What you decide to call human is based more on the way they act, I guess.

196
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,280
Yes. OK. Got you. Exactly. Civil. Because they'll get.

197
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,000
And this has been justified. Just genocides have been justified this way, that they're not human anymore.

198
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,920
So it's OK to gas them or kill them. Right. Right. This is how you justify an illegal system.

199
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:32,880
You know, if you don't have attorneys, it won't happen. So here's the thing.

200
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:39,140
Many people are curious about certain characters in the Bible, the Christ or Yahweh or whatever.

201
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:48,480
You know what? Put that aside. What are you going to this because you think there's some like playing the lottery or something?

202
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:56,820
Or are you going to this because it's in vogue, because it does get in vogue every 40 or 30 years as a movement, right?

203
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:03,120
Biblical, conservative, biblical movement. Right. Right. To use the names and, you know, church is bad and all this.

204
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:06,100
Right. Or what? Right. What why are you going to it? Right.

205
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:15,020
If you're going to it because you are looking for, you know, they say there's got to be a better way.

206
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:22,460
Right. Yeah. Then you're on the right track. But then you have to get how are you going to get something out of it?

207
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:27,380
Because you're not going to see common modern things in society in there.

208
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:33,820
Generally, there's no iPhone in the Bible. Right. There's no airplane in the Bible, directly speaking or anything like that.

209
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:42,040
So it's going to lean more towards your basic formative way of how you keep time, how you live, what you eat, how you keep a house,

210
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:48,140
how you do business with who you associate with. And then it jumps over to your moral and ethical stance in life.

211
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:54,220
Right. Not in between, you know, stuff and your technology. OK.

212
00:19:54,260 --> 00:20:02,160
The other thing about the Bible is it's very egocentric. It speaks from the God's perspective and it's mostly about the gods.

213
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,640
Right. So when it says knowledge will increase, people think, oh, yeah, knowledge because we have the Internet.

214
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,740
No, no, no, no knowledge. It's about everything's about the God. So it says knowledge will increase.

215
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:22,640
It means the knowledge of the gods will increase. Right. So when you have these nouns and what do you call pronouns that seem general?

216
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:28,200
They're not. There's no generality there. It's very specific if you understand it's about them.

217
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:33,920
Right. So the best example I give is people will travel to and fro and knowledge will increase.

218
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:40,480
Oh, that's happening because of the Internet. No, no, people are actually less knowledgeable because of the Internet.

219
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:46,020
Sorry. Unfortunately, much dumber. Yeah. Less literate as a mass, as a group.

220
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:52,560
You could see that by all the reports they do with what they call public schooling, which we know has an alternative agenda.

221
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,780
But yeah. So. So they're not. So it's knowledge of the gods.

222
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:01,980
So whenever you see these general words, right. Hunger, knowledge, hate, good, love.

223
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:08,340
All that has to do with the gods, not with each other, unless it's not paraphrasing and it's more direct.

224
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:16,280
Right. It'll say like the the Hittites are back in there and they hate the the other guys, whatever.

225
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:22,140
You know, if it's specific like that, then it's specific. So when you start putting these things together,

226
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:30,180
what you're going to get is who are the gods? Is this God better because he's a redhead?

227
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:36,240
Right. Versus this God who's short and fat. Right. That's not.

228
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:42,400
No, it's what they're telling you to do. Right. And does it qualitatively get better to make your life better?

229
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:47,160
Just like the previous examples about the actions you're taking. It's about the things you're doing. Right.

230
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:54,820
I mean, yeah. So. So like let's say you spend like I spent 20 years knocking my head against the wall like everybody else.

231
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,300
And I read this thing in scripture and it says, don't knock your head against the wall.

232
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,180
And now I'm not knocking my head against the wall. You know what? My life is going a lot better.

233
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:08,620
Better. OK. OK. You see the example. Oh, come on, man.

234
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:14,160
I think you read it wrong because everybody's knocking their head on the wall for eight hours a day or 10 hours a day.

235
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,860
What's wrong with you? You know, you're you're you're one of those extremists.

236
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:23,440
I'm telling you, man, it really means don't knock your head on the wall and you'll feel a lot better. Try it.

237
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:28,660
You know, I don't know about that. You see, I'm giving that analogy because that's how simple it is. Right.

238
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:36,940
So who are the gods? It doesn't matter until you get to where you're putting your hope and getting your idea of what you should have hope in.

239
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:44,520
Then it starts to make a little bit of a difference, but it's still based on your what they're giving you to substantiate as base knowledge.

240
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,780
Now, I call it doggy bowl. Consciousness is in the world right now.

241
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:56,220
All the way across with anything. Right. Science, religion, everything.

242
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,260
You know, I was talking to someone recently about relationships. Right.

243
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:06,040
About one of the most ridiculous is they have these relationship therapists.

244
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:10,000
You go to as a couple. Yeah. Whatever. Yeah. No idea what they're doing.

245
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:17,760
Not a one of them. Not because they first of all, it wouldn't make sense to tell people the truth of how to be in a proper relationship.

246
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:22,700
Right. It's very simple to do, by the way. I think we kind of went into it in a lengthy thing.

247
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:28,860
But basically the one you're equal in a relationship, not one over the other.

248
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:41,540
Sometimes you might want to be because let's say the guy is 250 pounds and 2 percent body fat, which means he's like built like Arnold Schwarzenegger and the woman's 90 pounds and a big couch needs to be moved.

249
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,620
He's going to do the brunt of it. Right. He's going to be carrying it from the middle and she'll be balancing the end.

250
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:53,440
It wouldn't be fair to have them do the lift 50 50. Let's just say the fitness level corresponds with their size.

251
00:23:53,720 --> 00:24:06,120
Right. Right. So in some cases. Right. But the people in a relationship must have the ability to objectify is who is better at what within the relationship and not trying to one up each other.

252
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:14,740
Right. Right. So and to confide. So in other words, you have instead of carrot soup, you've got carrot and celery soup.

253
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:24,440
Tasty. Much better. Good combination. Right. You see. So they come together to to become greater than than they were apart.

254
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:29,760
So that instead of one plus one to make the relationship, it's not two, it's four, five, six, seven.

255
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:38,820
But if you come together, what I see is people you have one and one come together to make two and then it becomes one point eight, one point five, one point three.

256
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:44,080
You see, because they're not adding up. Well, but that's the thing. Look, it's by addition.

257
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:54,980
I've tried to have this conversation, had this conversation many times in many different relationships where it's like, look, this is something that I'm better doing.

258
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:59,940
So therefore, this is the thing that I should be doing. You know, it's just that simple.

259
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:09,740
And it's almost confusing to some, you know, look, if this is naturally, it just makes more sense for me to do this part and more sense for you to do that part.

260
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:16,420
OK, you know, I've got the visual problem, so it doesn't make any sense that I should be relying on for transportation to drive a car.

261
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:23,060
It's not sensible. So a partner of mine knows that they're going to have to do that part, you know.

262
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:26,580
No, no. But it's more than that. So you said doesn't add up. But you see, nature doesn't add.

263
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:32,060
Nature multiplies. You notice I didn't go. I said one plus one is not two. It's four, five, six, seven.

264
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:38,960
Yeah. So it multiplies. Think about cats and bunny rabbits. What do they add up or do they multiply?

265
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:45,660
I mean, like crazy. Right. So the intent and the workability should do the same.

266
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,720
But here to go back to the gods, it's also I'm going to say it's a personal relationship.

267
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:54,140
What are you getting out of it? Oh, I just believe. OK, doggy ball time. Right.

268
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:59,800
Yeah. The big kennel, the church. Right. Whatever. And they know this, by the way.

269
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:04,060
They the the mid-level is their academia, priests and all that.

270
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:12,660
They're there to protect what I'm saying. In other words, the leaders of these organizations, governments, science or whatever, deplore the people.

271
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,220
They hate the people and they have the mid the mid-level group, mid-level management to be a buffer between them.

272
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:26,900
Right. But when you're around, let's say a high level, whatever, bishop or finance person or whatever, they'll tell you.

273
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,640
So, yeah, people are basically stupid. They'll tell you that.

274
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,700
But, you know, when they're on CNN or Fox News, they won't say that.

275
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,200
There was a time when do you remember when Obamacare came out?

276
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:43,700
The guy who head off the committee to structure it. So why so complicated?

277
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:48,420
Why? Why so much? Why is it so expensive? It's basically the American people are too stupid to understand this.

278
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:53,900
He wasn't talking about Obamacare. He's talking. This is a financial, the financial system thing, you know,

279
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,800
because people don't understand that the money comes from your signature.

280
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:03,100
And when they want to do things to for the interest of the United States, which is not United States, it's not what you think.

281
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:13,200
Right. So in Mexico, when they say Mexico, anyone federal says Mexico or anyone federal says Russia, Putin or anyone federal says United States.

282
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,540
It's the district within the country, a foreign district. Right.

283
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,680
So basically what he meant by the people are too stupid.

284
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:25,640
So they don't know that the money is drawn from their signature. And we as a corporation, which is that capital, they believe they worship us.

285
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:32,160
How do we know? Well, look, we need a bunch of their funding, their credit, and we need to get their signatures.

286
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,960
And we're just getting creative on how to get their signatures. Right. The IRS is the same thing.

287
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:41,460
You know, people say, oh, you pay taxes. I don't know anyone who's ever paid taxes.

288
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:50,540
Never. But I know that if you endorse credit instruments, you're going to have to file a report and then give a return.

289
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,280
Oh, yeah. That's paying taxes, is it? No, that's not paying taxes.

290
00:27:55,620 --> 00:28:01,660
You're using private credit. You're going to make a report on how much credit you use and then file a return.

291
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:09,160
Isn't that the same thing? I said, no, if you go and borrow a tool rental tool from the tool rental shop,

292
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:14,960
you just bring it back a few days and wave goodbye. No, you got to pay a fee for using that.

293
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:19,860
Right. That's what it is. I don't understand. Good. You'll be a good citizen, good resident.

294
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:25,980
Pat him on the back. Have a nice day. You know, this is this is the same thing with the gods.

295
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:33,560
Right. And here's the thing. You know, I say the anyone who let's go back to the scripture for a moment.

296
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:37,480
I've been saying this for a long time and I wasn't saying it public.

297
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:43,060
Like I wouldn't say a guy nailed to a cross wearing a diaper is what they show Christians, you know, because it sounds kind of crazy.

298
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:47,940
But no one ever said you're insulting my God, you know, because I'm not saying it to insult.

299
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:51,480
I'm just saying it to awaken you. But here's the other thing that I've been saying.

300
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:55,520
The most hateful bar none bar none. Most hateful character.

301
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:00,040
Literally what's written, what he said in the Bible is the Christ.

302
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,360
And all that lovey dovey stuff is all in private.

303
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:11,700
A lovey dovey stuff would be like you recording you and your best friend from the third grade and your wife.

304
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:18,020
I'm not talking menage a trois, but I'm talking about like someone you really, really care for in private.

305
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,300
In a relaxed sense is what people are taking applies to the public at large.

306
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:32,580
Where if you take what the Christ said to the public at large and the general groups around him is so hateful, so hateful and so dismissive.

307
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,480
And it trumps anything, anything I've said anywhere else in the Bible.

308
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:44,240
So we're talking about the population is completely demented to think the opposite.

309
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:48,800
Right. And where does it say that? Sometimes people say you have to show me more.

310
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:55,520
No, I'm not showing you anything because if you're not going to do your own research and if you don't know it well enough, then there's no reason to talk about it.

311
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:58,440
Well, a suggestion about where somebody could find that, though.

312
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,860
Oh, every all the red letter, all the red letter.

313
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:06,300
A suggestion would be all of the read all the red letter in the King James.

314
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:11,440
But when you read the red letter, read do me a favor and read a few verses before for the setting.

315
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,940
Right. Not when he's sitting in there in his cozy little room in a house.

316
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,800
They were in a house here with his disciples.

317
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,800
No, that doesn't count. That's the lovey dovey.

318
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,320
Read about where he was around the groups of people.

319
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:28,500
Right. And we're not talking about the beatitudes where those are.

320
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,140
Those were different. That's a very small exception.

321
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,320
You know that the meek will inherit the earth and all that. Right.

322
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,800
OK. OK. Even then it's like, oh, wait a second.

323
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,880
You know, those are pretty strong.

324
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:42,600
But the personal ones, the woman at the well, the rich man, the Pharisees, all these things.

325
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,980
Oh, my gosh. No one's ever said anything like that to anyone in Scripture.

326
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,680
Very, very hateful. And I mean, hateful.

327
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:57,940
All of the everything that he says in public and private is completely misunderstood by ninety nine point nine nine nine nine percent of the people have ever read it.

328
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:03,100
It's it's unbelievable how this has been misinterpreted.

329
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:08,840
Actually, not interpreted at all. It's been opinionized because it's good for business.

330
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:13,780
You know, I had the Jehovah's Witness come to the door and she had a Bible out.

331
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,640
And I said, oh, it's like a baseball bat. You know, are you playing baseball?

332
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:22,000
She goes, well, you know, I said baseball's baseball bats.

333
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:26,920
Ninety nine percent of baseball bats sold are not playing baseball because they make a good club.

334
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:30,360
Right. Everybody's got one behind the seat or behind the cashier.

335
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,140
You keep one next to your door just in case. Yeah.

336
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:39,500
And so that Bible is not being used for a show talking about what's in it because you don't know a thing in there, do you?

337
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:47,780
Right. You know, as a response, you know, sometimes you got to do that once in a while.

338
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,480
And there's sometimes say no one's ever told me to tell this.

339
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,300
I'm not saying I'm saying this to help you because I know you're not going to hear this from anyone else.

340
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,620
How do I know? Because the planet full of morons with little exception.

341
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:01,820
The exceptions are so little. It's a real teeny, teeny, tiny bit.

342
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:06,140
The exception is so small that you won't even you won't see it.

343
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,680
So anyway, I like when people tell me. So are you.

344
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,200
So you're saying you're not a moron. I said, well, what do you say?

345
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:18,580
And they never say you're a moron to none of them. So anyway, that makes me feel feel OK.

346
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,720
That's where people challenge. You just pull what the Christ said.

347
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:25,460
What do you say? I am. They say that you're king of the Judeans.

348
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:29,300
What do you say? I have no answer. All of these things.

349
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,060
So so here's the interesting part about all of it.

350
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:41,020
Have you ever heard of. Well, the one room schoolhouse, we suggested that the biblical text was a book that was already available.

351
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:44,640
Books are still very expensive, especially in a rural community.

352
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:49,560
You know, when I ship something, I guess I'm naive when I ship a pair of loudspeakers to someone.

353
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,460
It's like one hundred and fifty or two hundred bucks. Not that heavy. Twenty pounds.

354
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:55,080
OK, like, oh, my goodness is so expensive.

355
00:32:55,540 --> 00:33:00,920
But it's not really because think about driving them over the fifteen hundred miles, how much gasoline and time.

356
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,980
It's cheap, but it's still expensive when you think about it.

357
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,960
You know, an insurance and all that. It's like a ship out of Paris.

358
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,480
Two hundred bucks. Oh, my goodness.

359
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:13,780
Well, it's a lot cheaper than if you had to go through all the process yourself, you know, and actually, OK, I'm going to take this.

360
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,800
You get books to get books to a rural area.

361
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,960
No matter how much you thought was expensive at the post office,

362
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,020
it took a long time and you didn't have access.

363
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:25,520
The post office refuses it. We don't ship this because we don't have them.

364
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,420
We have a carriage. It's muddy. It's raining. And we have a horse.

365
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,600
You know, when it's raining, the carriage can't carry that much.

366
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,320
Right. You know, the wheels will sink into the.

367
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:39,740
So it was very, very, very, very, very, very good at a few more varies expensive to move things around.

368
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,940
So when you had these Bibles in one room schoolhouses,

369
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:47,420
it was not only the education because it was the written word, as they call it,

370
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:51,260
but it was also part of the context and the subject matter as well.

371
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,700
You see. And right now it's not being done that way.

372
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:58,120
Now it's all about you got to believe, believe, believe, believe in the doggy ball.

373
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,880
So and, you know, very, very interesting.

374
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:10,639
So who are the gods? Irrelevant. But if you decide to focus on one, just like literally taking a picture, what do you do?

375
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:14,159
Oh, it's out of focus. No, put it. Let's focus. You take a picture. It's out of focus.

376
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,719
Reject. Reject. Right. Right. OK. Well, once you get it in focus,

377
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:24,719
you better figure out if you're focused on which which got which version of that God.

378
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:30,980
Are you getting the misidentity? Are you getting the Osama bin Laden who's been killed two or three times already?

379
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:35,260
You know what I mean? Right. You get it. Or the guy who was the CIA agent.

380
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:41,699
And the reason he died of kidney failure is because he got Western medical treatment that his family advised him not to.

381
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:47,320
Which one? You know, you see what I mean. And the one who was interviewed after 9-11,

382
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:52,900
he says, this is not a terrorist act, as you're being told. This is some group that runs your government.

383
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,580
Right. That made it to the news, by the way. And also, you have a lot of fake news.

384
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,720
Do you know? I don't know if you remember. There were reports that an airplane crashed into Camp David on 9-11.

385
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,060
You know, do you remember that? Oh, yeah. Well, Camp David.

386
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:10,420
Plus, they said that there were bombs that were set off on the ground in different places.

387
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:16,140
Yeah, there were that were that were found later. But yeah, exactly. So where's the one?

388
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:22,680
So they had it all pre scripted, ready to go. Many, many things. So what are you focusing on?

389
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:29,660
You see, or do you see 9-11 as a textbook nuclear reactor, which it is a textbook?

390
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:39,880
You know, there's nothing to ponder textbook, basic textbook physics, but not the textbook they have at college, by the way.

391
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:50,460
So so here's the thing. When you when you focus, let's say, let's look at the Buddhist genre.

392
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:56,660
It was a skinny Indian guy, man. Right. From India. Right. Not this fat guy. Right.

393
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:02,200
You see what I mean? And he had followings and disciples and all this stuff. Not this. Right.

394
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:06,360
That's another one. That's another. So you keep going on and on and on and on and on.

395
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:14,960
You better identify and figure out what your identity, what you're what you're looking at, you know, because it's not going to be served up to you.

396
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:18,720
And that's the that's the easy part. Believe it or not. Why is it easy?

397
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:24,300
Because whatever you're being, whatever they're telling the masses, it's not for sure. Right.

398
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:29,640
It's the opposite. But which opposite. Right. And then you've got to focus in on your own.

399
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:36,940
And this is the part that the let's say, again, I always compare religions and the biblical stuff to any stuff to 9-11.

400
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:43,460
It's perfect because it's backwards. So what they do is they set up alternative groups right away to mislead you.

401
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:46,180
What is it called? Counterintelligence, whatever coin Intel program.

402
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:54,040
So if you know there's going to be a counter group to something, you set up the counter groups and have them fall into the predetermined package.

403
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:58,160
Right. So you control your position because you control it all that way.

404
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:01,880
Because someone who does have the proclivity to go into an opposing viewpoint.

405
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,740
Well, they already have some of these groups available to them.

406
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,680
So, oh, well, that's all right. Then we'll go. Yeah, exactly.

407
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:14,340
They're total cookie cutter. Yeah. So the people will say it on the surface.

408
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,080
Oh, yeah. They're opposing the official story. So do I. So they're going to go with them.

409
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:22,220
Oh, I don't think they're right. Maybe this other one is. None of them are right. None of them. Zero.

410
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:28,580
So the easiest part is to figure out that what they're telling the masses is not true.

411
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,540
That's the easy part. But then it gets easy again.

412
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:36,660
Once you see the alternatives are also part of the same thing. Yeah. Right. Yeah.

413
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:40,360
All right. And then it gets easier because you're doing process level elimination.

414
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,540
So the alternative group says it was a super weapon from space.

415
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:48,280
Oh, great. It's not in the official story. But that's bullshit, too.

416
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,940
So now we could scratch that off and on and on and on.

417
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:55,480
So this is how you look at biblical stuff, Quranic stuff.

418
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:01,320
But by the way, you know, 99 percent of Christians, if you tell them you're a staunch literalist of the Bible,

419
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:06,080
they they don't like that at all. Right. The same with the Muslims in Islam.

420
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:12,440
They actually have a term for it. I forgot what it was that if you if you do what's in the say what's in the Koran,

421
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,780
you're like you're actually it's punishable almost to the point.

422
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:21,520
I don't know about now, but mid 20th century, it was almost to the point is if you were Protestant in a Catholic Europe.

423
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:27,980
Right. You know, it was punished. Right. Also. So, yeah, it's really bad.

424
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:34,540
But it's not so bad if you're going for it for the right reasons, which is to get knowledge.

425
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:43,460
Right. And what I'm talking about applies to point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one percent of the people.

426
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:47,520
So that's OK. And I don't think they've all subscribed here yet.

427
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:53,180
But either way, it applies to those people. So it's all about knowledge.

428
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,140
When you get knowledge. Here's the thing.

429
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,380
If someone gives you an idea of what to put your hope in, meaning future,

430
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:09,440
and you have no knowledge of them, the subject matter or anything, how and you you you think you're well invested in that.

431
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,400
How well is the turnout going to be? Well, it's 50 50, isn't it?

432
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:20,600
Well, it's a lot more than 50. It's more complex. Look, how reliable is the individual anyway?

433
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:24,360
You know, how about you know who the individual is and what where this is coming from?

434
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:32,300
You know, so you got to know what what what what their proclamation is based on, don't you?

435
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:37,900
You got to know what it's based on. So, yeah. Let's go back to the biblical nomenclature.

436
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:42,560
OK, there's a lot of knowledge in there. It's about knowledge. He gives knowledge.

437
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,400
There is. It's about knowing. And it's also about knowing.

438
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:52,900
And did I mention it's about knowing. Right. Yada Yada.

439
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:58,900
It would be Hebrew for knowledge or knowing. It's here.

440
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:04,400
Let's just say even though the Jewish culture is one percent biblical or two percent. Right.

441
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:13,520
Do you know that one of the main things in, quote unquote, Jewish culture is it's very important next to food and water,

442
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:20,180
food, clothing and shelter isn't is to be educated, but not what what the collective is getting right about their own culture,

443
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:25,300
but specifics on how to do business, how to keep a house. Right.

444
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:30,440
You know, we think we brought up to the Syrian Jewish in Deal, New Jersey earlier.

445
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:36,800
Very much so. They're orthodox, but they don't appear to be like, you know, the cultish black and white.

446
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,160
We weren't recording at that time, but yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

447
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:46,500
So but the education, in other words, going to even today, what they call yeshiva or shul. Right.

448
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:52,000
The education is far better than any of the private schools that you get otherwise.

449
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:58,580
But here's the interesting thing. They're still teaching a lot of BS, 98 percent BS.

450
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,420
That's not you won't find in the Bible.

451
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:05,620
I've run into some people that were when I was living out in California for a short time a decade ago,

452
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:10,040
there was a very religious Jewish man, his wife and a newborn baby.

453
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:14,220
And every morning he would see him running down the steps, going to the temple,

454
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:20,000
which was a block or two away to to pray for an hour and then come back.

455
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:23,900
And I said, well, you know, my prophecy is, oh, yeah, prophecy.

456
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:28,680
Yeah. Elijah is going to come down from heaven and he's going to bring the temple, the temple.

457
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,680
You mean the building? Yeah. From heaven. And they're going to land it right on your head.

458
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:35,600
Right. I said. And before he finished saying that, I said, right on your head, that's not in Scripture.

459
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,980
Oh, it is. It's in Isaiah. So it's not it. Where? Where?

460
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:47,660
Well, you see, this means that this means, oh, I see, because the car is red and the apple is red.

461
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,540
The apple is a car. I get your I get it.

462
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:57,500
So so this is what they're this is what their strong education system still leads to crap like that, you see.

463
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:02,180
So I'm not I'm not condoning and saying, yeah, the Jewish people know they don't.

464
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:05,620
I feel sorry for the efforts that they make to stay.

465
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:10,820
So let's say rigid within the confines of excelling scholastically,

466
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:13,540
because they are very rigid about excelling scholastically.

467
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:18,860
By the way, the Asian, the Asian-Americans that come here are like that with their children.

468
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:24,620
You know, if you're there's a lot of funny car stuff on YouTube, you might find the Chong brothers or something.

469
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,060
What's it like growing up with Asian parents?

470
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,060
If you could catch that video, it's kind of funny.

471
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,960
You know, they come home and it's look at the report card.

472
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,900
A, A, A, A, A, B, B, this one you got B.

473
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:42,480
You disgraced the family. Right. You know, it's like they're very, very harsh.

474
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:49,020
Right. Also, but even then, scholastic with all that.

475
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,400
That's what I mean. Rigid like that.

476
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,940
But it's still a waste of time because they're telling you, you know, to go into medical school.

477
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:57,220
They believe actually the body is absorbed.

478
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,720
They don't even see what's in front of them.

479
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:02,060
They're still in this, but it's in their culture to be rigid scholastically.

480
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,040
You know, so you see this in every culture.

481
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:12,000
So, again, to go back to the gods, whichever religion, quote unquote, you find rubs you the right way.

482
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,220
Go see what it's based on and what that's based on and what you're supposed to do in there and how much information is there.

483
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,500
And you'll see there is a group of beings in there.

484
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:21,360
If you can properly identify them.

485
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:25,080
It's in the text, by the way, just like 9-11.

486
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,140
It adds up, for example, it's called Ground Zero.

487
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,580
Look up the word Ground Zero.

488
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,640
What does it mean? Right.

489
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,260
Just look it up.

490
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,940
It has to do with nuclear atomic.

491
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:38,140
And then start looking at, you know, how is it 3000 degrees underground for so long?

492
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,400
Molten rock and molten steel for a month.

493
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,460
Oh, OK.

494
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:43,040
So everything adds up.

495
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,520
Right. So when you start.

496
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,120
Let's say you find a religion that rubs you the right way.

497
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,460
Find out who the gods are and see.

498
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:53,100
Forget about what their little pictures and things are showing you.

499
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,320
What are the characteristics of this entity?

500
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,020
Add them up.

501
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:58,840
Right.

502
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:06,280
And then you're going to have to do it from your peripheral because what's easy to focus on is some picture or icon or image in front of you.

503
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:10,860
So you've got to do it from the peripheral, you know, which is what your safety relies on.

504
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,200
And then see what kind of knowledge base.

505
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,780
Does it tell you how to keep time?

506
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:15,300
What to eat?

507
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:15,820
What to wear?

508
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:16,620
How to do business?

509
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:19,680
You see?

510
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:21,000
On and on and on and on.

511
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,060
How much stuff can you find in there?

512
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:26,140
And if the answer is no, it's none of that Greek.

513
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,000
It's about faith.

514
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,460
I got alpo.

515
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,120
I got purine.

516
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:29,860
I got dog.

517
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:30,640
I got dry.

518
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:32,700
Someone says, you know, their cat ran away.

519
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,780
I said, your cat ran away?

520
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:34,060
Why?

521
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:34,800
What did you feed him?

522
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,200
What did you feed him?

523
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,040
Good cat food.

524
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:36,780
Dry or wet?

525
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:37,660
Dry.

526
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:38,000
Ah.

527
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,320
That's why they left.

528
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:40,660
You got to give them wet food, man.

529
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:41,560
Right?

530
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:49,000
So they have the wet food version is, yeah, we have really good prayer session or really

531
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,040
good Bible study or really good festival.

532
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,540
The Greek churches do the festival.

533
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:52,820
Right.

534
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,120
Whatever, right?

535
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:56,620
You know, that's the wet food, you know, part.

536
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,760
So, you know, here's the irony of it.

537
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:03,180
The local Greek church, they have a raffle, right?

538
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:03,440
Okay.

539
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,080
And it's a statue of Zeus they were raffling off.

540
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:07,240
And my wife and I were cracking up.

541
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,080
I wouldn't go there.

542
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:08,680
It's disgusting.

543
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:09,300
Go to a place.

544
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:10,460
It's perfect.

545
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:11,540
That's hilarious.

546
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:12,980
It's perfect.

547
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:13,800
It's priceless.

548
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,540
These people are so stupid.

549
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,060
Don't even bother with it, you know.

550
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:22,380
It's that they all had stupid tattooed on their forehead in white or whatever color skin they

551
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:22,600
had.

552
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:23,460
You know, you couldn't see it.

553
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,960
You needed the glasses to see it, right?

554
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:25,380
Okay.

555
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:29,060
No statue of the guy in the diaper.

556
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:29,980
Yes.

557
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:30,760
No, no, no.

558
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,240
Well, they all wear one on their neck.

559
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:32,680
Right.

560
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:33,600
But here's the thing.

561
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:34,980
And oh, my goodness.

562
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,480
This is not just them.

563
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,280
It's all of it.

564
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:41,240
Go down to any government building, right?

565
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:42,500
Even the attorney general.

566
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:44,840
Have a discussion with the attorney general about something.

567
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,260
You know, if you keep talking about this, you're going to go to jail.

568
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,480
That's all you can say.

569
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,660
He doesn't know anything about law at all.

570
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:51,340
He can't.

571
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:54,040
They're just there working for the bankers to intimidate people.

572
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:55,100
None of it.

573
00:45:55,260 --> 00:46:01,060
It's a shithole of a place when you try to put things together with rational logic and

574
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:04,360
people saying, oh, the recent thing with the pandemic with science.

575
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,240
Well, science is based on logic and reason.

576
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:09,060
And when you have a science with no logic and reason, it's not science.

577
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:10,300
Right.

578
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:10,860
Very simple.

579
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
You don't even have to go.

580
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,300
So you live in a situation like this, but take advantage of it.

581
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:17,040
Here, I'll give you an example.

582
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:17,800
Okay.

583
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:18,800
You have the moral.

584
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:19,800
I've mentioned this before.

585
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,420
You have a moral and ethical decision on what you're going to do.

586
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:28,060
Now, there's something in scripture that says if an animal dies of unknown causes, I'm paraphrasing

587
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:29,560
here, don't eat it.

588
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,280
You know, like roadkill or sick animal.

589
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:31,640
Right.

590
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,920
Because you have no idea what's wrong with it.

591
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:34,980
What's unclean.

592
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:35,940
It has to be killed.

593
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:36,440
You know.

594
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:36,740
All right.

595
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:39,860
So if it dies, it's more than just pathological.

596
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:41,780
There's a spiritual element to this.

597
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:41,980
Right.

598
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:42,680
Just like water.

599
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:43,080
Right.

600
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:48,400
But what you do when you find the animal, you sell it to the pagan for a profit.

601
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,380
Let him eat it.

602
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:52,920
Doesn't say give it to the pagan because he's hungry.

603
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:53,700
No.

604
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:55,580
You sell it for a profit.

605
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:56,960
Right.

606
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,540
Let him eat it.

607
00:46:59,180 --> 00:46:59,620
Okay.

608
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,160
I could see that.

609
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:01,920
Right.

610
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:03,320
I wouldn't do it.

611
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:03,900
I can opt.

612
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,340
It doesn't say you have to do it.

613
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:09,000
But I'd rather bury the thing.

614
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:09,660
Right.

615
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:09,900
You know.

616
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:12,640
It should be buried.

617
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:13,240
Or whatever.

618
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,340
Or actually feed it to other animals.

619
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:16,620
Or whatever.

620
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:18,280
But I wouldn't really go that route.

621
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:19,580
So you also have that route.

622
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:20,600
You see.

623
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,240
It's voluntary.

624
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:21,760
Right.

625
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:23,360
You see.

626
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,380
You can pick and choose.

627
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,580
But you can't cherry pick.

628
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:27,000
You can't insert things.

629
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,860
You can't insert things that are not in there.

630
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,800
And you can't fragmentize it and change it.

631
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:35,140
So now it becomes something else.

632
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:36,320
Right.

633
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:40,100
You can't just take a part of it and say this part of it says this.

634
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:41,340
Right.

635
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,940
Now you've twisted it into something else.

636
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:44,140
Right.

637
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:45,760
You can do that with a chocolate chip.

638
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:51,700
You can take a chocolate chip recipe out of Betty Crocker recipe book and turn that into a Bible, into a religion.

639
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:52,960
You just take pieces out of it.

640
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:53,240
Right.

641
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:56,040
It's got the hot fire in there.

642
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:56,460
Doesn't it?

643
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:57,020
It's got the hot fire.

644
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:57,540
Right.

645
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:58,580
It's got the heavenly part.

646
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,560
You know, the heavenly hot.

647
00:47:59,640 --> 00:47:59,740
Right.

648
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:00,320
They've got all these.

649
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,600
You just take words from here and you piece it together.

650
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:05,260
It sounds like something out of the Bible if you do that.

651
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:05,520
Right.

652
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,720
So you can make the.

653
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,600
You've seen the edits years ago.

654
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:10,500
I remember the first one with Reagan.

655
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:14,460
They did an editing with his voice.

656
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:14,940
I forgot.

657
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,080
It's Air Force One.

658
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,820
It's a disco group from very obscure underground.

659
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:25,640
They took Reagan's voice and it started with a heavy, like 120 beat per minute house beat.

660
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:28,280
And it goes, I've got my finger on the button.

661
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:29,360
Feel the heat.

662
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,040
See the light.

663
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:31,840
Nuclear war with Russia.

664
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,800
I've got my finger on the button and it's Reagan's voice.

665
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,560
They just kept editing and splicing it until they got him to say what.

666
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:38,240
You see what I mean?

667
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:41,300
There's a whole bunch of YouTube channels that do that with all kinds of stuff.

668
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:41,820
Yeah.

669
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,420
It's been done since the 60s, 70s, 80s.

670
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,860
It was kind of interesting.

671
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,920
So this is what the religions are doing.

672
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:50,680
Away from all of it.

673
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:54,100
Once you understand what's in the text.

674
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:54,820
Now, here's the thing.

675
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,800
There's another thing about the veracity and the origin of all this.

676
00:48:58,880 --> 00:48:59,860
It doesn't matter at this point.

677
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:00,640
Do you know it?

678
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,040
Like, for example, if you switch over to fictional genre.

679
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:06,920
And let's say we're going to do a study on Moby Dick.

680
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:07,580
Okay.

681
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:12,720
We're doing the purpose of the investment of time and effort is to study this book.

682
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:13,900
It's Emerson, I think, right?

683
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:20,760
Moby Dick and all the grammatical and mechanical mechanisms used.

684
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,620
And now let's say we want to create a screenplay or whatever.

685
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,160
And you have some idiot in the background saying, but it's fiction.

686
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,460
Oh, yeah, we know that already.

687
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:31,240
We're not here to get that it's fiction to the public.

688
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:33,200
We're here to get the story out to the public.

689
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:33,680
Right.

690
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,920
So when someone says, well, the Bible was really written by – that's okay.

691
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:40,900
We just want to see what's in it first to criticize it.

692
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:41,320
Right?

693
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:42,300
We want to see what's in it.

694
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:42,940
Is it usable?

695
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:44,560
Is it substantial?

696
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:45,800
You see?

697
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:49,760
And if it's usable, it's usable.

698
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,080
If it's not usable and it's not – then that's the second part.

699
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,340
But you have to know – right?

700
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:57,400
There's Gulliver's Travel.

701
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:01,700
When he went to the Lilliputians, one of these little people –

702
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:06,320
Well, there's many – look, there's actually more than one story in Gulliver's Travels.

703
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:09,760
But the most famous one is when he goes to see the Lilliputians, which are small.

704
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,200
Lilliputians.

705
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:13,800
Well, they tell him about the moons of Mars, which were not yet formally discovered.

706
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:14,520
Right.

707
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:15,600
Are you familiar with that?

708
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:15,940
Yes.

709
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:18,700
They described the two moons of Mars in detail,

710
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:22,900
but yet they were discovered 20 or 30 years later by the scientific community, let's say.

711
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:23,560
Right.

712
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:23,880
Yeah.

713
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,200
So you have stuff embedded in there everywhere.

714
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:28,540
The thing is, do you know it?

715
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,240
And the thing is, I don't need to know it.

716
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:31,740
I just believe.

717
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:34,620
Well, there's lots of dog chow for that.

718
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,900
And you think about dogs.

719
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:36,480
You know, they fight.

720
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:37,320
They pee on everything.

721
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:38,760
You know what I mean, right?

722
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:39,060
Yeah, yeah.

723
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:44,580
And actually, I'm denigrating dogs, too, by comparing these people to them, by the way.

724
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,680
Nothing, you know, but anyway.

725
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:54,160
Gulliver's Travels is interesting, though, because here you go,

726
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:57,680
a lot of people reference it and have never bothered to read it.

727
00:50:59,540 --> 00:50:59,940
Anything.

728
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:00,560
Yeah.

729
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,300
And that's just typical of the whole thing.

730
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:04,540
This is exactly what goes on.

731
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:09,040
I mean, look, I'm willing to bet that the majority of people that are listening to us right now,

732
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:12,620
don't remember who the Ho Hoiams were in that story, right?

733
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:15,440
My memory serves.

734
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:17,080
That was the horse people.

735
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:19,500
He ended up with horse people, too.

736
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,580
In what context?

737
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:27,800
Well, he ends up on another island, another place, another travel, and yeah.

738
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:28,680
Oh, that's right.

739
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:30,560
That's right, because he's going.

740
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:32,660
It's more than just three places, right?

741
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,280
Yeah, but during his travels, he encounters really interesting, you know,

742
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,140
people that are completely different.

743
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,040
And people have gotten into the metaphorical reasons for it and whatnot.

744
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,980
But the point is that, yeah, okay, it's a fictional story.

745
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:49,000
But at one point, he comes across a society of horses, basically, that are, you know,

746
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:52,100
able to speak and this and that, right?

747
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:52,980
Mr. Ed.

748
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:55,860
Well, kind of like a Mr. Ed sort of thing, but.

749
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:57,360
Yeah, but not in a stable.

750
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:58,780
They had a formed society.

751
00:51:58,900 --> 00:51:59,920
Yeah, a whole society.

752
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:00,360
Yeah.

753
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:05,920
So just to go back to the gods, it's a matter of preference in what you get out of it.

754
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,620
I've run into a lot of people.

755
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:15,820
That's why I'm diminishing on the discussion of the gods more and more on them specifically.

756
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:23,040
And I'm more focused on what people have gotten or what they think they can get out of it, right,

757
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:26,740
from a knowledge base that they could yet use.

758
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:31,100
Because I recently had a Skype discussion in a private, small Skype group.

759
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:31,680
Okay.

760
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:35,640
And I was like, I want to talk about how Yahweh is a man.

761
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,600
But he's not a man as we are men genetically also, but he is human.

762
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:43,720
And the conclusion at the end was that he's not.

763
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:50,780
But the hour that we spent bringing it up is all of the points, especially like in Exodus 15.

764
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:52,020
Yahweh is a man.

765
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:56,940
He is a man of war and uses the word ish, right, which means man.

766
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,260
It's not metaphorical.

767
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:02,300
And I kept bringing up all these other things, you know, like all the visitations

768
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,800
and how he has doppelgangers and on and on and on.

769
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:11,740
And suddenly, no matter how what you show or talk about,

770
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,400
it still goes back to somebody like Zeus sitting on a throne.

771
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:18,100
It's very hard to break that, right, that image.

772
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:23,580
Which, by the way, Zeus sitting on a throne was a man, by the way.

773
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:25,360
It was a group of the Olympiads, right?

774
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,840
They were descendants of the Titans.

775
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:32,880
If you want to get a cut and dried version, which I don't really endorse,

776
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:40,680
listen to Jason Breshears of Archaics on what were the ancient gods from the Greek and all that.

777
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:47,860
And I said similar things with Seth Michael 13 years ago on Revolution Radio late at night.

778
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:52,760
You know, these were kings, men of renown, right, these Greek gods.

779
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:58,480
They would be considered like Elvis Presley, you know, kind of, but not a musician,

780
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:04,560
but a physical prowess, mental capability, you know, far superior.

781
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:05,240
They were men.

782
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:10,280
There are many places where it's documented like they didn't know if Zeus was a Minoan king

783
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:14,040
or he was a king of some other extraction.

784
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:17,300
But he wasn't a king because he didn't sit on a throne.

785
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,700
Other people said he sat on a throne.

786
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:22,020
Other people said he tried to live in his own settings.

787
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:25,180
So there's much on that, but Jason Breshears of Archaics,

788
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:31,900
but he puts out things that are not where they're not really so.

789
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:36,640
He's borrowing still from religious BS and making it a fact.

790
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,740
So I don't endorse it, but it's fun to look.

791
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,180
Here's the thing.

792
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:43,260
If I'm in the shop or I have speakers wired here everywhere

793
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:46,380
and I want to put on a YouTube about something, history, whatever, and I have them on,

794
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:50,840
it's a lot better than most of the others that you have out there, not to mention names,

795
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:55,100
and I won't mention names, which I end up yelling at the speakers.

796
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,120
I'm like, I'm not that stupid.

797
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,080
So at least get some chronography correct.

798
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:07,460
But I don't endorse them by any chance.

799
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,460
I don't subscribe or I wouldn't send any newbie there.

800
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:11,660
I mean, go ahead and enjoy it.

801
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:12,640
It's fun to listen to.

802
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,100
It's Texas country meets the Internet.

803
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:17,060
Have a good time.

804
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:20,180
Yeehaw, and it'll be fun.

805
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:21,860
And you'll get some good stuff.

806
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:25,100
What I got out of him is a 138-year cycle.

807
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:25,800
Close enough.

808
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,440
It winds up pretty well.

809
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,760
So if you want to get a roundabout thing, he's got a thing called the dark scriptures,

810
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,080
which I don't endorse.

811
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,700
The stuff that he talks about is just not found anywhere.

812
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,200
It's just commentary that someone wrote, so so what.

813
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:46,040
You can take a commentary on a movie review and make that as gospel.

814
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:46,680
That's fine.

815
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:50,240
You watch the movie and you're like, I don't know what movie that reviewer watched.

816
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:50,780
It's similar.

817
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:56,940
So either way, we're in a tough spot with all that stuff.

818
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:03,720
But when people say, give me your statement of faith, I'm an Old Testament kind of guy.

819
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,800
Write me down your statement of faith.

820
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:12,080
Somebody wanted me to do a talk show once because I called in and broke down the nail to a cross,

821
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:14,720
wearing a diaper, that didn't happen, and all these other things.

822
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:19,760
But if you're acting like your kindergartner is eating from a doggy bowl, you're never going to see this.

823
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:24,700
You're going to have to grow up to eight or nine or 12 maybe years old, clean yourself off,

824
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:30,260
brush your teeth, and then go back into the text as if you're reading your older brother's college book,

825
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:33,140
from that mentality, and then you'll see it.

826
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:35,060
It's in your face.

827
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:40,880
So I want a statement of faith, so I'm an Old Testament kind of guy.

828
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:45,980
And I just put in writing, I'm an Old Testament kind of guy.

829
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,880
They never got back to me.

830
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:53,300
I was like, no, I don't sit there and say I believe in one J-E-S-U-S and this and blah, blah, blah, blah,

831
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:55,480
all that stuff, two old beef patties, special sauce.

832
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:57,160
It's a mockery.

833
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,940
Have you accepted Christ as your one true Lord and Savior?

834
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:02,520
Which one?

835
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:04,660
Because even if you read Scripture, there are many.

836
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,480
Some are false and some are minor.

837
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:13,520
And then there's one that is claimed to be out of a certain lineage.

838
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:18,900
When these Christians come to me and say, do you believe in J-E-S-U-S?

839
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:26,080
I'm like, you mean the one that was talked about by the prophets, the Psalms, and Moses?

840
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:28,020
Huh?

841
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:29,940
What?

842
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,040
I mean, that's what the Christ said.

843
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:36,560
He says, if you want to know who I am, read Moses, the prophets, and the Psalms.

844
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,180
So I just use that on the Christians.

845
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:41,560
You mean the one that, well, there's only one.

846
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:42,940
I'm like, oh, okay.

847
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:45,720
There's only one for everyone, isn't there?

848
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:47,340
Yeah, anyway.

849
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,600
So, yeah, it's pretty interesting.

850
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,260
What do you get out of it?

851
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:54,480
It's all knowledge-based.

852
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:59,640
By the way, you know, just about every story that you see biblically done in any movie,

853
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:02,400
biblical movie, is false, every single one.

854
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:07,280
I think we, just real quick, you know the woman being stoned,

855
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:11,680
the Christ is sitting down and he's writing with his finger in the sand,

856
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:15,060
and he says, whoever is without sin throw the first stone,

857
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:16,820
and they all drop the stones and walk away.

858
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:19,740
And the Christians think, oh, he's so kind and loving.

859
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:22,160
No, nothing to do with that.

860
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,600
You could take it that way.

861
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:24,780
Take it that way.

862
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,840
You get some candy, too, if you take it that way.

863
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:29,140
Right?

864
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,100
Good boy, good girl.

865
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:33,040
But actually he was a stickler about the law,

866
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:36,920
and in the law you need two witnesses.

867
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:38,280
There are obviously more than two.

868
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:45,500
But in the law, you know, the two witnesses, you have to be a qualified witness.

869
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:51,800
So what I mean by that is like if you have outstanding parking tickets, right,

870
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:55,680
or a warrant, you can't qualify.

871
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,800
I'm using modern-day legal terms here.

872
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:58,520
Right.

873
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:01,160
With the temple, you don't qualify.

874
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:07,380
So without sin, right, meaning you don't have any warrants or outstanding tickets,

875
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:10,460
and they all said, oh, we all have, you see, so they all drop their stones.

876
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:15,900
And also the ones that witness against throw the first stone,

877
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:17,600
that's what he meant by the first stone.

878
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:20,780
You see, you have to have a qualified witness.

879
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:25,000
So twice, without sin, meaning you have no outstanding warrants or tickets,

880
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:28,920
and in order to throw the first stone, you may have to be a witness, right?

881
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:30,720
Okay, because the witness has to throw the stone.

882
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:31,340
Okay.

883
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:36,500
Strictly from the law, if they did, okay, stone the bitch.

884
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,980
If they did, you see what I mean?

885
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:45,420
If it was the other way around where they had no outstanding parking tickets or whatever,

886
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:46,840
you see what I mean?

887
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:48,440
Because he said sin no more.

888
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:52,200
So actually people see the biblical law as being harsh,

889
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:53,640
but it has a lot of loopholes.

890
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:57,800
In other words, you could be seen by a lot of people doing something,

891
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:03,860
but if they had outstanding warrants and parking tickets, you can't be stoned, you see,

892
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:04,940
according to the law.

893
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:08,220
So you had a lot of people actually, people thought it was brutal.

894
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:12,500
Yes, it is brutal once it is, what's it called, procedure is applied.

895
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:13,020
Right.

896
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:16,520
But it was very difficult to provide procedure.

897
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,100
You could actually set it up.

898
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:19,120
You want to do something.

899
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:22,840
Let's go here where we know these people have outstanding warrants and tickets.

900
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:23,820
Let's do it right in front of them.

901
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:25,040
They won't be able to stone you later.

902
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:26,880
Okay, bet, let's do it.

903
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:28,440
And guess what happens?

904
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:32,160
You get off scot-free because those people get checked out and they know they can't stone you.

905
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:33,920
They can't throw the first stone.

906
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:34,640
They can't commence.

907
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,460
You can't have somebody willy-nilly say,

908
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:41,540
if the people that witnessed against you don't throw the stone,

909
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:43,760
it doesn't matter how much the others want to stone you.

910
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,980
You see, according to procedure it won't happen.

911
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:48,420
So people don't understand this.

912
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:49,280
They don't get it.

913
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:54,460
And don't ask me where it is in the scripture because you're just disqualified just by asking that, right?

914
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:55,460
It means you don't know it.

915
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:56,460
So step off.

916
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:57,140
Watch Netflix.

917
01:00:57,940 --> 01:00:58,200
Right.

918
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:06,620
What I would suggest, also, do you know when there was no witness and a woman was accused,

919
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:14,440
you wrote the law down and you put it in water and some bitter water.

920
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,320
It was called dust from the floor.

921
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:17,200
Okay.

922
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:20,520
And if she drank it, this is like a sorcery, right?

923
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,900
This is in the law.

924
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:27,020
And if she drinks it and loses the loss of her legs, she's guilty.

925
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:30,340
But if she drinks that and she's accused, this is the accused,

926
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:36,260
and she still has power in her legs, she's innocent of the charge or the accusation.

927
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:38,360
That sounds like magic to me.

928
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:39,740
It does.

929
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:40,420
Yeah.

930
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:41,320
It's in the Bible, right?

931
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:41,580
Okay.

932
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,240
But it's approved, right?

933
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:46,040
Here's the thing.

934
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:50,600
If you are to slaughter a lamb, a goat, or a pigeon or a dove at the temple

935
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:53,840
and pour its blood, et cetera, et cetera, if you don't know what I'm talking about,

936
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,740
you could find it in there just like you find everything else I'm saying.

937
01:01:57,060 --> 01:01:57,180
Right.

938
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:58,160
Right?

939
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:02,020
What's the difference between that and some voodoo lady cutting the head off of a chicken, whatever?

940
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:02,880
What's the difference?

941
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,420
It's an animal being slaughtered, right?

942
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:07,140
It's who you're doing it for, right?

943
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:07,860
Right.

944
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:08,760
You see?

945
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:10,340
It's the same thing.

946
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:12,660
When you see there's a bunch of references, too.

947
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:16,580
You know, okay, so you're supposed to offer up a ram and this and that and the other thing.

948
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:18,240
It's an animal being slaughtered on an altar.

949
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,120
It's voluntary.

950
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:20,460
Well, here's the thing.

951
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:21,820
Okay, what do we see objectively?

952
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:25,240
Let's say you're up in high altitude and you're looking down with a camera.

953
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:30,340
You see some people slaughtering an animal here in a ritual in the temple, let's say, for Yahweh,

954
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:35,680
and over here you're seeing a bunch of people slaughtering an animal for some other whatever voodoo thing.

955
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:37,140
What's the difference?

956
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:42,280
The only difference is slight procedure difference and who they're doing it for.

957
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:55,420
Right, but if you're misidentified, okay, so all of this stuff comes together based on how you want to live your life, basically.

958
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:56,500
It's very simple.

959
01:02:57,060 --> 01:02:58,140
It's very, very simple.

960
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:01,520
All of it comes together when you go on your own search.

961
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:02,520
There's so much.

962
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:04,080
This is a little bit of synchronicity.

963
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:05,820
You know what's been coming up to me lately a lot?

964
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:10,600
On the radio, on the computer, in print, being out.

965
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:15,200
I even saw it on a billboard about five times this week, maybe more.

966
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:16,620
I have to say it.

967
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:18,020
It's not getting there.

968
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:20,360
It's the journey that matters.

969
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:22,760
You know that, right, the cliché?

970
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:23,360
Oh, yeah, yeah.

971
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:27,060
It keeps popping up everywhere around me for the past, let's say, week.

972
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:28,760
What does this mean?

973
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:34,580
Everything that I've said is paraphrasing that.

974
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:38,580
You better find out what you want to do.

975
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:41,400
By the way, there is no conversion in the Bible.

976
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:47,500
There's no missionaries to go out and convert anyone, and there's no racism either.

977
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:56,580
In other words, it states that if some foreigner, sojourner, whatever, not you, your people, come in amongst you.

978
01:03:56,580 --> 01:03:57,540
I'm paraphrasing.

979
01:03:57,740 --> 01:03:58,860
Your camp or your nation.

980
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:05,380
And they become educated on these things, and they want to do it, right?

981
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:09,980
And they pledge to doing this, let's say, have allegiance to this way of life.

982
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:12,800
You treat them as one of your own.

983
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:16,120
It doesn't say just because they're this or that or whatever.

984
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:17,000
There's no conversion.

985
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,300
You don't go out and tell people, come here, blah, blah, blah.

986
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:22,700
They have to be free.

987
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:25,700
They have to pick it up on their own, do it on their own.

988
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:28,480
You'll offer if they ask, but you don't put it on them, right?

989
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:29,120
Right.

990
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:31,500
You see, Christian missionaries, what the hell?

991
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:32,900
Where'd you get that?

992
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:34,940
It's totally separate.

993
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,320
Completely different thing, right?

994
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:38,600
The Mormons, they send out missionaries.

995
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:39,640
There's no missionary work.

996
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,460
None, none, none, none, none.

997
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:48,900
And then they say, oh, based on the Christ, you know, after the Pentecost, which is not Pentecost, by the way, right?

998
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:51,440
It's seven weeks plus 50 days, by the way.

999
01:04:51,440 --> 01:05:04,880
Anyway, to the 3,000 people, that was to let them know that the Christ has come to spread the news that the resurrection has been proven.

1000
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:07,400
Not to start a religion or anything.

1001
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:09,560
Why bother?

1002
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:14,120
So, in essence, it's all about knowledge.

1003
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:18,720
Why do you think, here's another description, another sideline comment.

1004
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:19,000
Ready?

1005
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:19,440
Okay.

1006
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:26,500
When education is removed from society, I'm not talking about BS education, but real information.

1007
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:28,060
Real information.

1008
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:35,860
It's a society unto godlessness, meaning they're removing knowledge, meaning they're pulling you away from, quote, unquote, the gods.

1009
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:36,560
Right.

1010
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,920
The society that goes closer to knowledge gets closer to the gods.

1011
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:42,220
Very simple.

1012
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:44,340
Has nothing to do with faith or religion.

1013
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:50,680
Those things exist just like anything else exists, any other social mechanism, right?

1014
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:53,580
And it's the journey.

1015
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:01,780
I give hints, and I'm not reading into it.

1016
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:04,140
I'm reading out in a purist form.

1017
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:11,060
So, you know, it's like when I go buy certain supplies and the supply is out.

1018
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:15,380
I'll ask, when will you get it in and can I order some before I go for an alternative?

1019
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:17,020
Right?

1020
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:17,920
You see my point?

1021
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:20,080
Because there might be a compromise.

1022
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:21,180
I'm not familiar with it.

1023
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:25,260
So, the more you get familiar with it, the easier it is to get familiar with it.

1024
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:35,000
In other words, when you start going into a gym or any exercise, even mental, if you're not used to reading, when you start reading again, it's difficult and it's slow.

1025
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:38,000
But the more you read, the faster you read and the more you can read, right?

1026
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,720
You go to the gym, it's difficult.

1027
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:43,980
But the more you go to the gym, the more you want to go to the gym and the more you can do at the gym.

1028
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:44,800
You see?

1029
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:46,840
It becomes easier.

1030
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:51,900
The spiritual stuff is the same and it all has to do with knowledge.

1031
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:53,840
And, yeah.

1032
01:06:54,540 --> 01:07:05,440
So, if it says don't bang your head on the wall and you stop banging your head on the wall and tell other people you don't bang your head on the wall anymore and they laugh at you, well, you're going to have to make up jokes about banging your head on the wall.

1033
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:06,300
I don't know.

1034
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:07,400
Everyone's got their own thing.

1035
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:09,180
But, again, paraphrasing, it's the journey.
