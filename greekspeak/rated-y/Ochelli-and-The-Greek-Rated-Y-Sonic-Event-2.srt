00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,260
Welcome to Sonic Event number 2 of Ocelli and the Greek Rated Y.

2
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:29,240
Obviously I'm Ocelli and the Greek is with me today and we are going to discuss quite

3
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,280
a few things, I think.

4
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,320
We're going to have to start with a little bit of a review, I guess, from Sonic Event

5
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:42,140
number 1, where the introduction, I suppose we could say, to the concept of the soul,

6
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,220
the spirit, and, well, let's see, the soul, the spirit, and the body, right?

7
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,280
That would be the three things that we were discussing when we closed out last time, Greek,

8
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:51,780
is that right?

9
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:57,940
Sure, and these three things are towing, have a multiple of other things in tow, let's say,

10
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:04,500
and we're going to be a little forthright about certain of the things because telling people

11
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,740
how things are makes some people kind of standoffish, but if you give them hints, they don't get

12
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,140
the hint.

13
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,480
So, there's somewhere in the middle between hitting someone over the head with it and

14
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:21,840
being very indirect about it, there's something in the middle that gets to people.

15
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,100
Very often I brought up, I had discussions with people I've known for years and they

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:31,220
come to me with some situation and I said, well, do you remember we talked about this

17
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:31,500
and that?

18
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,300
Did you try that?

19
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,900
And they're like, yeah, I do remember that.

20
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,060
But no, I didn't try that.

21
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,020
And I'm like, well, if you don't try it, what can you report?

22
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,820
So you have to have a workable knowledge, I guess I would call it.

23
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,000
Wouldn't you say that's workable knowledge, right?

24
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:51,320
Workable knowledge, well, what can you use is usually the big thing, right?

25
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:56,400
Because after all, look, I could explain to you how to travel in a rocket, okay, let's

26
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,720
say, theoretically, I can't, but let's say I could.

27
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,400
You know, how to travel in a rocket to Mars, but if you don't have the things around you

28
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,700
to work with to get there, I mean, it's kind of pointless.

29
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:08,320
It's a theoretical exercise.

30
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:08,420
Sure.

31
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:14,980
Well, the irony there is the people that say they've been in rockets and left the atmosphere

32
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,420
or whatever, still can't explain it.

33
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,760
That's the irony of it.

34
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,300
So even though they've, anyway, that's another story, right?

35
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:26,720
Well, yeah, we could talk about Captain Kirk and, you know, going up in the-

36
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,740
That's a little better.

37
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,340
Now you're talking.

38
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,740
That's a lot more fun anyway.

39
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:38,580
But all right, anyhow, it's a practical knowledge because, look, this is something anybody could

40
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:46,720
access because anyone, I assume, that is hearing what we're saying has access to a spirit,

41
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,640
a soul, and a body, because otherwise, you know, well, maybe, okay, go ahead.

42
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:58,080
No, of some quality and, you know, forgive me, I might be going on for a while on some

43
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,440
of these concepts, so don't fall asleep on me, you know, because some of these concepts

44
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,860
are, like I said, these three things, the spirit, which is the mind, what makes you

45
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:14,420
you, the soul, the metabolism, which is the breathing and all the bodily functions, the

46
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:18,360
energetic functions, the animating functions of the body, and then there's the body, the

47
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,540
actual shell itself.

48
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:24,880
They have a lot of various things in tow, meaning you cannot talk about one without

49
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,640
bringing up these other aspects and also how they all work together.

50
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,160
You see, essentially, what I'm trying to say is we're in an environmental suit that has

51
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:42,840
a, basically, we are the spirit, and the environmental suit is the body, and the status of that environmental

52
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,320
suit is the soul, the metabolism.

53
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:51,440
I like using the word metabolism, because people already use that word when they get

54
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,720
into, let's say, discussions about how they feel or how things work biologically.

55
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,760
So, it's interesting, though, because the use of the word metabolism up to this point,

56
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:06,420
I guess you sort of have to reset that, because generally, I would lead to the idea this is

57
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,680
how you metabolize things, and this is how you, now, here we go.

58
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,959
Well, actually, if you actually look up the name on how it's being used and what it really

59
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:21,300
means, it's slightly different, but I like to use it because it kind of connotates that

60
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,720
you're going to be talking, it's slightly technical and a little more in depth, you

61
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:25,900
know?

62
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:32,440
Well, right, but the generally accepted concept, right, you metabolize things, convention says,

63
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:39,000
you metabolize by absorbing, and there you go, there's a problem there, so could you

64
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,260
maybe give us, I know we've discussed it before, but how about we go back over that, because

65
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,200
I think it's important.

66
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,940
Yeah, well, here's the thing, like I said, I might run with this a little bit.

67
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:58,940
We kind of try to drive home the distinctions, but if you're in an environmental suit, you

68
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,580
look at sci-fi, you know, they look at their wrist and they have the little screen that

69
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,900
tells them the status of that environmental suit, you know, whether they're low on oxygen

70
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,940
or whatever, you know, in sci-fi, you've seen it all the time, they've got the visor

71
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:16,900
on and all this, that, and the other, essentially, we are in an environmental suit, and we would

72
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:25,120
be the mind, the spirit, who we are, it's very distinct, again, and I keep repeating

73
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:31,880
this, and the battery level of the suit is the soul, the breath, because even in sci-fi,

74
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,840
if you damage the guy's or the gal's suit, what happens to them, right?

75
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,380
They suffocate and die, so there's that aspect, and then there's the body itself, the carne,

76
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,520
the actual vehicle, which, you know, what's that movement called, transhumanism, where

77
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:53,000
they're going to get you with machine and all that, so mixed with machine, that's still,

78
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:58,820
believe it or not, I'm not for it, but that is still a viable body, so, right, and I've

79
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:04,220
talked about consciousness transfer, this is more on the, let's say, esoteric side, technology

80
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:10,980
to transfer consciousness has been around, and some of these things that I speak on,

81
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,360
that I borrow from science fiction, believe it or not, I don't want to come out and say

82
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,600
that they're not really science fiction, it's a form of disclosure, to give a quick example,

83
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,780
we mark things in time, and on the last Sonic, we talked about, when you're made aware of

84
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:32,120
a concept, whether it's social, technical, religious, whatever concept, imagine any subject,

85
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,780
it doesn't matter in cosmic theory or cosmic law, whether it's marked or categorized as

86
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:44,720
fact or fiction, did you get the concept, right, so, if, you know, let's say, remember a long

87
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,580
time ago, there was a B movie called Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, right, it doesn't

88
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:55,080
matter if it's fact or fiction, now you have this concept of killer tomatoes, right, so

89
00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:00,840
this is what I mean about from the cosmic point of view, it's beyond, it's imagination and

90
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,520
all these other things put together that form reality anyway, ask any inventor, right, so

91
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:12,720
does that relate to the fact that often we see things imagined in science fiction and

92
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:19,020
literature well ahead of them actually existing in the 3D world, you know, like you brought

93
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:24,060
up the wrist, immediately my mind jumped to, yeah, at some point though, somebody created

94
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:30,220
like this Apple watch, right, where it now monitors, you know, these different things

95
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:35,240
that your body's doing supposedly and it tells you, now I know, I know I'm gonna say

96
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,840
a bad word here, but, yeah, I know, I know what you're gonna say, but say it, go ahead,

97
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:44,500
it's supposed to monitor your blood pressure and your heart rate and all these things, I'm

98
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,300
just telling you what it says, now it is doing something, but it is born of the concept that

99
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:55,680
was initially imagined, you know, and wasn't part of the reality as far as I know, when

100
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,620
they would show people looking at their wrist to find out what their status was, how much

101
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:05,560
oxygen they have, what their heart rate was doing, et cetera, and then we saw it incrementally

102
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:11,240
come into play, like maybe somebody saw the movie Apollo 13 supposedly based on real events,

103
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,400
right, where they were monitoring from a distance what the condition of the astronauts was,

104
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:23,280
these things came into existence, so to speak, over time, but at a certain point, everything

105
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,920
is actually imagined before it becomes reality, right, I mean, an inventor says, I want to

106
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:35,020
do something, and they are inspired to do it, and then they attempt to take the physical

107
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:41,559
world and manipulate it or form that idea into the physical reality, so this is, you

108
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:44,580
know, people act like they're shocked when they go, well, that was imagined in something

109
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,580
before, and I go, but everything is, you know?

110
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:53,140
Yes, but also from knowing many inventors, many meaning more than, I have fingers on

111
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:57,740
my hands, I do have all the fingers, by the way, when you find out the real story, see,

112
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:04,520
we're told that these inventors are clear, great thinkers, and I'll tell you from their

113
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:09,540
own mouths what I've heard in many fields, their inventions were actually accidents,

114
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,100
they weren't trying to do that, or, you know, it just came about, and they happened to notice

115
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,280
it, other people had done it, but they were the first ones, let's say, to run to the patent

116
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:25,640
office, right, with it, but what I wanted to mention also was, you know, you hear about

117
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:31,460
in American schools, especially Columbus sailed the ocean blue, whatever, 1492, right?

118
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:37,020
Well, that didn't make it to the history books until more than 200 years later, so what was

119
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:42,140
going on in the 10s, 20s, and 30s of the last century is not in the history books right

120
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,520
now, right?

121
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:49,060
So they, those that know what happened and have not disclosed it, show it to us through

122
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:55,000
science fiction, they invented science fiction in the 50s, but what you do is you exaggerate

123
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,680
it, so it's in the realm of entertainment, right, but it's also a form of disclosure.

124
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,440
The other thing is the, you brought up the Apple watch, and yes, the bad word of blood

125
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,800
pressure, blood pressure is a misnomer, it's actually measuring the interval between, let's

126
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:19,400
say what they call a heartbeat, but it's all on the wrong track, what they're monitoring,

127
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,380
for example, with nutrition and calories.

128
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:27,660
Calories are not relevant to nutrition unless you're pooping charcoal, right, because a

129
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:32,440
calorie is derived from burning something completely down into carbonization, so unless

130
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,320
you're pooping charcoal, I think we've gone over that with the old Ocelli in the Greek

131
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,440
stuff, irrelevant, now I wonder how much of that is deliberate to put up irrelevant stuff

132
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:48,820
like diabetes, for example, blood pressure, calories, all these things, and wait a second,

133
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:53,520
someone said diabetes is irrelevant, my dad died from it, he had to cut off his leg and

134
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:59,760
all that, yep, it is, there is no, the pancreas are not an independent organ, just like the

135
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:07,140
rear view mirror is not independent of your car, really, that whole function is a bad liver

136
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:13,860
function, and you have diagnosis, and also they have no way to really diagnose blood

137
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:19,640
sugar, look it up, it's kind of hard now with Google and all that, by the way, who

138
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:26,380
is Gug, see, because El, you know, a lot of Mikhail, Raphael, is a Hebrew term, El meaning

139
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:31,580
Elohim or God, or a God, you know, that's the name of their society of gods are the El,

140
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:39,540
so who's this God Gug, like Gug El, right, you see what I mean, anyway, it's a Hebrew

141
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:46,300
deity of some sort, but here's the overall analysis that I've come up with to get to

142
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:51,680
the end, what you are engaged in in this society, you meaning the collective, not necessarily

143
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:58,300
those that are listening to us, but they've come from the collective most likely, and

144
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:03,360
you're now separating yourself from it, because of its lack of quality or what have you, everyone

145
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,920
has their own reasons, nothing that the collective approach has approached as being significant

146
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:13,800
or important or would deem improvement is going to be for the next society, all that

147
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,280
stuff will, like I said, there will be no blood pressure, blood sugar, calories, all

148
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:24,320
that stuff's going to be, that's just a big foolish, how would you say, it's a category

149
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:32,520
of nonsense, right, now calories can be used in laboratories or whatever, but not, has

150
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:36,740
nothing to do with food, the diabetes, the blood pressure, all that is complete nonsense,

151
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:43,300
and you could go down the line on how they invent diseases, by the way, doctors do, and

152
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:48,760
I hope people have woken up from the pandemic, they strap people that, anyway, they have

153
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:53,920
to show numbers, just like 9-11, if they left the people, if they told everyone to come

154
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,320
out of the building, it wouldn't have been such a bad event, right, so you leave people,

155
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,340
so if you tell people there's a pandemic and people are dying, well you've got to supply

156
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:06,920
dead people, right, and the other thing I want to mention is when you read about death

157
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:13,400
camps, whether they were in Europe, Cambodia, or wherever, it was always run by doctors,

158
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:23,040
always, so the whole thing about the doctors inventing, in other words, I've got direct

159
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,740
knowledge of this from many people, they have a, work for a big company, very expensive

160
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:34,280
health plan, the doctors say, hey, let's prank this person, and tell them they got tested

161
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,700
for cancer and they have cancer, so they go for some therapy, you know, a quarter of

162
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,100
a million dollars a month or whatever, right, just to get the insurance money, I'm serious,

163
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:47,460
this is more common than not, it's just not known, and when you, and it's always inconclusive,

164
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:55,360
it's like, yeah, it showed inconclusive, some cells showed up at the blood test, but it's

165
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,380
very serious, you should consider therapy, and the people, of course, you know, they're

166
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:05,520
in the upper part of the collective, you know, they got a quarter of a million salary with

167
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,980
a three million in health insurance, they're going to go for it and they get ruined, and

168
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:14,120
the doctors get it from their society, so the other thing before we get into this, it

169
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,500
seems like we're leaning towards the medical thing, I don't know if you guys are familiar

170
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:22,760
with the Flexner Report, early 20th century, between 1902 and 1910, that's when they decided

171
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:27,020
to standardize allopathic medicine, and one of the things in the Flexner Report, and listen

172
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:34,140
to this carefully, is that only accepted scientific practices will be applied in the medical field

173
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:40,480
in 1902, is what the Flexner Report said, alright, it sounds very innocuous or whatever,

174
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:48,440
I'll say it again, only accepted current scientific methods will be applied to the

175
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,920
medical industry, okay, it's 1902, 1910, between that time period, alright, stop and

176
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:58,060
think for a minute, that sounds very harmless, right, how much, so what did that do to medical

177
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:58,440
research?

178
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:04,300
It actually doesn't sound harmless to me, but because, yeah, it says no more, there's

179
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,940
no medical research anymore, no more medical research because, it's not established, stop

180
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:14,240
here at this time, right, I mean, unless I'm hearing it wrong, okay, right, exactly, so

181
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,480
when they tell you they're doing medical research, and you look into it, there's nothing

182
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:22,020
there, because they actually, they have not improved some of the practices here and there,

183
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,720
and it is true, I do know several people that worked in emergency medicine, and they had,

184
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,100
one of the most typical things when someone comes in from an accident, is their femur and

185
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,680
hip are displaced, so they have to pop it back in, or the shoulder is displaced, they

186
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:38,280
have to pop it back in, and it usually takes several orderlies, it's a lot of work, so

187
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:43,240
he developed a brace, a device that will hold the body, and the doctor pulls a lever, basically,

188
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:49,860
and it resets the joint, he went for 10 years, they would not grant it to him, they finally

189
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:59,180
did, you see, so they're fighting, so anyway, they do say what they're doing, right, and

190
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:05,600
it's actually pretty nefarious, but it's the way, you know how they say, it's not what

191
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,760
you say, it's how you say it, right, and that's what they're doing, so I want to go back to

192
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:16,740
the theme here, which is multiple themes, and maybe end up with the body first, because

193
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:20,920
that's the easiest one, you know, it's kind of like, it's not how good of a driver you

194
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:27,080
are, it's what car you drive, what people notice first, right, so the car you're driving

195
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:36,040
is the physical body, it's actually the suit, but it is powered by the soul, okay, which

196
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,960
is the breathing, the nervous system, and the heart rate, and all that other stuff,

197
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:45,960
and when the body is alive, and the soul is powered, you know, like charging something,

198
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:51,300
and it's fully charged, or working, enough of a charge to keep working, then, just like

199
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,940
a computer, or a phone, or whatever, then you could use it for its normal operation,

200
00:16:55,060 --> 00:17:01,100
then the spirit can run, it could work, so back to the body, someone, by the way, had

201
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,980
said, where do I get the older recordings, because we had done two hours, we called it

202
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:10,220
the container, it was episode number two back then, yeah, essentially, the main thing

203
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:17,079
that I hammer on people is the body is, we view ourselves as walking around through the

204
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:21,980
world, through space, or sitting down in a chair, or doing anything we do with our body,

205
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:26,680
you know, and it has senses, touch, feel, and all this other stuff, we sense temperature,

206
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:32,100
and hardness, softness, and all this other stuff, what I'm trying to say here is that

207
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,840
we are integrated with the environment, where does the body stop, and where does the environment

208
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:41,140
start, well, you could say, typically, it's the skin, your hands, the bottoms of your

209
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:45,640
feet, the top of your head, but I'm telling you that that environment, whether you're

210
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:51,420
underwater, or in the air, or under, in your bed, covered with sheets, it is integrated

211
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:55,140
with the environment, proof of that is when you go to different air pressures, right,

212
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:58,900
you feel the difference, right, in certain depths in the ocean, temperature.

213
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,400
Doesn't this travel all the way through, though, look, from the environment, through the body,

214
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,640
into the other parts here, right, the spirit and the soul, you know, to try and define

215
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,940
where the borders are is sort of important, isn't it, because...

216
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:17,300
Yeah, yeah, and there is, the borders are boundaries, but it doesn't mean that your

217
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:22,380
body ends there, like, for example, early electrical research, they found that all materials have

218
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,260
an atmosphere, I know it sounds kind of crazy, but when I say atmosphere, I just mean what

219
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:32,140
I said, and it's held in with a slight vacuous field, just like, for example, with the Earth,

220
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:36,060
they say the Earth's, the space is a vacuum, and the Earth is an atmosphere, it's mild,

221
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:41,380
you know, it's basically air surrounding the planet, well, if we know what a vacuum is,

222
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,560
it's a negative pressure, it should pull the atmosphere out, and there should be never

223
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:48,600
an atmosphere on the Earth, how does it work, well, actually, the vacuum on the Earth's

224
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,720
atmosphere is greater than the vacuum in outer space, actually, outer space is pushing

225
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:58,480
on the Earth, it's denser energetically, or in the energy that you need for the atmosphere

226
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:04,160
to stay on the Earth, than we're told, and how do I know that to be true, because we

227
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,120
have an atmosphere, there's no way that space could be a vacuum pulling away on our atmosphere,

228
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:14,000
look how gentle it is, you can actually move your hand briefly or wave through the air,

229
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,880
you're actually displacing atmosphere, if you subject anything that were the, quote

230
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,220
unquote, atmosphere to a vacuum condition, what happens, completely collapses and goes

231
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:26,800
into that area where the vacuum is, so space cannot be a vacuum by very proof of that,

232
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:32,920
is that we have an atmosphere, so this very simple type of thinking is based on the emperor

233
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:38,160
has no clothes reasoning, right, it's almost the most simplest approach to view it and say

234
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:45,080
what you see is actually what's going on, so the body has an atmosphere as well, and

235
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:50,780
that atmosphere is what integrates with the environment around you, and for example, kind

236
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:55,200
of a jestful matter, if you've ever, if you want to notice someone's atmosphere, it's

237
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,640
the way they smell, if someone puts on all this cologne and walks by five feet away

238
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,060
from you, you kind of smell them, right, it's because it's in their atmosphere, right, other

239
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:08,580
people, let's say, have bad hygiene, right, you're smelling their atmosphere, not them

240
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,940
essentially. Isn't that literally due to some little bits

241
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:17,860
of matter that sort of break off, float off, and you know, end up in your nostrils, I mean

242
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:21,900
look, I'm not being completely... There's been tests on that, and no, there

243
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:27,440
is no matter, yes, yes, if you have matter on your nostril, think of it this way, remember

244
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:33,420
this is the materialist point of view, if there's matter on your nostril, do you smell

245
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:36,880
it on the sensory organ, on the tongue or the nostril, and then it pops off when you

246
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,520
stop smelling it? No. Right? It would be like a self-cleaning filter, and it's not, it's

247
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:49,580
all energetic, signaling. Remember, this is a materialist point of view that the collective

248
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:55,960
has garnered, you know, telling you that all these things about light as a photon and electrons

249
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,600
and all that, you know, it's just completely ridiculous.

250
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:05,800
So going back to the body and the environment, there's nothing that ever enters or leaves

251
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:11,020
the body directly, so nothing goes through the intestines, nothing goes through the lungs,

252
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:17,460
nothing goes through the skin, in either direction, right? There are organs that we excrete from

253
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:23,140
that collect these energies and manifest them as energy, discharge them, right? Solid, liquid

254
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:29,080
and gases, let's say. Proof of this is very simple. Many of the anatomical drawings that

255
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:35,600
you'll find online or in an anatomy book are very accurate, because you could also look

256
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:43,660
at photos of skin and intestine and lung tissue, or if you have a microscope, usually 320 to

257
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:48,580
400 magnification, you will see what I'm saying here, and it all matches the diagrams that

258
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:55,120
you see online. So if you type in cross-section of human intestine, you will see basically

259
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:00,360
the lumen of the opening, and then you will see the inside wall and the villi and the

260
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:05,520
blood vessels and two layers of cells, and there is nothing, there is nothing there that

261
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:11,800
allows anything to go through, right, at all. The same with the lungs, the same with

262
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:17,800
the skin, everything is done by induction. Induction is just contact, in other words,

263
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:23,940
physical proximity or contact, and there is an energy exchange, and the exchange from

264
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:29,940
one to the other stimulates or changes the other. It's very simple. Now, I have not gone

265
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:35,300
into this in depth, because it sounds pedantic, in other words, this is not a quote-unquote

266
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:41,180
biology medical class, but what I encourage people to do, because we're all very young

267
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:46,580
and new at this, most people will never hear what I just said unless they hear it from us.

268
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:54,640
I'm serious. I've been saying this since the 1980s, and I've never run across anyone that

269
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,300
directly says, yeah, I know that. Where did you find that out? How did you come up with

270
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:04,360
never? It's always like I'm presenting something new to anyone I've ever spoken to about this.

271
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:10,360
Well, the only thing I can say about that is that it's not so new to me, and I told

272
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,880
you about the observation that I have that I don't fully know how to articulate.

273
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,380
Okay, well, communication, then.

274
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:21,060
Yeah, let's try to communicate this, because I think it's extremely important what you're

275
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:28,140
saying and extremely correct, but I say that because of my observations. I see the sun.

276
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:33,640
I told you this before, and you were kind of surprised, I thought, that the way people

277
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:41,000
explain the sun is absolutely stupid. It beams light down here, and I go, no, it doesn't.

278
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,400
How is it that you people even see this? I see it.

279
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:51,920
I want to just stick with this, follow this thought for a moment. My point here was, you

280
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:56,680
know how we spoke about the juvenile nature. In some cases, we have to retain this, and

281
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:01,460
the reason why I'm saying this is just when you jump online and look at the cross-section

282
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:06,220
of the intestine, do a cross-section of a steel-belted radial car tire, and you'll see

283
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:11,780
they're the same. They're the same in function. Nothing goes through them, and because this

284
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:17,400
is not discussed openly, whether it's done secretly, it should be, I guess, and anyone

285
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:22,800
that I've ever confronted in the past 30-some-odd years either sees it as a completely new notion

286
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:28,480
or something acceptable and not ridiculous. What I'm trying to say, this concept is very

287
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:35,440
young, not juvenile and immature, but still extremely young. Like I said, I didn't want

288
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:42,500
to get into too much on how it functions because I'm just as young at this in knowledge as

289
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:51,580
anyone who just found out about it 10 seconds ago. What I'm counting on is, I'll go on with

290
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:56,800
the sun, but what I'm counting on is people looking at this and coming up with their

291
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:01,780
own expression, like you said, I just couldn't explain it, and then getting back together

292
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:08,040
and forming a body of work. Even when PCs became popular with computers, it wasn't until 10

293
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:15,100
years later until it started becoming a big deal. Enough people understanding that nothing

294
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:21,440
gets absorbed or goes through any of the biological tissue, plants, animals, fish, anything, within,

295
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,960
let's say, we don't have that much time, but within a certain amount of time, there will

296
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,580
be more and more focus on this, and more and more will come together and establish

297
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:35,640
it as a form of study, and it still hasn't happened. But you were saying about the sun.

298
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:39,280
Well, the computers, like you said, look, computers were great and they were very powerful

299
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,380
instruments, but until people learned how to make them communicate with one another,

300
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,620
there was not very much use for it as far as coming together and sharing knowledge and

301
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:53,260
actually making some progress there collectively.

302
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,300
Sure. It's slow.

303
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,080
It's slow, yeah.

304
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,460
It's slow, yeah. So the thing about, I mean, you had to take a disk and hand it to somebody

305
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,900
and then they had to take it somewhere else and put it on their computer. So you didn't

306
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:10,420
have a very efficient methodology for transferring information. But what's fascinating here is

307
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:16,600
that, like I said, the sun is not this thing that beams light onto the planet, okay? And

308
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:25,000
by observation, what it looks like to me is that the sun does send energy, and the light

309
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,620
is created by contact here.

310
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:32,300
In the atmosphere. That's why the sun looks different at morning, it does at high noon,

311
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,560
than it does at sundown, yeah.

312
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:39,520
But I see that process happen, and other people will look up at the very same thing that I

313
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:45,580
see and say to them, say, no, this beams light. It's like a big flashlight in the sky. And

314
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,920
I go, well, but no, it doesn't, actually.

315
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:53,460
Yeah, well, that sounds like a personal problem, whether it's on your part or their part.

316
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:58,900
You see, it's a personal thing. The thing, I believe that we need to get away from that.

317
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,620
Like, for example, there's a lot of people that do Sonics, and I've heard some podcasts,

318
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:07,040
and they spend half the time talking about their own personal stories, right? And whoever's

319
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,620
listening is just itching to say, I've got a better story than that, right? So the focus

320
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:15,560
gets away, that the purpose of what we're trying to do, I believe, or at least I try

321
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:20,020
to focus on since I've been speaking, is to be objective as possible and leave my personal

322
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:24,520
experiences out unless they need to be shown in an impersonal way to everyone else how it

323
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,280
could benefit them.

324
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:30,240
Well, but that's the point of this, actually. It's not about my personal story is better.

325
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:35,240
It's a matter of, but that's what I'm observing. So now I'm trying to figure out why it is

326
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,780
they're not seeing the same thing.

327
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,740
Don't do that. You'll go crazy.

328
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,680
Well, that's what I discovered. Yeah.

329
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,920
Yeah, we'll explain why that works. Also, we've done in the past cosmic censorship.

330
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:51,060
And also they there are people that come into this reality to kick to manifest the reality

331
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:56,560
because societies are governed by more powerful beings, and they need to create numbers just

332
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:03,260
like you create a Dungeons and Dragons thing. It's, you know, to create characters. But

333
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:09,260
so I just wanted to get back on this, because future discussions will involve references to

334
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:14,720
this mindset. And these are ideas, not ideologies, by the way. You know, whenever you hear the word

335
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:20,680
ideology, that's a low level standing narrative. Right. So anyway, I just want to throw that in

336
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:26,280
there. But the body, again, just is completely sealed. And it works by induction. You have an

337
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:30,960
induction stove, you know, glass stove, you know, the pot of water is boiling. You move the pot

338
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:37,840
aside, put your hand on it. Radio waves, you know, waves in the ether, radio and all things

339
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,000
that are transmitted wirelessly is all by induction, forms of induction. So you could

340
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,540
look up that field. It's been around for a long time and apply that to bio to biology.

341
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:55,100
And we'll cover the human body again, perhaps in a sonic all by itself, because the main thing

342
00:28:55,100 --> 00:29:00,860
with this human body is that it's working right to animate the spirit. Because if your physical

343
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:06,540
body is so sick, you can't think clearly. And your spirit is now in that sick state also will

344
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:13,420
follow suit. Right. So there are many other things like eating seasonally and what to eat when

345
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:19,260
various times of the month. Yeah. Various times of the day and all that. I think that will be

346
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:26,480
something go to go into maybe even in this one bounce back. Right. You cannot speak about this.

347
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,140
Now, I mentioned a lot of these diseases are fraudulent and how they misdiagnose and all this.

348
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:37,540
That's in the category of health. Right. OK, I have you. I cannot explain how many times I was

349
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:44,000
brought into conferences, Skype and what have you, anywhere from three to two dozen people talking

350
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,500
about what's what to do to improve your health. What do you think I say when I get on there?

351
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:57,500
Well, the first thing you say or just generally, how long do I last? Actually, I should have put

352
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:02,920
you on the spot like that. I usually leave within two minutes. I'm thinking and I end up giving a

353
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:09,740
bunch of pejoratives. Why? Because I keep asking health for what? What are you trying to do?

354
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:16,980
There is no general health. Right. There is no such thing. Give an example. Listen, I'm going

355
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:22,260
to go over to the Himalayas and climb Mount Everest next week. I need a certain level of

356
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:28,640
health and conditioning to do that. Or I just got a job. I'm going to be sitting in a chair 10 hours

357
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:35,860
a day. That requires a different level of health. Right. Or I'm going to be working. UPS requires a

358
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:43,220
different, you know, delivery packages, different level of health. Or this woman is a single mom

359
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:48,980
or what level of health? What are you trying to do with your health? In other words, your health

360
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:54,680
is your condition. That's why people that go out and get physical trainers, right, to help them

361
00:30:54,680 --> 00:31:01,400
in the gym or nutritionists. How many of them actually benefit? They'll tell you they do because

362
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:07,220
they're, you know, they're paying for it, let's say. Right. But very few, very, very little benefit

363
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:17,140
because like you said earlier, that communication is not there. And if the concept of what level of

364
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:20,580
health or conditioning you need is not there, what are you going to communicate? There's nothing to

365
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:26,680
communicate. You just fall into some niche. So I always leave these discussions about health

366
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:34,560
because I keep asking what level of conditioning, what level of health, what are you trying to do

367
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:39,640
with this quote unquote health that we can discuss this general? The reason I say this is because

368
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:45,320
you'll hear one person pop up. Have you ever heard of a quandroitin, whatever selenium or blah, blah,

369
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:51,380
blah? I'm like, yeah, but what's that for? What are you trying to do? Oh, this. Well, this

370
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:56,780
supplement is absorbed much better by the body. I'm like, oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Yeah. Well,

371
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:02,440
yeah. What you see. So what are you trying to do with your health? Some people in health discussions

372
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:07,280
have an ailment. Well, see, that's what I was thinking, actually, is that most of these things,

373
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:13,360
if somebody asks for advice on health is due to the fact that they have a condition that is not

374
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:18,140
negative. It's a negative condition. It's an undesirable condition. I'll call it. Right. Right.

375
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:23,360
Add that extra word. It helps. Yeah, it does, I think, because it's the undesirable condition.

376
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,700
If it was a desirable condition, you wouldn't seek to change it. OK, so you wish to change

377
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:33,780
a undesirable condition. And that's what it is. I'll give you a perfect for instance.

378
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:41,320
I'm in constant pain. There is a pain occurring all the time in an area of the body. Right.

379
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,620
I know there's been plenty of these meetings and maybe not involving you,

380
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:51,140
but there's been plenty of these meetings about, oh, well, we have the way to deal with your pain.

381
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:56,720
Uh, and I always say, well, you know, well, what, what, what pain are we talking about? Because

382
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:02,160
the pain in my head is not necessarily the pain that is caused in my feet. It is not necessarily

383
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:08,080
based on the same thing. So you address an issue based on an undesirable condition. I think you

384
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:12,920
got to be specific about the condition. Yeah. To address it. I mean, this is my thinking again.

385
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:17,800
No, no, no. Let's just tackle that real quick. I'll show you how quick I tackle things like that.

386
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:23,680
Okay. Because, okay. So the first thing I ask is, uh, are you having the pain between morning

387
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:28,880
and afternoon or are you having the pain between afternoon and all night? Very important.

388
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:36,100
Because if the pain is from morning to afternoon, that's when the ether, the energies are expanding.

389
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,520
Right. And we're talking about afternoon and morning where you are.

390
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:46,480
If you're having the pain from afternoon and through the night, well, that has to do with

391
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,420
something about the energies contracting, right? Because nighttime, the energies contract,

392
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:55,280
right? Things get colder. Sun, sun goes down. Right. Okay. But in your case, let's say you

393
00:33:55,280 --> 00:34:01,160
said that it was all the time. So it doesn't matter if the energies are expanding daily or

394
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:06,100
night, uh, nightly contracting it. So you're having it all the time. So that would be

395
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:12,080
all the time. Then I would ask you, is it all day? You might say what? Yes. Right.

396
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:15,440
And it's okay. Now here's the thing. Is it all week?

397
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:22,500
What would you say? Yes. Well, uh, that's important. I can tell you that I've been in

398
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:27,360
that condition. Okay. So I'll, I'll, I'll go back to that condition. It lasts more than a week.

399
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,760
And it has been going on all day. Does it last more than a month? Bear with me here. Yes.

400
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:36,060
More than a month. Okay. So then we go into a different field. Okay. Because if it lasted

401
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:41,320
only a week, let's say two weeks, then it's not really tied in with the expanding contraction

402
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:47,280
on a daily basis of the environment. It's more of a monthly basis because in half the month,

403
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:51,960
the energies are expanding and the other half they're contracting actually in the middle of

404
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:56,700
the month, right? You go from full moon, then it contracts to dark moon. Then it expands back to

405
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:01,500
full moon. That's a monthly. If it's more, if, in other words, if your pains are lasting more

406
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:06,580
than a month and you don't see cycles where some day, some days or weeks are there less or more.

407
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:11,960
Now we have to get into the cycles. Is it more during the beginning of the month and Lester,

408
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:16,200
then we could work with that monthly cycle. Because if you say it's all the time, we can't

409
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:20,560
work with the daily cycle. If you say it's all month though, it's harder to work with the monthly

410
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:25,680
cycle. And if it's more than a month, now we have to work with a yearly cycle. Do you see what I

411
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:33,320
mean? So let's look at the yearly cycle. Summertime is maximum expansion fall. It starts to contract

412
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:40,140
winter is maximum contraction of energy, right? What happens in the spring starts expanding again

413
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:44,360
until it reaches summer where it's maximum expansion. So my next question to you, Chuck,

414
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:49,100
would be, do you, you have it all the time. How was it in the winter? How is it in the summer?

415
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,920
Well, okay. You have it more or less, right? Some people with arthritis have it more in the winter.

416
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:58,260
You see what I mean? I was just going to say that typically, uh, and, and, and I've experienced this

417
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:05,000
personally is that it's definitely more in the winter, but, uh, but here's the problem now, uh,

418
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:11,940
I have to be able to understand what proper timekeeping is here because, oh, yes, yes.

419
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:18,700
But hold on, hold on to stick with the health. You see how specific you must be. So in the winter,

420
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:22,700
if it's harder time in the winter, meaning you're sensing a harder time, because here's the thing,

421
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:27,640
your physical body could be having a harder time in the summer, but it doesn't show up

422
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:32,420
until the winter, kind of like, you know, your tires running out of air. It's not flat yet,

423
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,740
you know, but gets flat in the way you see. So you're actually manifesting it in the winter

424
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:41,300
with your sensory. So that means that you're having a hard time when the energies are contracting,

425
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,900
right? So that means you're not going along with the contractive energies,

426
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:50,040
or it might be, we need to go a little deeper and see that you actually

427
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:55,500
need the opposite to balance it out. So you're either not going with the flow enough and you're

428
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:00,920
feeling drag and resistance because you're not going with it, or you're going too much with it

429
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:07,180
and falling and hitting bottom. So that's another way to look at it. And this is mitigated, helped

430
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:14,480
with your behavior, believe it or not, the way you think, what you eat, your actions. And this is the

431
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:21,320
real, how would you say, treatment of, quote, unquote, maladies. And that's how I go about it.

432
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:28,200
Do you see the whole example there and how you actually just, you actually set up, gave us the

433
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:34,440
whole setup, right? Right. I totally understand now. Now this means that there are a whole bunch

434
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:41,660
of different actions that could be taken to either make it, you know, again, kind of put yourself,

435
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:47,840
I hate to use this phrase again, in sync with what's happening. But really, it's it is to know

436
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:53,060
it's fine. You have to be in sync, but you have to know which direction is it a one way street,

437
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:56,940
you go in the wrong way, or is it a two way street where you, but, but if it's two way,

438
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:00,200
you have to be on the right or on the left, depending for an, you know what I mean? Of

439
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:04,300
course. Right. You see what I mean? Or is it four lanes in one direction, four lanes in the other?

440
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,120
Are you in the fast lane, middle or slow lane? So all these things have to be considered. So

441
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,900
do you see, but basically you brought that up and I kept asking questions till we nailed it down

442
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:20,780
to a yearly seasonal thing. How can you have a general, let's say, well, you get on a group and

443
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:25,240
there's 10 people talking about health, you can't have a general discussion, you have to approach

444
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:30,720
each individual's condition or what they desire from it. You see, there is no general discussion

445
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:36,160
on this. You see what I mean? No, it makes no sense, because you can't have a in this, this is

446
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,060
always the problem. And always the problem I have with the quote, medicine, unquote,

447
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:47,620
is that, you know, here's the, the solution and the solution. Well, the one size fits all. Yeah.

448
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:54,800
The one size fits all. That makes no sense to me. Well, it could. I've seen the one size fit all

449
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:01,700
t-shirts at the rock concerts and three people put them on and one of them, it looks like a dress.

450
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,600
The other one is tight. The other one, right? Yeah. But that's the thing. It's not going to

451
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:09,520
fit very well. Exactly. It's not going to fit very well. And the chances that it's,

452
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:14,720
it'll look like a, right? Like, for example, there's arguments with the, what they call the,

453
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:21,040
the, the lollipop, the whatever, the vax, right? Okay. Yeah. Okay. And I think I mentioned this,

454
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:26,920
maybe I don't do it again, but someone brought up, got in the nurse's face about it. And she,

455
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,560
she started laughing. You're one of those anti-vaxxers. And I went up to her and I said,

456
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:36,800
are you taking consideration the age, body weight and blood type as it is in NHS protocols?

457
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:42,500
She packed up all her stuff and went away. Of course. So, so every time there was a vac center,

458
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:46,360
if you had a bunch of people going and asking these, because in order to administer a vaccine,

459
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:53,420
you have to have age, body type race, believe it or not. And blood type and body weight.

460
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:59,280
And none of it, you know, so it's, it's a fraud on its face. It doesn't mean that a one size fits

461
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,080
all t-shirt is a fraud, but what they're doing injecting, you see at all the medicines, right?

462
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:09,220
The only time they consider the different medicines is for example, how many mil, the dosage.

463
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:14,580
And there are some warnings about, let's say pregnant women or whatever, but it's more

464
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:20,520
in depth than that. An anesthesiologist that has two patients that are coming in for an appendectomy.

465
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:27,420
One of them is a 90 pound white girl with red hair and freckles. And the other one is a 300 pound

466
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:34,680
black man in his forties. Well, the amount of anesthesia to put out the little redhead white

467
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:41,900
girl with freckles will kill the 300 pound black man in his forties. Right? So Matt, you see,

468
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,480
and this is already, well, it's, I call it medical racism. It's very real. The Prozac doesn't work in

469
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:53,720
Asia, in Korea. If you, if you, if you're from Korea or the Northern Northwestern part of Asia,

470
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:58,400
you will die if you take Prozac. That's why it's banned. It's why it's banned in some of those

471
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:03,840
countries, actually, for a very practical reason. Right. So there's, there's no discussion on this.

472
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:09,600
So what this does is actually, I had someone once messaged me, I listen to Greek speak and I feel

473
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:14,600
just so depressed or whatever. I said, why is it? I mean, that's good because you're actually

474
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:20,680
getting the dose of it and you are handling it that way first. That's fine. But it should be

475
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:26,720
empowering because now you have tools. I said, is it, is it depressing in a way? Like,

476
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:32,200
let's say you want to start fixing things around the house. If I come over and I give you 14

477
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:37,060
toolboxes with every woodworking, plumbing and electrical tool and put it on the ground and say,

478
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:41,640
go at it, you're going to be like, I'm depressed now because I don't know how to use these tools.

479
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:47,640
Right. You see what I mean? All I have is a hammer and a screwdriver, right? Or in most people's

480
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:51,660
cases, I have three hammers. I fix everything with small, medium and large hammers. Right. So

481
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:57,920
do you see where I'm going with this? So the body is very, very interesting in that part.

482
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:04,640
So the body will let you know through the soul what you need to do. And there is no health.

483
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:12,380
So when you hear people saying this is healthy, I'm like, for what, for what? Right. What,

484
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:21,380
they have no concept. It is so juvenile in a not such a good way. Right. That it's just not

485
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:26,180
explainable. So anyway, go ahead. And what have you got so far before we keep perusing on this?

486
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:31,500
What do you think? No, I think, I think it's great. And look, the one size fits all. I get

487
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:35,700
what you're saying. And I guess I shouldn't dismiss it that easily because practically,

488
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:41,020
yeah, if you make a T-shirt big enough, indeed, yeah, everybody can wear it, but

489
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:47,540
it's not going to have the same effect. OK, you put it on the four foot tall, four foot

490
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:53,340
nine tall girl and she's wearing it down to her ankles. You know, that's wonderful and all. And

491
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:57,940
it does. She can wear it. But that's a bit of a different condition that you've now achieved

492
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:03,440
with the one size fits all. Now, if you want to properly do this, you know, you have different

493
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,320
sizes. You actually small, medium, large will work. And then you got the extra large, extra

494
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:12,640
small. But look, Chuck, what does this all say? Let's say we're talking about what people get

495
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,900
administered as, quote, unquote, health care, which is an absolute joke. Right.

496
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,200
It's come comes out of the banking system. That's why if you don't can't show you have health care,

497
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:26,260
you get fined by the IRS 500 bucks. Right. It's such a joke in your face. By the way,

498
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:32,180
this is all financially hinged and society. Every society has become fish in a barrel.

499
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:36,220
And there's a saying that goes, what do you do with fish in the barrel? Right.

500
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:41,240
So, well, at this point, you know, you shouldn't have been in the barrel. But anyway,

501
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:46,240
this is the thing. These are things that are being administered inside people's bodies,

502
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:51,520
whether it's oral injection or therapy or whatever. Right. And you got some quack telling

503
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:56,620
you you got blood pressure or this is your condition or that. Right. What does that tell

504
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:01,860
you? That humanity is still around. It's a testament to how robust the human body is.

505
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:11,580
Right. So the collective, as ignorant as they are, by the way, they are robust. They have not

506
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:16,400
been wiped out by their own medical system yet. They're in everything they're trying. They don't

507
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:21,100
have to because, remember, this is not some major. The way that the medical professionals

508
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:25,860
are acting is nefarious, but they don't know that they're doing it. But it does just because

509
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:31,360
they don't know what they're doing does not make them innocent. You see, they're guilty by association

510
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:37,620
and by they're actually the ones manifesting these ill acts. So but what is it saying if the

511
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:42,100
medical community is so bad and actually people that are being destroyed by it actually leave

512
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:47,820
saying, my doctor helped me and treated me actually thinking that that is telling me that the human

513
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:52,840
body is extremely robust, can take a lot of punishment, tremendous amount of punishment

514
00:44:52,840 --> 00:45:00,520
and still maintain, you know, being alive or together in most cases, you see. So can you

515
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:06,060
imagine taking something as robust as the human or any biology? Also, you can take a trimming off

516
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:11,340
a plant, put it most plants, put it in a glass of water properly and you will sprout roots and put

517
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:18,520
it in the ground. Right. That's pretty robust, you know. So you have a very robust biology here.

518
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:27,580
And it's obviously it's, you know, being abused mostly and it's still continuing, still propagating.

519
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:33,460
Right. Well, it's still durable. And by the numbers, the population grows despite all this.

520
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:38,780
Sure. So and it's actually growing. Yeah, that's another thing, because I've driven through parts

521
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:43,520
of the US for hours and not seen anyone or anything or any evidence of anyone who are not

522
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:50,200
overpopulated. I think I've mentioned trillions, thousands of billions can be supported on the

523
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:55,400
planet. I think right now you could fit everyone on the planet in what they call Texas State and

524
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:59,460
they would still have plenty of, you know, like a suburban community, everyone on the planet. So.

525
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:05,520
But then again, you're there. This information of global warming and overpopulation is being

526
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:13,540
communicated to fish in a barrel. What can they do right now? This is the body. Nothing goes in and

527
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:20,020
out. It works through induction. So when things manifest in the body through nutrition and are

528
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:27,260
excreted right through the body, giving off stuff, it's literally going from material to energy,

529
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:33,160
back to material or material to energy into material. It's a palindrome works both ways.

530
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:38,600
What it literally what literally is happening in the body literally is what you see in the

531
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:44,100
fictional Star Trek depiction of the replicator, right, where they think when they want to eat

532
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:48,520
something in the machine makes it, let's say, out of pure energy. The only flaw, by the way,

533
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:53,920
I do see as a commentary on Star Trek is a lot of times they go down to a planet, they get sick,

534
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:57,860
so they have to be beamed up. If they were really able to beam you up, they shouldn't be able to

535
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:05,180
filter out the bad stuff and only beam up the healthy body. Well, there are biological filters

536
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:10,940
on there, you know, in later incarnations after they. OK, good, because that's that's the most

537
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:15,200
logical thing that I see if you have the technology to apply. That's what I would think, too. And,

538
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:20,940
honestly, when I viewed it as a kid, you know, the 60s version of it, you're absolutely right.

539
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,740
And as a matter of fact, I didn't think of the replicators at first. I thought of the

540
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:30,000
transporter because what the idea is that they're supposedly breaking down

541
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:37,900
the physical body into energy and then reassembling it into the body, which is,

542
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:43,460
by the way, in a real reality, you wouldn't do it that way. You keep the organism alive,

543
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:48,000
but you have them walk through walls, let's say, or walk through atmosphere where you collapse

544
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:56,120
time and distance. Notice I didn't say space. Right. Right. So, OK, so the human body will

545
00:47:56,120 --> 00:48:02,280
always keep referencing, like even if we don't get again very soon into the human body, how it

546
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:06,580
really works. I think I mentioned enough right now that if you have access to the old Greek speak,

547
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:11,000
which somehow will get up on Rumble or one of these other platforms, maybe even YouTube.

548
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,960
I do have a collection of all of the ones we've done. Somehow they will be available. Not now,

549
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:23,120
not next week, but around, let's say, near future. So you can go and listen to the old

550
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:26,940
early incarnations. When were they done, Chuck? Twenty fifteen, I think. Right.

551
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:32,100
The original one. Yeah. Twenty fifteen. OK, so eight years old. They're still fresh. Yes.

552
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:39,680
Right. OK, so. So this is important because we're covering like who we are in a very

553
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:44,760
objective kind of way. You notice I keep going back and forth with the health and the soul,

554
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:51,360
the metabolism. Like if you're going to go into a discussion speaking about general health,

555
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:58,180
they're really talking about how well the soul is doing in the body and then the how what's the

556
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:02,980
status of the body because the soul is either working well or not. So if someone has a problem

557
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:07,320
breathing, that's a problem with the soul. Problem with their heart is a problem with the soul.

558
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:12,040
Not enough energy or too much energy. That's a soul problem. Right. That's the metabolism,

559
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:19,340
the breathing, the nutrition, the all that. Right. So this is the basic mechanics. It's kind of like

560
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:24,460
taking a car for a tune up to a mechanic. He's not going to consider what you can. He doesn't

561
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:29,620
consider the driving style. He just wants to make sure the equipment is up to snuff. Right. Right.

562
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:33,720
But if you if you're setting it up for high performance driving, you're going to tune it

563
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:38,040
for that. You can. And that's what basically health is when you start to go to extremes.

564
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:42,800
Now, most people on the health discussion will not be climbing Mount Everest or whatever. So

565
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:49,620
you don't need a special regimen for that. They're basically you can presume they're either

566
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:54,740
a UPS delivery driver, postman sitting in an office or a single mom kind of thing.

567
00:49:55,380 --> 00:50:00,240
Generally, that that health status is generally overlaps and works OK,

568
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:06,740
but it's still not specific enough for each individual. It cannot it cannot be effective.

569
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:11,220
In other words, you could say we had a discussion about health like we can do a discussion about

570
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:16,800
health, but it does not help anyone specifically. And we are very specific beings ultimately.

571
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:26,580
Right. So so so that that's the the body and the soul. For what else I could talk about the soul,

572
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:30,980
there are things that are very specific to the soul, because the soul we went over

573
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:38,380
in the Greek convention, it's pneuma. So it's used as a prefix in the English with the PNU

574
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:44,560
prefix. We see pneumatic pneumonia. Those things have to do with the movement of air. OK.

575
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:51,000
There are specific things. There are certain disciplines, like, for example,

576
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:55,500
there I remember having a book. I don't have it anymore, but the gist that I got out of it,

577
00:50:55,500 --> 00:51:00,300
you can pretty much heal most things through breathing, just like there's a book that you

578
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:05,640
could pretty doctor met at Mengele. You're not sick. You're thirsty. You can heal most things

579
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:10,460
with water. I think it's a little extreme, but there are a lot of examples where people

580
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:17,360
have testimonies and gone through exercises of breathing. Right. Most Westerners or most people

581
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:22,480
are shallow breathers. Right. They're not fully taking advantage of breathing. So you inhale

582
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:29,220
slowly and you hold it for the amount of time that you took to inhale and then you exhale slowly

583
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:34,940
at the rate of the amount that you took to inhale and hold it. Right. So it would be inhaling for

584
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:41,420
one second. You hold it for one second and then exhale for one second. So a breath cycle is three

585
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:48,640
seconds or you double the time. Right. You spend two seconds inhaling. Right. And every time you

586
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:53,860
inhale, you hold it for that amount of time. What I mean, time by the stopwatch, let's say

587
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:59,100
and exhale. That is the easiest way to reset your breathing, which is the predominant term

588
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:05,620
used for the soul. And that is another discussion that we can get in depth depth in. But again,

589
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:13,520
it's very personal. Right. But in essence, the body is the suit, the meat. Nothing goes in.

590
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:19,500
Nothing goes out directly. And the soul, you could say the paramount aspect of it is your breath.

591
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:26,060
But it's the heart rate. It's the nervous system. Right. It's the it's the pulse rate of all of the

592
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:33,260
various organs or 12 pulse rates. Each major organ has a pulse rate on and on. You see,

593
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:40,040
it's complex, but simple. Right. And I've read about many of these mystical things,

594
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:45,640
supposedly. Right. Where it does boil down to quite often just the breathing and the amount

595
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:51,020
of water and the quality of the water, of course, and things like this. And I say to myself, yes,

596
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:56,880
quality of the air, the quality of the water and how you use it seem to be two of the very

597
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:06,260
primary things, but also the food. Now, I do use the word consume, but but maybe that's not exactly

598
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:11,280
proper. But it is more proper than you think, because when it breaks down energetically in

599
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:19,420
your body, it's it's pretty well consumed. But it's not. Anyway, it's not the way that people

600
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:25,220
do explain it generally. So if you said consumer consummate years ago meant you had tuberculosis.

601
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:29,600
Well, there you go. I mean, I'm just saying the words have changed.

602
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:34,420
So, you know, just like a, you know, is happy. Right. It's written in songs everywhere. And

603
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:41,100
now it means something else. But we've gotten into etymology before, and I'm sure we're going

604
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:46,160
to get into it again. Yeah. But but yeah, the food is very important, but that's going to be hard. I

605
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:50,640
been sort of a food prophet years ago. I said next amount of years, you won't be able to eat

606
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:54,360
this because of this. And I tell my wife all the time, she goes, remember, I said this about three

607
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:58,740
years ago about this. And he's seeing it happening right now. It's very simple once you see the

608
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:05,800
patterns. Right. If you see something happen in time and you see if it's a pattern of something

609
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:09,780
that's repeated before and it'll get to that point X amount of time, it's very easy to say

610
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:14,520
five years from now this. Right. Because you studied how it happened before. It would be

611
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:20,960
slightly different, you see. But starving a population can be done two ways. One is by

612
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:25,840
preventing the actual presence of food, of being there, or you give them all the food they want,

613
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:31,020
but you can't. It's tainted. It has no nutrition. What's the difference? Right. Well, the difference

614
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:36,760
is that that you have people not being alarmed by the fact that there is a lack of food.

615
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:42,800
That's right. That's the worst one. Yeah, that's the frog being boiled alive slowly. Right. And

616
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:47,800
that way it's not as noticeable, you know, because the food just disappeared. You have a reaction.

617
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:54,880
You're guaranteed you'll have a short term reaction immediately. That's right. You're

618
00:54:54,880 --> 00:55:00,420
deliberate, by the way. You'll find it if you're looking for it. But the thing is not to focus

619
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:09,020
on how evil this place is and can be and was and will be. It's a matter of focusing on

620
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:16,660
what you can know and how you're going to use what you know and how simple it is. So again,

621
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:22,480
let's just, I think we've covered enough about the soul and the body and how there is no one

622
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:28,060
size fits all. Pretty much everything that we've been told about these things is false,

623
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:32,100
but the truth of the matter or as close to the truth as possible

624
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:37,260
can easily be brought up and discussed. And a great deal of it can be observed

625
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:44,020
if you just have the time to do so. Right. Yeah. Once. Yeah. You know how many times people,

626
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:49,000
you know, when you have been working at this job 20 years, same parking lot,

627
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:54,420
what color are the stripes in the parking lot? I don't know. Well, you've been coming here. What

628
00:55:54,420 --> 00:56:00,380
do you mean? Right. See. So I love when that kind of thing happens. Actually, I find it extremely

629
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:05,880
ironic where, you know, well, I noticed this and somebody is there every single day and they don't

630
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:11,340
know it. Yeah. What's filtering? It's it's how observant are you? And but you see, it's not a

631
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:18,720
big deal. And whether you know the color of the stripes or not, the big deal here is that you've

632
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:23,500
been doing something by repetition doesn't mean you're going to be aware of it or of what's going

633
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:29,340
on. Right. At all. That's that's something else to get into. And we'll we'll do that.

634
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:55,470
So. Interesting, the break time there, actually, because I kind of like this where we're recording

635
00:56:55,470 --> 00:57:04,370
as opposed to being on live radio because it allows us to relax a little more. And I like it.

636
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:10,870
Anyway, hopefully you guys are enjoying this. And the Greek seems to dig this kind of situation.

637
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:15,730
Sorry to use those kind of terms, but that's fine. I think so. I think it's pretty cool.

638
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:21,390
Well, you know, we're not doing any canned laughter anymore, are we? No, I'm just joking. None of that.

639
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:25,230
None of that. Do I want to play 100 year old sounds at this point? You know, some of those

640
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:29,390
sounds are almost 100 years old. Yeah. Most of those people are dead. I heard that back in the

641
00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:36,390
days is, you know, this is from when the crowds were overly enthusiastic. So. Yeah. So. So anyway.

642
00:57:36,570 --> 00:57:41,910
So, yeah. To pick up where we left off, though, I think it's important to discuss something that

643
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:48,930
is often discussed elsewhere. But but obviously it won't be discussed the same way here. And look,

644
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:58,330
common parlance for me. I'll I'll use the term fear porn because people seem to get addicted to

645
00:57:58,970 --> 00:58:06,050
sources which provide them with information that is meant to evoke an emotional reaction.

646
00:58:06,710 --> 00:58:12,310
And fear is one of the easiest ones that that one can observe. Right. They make you afraid

647
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:17,250
of something. You're afraid of an enemy. You're afraid of a disease. We brought up disease already

648
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:24,150
dis ease already during this discussion. Right. But they make you afraid. They put it to you.

649
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:31,670
They broadcast it. And collectively, there is a response. And the collective response is,

650
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:38,010
guess what, designed to be that way. It's not accidental that that you're being encouraged.

651
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:42,970
Be afraid of the disease. Be afraid of this nation. Be afraid of this kind of people.

652
00:58:43,110 --> 00:58:48,010
Be afraid of people who believe this. It doesn't matter. Right wingers, Christians,

653
00:58:48,810 --> 00:58:55,010
the Arabs, they're coming to get you. They're coming to get you. This is all a charade, really

654
00:58:55,690 --> 00:59:02,730
meant to evoke what fear create an emotional response. And the same mind is in the spirit.

655
00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:07,670
And it does. They do the same thing when it comes to now fear. Fear porn is easy,

656
00:59:07,950 --> 00:59:13,670
easy to recognize. But they also encourage you about certain things. Right. Hey, listen,

657
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:17,870
the economy is doing better. You know why? Here's these numbers. Nobody understands the numbers.

658
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:22,250
Nobody knows how they were collected. It doesn't. Actually, it's irrelevant.

659
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:29,890
They just told you things are better. And suddenly the behaviors on mass change.

660
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:36,510
This. Well, that's that's why I want to shoot by you that it's not just fear. You can make

661
00:59:36,510 --> 00:59:41,550
people so overly happy that they'll gladly tie someone to a stake and light them on fire.

662
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:47,370
Well, and there you have it, because they can now encourage all sorts of things that you

663
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:54,250
happiness. Yeah. Yeah. Or you can make a group of people in a sports venue so happy that their

664
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:59,270
team won. They go outside and start flipping cars and setting garbage cans on fire. Yeah,

665
00:59:59,290 --> 01:00:03,710
because you're supposed to care that, you know, insert football team's name here or whatever

666
01:00:03,710 --> 01:00:08,210
that they got a bonus for winning a championship. That matters to you.

667
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:13,990
It's emotion, basically, and that's the governing. Well, yeah, yes, I would say

668
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:19,210
governing either limit or or or let's say the limit, because I think we spoke earlier that

669
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:27,270
there is no memory limit. Right. Where they put a cap on it by saying, look how this intellectual

670
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:31,390
person or whatever, you know, you can't if you could be as smart as him. That's all you have

671
01:00:31,390 --> 01:00:35,690
to be. Right. There's no limit to what the human mind can, let's say, memorize or learn.

672
01:00:35,690 --> 01:00:41,930
It's limitless. It has no cap on it. Right. That's why I don't buy all the A.I. stuff there.

673
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:48,190
There is an A.I. That's another discussion, because if you are not our most powerful being,

674
01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:51,390
why would you do things yourself? Right. You know, like if you're very, very wealthy,

675
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:58,870
you have a staff do things for you. Right. So. We covered most of thing,

676
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:04,050
most things that are generally purposeful when we refer to the body and the soul

677
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:09,710
or the health condition. And in a general sense, you cannot generalize those things because they're

678
01:01:09,710 --> 01:01:16,130
very, very specific. But what's even more specific about the lack of ability to generalize on those

679
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:23,050
things is the specificness of each spirit, because the spirit, who you are is the spirit,

680
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:30,390
the mind, the personality of each individual. And that is not interchangeable as the soul

681
01:01:30,390 --> 01:01:36,070
and the body might be. With consciousness transfer, your spirit can be put into another body. I love

682
01:01:36,070 --> 01:01:42,070
when they show this in sci-fi, taking someone's mind or spirit, putting it in a dog and vice versa.

683
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:48,050
Right. Well, again, I know you love Star Trek as an example anyway. Yeah, they've done that there,

684
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:52,390
too. Yeah. Well, certainly. And even in the 60s. Right. One of the most famous and terrible

685
01:01:52,390 --> 01:01:57,930
episodes of Star Trek, honestly, was they called Spock's Brain. You might recall this one

686
01:01:58,870 --> 01:02:04,970
where they literally took Spock's consciousness and put it in a box. Right. So it's in a box. I

687
01:02:04,970 --> 01:02:10,670
mean, to me, this is transhumanism in the 60s being shown to us. Sure. But it's been done

688
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:16,330
since the 30s. Oh, look, I'm not saying that it's about the reality. I'm saying that as far as,

689
01:02:16,350 --> 01:02:21,290
you know, public demonstration. Right. They showed, OK, Spock's body is getting to walk around

690
01:02:21,290 --> 01:02:26,490
because they put this mechanism on his head. And therefore, this was supposed to give control of

691
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:33,050
the brain to somebody with switches and all this. But meanwhile, his consciousness, his spirit,

692
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:38,850
his soul, mind, his mind. No, not his. Actually, sorry, not his soul. His soul is in his body.

693
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:46,270
He was kind of listless and on sort of life support when that was done. There's other ones

694
01:02:46,270 --> 01:02:51,270
where another person's body like I think Kirk was switched with a woman back and forth. Oh,

695
01:02:51,290 --> 01:02:55,290
right. Right. She was Kirk. Right. That was another one. Another one of the bad episodes,

696
01:02:55,290 --> 01:03:00,670
right. But Spock, in this case, I think he was just an automaton. They put a band on his head

697
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:05,970
and his soul was still going and his body was going. But his mind and his spirit,

698
01:03:06,470 --> 01:03:12,810
you see, even I catch myself. I think I caught you on that soul thing. I'm not being a stickler about

699
01:03:12,810 --> 01:03:19,110
it, but it's important that we if we practice enough to be a stickler, then you won't have

700
01:03:19,110 --> 01:03:26,710
to be a stickler. Right. It'll just be natural. And go back to how we started. You can't come out

701
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:32,370
and tell people this is the way it is. This is how you should do it. They won't you know, people

702
01:03:32,370 --> 01:03:38,030
will find that as an affront. But if you just give hints and suggestions, people won't do it either

703
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:42,570
if they don't get the hint. So there's somewhere in between where I cannot emphasize enough the

704
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:48,350
difference between the three, but how the soul and the body are really, really in union. Once

705
01:03:48,350 --> 01:03:53,650
you consider there's consciousness transfer. Right. And, you know, just to transfer an idea

706
01:03:53,650 --> 01:03:59,190
to people, I also set things up so you'll knock them down sometimes. Just OK. That's good. But

707
01:03:59,190 --> 01:04:07,450
anyway, posthumous. Yeah. So so look, put it put it in one way. I wrapped up what we wrapped up,

708
01:04:07,490 --> 01:04:14,130
let's say generalizations, specific generalizations about the soul, health at the body and health

709
01:04:14,130 --> 01:04:20,350
and how they're attached and how to view it in a way that it just means the way the collective use

710
01:04:20,350 --> 01:04:25,850
it is ridiculous from one side and how ineffective it is. There are many people that have gone to

711
01:04:25,850 --> 01:04:30,610
health seminars and feel like they've gained something. But mostly it's because they that's

712
01:04:30,610 --> 01:04:35,410
what they were told to say. Someone else said it and they they really don't get much out of it.

713
01:04:36,670 --> 01:04:41,770
That's long term. And then if they think they are, they hit through long term practice. They'll see

714
01:04:41,770 --> 01:04:46,170
it's not effective. And this is just the way humans have been string along, strung along for

715
01:04:46,170 --> 01:04:53,110
a long time. We gave a little bit of the example of the pain issue. Was it daily? No. Was it weekly?

716
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:58,050
No. Was it monthly? No. It was seasonal. Right. So it's very everyone is very different. But

717
01:04:58,890 --> 01:05:03,590
even though we showed how you can't generalize with the health and the body because there are

718
01:05:03,590 --> 01:05:09,930
specifics, the spirit is even more specific because the body and the soul are interchangeable. Right.

719
01:05:09,930 --> 01:05:18,430
But the spirit is not no matter where your spirit goes or does, it's going to be you

720
01:05:18,970 --> 01:05:25,030
always and just you. And that's what makes you you. Right. It's it's I mean, how else

721
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:32,530
can we say it? And you brought up the fear aspect. And is it usually fear based on good,

722
01:05:32,650 --> 01:05:37,550
solid, concrete information? Or is just because some authority figure said you were taught at a

723
01:05:37,550 --> 01:05:41,810
age like we mentioned the last time that was respectable and because they're respectable,

724
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:46,110
they what they're saying is correct. Right. You see. So it's emotional.

725
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:53,370
Well, and that's that's the thing, though, is now where does emotion really come from?

726
01:05:53,890 --> 01:05:59,850
I talked about a way to access it. Right. It's just there through external input. Oh,

727
01:05:59,870 --> 01:06:05,350
wait, that sounds familiar. But through external input, you can access that

728
01:06:05,350 --> 01:06:14,270
if someone is susceptible. Right. If someone is willing to accept that word from the authority

729
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:18,770
and that authority, again, could be the government agent, could be the just the TV in general.

730
01:06:19,490 --> 01:06:24,550
It could be the matter, the chief of the tribe or the coach in a football team, let's say.

731
01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:31,630
But but here, you know, where does it come from? OK, it's just part of the the way the spirit

732
01:06:31,630 --> 01:06:39,070
interacts again with the soul and the body. OK, so the condition of the mind, I'll be using mind

733
01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:43,970
and spirit and personality interchangeably, just like breath and soul are interchangeable. The

734
01:06:43,970 --> 01:06:50,510
body seems to land on itself just being the body. But the mind and the spirit, your personality,

735
01:06:50,790 --> 01:06:57,070
uniqueness, who makes you you is the spirit, the mind, personality. It's very, very unique.

736
01:06:57,070 --> 01:07:03,670
But what's interesting is it has an attribute which, again, if we go back to Star Trek,

737
01:07:03,810 --> 01:07:11,570
certain cultures eliminated emotion. Right. They tried to because it was usually led to detriment.

738
01:07:12,290 --> 01:07:16,910
But if you look at, let's say, why the Vulcans got rid of emotions, because it almost led to

739
01:07:16,910 --> 01:07:24,450
them completely wiping themselves out, which is very extreme. So what that means is the Vulcans

740
01:07:24,450 --> 01:07:29,750
better because they're not emotion. Well, in some cases, but and they went overboard because

741
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:35,670
they didn't have to do what they did, getting rid of emotion because it was an extreme situation.

742
01:07:37,450 --> 01:07:43,050
One of the markers of of a believable A.I. is that when people communicate with it is that

743
01:07:43,050 --> 01:07:49,430
it has emotion, you see. But what I'm trying to convey is there is this something we call emotion

744
01:07:49,990 --> 01:07:57,030
and everyone accepts it. It goes. It also borders the boundary of sanity, by the way.

745
01:07:57,430 --> 01:08:03,250
And maybe we'll get into it a little bit, because someone who is a very mild mannered person that

746
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:07,350
does something totally out of character and harms others, let's say, in a criminal sense,

747
01:08:07,370 --> 01:08:13,770
like going postal or whatever. Right. They that was an emotional response they had.

748
01:08:13,770 --> 01:08:19,510
And usually they may not suffer the full consequences because they plead insanity.

749
01:08:20,149 --> 01:08:24,850
You see, that's what I mean. It's the boundary. That's just an extreme example. The same with

750
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:30,870
someone being overly infatuated and enamored with someone and then noticing that that was just a

751
01:08:30,870 --> 01:08:37,830
temporary thing. So it goes both both many. The spectrum is very wide, but the ability for the

752
01:08:37,830 --> 01:08:45,470
emotions to be a function of the spirit, the mind and it having an overarching effect on the on the

753
01:08:45,470 --> 01:08:50,510
rest of the being, the soul and the body is something that has been completely skirted and

754
01:08:50,510 --> 01:08:57,510
not spoken of publicly. And this is this is goes into this discussion almost of have you ever heard

755
01:08:57,510 --> 01:09:03,569
like in scientific terms, non-Newtonian, right? It's like something that doesn't obey the regular

756
01:09:03,569 --> 01:09:08,710
laws of physics, you know. So they still keep you in the Newtonian thing, like, for example,

757
01:09:08,890 --> 01:09:14,229
cornstarch and liquid. If you vibrate it, it becomes solid during the vibration. Right. And

758
01:09:14,229 --> 01:09:17,490
then you take the vibration off. It goes back to being a liquid. Right. So they call it a

759
01:09:17,490 --> 01:09:24,830
non-Newtonian fluid. So when you when we reach into the study of the mind, it's the psychology field.

760
01:09:25,390 --> 01:09:29,529
So this is all going to be non-Freudian, which is like they have non-Newtonian.

761
01:09:29,529 --> 01:09:36,790
These things do not fall into that limited kind of joke called, you know, Freud, which, by the way,

762
01:09:36,830 --> 01:09:41,689
Freud was more heavily into dream interpretation than anything else. And also he suggested to all

763
01:09:41,689 --> 01:09:47,710
the world authorities that everyone should be taking cocaine, by the way, constantly. So well,

764
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:57,170
because it excites. But anyway. Yeah. So the spirit and the emotion is they're so linked and so

765
01:09:57,890 --> 01:10:04,030
close together that we live in separation of them, just like the Vulcans kind of like

766
01:10:04,030 --> 01:10:12,170
separated completely. And but yet we cannot. We're always using it. And it's also a major effect on

767
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:16,870
how the spirit affects the body and the soul. So we're going to maybe delve into that a little

768
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:20,710
bit because we're going to be bringing that up again in the future. Yes. And I think it's a look

769
01:10:20,710 --> 01:10:27,210
and I have a very solid question about this, I think, because it's it's very important to note

770
01:10:27,210 --> 01:10:32,350
again. And I think I mentioned this on the first Sonic, but they say that you lost your mind,

771
01:10:32,450 --> 01:10:38,470
you know, when you seem to be more overwhelmingly governed by your emotions one way or another.

772
01:10:39,510 --> 01:10:45,110
I think it's kind of a relatively good phrase, actually, when you lost your mind,

773
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:53,830
sort of because it indicates that you're not using your your more solid, logical mind.

774
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:59,170
We're not using your mind is one thing, but losing your mind when I hear losing your mind

775
01:10:59,170 --> 01:11:03,190
in a literal sense, it means possession. You're possessed by another mind.

776
01:11:03,330 --> 01:11:08,250
Well, this this is true. But is it? Yeah. But they don't call that losing you. They call that

777
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:12,710
possession. They call that possession because if one loses their mind and their mind less

778
01:11:12,710 --> 01:11:18,850
unless something else steps in to become their mind. So, look, logically, you could be you can

779
01:11:18,850 --> 01:11:25,070
be mindless, just like if this if you're transferred, the spirit is transferred out of the

780
01:11:25,070 --> 01:11:30,750
physical container, the container, which is the soul and the body. Right. You are mindless. Yeah.

781
01:11:30,830 --> 01:11:36,010
Does it you can be mindless and still be breathing and walking and talking and running for president

782
01:11:36,010 --> 01:11:42,950
or what did I just say? I'm sorry. Or whatever. Right. You did. OK. Anyway. Yeah. OK. That's all

783
01:11:42,950 --> 01:11:47,390
that they should walk. Don't run. Yeah. Someone running is running for a position. I said,

784
01:11:47,530 --> 01:11:51,610
why don't you try walking instead of running? Might be to figure out what's going on. Might

785
01:11:51,610 --> 01:11:59,470
be a bit safer for all involved, but don't run. Yeah. But look, this is one question. I'm sorry.

786
01:11:59,650 --> 01:12:03,470
One question. I think it's going to set you off, actually, into a very interesting direction

787
01:12:03,470 --> 01:12:12,610
because, OK, when people talk about this and, you know, I think much like the mind is limitless

788
01:12:12,610 --> 01:12:19,230
for the information it can take in. We don't know what that limit is. I would say that emotion,

789
01:12:19,390 --> 01:12:27,010
on the other hand, is not the same because I think it's not even non-Newtonian, you know,

790
01:12:27,030 --> 01:12:31,850
non-Freudian or even well, non-Freudian. I don't know because we're speaking of psyche,

791
01:12:31,850 --> 01:12:37,850
the PSY prefix, the mind, psyche, spirit. Right. And that's look. But it's it's it's

792
01:12:37,850 --> 01:12:43,470
interesting to me because I think it's just that the rules are there. There are governing principles,

793
01:12:43,630 --> 01:12:49,750
a logic to it. I think that they're not easily understood at this time. I think nobody understands

794
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:57,650
it. But emotionally, like you said, you know, even the response that one might have to being

795
01:12:57,650 --> 01:13:03,910
overwhelmingly infatuated with someone. Right. This is another form of, you know, yes, you're

796
01:13:03,910 --> 01:13:09,910
you're adhering to emotional response a lot more than thinking usually. And that's not even a bad

797
01:13:09,910 --> 01:13:16,090
thing there, because, look, anybody could observe that when you first are encountering somebody in

798
01:13:16,090 --> 01:13:23,550
an amorous relationship that often, often, very often, you're much more intense about it, let's

799
01:13:23,550 --> 01:13:28,950
say, at the beginning. You're falling also, aren't you? Right. They call it falling. Why do you want

800
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:33,690
to fall in love and not rise in love? That's another common issue there. But I think the

801
01:13:33,690 --> 01:13:39,150
language, if we pay attention to the language and it's not like the word nice, you just basically

802
01:13:39,150 --> 01:13:45,050
falling is falling. So no, look, Chuck, what I'm trying to somehow introduce, which it's hard to

803
01:13:45,050 --> 01:13:51,970
put out, is that the emotion is a component of the spirit. But showing the Vulcan analogy, how they

804
01:13:51,970 --> 01:13:57,870
wiped it out, is it really? Yeah. I mean, you could like circumcision, for example. Right. Well,

805
01:13:57,870 --> 01:14:02,830
but they did. Everyone's born with and then they do the chop. So they kind of like emotion did a

806
01:14:02,830 --> 01:14:06,770
spiritual circumcision. The Vulcans, right, where they eliminated it. But here's the thing. They

807
01:14:06,770 --> 01:14:11,010
didn't eliminate it. If you notice, the struggle is still subject to it. They were still subject

808
01:14:11,010 --> 01:14:16,130
to it. It was something they couldn't separate, but they were supposed to be under a discipline,

809
01:14:16,130 --> 01:14:22,890
right, where logic was a discipline. And that was supposed to be this. Well, it was only accepted

810
01:14:22,890 --> 01:14:28,090
and all the emotions were not acceptable. They're not acceptable. But but they did acknowledge that

811
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:31,630
they were there. I mean, look, you can't say something is unacceptable if it doesn't exist.

812
01:14:31,630 --> 01:14:36,990
So the thing is, it must exist for it to be unacceptable. Right. Right. And when you don't

813
01:14:36,990 --> 01:14:41,910
accept it, it doesn't mean it still does. It still exists. Right. But here's the thing, though. There

814
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:47,990
is no what I'm trying to maybe look, I've been talking about this for over a decade and I still

815
01:14:47,990 --> 01:14:55,270
haven't prevailed in a very simple way to about emotion. But just because you cannot fully define

816
01:14:55,270 --> 01:14:58,650
something doesn't mean you can't use it. Right. Electricity. Anyone will tell you we don't know

817
01:14:58,650 --> 01:15:04,350
exactly what it is, but we use it. So what's the point? Maybe I'll say it again a different way.

818
01:15:05,110 --> 01:15:12,090
The spirit is the mind, what makes you you and it tends to be dominant. The what the body and the

819
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:17,990
soul, your living body, a container is animating the spirit. OK, but the spirit can be transferred.

820
01:15:18,710 --> 01:15:23,350
But even when it's transferred, it seems like the emotion is part of the mind and the spirit,

821
01:15:23,430 --> 01:15:30,550
not part of the metabolism in the body. So the emotion discussing emotion that is a quote unquote

822
01:15:30,550 --> 01:15:35,910
psychological or spiritual topic. So and I can't see how it could be separated, just like you

823
01:15:35,910 --> 01:15:42,010
brought up it just because it's not accepted. It's not there. It's still part of the spirit,

824
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:46,330
just like, for example, the male is born with a foreskin. And then what in some cultures,

825
01:15:46,390 --> 01:15:51,330
what do they do? They cut it off. Right. So when the spirit comes in, it's always it always has

826
01:15:51,910 --> 01:15:58,730
an emotion. And then whether it's dealt with, acknowledged, you know, or cut off, it doesn't

827
01:15:58,730 --> 01:16:04,010
mean that it's separate. You see, it's the same unit. And this is not being there is no science

828
01:16:04,010 --> 01:16:10,230
of it. It's meaning the study of it. It's bundled with psychology. That's what I'm saying. This is

829
01:16:10,230 --> 01:16:16,350
non Freudian, non Jungian. Right. Just like something that doesn't a liquid that reacts

830
01:16:16,350 --> 01:16:23,070
like a solid is called non-Newtonian because it's still trying to preserve the standard BS. Right.

831
01:16:23,070 --> 01:16:33,270
Um, so when here's the thing, we get plenty of examples or try to be specific, how you can't be

832
01:16:33,270 --> 01:16:38,410
general, you have to be specific about the body, the health and all these other things. The spirit

833
01:16:38,410 --> 01:16:44,490
is so specific. And each each individual will who makes me me and makes you you and all the

834
01:16:44,490 --> 01:16:49,490
veritable plethora of people that I've ever been on this planet or whatever are extremely

835
01:16:50,510 --> 01:16:55,590
individualistic, more individualistic than the body and the soul of the body is, let's just say,

836
01:16:56,830 --> 01:17:03,090
but attached to that is the emotional body, let's say. And this is something that is completely,

837
01:17:03,830 --> 01:17:09,290
let's just say there is no science of it. There is psychology, and they blend it, but there is no

838
01:17:09,290 --> 01:17:14,450
science and no discussion. First of all, what is the purpose of it? You know, but then again,

839
01:17:14,450 --> 01:17:20,110
if we speak of the body, okay, what's the purpose of the pinky finger, right? Well, I don't know,

840
01:17:20,190 --> 01:17:23,810
what's the purpose of the thumb? Well, it's an opposing member without a thumb, you can't button

841
01:17:23,810 --> 01:17:28,550
a shirt. What's the purpose of the appendix or whatever? See, so the purpose can be found,

842
01:17:29,290 --> 01:17:34,630
even if what's the pinky finger or the appendix, which is argued, but when we come up to what's the

843
01:17:34,630 --> 01:17:39,610
purpose of emotion, there is not no discussion. Well, right. And even though even the little toe,

844
01:17:39,830 --> 01:17:43,990
you know, where where I've heard people argue that the smallest toe on your foot actually

845
01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:50,350
doesn't serve a purpose, but it does. And it did. You know, and here you go, there is a discuss,

846
01:17:50,450 --> 01:17:55,110
see that what I'm saying is there's no discussion on the purpose of emotion, not discussing emotion,

847
01:17:55,190 --> 01:18:02,310
but the purpose, right. But nonetheless, it's still always part of the situation. So and what

848
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:09,110
strikes me here is that it would clearly have to be as individual. Like you said, the body, we can

849
01:18:09,110 --> 01:18:15,490
also observe commonalities with the body, right? There is a general given structure, human beings

850
01:18:15,490 --> 01:18:23,130
are bipeds, let's say, okay, so we walk on to two feet, generally speaking, right? This is our normal

851
01:18:23,130 --> 01:18:28,950
construct. There's one head, right? We don't have tails. I mean, there are things five stars,

852
01:18:29,090 --> 01:18:33,530
it's the star configuration, anthropomorphic. And the anthropomorphic representation is in

853
01:18:33,530 --> 01:18:39,110
the pentacle. Yes. But that's the thing is, I think the whole thing is actually represented in

854
01:18:39,110 --> 01:18:44,470
the pentacle, because the circle around it is that atmosphere you were talking about. And each one of

855
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:50,450
the compartments in the pentacle is a compartment, you know, one section of the star is an arm,

856
01:18:50,770 --> 01:18:55,450
another section is an arm, the top of the star is the head, the two sections on the bottom are

857
01:18:55,450 --> 01:19:00,910
the legs. And it doesn't have to be like an example, an octopus would be far more functional,

858
01:19:00,910 --> 01:19:04,390
right? Well, think about, you know, the one man band, if you're an octopus.

859
01:19:04,850 --> 01:19:09,430
Well, but the pentacle is for the human construct, is what I'm saying.

860
01:19:09,430 --> 01:19:15,610
Well, we've taken it that way. But that's the way I interpret it, that's all. But that's the way I

861
01:19:15,610 --> 01:19:19,790
interpret it, is that's what it is. And that's what it appears to be representing. So I'm just

862
01:19:19,790 --> 01:19:27,030
saying, though, is that the emotion, though, like you said, there is no definition, because I think

863
01:19:27,030 --> 01:19:32,630
it's also individual, like you said, you know, look, everybody's like, we can't generally discuss

864
01:19:32,630 --> 01:19:37,890
health, I don't think you can generally discuss the effectively, you could generally discuss it,

865
01:19:38,030 --> 01:19:42,930
like saying it's seasonal, it's in, you know, don't eat stuff that's toxic, or stay hydrated.

866
01:19:43,110 --> 01:19:48,530
But for each individual person, it's actually far more specific. And it must be a general

867
01:19:48,530 --> 01:19:52,370
knowledge of how specific it is. So it could be applied. So you don't have these general discussions.

868
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:58,050
But I just want to let's just go back to the, the emotion, there's a lot of talk about emotion.

869
01:19:58,850 --> 01:20:05,290
But there is no talk about the why we were imbued or endowed with it is what I'm trying to say.

870
01:20:05,610 --> 01:20:11,270
And what I have discovered by looking at the behavior is that people do things, you know,

871
01:20:11,330 --> 01:20:17,410
people can you have demographics and people can be categorized, right. And when you hear that person

872
01:20:17,410 --> 01:20:24,190
operating, let's say, out of that norm that they're known to exhibit, it's usually blamed

873
01:20:24,190 --> 01:20:31,250
on what emotion. So it seems like this impetus and it's not part of the body, it's part of the mind.

874
01:20:32,230 --> 01:20:38,450
Right? So what is it? Why do we even have it? Why? What is it doing? What it's doing is it's

875
01:20:38,450 --> 01:20:45,070
tapping in to the way we interact with the environment with the body's ability and super

876
01:20:45,070 --> 01:20:53,970
ability. What I mean about that is, was very popular metaphor given where the 90 pound soccer

877
01:20:53,970 --> 01:20:59,690
mom flips the minivan with the children inside and she's able at that moment of panic,

878
01:21:00,550 --> 01:21:08,090
roll the van back over herself to get the children out. Right? Right. You can get all the 90 pound

879
01:21:08,090 --> 01:21:12,050
soccer moms in the world to lay down a minivan or lay down a minute and have them pick it up.

880
01:21:12,050 --> 01:21:19,230
They can't. But why? What? Well, well, her desire to save the children. Right. Was that

881
01:21:19,230 --> 01:21:24,210
mental? Was it physical? No, it was the emotional component that allowed that to happen.

882
01:21:24,310 --> 01:21:28,910
Right. The mild. Well, you've the postal rate, which is literally the post guy working at the

883
01:21:28,910 --> 01:21:34,070
post office or whatever, goes back on his day off and shoots everyone. Right. Right. Outside

884
01:21:34,070 --> 01:21:39,190
of character. Again, outside of character, outside of I mean, in the case of the soccer mom, you're

885
01:21:39,190 --> 01:21:44,830
talking about something that in the normal circumstance, right in the typical circumstance

886
01:21:45,470 --> 01:21:48,750
is not something that can be achieved, not something that can be accomplished

887
01:21:49,270 --> 01:21:54,010
because a 90 pound woman is not able to lift the car. It's always to lift the car off the kid.

888
01:21:54,270 --> 01:21:57,830
Right. Actually, no one really can. Maybe some elite power lifter can.

889
01:21:58,290 --> 01:22:04,130
Well, it is very difficult. I've seen it done. Small car, you know, lifted up by someone very

890
01:22:04,130 --> 01:22:10,670
strong. Sure. But, you know, so. So what is this emotion? Purpose? Well, it seems that we

891
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:17,170
the exhibit is we've seen extremely radical behavior come out and actually super physical

892
01:22:17,170 --> 01:22:21,590
behavior. Right. In the case of the soccer mom, that's super physical because from a physics

893
01:22:21,590 --> 01:22:26,570
perspective that she would have torn all of the ligaments in her body, but she was able to do it.

894
01:22:26,570 --> 01:22:34,970
So there's something, quote unquote, supernatural of about the whole interrelation between the

895
01:22:34,970 --> 01:22:40,970
emotional body and the spiritual body, which is the mind interacting with the physical body.

896
01:22:41,150 --> 01:22:45,770
So there's this emotional component. And again, what I'm stressing here is not that there's no

897
01:22:45,770 --> 01:22:51,170
discussion about emotion that's in the psychological field, but there is no discussion intrinsically

898
01:22:51,170 --> 01:23:00,410
about why we have it. And I'm trying to give examples here on it's there. Basically, we don't

899
01:23:00,410 --> 01:23:06,990
know what it is, but we see it exhibited giving super physical powers to the soccer mom or extremely

900
01:23:06,990 --> 01:23:12,910
radical, you know, the guy that goes postal or like the guy who a woman who is super enamored

901
01:23:12,910 --> 01:23:17,790
will do anything for someone that they've, quote unquote, fall in love with. This is all emotional.

902
01:23:18,430 --> 01:23:25,470
And what I'm trying to do is bring up a way of thinking about it rationally, even though all

903
01:23:25,470 --> 01:23:29,490
those things that we mentioned are irrational. There is a rational reason why we have it.

904
01:23:29,990 --> 01:23:40,330
And that is outside of the norm consideration. What I mean by that is that there's no way the

905
01:23:40,330 --> 01:23:46,090
90 pound woman could lift the minivan. There's no reason really, or there's no way someone would go

906
01:23:46,090 --> 01:23:51,630
and shoot all their co workers or fall in love and give up everything they have for an emotion

907
01:23:51,630 --> 01:23:59,070
is so extreme. So outside of forget about normal, just like super physical behaviors and things like

908
01:23:59,070 --> 01:24:04,530
this. This emotion thing should be studied, right. And I've heard in a lot of the black

909
01:24:05,450 --> 01:24:12,410
operations project, there's even TV shows like Stranger Things or whatever, x men or whatever,

910
01:24:13,030 --> 01:24:18,270
where this is not even contemplated, but easily displayed, like when you see, let's go to the

911
01:24:18,270 --> 01:24:24,750
superhero or this the paranormal. If you watch something like x men or the heroes, you know,

912
01:24:24,770 --> 01:24:31,350
they've many things have been in fiction. When Mr. Freeze, for example, or the person who throws

913
01:24:31,350 --> 01:24:37,090
fire or the person who whatever, you notice what before they exhibit their power, they go into a

914
01:24:38,230 --> 01:24:44,750
emotional state, don't they? Right. That's true. And look, I discussed this, like say on my show

915
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:50,690
with Richard Allen Miller, which is I don't know if you're familiar with that guy. Dr. Ram. Yes,

916
01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:56,570
of course. Okay. So I'm sure we could spend time talking about him if we wanted to, but we're not.

917
01:24:57,090 --> 01:25:00,850
I just mentioned it. Well, here's the thing. I've been on personal calls with him and he did not

918
01:25:00,850 --> 01:25:06,450
like me. So I'm not there to take anyone's thunder away, but yeah, that's fine. But here

919
01:25:06,450 --> 01:25:12,670
is what is legitimate about things that he presents. And that is that he has been able to

920
01:25:13,690 --> 01:25:22,410
instruct people about how to tap into some of that and to change their mindset, so to speak,

921
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:28,350
to interpret things differently around them and create circumstances by which their behaviors can

922
01:25:28,350 --> 01:25:36,930
be changed, you know, where they can do things that normally would not be, you know, part of

923
01:25:36,930 --> 01:25:41,610
the normal behavior, normal character. Right. Right. And in the physical realm also, not just

924
01:25:41,610 --> 01:25:46,830
the quote unquote mental realm. Well, right. But first he begins with the mind, you know, in his

925
01:25:46,830 --> 01:25:51,390
practice. Right. And what do you have to do? You have to change your mind about the situation first.

926
01:25:51,390 --> 01:25:58,230
You know, I talked to him. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Somebody sent me his book, Power Tools for

927
01:25:58,230 --> 01:26:03,570
whatever, whatever. And I didn't I skimmed it. I didn't get anything practical out of it other than

928
01:26:03,570 --> 01:26:11,050
the example of practical examples that he gave. And I didn't find a bit defining what I brought

929
01:26:11,050 --> 01:26:16,430
up, which is why do we have emotions? No, that was the point I was going to get to is that he doesn't

930
01:26:16,430 --> 01:26:22,570
discuss any of the why. Yeah. Why we have emotions. And now that we well, OK, but you may never find

931
01:26:22,570 --> 01:26:27,470
out why. Yeah. Right. But he does talk about and many. But we know enough about it that we could

932
01:26:27,470 --> 01:26:32,130
probably use it just like electricity. But that was that was the point I was trying to get to is

933
01:26:32,130 --> 01:26:39,670
that many people have tried to demonstrate and have demonstrated that if you if you tap into this a bit,

934
01:26:39,670 --> 01:26:47,790
you can willfully change the circumstances, change your own limits of behavior and things.

935
01:26:48,030 --> 01:26:53,910
That's all I'm bringing it up. Yeah, I got you. But I like I said, what I focus like we just did,

936
01:26:53,990 --> 01:26:57,810
let's say, and I have been on the body and all these different subjects, it's because it's

937
01:26:57,810 --> 01:27:03,350
lacking out there. There's no reason to come out and do our project, whether it was the older

938
01:27:03,350 --> 01:27:07,870
Chilean, the Greek, or if I do an interview or even have a discussion, if we're just going to rehash

939
01:27:07,870 --> 01:27:12,350
things that have already been discussed by others. And because I'm not a person, I'm not a

940
01:27:13,550 --> 01:27:18,890
public person. Right. You know, this is not my lot, but I just happen to be because these things,

941
01:27:18,970 --> 01:27:24,670
I think, need to be somehow put out there. But OK, let's get back to the subject at hand in some

942
01:27:24,670 --> 01:27:31,450
capacity, because I don't know why we have them. But I do know that we we know enough about the

943
01:27:31,450 --> 01:27:38,390
effects of strong emotions or even just setting one's emotional state on the rest of the body and

944
01:27:38,390 --> 01:27:43,650
the environment. So what what I came up with, actually, someone else did on one of the private

945
01:27:43,650 --> 01:27:49,230
Skype calls a few years ago, they call it the emo work. It's very easy. Right. Emo. Right. So

946
01:27:50,070 --> 01:27:56,510
what I've discovered on that is that for sure it's part of the spirit. But if you stub your toe or

947
01:27:56,510 --> 01:28:00,990
you're in a lot of pain, it will the body will affect you. It's a two way street. But it comes

948
01:28:00,990 --> 01:28:10,110
with pre preloaded with our spiritual body, our spiritual self, what makes us us. And what's

949
01:28:10,110 --> 01:28:16,770
interesting also, if you read ancient texts, hey, if it says the gods are angry now, what is anger?

950
01:28:17,070 --> 01:28:23,730
It's an emotion. If the gods are happy, it's so apparently the gods are have it as well. OK,

951
01:28:23,730 --> 01:28:31,390
so all of the work, by the way, I don't know how to package this. So it's a continuation. It's a

952
01:28:31,390 --> 01:28:38,570
continual work. The emo work, you know what? OK. Don't know why it comes with the spirit,

953
01:28:38,690 --> 01:28:44,490
what its direct purpose is, but we have enough examples of what can happen when it's used,

954
01:28:44,730 --> 01:28:50,870
which is super physical. So why don't we tap into that? Right. Why don't we start working it? And

955
01:28:50,870 --> 01:28:57,850
the most basic level, the emo work and what I've come up with and really pondering this for about

956
01:28:57,850 --> 01:29:02,710
a decade and a half and in the last five years trying to communicate it to others and then

957
01:29:02,710 --> 01:29:09,710
getting feedback has been tremendous. Right. Right. Just like, for example, speaking of the

958
01:29:09,710 --> 01:29:13,990
body does not absorb anything. It's all by induction. And in getting feedback from others,

959
01:29:13,990 --> 01:29:20,030
there has been tremendous. But still, there is no general field in public discussion about this at

960
01:29:20,030 --> 01:29:26,990
all. So maybe we should get into like a specific example of the how the emotions can be used and

961
01:29:26,990 --> 01:29:33,090
for changing the environment. Well, why not? But the reason why I was just trying to set this up

962
01:29:33,090 --> 01:29:39,110
is that it is important. And I see it in a lot of other people's presentations,

963
01:29:39,730 --> 01:29:47,030
but it's never really explained quite well that, look, your emotional state will affect

964
01:29:47,030 --> 01:29:53,130
every other part. So that's the thing where we could be recording the sonic right now

965
01:29:53,130 --> 01:29:58,410
or doing the sonic. And if someone whispers in your ear some really bad news, it's going to change

966
01:29:59,710 --> 01:30:05,130
your behavior even to the point where you can't continue or the if it's really good news,

967
01:30:05,930 --> 01:30:11,730
it could it might change it again. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. But that's just on a mild level.

968
01:30:11,730 --> 01:30:17,790
But, you know, of course, someone in constant weather, whatever state it is, will experience

969
01:30:17,790 --> 01:30:23,910
drastic changes in their body. You see, this is beyond that. See, but that's why I brought up

970
01:30:23,910 --> 01:30:32,030
the constant fear point, right, where you're allowing that external input to come in to your

971
01:30:32,030 --> 01:30:37,730
mind. You then have an emotional reaction. And this will change your behaviors. I mean, right.

972
01:30:38,650 --> 01:30:42,690
You've brought this up several times and a lot of people do. I want to address it this way.

973
01:30:42,910 --> 01:30:48,750
If you can, with the fear, maybe we'll help anyone else, because I've been thinking about

974
01:30:48,750 --> 01:30:53,350
the fear thing a lot. So when I hear the fear point, as it doesn't affect me, it's actually

975
01:30:53,350 --> 01:30:58,990
stupid. So it's not the fear point. It's actually the state, the emotional state that it puts the,

976
01:30:59,070 --> 01:31:02,630
let's say, those in the collective. So now when you're dealing with the collective,

977
01:31:02,630 --> 01:31:08,770
they're in that fear state. And because of their lack of awareness or whatever,

978
01:31:09,390 --> 01:31:14,910
they then can become lean on the dangerous side, right? So when it's actually doing the fear,

979
01:31:15,170 --> 01:31:20,190
you know, most people stop with the discussion on the fear point. And that's fine. I usually

980
01:31:20,190 --> 01:31:25,790
avoid it because I don't see it as fear point. I see it as a way to set people up and to keep

981
01:31:25,790 --> 01:31:29,670
them in a state where they could easily be triggered and dangerous, just like you have a dog

982
01:31:30,130 --> 01:31:34,730
that's going to bark or bite. They're doing that with the population. It's part of

983
01:31:34,730 --> 01:31:39,690
self policing. And it's also a part of keeping them, you know, a lot of people say it makes you

984
01:31:39,690 --> 01:31:46,550
unstable. I disagree. I think when you put fear porn on the society, it stabilizes it, but it

985
01:31:46,550 --> 01:31:53,590
stabilizes it in a state of like having a dog, right? That's going to bite, right or bark at

986
01:31:53,590 --> 01:31:59,930
anything. See, and they lack the awareness of what's going on. But that's very well known.

987
01:31:59,990 --> 01:32:05,070
They'll tell you, by the way, I ran into so many people wearing masks. So what it is, I don't care

988
01:32:05,070 --> 01:32:11,550
if it's if it's natural or a weapon, or I don't care. I just I'm just doing it. Okay. Right. So

989
01:32:11,550 --> 01:32:16,490
now it doesn't matter what it is. It could have been slipping on a banana peel. If they're set

990
01:32:16,490 --> 01:32:22,530
up in that emotional state, where they're stabilized in a dangerous, they're ready to

991
01:32:22,530 --> 01:32:27,170
be triggered on that subject, right? Right. So basically, what they're doing is creating an army.

992
01:32:28,490 --> 01:32:33,090
They're militarizing. In other words, they're weaponizing the population with fear porn. I don't

993
01:32:33,090 --> 01:32:38,190
think you've ever heard this explanation. Well, it's actually they're actually weaponizing the

994
01:32:38,190 --> 01:32:43,430
society, right? Usually the alternative media talks about how it's misdirecting. It's not

995
01:32:43,430 --> 01:32:47,810
misdirection at all. Well, I do talk about the old could see the information is false. Yeah,

996
01:32:47,810 --> 01:32:53,010
no weaponizing. I talk about the misdirection. But I go further. And usually, quite frankly,

997
01:32:53,070 --> 01:32:58,790
I don't believe it's being heard. But I try to go further and say, look, the reason why I bring up

998
01:32:58,790 --> 01:33:06,290
the example of like, say, post 911, right, is not because of what the program was, it was the result.

999
01:33:06,410 --> 01:33:15,310
It caused people to instantaneously be ready to attack others, to be in that state where they

1000
01:33:15,310 --> 01:33:22,390
could be directed, whether they knew it or not, to do things that was well outside of their normal

1001
01:33:22,390 --> 01:33:27,370
character, they became weaponized. Exactly. This is the point of why I try and talk about it,

1002
01:33:27,470 --> 01:33:31,610
because so that this is the thing. Yeah, here's the thing when there's no fear porn,

1003
01:33:31,710 --> 01:33:35,250
the people are walking around thinking they have blood pressure, and they absorb nutrition,

1004
01:33:35,430 --> 01:33:42,550
or when Einstein is genius, or whatever, that's all misinformation, but that so what, you know,

1005
01:33:42,550 --> 01:33:47,830
they could be still controlled with that. But when you put fear on the people, you're creating a more

1006
01:33:47,830 --> 01:33:54,470
homogenous state. And it's they're easy to make, it's easy to make them reactionary. So I see,

1007
01:33:55,190 --> 01:33:59,150
how many times have we said stupid people are dangerous, or a lot of stupid people in a large

1008
01:33:59,150 --> 01:34:04,650
crowd, or, you know, whatever, there's many sayings about it, right. So here's the thing,

1009
01:34:04,730 --> 01:34:09,310
the collective will never be enlightened, and we're good, we'll get into because if they were,

1010
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:16,890
then there would be no collective, right. So we'll maybe get into the, the emotional aspect of,

1011
01:34:17,130 --> 01:34:21,990
of that real, real simple. It's people that are in the collective that fall for the fear porn.

1012
01:34:22,430 --> 01:34:29,450
What is the typical comment made about them? They are what asleep? Right? Now, is it really

1013
01:34:29,450 --> 01:34:32,930
the sleeping state? They're not asleep. I mean, sleep means you're laying down, eyes closed,

1014
01:34:33,050 --> 01:34:36,410
REM state, whatever, whatever. No, they're walking around, they're walking around,

1015
01:34:36,410 --> 01:34:42,190
they call them walking dead, or whatever. There's an emotion attached to sleep. It's the emo of

1016
01:34:42,190 --> 01:34:47,750
sleep. I'm I feel sleepy, there's an emotional or when you think about what I need to prepare

1017
01:34:47,750 --> 01:34:53,090
when I go to sleep, there's an emotion, right? So they're emotionally asleep. It's their emotions

1018
01:34:53,090 --> 01:34:57,310
that are asleep. And it's the same with the fear. It's also when they do the fear porn,

1019
01:34:57,390 --> 01:35:02,830
it's very important that they don't trigger emotions. They they let them know that this

1020
01:35:02,830 --> 01:35:07,370
has been very well thought of, and it's what they should believe, but don't think about it

1021
01:35:07,370 --> 01:35:11,870
too much, right? That is the other thing that attaches to that. And they have plenty of things

1022
01:35:11,870 --> 01:35:15,350
that if you think about it, you're going to be ridiculed, you're a loose nut,

1023
01:35:15,530 --> 01:35:18,890
you're a wing nut or whatever, or you're a conspiracy theorist, right? So you don't want

1024
01:35:18,890 --> 01:35:27,790
to be that. Right? So anyway, it's a very difficult subject. But since we're broaching

1025
01:35:27,790 --> 01:35:36,650
it here, give an example of the emotional control that or lack of control. But without

1026
01:35:36,650 --> 01:35:41,390
even going further on the control of the emotion, you can do a very simple experiment.

1027
01:35:43,070 --> 01:35:48,850
How much you could you control something that you know very little about its purpose

1028
01:35:49,370 --> 01:35:56,170
is a difficult area to venture. But you know that it's repeatable, right? Just like, though, most

1029
01:35:57,270 --> 01:36:01,370
scientists, quote, unquote, if you ask them, explain to me what electricity is,

1030
01:36:01,810 --> 01:36:06,450
and you hear all the blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. If you challenge them on it, you know what

1031
01:36:06,450 --> 01:36:12,030
they all finally say is we really don't know what it is, but we know enough about it to use it.

1032
01:36:13,090 --> 01:36:18,370
Right? So I always want to land on that with the with the emotion. Why were we you know,

1033
01:36:18,390 --> 01:36:22,810
what is it? Why is it attached to the spirit? Why is it attached to the mind? But

1034
01:36:23,390 --> 01:36:28,990
I like I said earlier, man repeating myself maybe being redundant, we could see what it does. And

1035
01:36:28,990 --> 01:36:35,110
the effects are super physical, supernatural in many cases, as well. So how do you how do you

1036
01:36:35,110 --> 01:36:39,530
start wrangling this in? You know, like, how do you like tying your shoelaces, right? If you've

1037
01:36:39,530 --> 01:36:43,290
never been if you're an adult, you don't know how to do that. You really have to think about it the

1038
01:36:43,290 --> 01:36:47,570
first few times and you may not do it right, right. But this is not a matter of doing it right

1039
01:36:47,570 --> 01:36:56,710
or wrong. But let's give an example. With the emotion, for example, you have to pick an emotion.

1040
01:36:58,990 --> 01:37:06,710
And when you gesture physically, generally, the emotion comes forward. In other words,

1041
01:37:06,750 --> 01:37:12,230
here's the body triggering that what's in reserved or in the on file in the spirit.

1042
01:37:13,270 --> 01:37:18,790
When people are sad, you know, there's a old psychological thing is that if you feel depressed

1043
01:37:18,790 --> 01:37:23,830
or whatever, tilt your head back, look up towards the ceiling or the sky and smile and hold that

1044
01:37:23,830 --> 01:37:29,170
smile for 10 seconds and then just relax, bring your head back down. You don't feel as depressed

1045
01:37:29,170 --> 01:37:37,210
or sad, right? Because that smile, you see. So that is a gesture feeling happy. Right now the same

1046
01:37:37,210 --> 01:37:42,970
works with the frown. If you are feeling OK or happy and you gesture, let's say a frown.

1047
01:37:44,110 --> 01:37:48,050
Hold it for 10 seconds and gesture your body, slot your shoulders and all that.

1048
01:37:48,510 --> 01:37:52,830
You will suddenly feel this sadness coming upon you, even though there's no logical or,

1049
01:37:52,830 --> 01:38:00,270
you know, rational reason to write. So we see that the body gesture will trigger the emotion.

1050
01:38:00,270 --> 01:38:07,450
OK, one the main thing that I introduce on this is most common thing since we just spoke about the

1051
01:38:07,450 --> 01:38:14,190
body and health is how many times you hear, especially in the airy fairy community, whatever

1052
01:38:14,770 --> 01:38:20,210
this person sick, send them some healing energy. You hear that all the time, all the time. Yeah.

1053
01:38:20,650 --> 01:38:26,310
And do the people usually get better? I mean, 99.99% of the time person doesn't get better,

1054
01:38:26,310 --> 01:38:33,570
but 0.001% of the time that it was known healing energy was sent and the person got better. That

1055
01:38:33,570 --> 01:38:41,270
is totally amplified and exaggerated that it works. Right. You see. So, yeah. So, you know,

1056
01:38:41,310 --> 01:38:46,130
they'll give an example. But, you know, if a million people are, you know, do this, why is it

1057
01:38:46,130 --> 01:38:52,850
that nothing just like what I religious people pray? Right. Not much comes out of it. But the

1058
01:38:52,850 --> 01:38:57,170
one that prayed and it was witnessed that they prayed and this thing happened, this overly

1059
01:38:57,170 --> 01:39:04,490
amplified again. So that means it works every time. No. And one of the things to attach to this is

1060
01:39:04,490 --> 01:39:10,450
going back to the airy fairy community. Send them some healing energy. The key word there is sending

1061
01:39:10,450 --> 01:39:17,490
it. OK, the giving. Right. So when it only let's say this is broadcast on the radio, one person

1062
01:39:17,490 --> 01:39:25,770
that can effectively do this will succeed. Very simple. It's the emotional part. Remember,

1063
01:39:25,910 --> 01:39:29,890
it led this 90 pound soccer mom to flip the van and do all these supernatural things.

1064
01:39:30,430 --> 01:39:36,950
So let's start working with that emotion. We want to send something, a giving feeling. It's a very

1065
01:39:36,950 --> 01:39:44,690
gentle giving feeling. The easiest way to gesture that in the physical body, in the being is when

1066
01:39:44,690 --> 01:39:50,450
you give someone a hug. Right. You'll notice when you hug someone, you have this rising warmth.

1067
01:39:50,550 --> 01:39:54,710
It's like a light feeling that comes through the center of your body and it goes up to your

1068
01:39:54,710 --> 01:40:01,490
shoulders and you kind of feel light for a moment. OK. OK. So if there's no one in the room, even if

1069
01:40:01,490 --> 01:40:05,470
you're listening to this alone or if you're not, don't you know, you don't have to just imagine

1070
01:40:05,470 --> 01:40:10,270
gesturing. If you have to put your arms around right now, let's say physically reach out your

1071
01:40:10,270 --> 01:40:15,970
as if there's an imaginary something, someone to hug. You will feel that rising feeling.

1072
01:40:16,550 --> 01:40:21,370
It comes up through the solar plexus. You feel light for a moment. OK, that is an emotion. So if

1073
01:40:21,370 --> 01:40:25,550
you're hugging, let's say you're at a hug party and you were hugging for a half an hour, you would be

1074
01:40:25,550 --> 01:40:31,110
fully drenched in that emotion and you would get high off of it. And it's constantly giving, giving,

1075
01:40:31,250 --> 01:40:35,650
giving. And that's the best time to have someone write a check, for example, right after they leave

1076
01:40:35,650 --> 01:40:39,390
a hugging party because they just want to give, give, give, give, give. Well, it's also why people

1077
01:40:39,390 --> 01:40:42,990
are so generous with their time after an A.A. meeting, because a lot of people hug after the

1078
01:40:42,990 --> 01:40:47,410
A.A. meeting or at least they used to. They used to. I don't know if they still do. Yeah, sure. But

1079
01:40:47,410 --> 01:40:51,870
I just want to hammer this because the hug, the hug, the hug, because it is very common and

1080
01:40:51,870 --> 01:40:55,910
universal. And when you start working with this and you want to communicate it, you want to find

1081
01:40:55,910 --> 01:41:02,570
very universal gestures that you can communicate. So let's say you hear about sending so-and-so.

1082
01:41:02,710 --> 01:41:05,930
You don't even have to really this is more advanced, but you don't even have to have an

1083
01:41:06,410 --> 01:41:11,050
identification, direct identification of who they are. Just imagine you're tapping into what you

1084
01:41:11,050 --> 01:41:15,670
heard that person that that person mentioned is enough of an identifier. But we can talk about

1085
01:41:15,670 --> 01:41:22,070
identifiers. This gets into the long 12 hour dissertation I can give on this.

1086
01:41:23,290 --> 01:41:31,130
But just to open up the subject. Excuse me. Giving the hug will gesture the body emotionally. Yes,

1087
01:41:31,190 --> 01:41:35,530
go ahead. No, I was just going to give you a chance to pause there and also say that

1088
01:41:35,930 --> 01:41:40,870
it seems to me as though and maybe I'm wrong, but it seems to me as though you need to address

1089
01:41:40,870 --> 01:41:48,370
the idea that by observation or by imaging in your own mind, because I was thinking while you

1090
01:41:48,370 --> 01:41:54,710
were talking about someone hugging themselves or gesturing, gesturing the hug. If you picture

1091
01:41:54,710 --> 01:42:01,630
an embrace that you had in the past, remember it, recall it. Right. You do that. You can also

1092
01:42:01,630 --> 01:42:08,110
get a feeling from it. A feeling will be generated by it. And that's something that happens.

1093
01:42:08,590 --> 01:42:14,850
And sure. All of it. The idea of sending to someone else, I think, comes from the very real

1094
01:42:14,850 --> 01:42:20,090
experience. The idea comes from the very real experience that when you're in a room with

1095
01:42:20,090 --> 01:42:26,530
someone, people commonly talk about anxiety now. Right. If someone is acting nervously around you,

1096
01:42:26,530 --> 01:42:34,370
OK, you observe it. A lot of people and to varying degrees, most people that I know in some way will

1097
01:42:34,370 --> 01:42:38,590
be affected by someone who's, you know, antsy. They're they're they're moving around. It's

1098
01:42:38,590 --> 01:42:43,970
contagious, like a yawn. It becomes a contagious thing. So it seems to me as though other people's

1099
01:42:43,970 --> 01:42:51,630
gestures that are observed and interpreted can also cause this to happen. But it's not a direct

1100
01:42:51,630 --> 01:42:57,050
transference like, you know, I'm beaming this to you. It's more of, again, induction. Right.

1101
01:42:57,470 --> 01:43:02,410
Well, it's it is it is very much. But let's go back to it. So maybe I'm running through this

1102
01:43:02,850 --> 01:43:08,110
too slow of a pace. So when you're in that state, when you feel that emotional rise through the

1103
01:43:08,110 --> 01:43:13,590
body, you think about what you were requested to do to send healing energy to so and so.

1104
01:43:14,110 --> 01:43:20,330
And while you're in that gesture, you make a request and a demand or however, actually demands

1105
01:43:20,330 --> 01:43:25,570
work better than requests that now that I am feeling this right, you don't have to. However,

1106
01:43:25,750 --> 01:43:31,890
you do it. I'm my body is in that state of giving. That's when you evoke the thought of what you'd

1107
01:43:31,890 --> 01:43:38,430
like to manifest. Basically, this person healing. But that that is, again, very general. So one,

1108
01:43:38,750 --> 01:43:44,290
the easiest way to do the healing energy is once you gesture a hug or you can do it without putting

1109
01:43:44,290 --> 01:43:50,690
your hands in front of us, get that rise, that emotion to come up. Imagine that person, whether

1110
01:43:50,690 --> 01:43:57,850
you know them or not, to for their body to be back in a more perfect state as they were when they were

1111
01:43:57,850 --> 01:44:03,770
18 years old. This is where it comes in, where you have there's work involved. If you know the person

1112
01:44:03,770 --> 01:44:09,710
75 and they broke their hip or whatever, you say, well, I'd like to bring this person back,

1113
01:44:10,270 --> 01:44:15,830
demand that towards them, towards where you heard this or where this person is while you're in that

1114
01:44:15,830 --> 01:44:21,650
emotional state of giving that they are, their body is back to how it was at 18. But if you know

1115
01:44:21,650 --> 01:44:26,770
more about it, and let's say they had a hereditary thing, they weren't good at 18 back to the womb,

1116
01:44:27,110 --> 01:44:33,870
how they were when they were just born their body renewed. Right? The what I hear very often in the

1117
01:44:33,870 --> 01:44:40,550
community is they mentioned the ailment, that it should go away. And I would suggest stay away from

1118
01:44:40,550 --> 01:44:48,930
all of that. And just have a do a replication or a past condition this person when they were more

1119
01:44:48,930 --> 01:44:56,010
perfect, be evoked towards them, you see? Now, what if it was something that they had when they were

1120
01:44:56,010 --> 01:45:02,330
born, then you have to go back several generations to before it showed up in the family line. So this

1121
01:45:02,330 --> 01:45:07,150
is where it becomes very specific. You see, just like the health thing, what do you want to do?

1122
01:45:07,290 --> 01:45:13,870
When do you have the pain you see? So this is where the the email work is very is a very big field.

1123
01:45:13,870 --> 01:45:21,510
And it's very practical. But essentially, the the giving feeling is when is the giving is when you

1124
01:45:21,510 --> 01:45:28,630
would send out and broadcast coherently and directly towards the subject, whatever it is,

1125
01:45:28,630 --> 01:45:35,530
it can even be a group of people. Okay. And that is the carrier wave. If you once the body is

1126
01:45:36,370 --> 01:45:42,410
in the condition of that particular emotion, then it becomes very effective, really,

1127
01:45:42,610 --> 01:45:47,990
really effective. And I could sit here for the next four hours to give examples and, you know,

1128
01:45:48,010 --> 01:45:53,830
real stories and things from myself and other people. So I think at this point, maybe we'll

1129
01:45:53,830 --> 01:45:59,810
give another example. What do you think? Well, I was going to just ask you about the the inverse

1130
01:45:59,810 --> 01:46:07,170
of that sentiment where and this this might touch on something that you don't want to go in depth on

1131
01:46:07,170 --> 01:46:14,150
right on this episode. But let's just hit it anyway. You tell me. But fact is that people

1132
01:46:14,150 --> 01:46:20,570
also in the airy fairy community will talk about when you need to do, let's say, balance things out

1133
01:46:20,570 --> 01:46:25,710
or do some harm to someone who's harmed you. Right. So what do they do? They say, oh, well,

1134
01:46:25,710 --> 01:46:34,250
picture them in your mind. Right. Having a problem, say. Right. But that but how many times has that

1135
01:46:34,250 --> 01:46:40,450
been done and it doesn't work? Well, and how many? And again, when it does work, it's over amplified

1136
01:46:41,350 --> 01:46:45,130
safe. Well, that's I was just trying to point out that it's about the same thing. It's just

1137
01:46:45,130 --> 01:46:49,070
that it's in a different direction. But some people think of it as a completely different thing.

1138
01:46:49,950 --> 01:46:53,430
But isn't it virtually the same? It's just, you know, objectively.

1139
01:46:54,190 --> 01:47:00,310
You're sure it would still be the giving energy. Yeah. But it would be technically it would be.

1140
01:47:00,590 --> 01:47:04,570
Sorry. Yeah. I was just saying you're giving something bad instead of good. But still,

1141
01:47:04,650 --> 01:47:09,850
it's the same. Sure. Sure. You can heal. You can kill. You can make sick. You can make happy. You

1142
01:47:09,850 --> 01:47:15,810
can. Yeah. This has been by the way, there is a guy named Samuel Chong. He translated a book

1143
01:47:15,810 --> 01:47:20,890
called 334 Lies out of German. It's very hard to get get an Amazon. I haven't read it yet. I might

1144
01:47:20,890 --> 01:47:26,750
get it about the confessions of an Illuminati or whatever. But listening to Samuel Chong talk about

1145
01:47:26,750 --> 01:47:32,950
it, he said, basically, they have superpowers. Basically, they can mind control other people

1146
01:47:32,950 --> 01:47:38,390
and they could make people they could do all kinds of things. And they're trained from a young child.

1147
01:47:38,390 --> 01:47:43,470
And I'm like, well, what could it be? It has to be an emotional carrier that they're trained in.

1148
01:47:43,470 --> 01:47:49,370
You see the same with the Jedi in Star Wars. Right. They're trained from a young child. And

1149
01:47:49,370 --> 01:47:53,650
they in the movies and in the books, I guess they portrayed as a feeling of the force and all that.

1150
01:47:53,810 --> 01:48:01,570
What I'm trying to do here is show that there is a point of discovery where how the emotional

1151
01:48:01,570 --> 01:48:07,690
the existence of emotions attached to the mind have led to super physical and supernatural

1152
01:48:07,690 --> 01:48:14,090
possibilities and events taking place. Right. So. Well, no, it does. It does happen. I was

1153
01:48:14,090 --> 01:48:18,610
just pointing out that there's you know, this thing can slide in all directions. It's still.

1154
01:48:18,870 --> 01:48:25,270
Oh, yes, it has. And to publicly get into showing both directions is really the objective way to

1155
01:48:25,270 --> 01:48:31,730
do it. But but don't you know, I mean, that's why they have guns, right? Or whatever. And this is

1156
01:48:31,730 --> 01:48:35,930
in the mind in all of the mind. It's in the field of psychology. But this would be like

1157
01:48:36,850 --> 01:48:40,170
ultra psychology, let's say, because it's not discussed in open circles.

1158
01:48:41,090 --> 01:48:49,910
But the each emotion has a different carrier for a different objective. Right. Give another example.

1159
01:48:50,090 --> 01:48:54,410
How many times do you hear again in the airy fairy community guard yourself, protect yourself, right?

1160
01:48:54,610 --> 01:48:58,410
Oh, yeah. A lot of stuff about protecting yourself. And it goes everywhere from the

1161
01:48:58,410 --> 01:49:03,130
physical gesture of, you know, a circle assault, which is the most common trope I can think of

1162
01:49:03,930 --> 01:49:09,290
on Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, that's very powerful. The circle of salt because it's a Yeah, that's a

1163
01:49:09,290 --> 01:49:13,230
pretty big discussion. I don't know much about it. But when we get into gesturing,

1164
01:49:13,250 --> 01:49:19,170
it is really the gesture. Right. And also what salt does the properties of salt, right? Why not

1165
01:49:19,170 --> 01:49:25,810
a circle of gold coins, or urine or whatever, because it's what salt the properties of salt?

1166
01:49:25,990 --> 01:49:29,590
Oh, not as though all those things don't have useful purposes. But go ahead.

1167
01:49:30,150 --> 01:49:37,150
Yeah. So yeah, so the protect yourself is a major Well, you know, what I hear, I'm addressing the

1168
01:49:37,150 --> 01:49:41,870
main like tropes that are out there, which is give healing energy. Other one is regard yourself,

1169
01:49:42,010 --> 01:49:47,130
protect yourself. Okay, so what I've discovered with the guarding yourself, this is going to

1170
01:49:47,130 --> 01:49:51,470
maybe shock some people. But this is what I've discovered you if anyone has any other ideas,

1171
01:49:51,470 --> 01:50:00,410
I'd like to hear them. But you're you're in the it's the form of protection. The most mild one is

1172
01:50:00,410 --> 01:50:05,230
you're in grade school, and you haven't done your homework and the teacher calls on you

1173
01:50:05,230 --> 01:50:11,390
with a question regarding the homework. You're like, Oh, no, I knew I was going to be called.

1174
01:50:11,710 --> 01:50:18,050
And now I don't know what to say. And I'm caught. Right? Right. Okay, at that point,

1175
01:50:18,050 --> 01:50:23,730
it goes both ways, it goes into protecting yourself, but you're extremely vulnerable.

1176
01:50:24,490 --> 01:50:31,350
So the next level to evoke is denial. We've always been told, don't deny it. Or,

1177
01:50:31,570 --> 01:50:35,770
you know, actually, in the legal system, if you don't deny something that's accepted as true.

1178
01:50:36,350 --> 01:50:42,890
Right. So the ease just like the hug was the gesturing forgiving the protection emotion to

1179
01:50:42,890 --> 01:50:49,210
clothe oneself in would be the denial like when you are accused of doing something,

1180
01:50:49,950 --> 01:50:56,530
right, you took the cookies out of the jar, and you deny it. As you're here, as just as the

1181
01:50:56,530 --> 01:51:02,890
accusation stops, and you're ready to produce the denial, there's an emotion that comes over. It's

1182
01:51:02,890 --> 01:51:11,590
almost like a slick feeling like a, like a taut sheet of plastic. It's kind of cool. It's thin,

1183
01:51:11,590 --> 01:51:16,390
but you know, it will stop many things. It's a denial. There's many, I'm just giving you like a

1184
01:51:16,390 --> 01:51:22,490
tactile feeling of that emotion, right? It's a stillness and almost like not a coldness,

1185
01:51:22,610 --> 01:51:29,590
but a cooling down a very even feeling when you deny something, right? So when you set up that

1186
01:51:29,590 --> 01:51:35,450
feeling of denial, that actually is a protection, then ask for yourself to be protected,

1187
01:51:36,010 --> 01:51:42,030
generally from other incoming things, even physical, right? But you maintain that motion

1188
01:51:42,030 --> 01:51:46,890
of denial. It sounds bizarre, doesn't it? Because we're taught denial is a bad thing. But I'm telling

1189
01:51:46,890 --> 01:51:52,650
you, in the legal community, denying things is okay, right? You hear it all the time. Right.

1190
01:51:53,190 --> 01:51:59,410
So, so the interesting thing, so imagine actually in to make it even stronger, which goes into

1191
01:51:59,410 --> 01:52:05,230
almost the falsehood aspect. Imagine that you're accused of something that you did actually,

1192
01:52:05,230 --> 01:52:10,510
but you're still denying it, right? Because you don't want to suffer the consequences

1193
01:52:10,510 --> 01:52:15,050
is also similar, because some people have been in both worlds where they've been,

1194
01:52:15,590 --> 01:52:20,290
they've done something and denied doing it and haven't been falsely accused, let's say,

1195
01:52:20,910 --> 01:52:25,250
didn't really do it and they but they have to, as a defense produced denial, there's an emotion

1196
01:52:25,250 --> 01:52:31,450
that comes when you are denying something, opposing it, that emotional state is the protection state.

1197
01:52:32,290 --> 01:52:36,890
So if you're going into a situation where you know, you're going to be either verbally,

1198
01:52:37,090 --> 01:52:41,830
emotionally or physically attacked, you bring up that emotion of denial, like no,

1199
01:52:42,510 --> 01:52:46,910
right, you're warding off that there's an emotion to it. I'm actually trying to gesture right now

1200
01:52:46,910 --> 01:52:54,290
as we're speaking. And I feel it. But typically what you feel it's, it's a very even this,

1201
01:52:54,490 --> 01:52:59,650
it's a cooling down and almost rigidity, but you're still can move. Are you with me on that? Are you

1202
01:52:59,650 --> 01:53:04,410
getting something like that? Yeah, no, I understand what you're saying. I'm not different than the

1203
01:53:04,410 --> 01:53:09,510
hug. Very different, right? No, I get that. What are you getting from it? Well, I'm not getting

1204
01:53:09,510 --> 01:53:14,530
anything from it. I'm just putting the idea in my mind and observing that, that that's a

1205
01:53:14,530 --> 01:53:18,610
possibility, but I'm not actually getting anything from it at the moment. Honestly.

1206
01:53:19,250 --> 01:53:25,410
Okay, so if you were to gesture, okay, so okay, so I see it's subtle, it's more subtle than the

1207
01:53:25,410 --> 01:53:31,830
gesturing the hug, but that would be the general emotion state to produce the protection layer.

1208
01:53:32,210 --> 01:53:35,990
Because think about it when you're accused of something and you're denying it, whether you did

1209
01:53:35,990 --> 01:53:40,010
it or not, that is a level of protection, just like in the legal system. If you don't deny it,

1210
01:53:40,050 --> 01:53:44,210
then it's accepted that you are guilty of it or have committed that, right?

1211
01:53:44,530 --> 01:53:48,630
Right. Well, denial, denial is definitely important. And that's the thing. So denial

1212
01:53:48,630 --> 01:53:53,030
is protection. I, I get the concept. No, it's not protection. It's, it's what you're,

1213
01:53:53,030 --> 01:53:58,230
you're bringing up the thought of denial to evoke the emotion that when you are denying something,

1214
01:53:58,430 --> 01:54:04,850
and that is the emotional field where one carries the protective layer on, you see,

1215
01:54:05,190 --> 01:54:09,670
but you see, this is a, this is all, I'm using terms that we're all familiar with,

1216
01:54:09,730 --> 01:54:13,990
but the application of them are very unfamiliar. You know, the application is completely unfamiliar.

1217
01:54:14,210 --> 01:54:17,570
That's why I'm, I'm trying to reassemble this in my mind. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

1218
01:54:18,090 --> 01:54:21,930
Yeah. So like, like Chuck, you know, we're, we're thousands of miles apart, you know,

1219
01:54:21,930 --> 01:54:28,930
you stole my calculator, right? What do you say? Well, I don't know how I could have done that.

1220
01:54:29,430 --> 01:54:32,930
Right. Or no, I didn't do it. I don't know how I could. Yeah. But you'd be more firm with it.

1221
01:54:32,990 --> 01:54:38,890
You'll see there's a feeling when you bring that up, that emotion, right? Yeah. Okay. Okay. I get

1222
01:54:38,890 --> 01:54:46,090
it. Because when you're denying something, it does create a, yeah. Okay. It's the, what is evoked

1223
01:54:46,090 --> 01:54:50,430
emotionally? Just like when you're gesturing a hug, even if no one's there, it brings up this

1224
01:54:50,430 --> 01:54:54,370
rise. That's the giving feeling. That's the giving feeling, but I'm giving a feeling of deflection

1225
01:54:54,370 --> 01:54:59,110
really, where it's like, look, that can't touch me because that is, yeah, that's what I'm feeling.

1226
01:54:59,750 --> 01:55:04,610
Right. But you're doing this as a general setup, almost like a four field, because we don't know

1227
01:55:04,610 --> 01:55:09,590
what that is usually like going back to the airy fairy comments, just put some guard yourself.

1228
01:55:10,390 --> 01:55:15,030
We don't know what that is yet. Right. So this is a very general non-specific state,

1229
01:55:15,230 --> 01:55:18,950
but it's even better if you're going into a very specific state, you see,

1230
01:55:18,950 --> 01:55:23,770
like, for example, people that are going into a debate are ready to deny what their opponent is

1231
01:55:23,770 --> 01:55:27,750
saying, right. Or counter it. This is a little different than that. This is very simple.

1232
01:55:28,050 --> 01:55:33,230
Well, no, no, no. I, I, that, that's a different state of mind. I'm saying that though my reaction

1233
01:55:33,230 --> 01:55:37,070
and I'm having a reaction as opposed to preparing myself, which is a different thing.

1234
01:55:37,810 --> 01:55:43,050
Uh, so. Well, it's more than a reaction. It's the emotional aspect of it.

1235
01:55:43,050 --> 01:55:47,050
Yeah, no, but that's what I'm saying. The emotional reaction. I'm trying to describe it,

1236
01:55:47,050 --> 01:55:51,110
but I'm, I'm, I'm apparently not communicating it too well, but what I'm saying is I'm having a

1237
01:55:51,110 --> 01:55:56,170
reaction as opposed to preparing myself, which is a different emotional state. I believe if you feel

1238
01:55:56,170 --> 01:56:00,750
prepared, I mean, and you'll note that if you go into something fully prepared, as opposed to not,

1239
01:56:01,470 --> 01:56:07,110
uh, you, you have a different emotional state that is generally noted all around, right?

1240
01:56:07,390 --> 01:56:10,910
Uh, if you feel prepared, you come in kind of confident, you're a little more relaxed,

1241
01:56:10,970 --> 01:56:15,210
people would say, right. So there's a difference there. Now, simply reacting to something that's

1242
01:56:15,210 --> 01:56:20,370
happening as it's happening creates a different emotional state, right? But then you're not,

1243
01:56:20,470 --> 01:56:24,750
you see, when you understand the power of the emotions, then we go into the realm of the

1244
01:56:24,750 --> 01:56:29,470
supernatural and the super physical, like the 90 pound soccer mom that flips the van over.

1245
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:57,300
Here we are continuing with the second sonic event. And, uh, I, I gotta say it was a fascinating

1246
01:56:57,300 --> 01:57:04,000
point. We stopped at because we had gotten into denial. And I was mentioning that there is a

1247
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:10,180
reactive denial and there's a prepared denial. And the Greek was talking about, well, if you're in

1248
01:57:10,180 --> 01:57:14,500
court, right, and you're being charged, or if somebody accuses you of something, you have a

1249
01:57:14,500 --> 01:57:21,620
reaction. Now that's a good way to relate it to, uh, to one's own experience. But is there a

1250
01:57:21,620 --> 01:57:27,080
difference here? I mean, how, how, how do we continue to, yeah. Yeah, we're, we're basically,

1251
01:57:27,080 --> 01:57:31,160
it's an element, let's just call it an element, meaning it can't be broken down any further,

1252
01:57:31,880 --> 01:57:37,140
even though it can be changed. The element, one of the elements of the spirit and the mind

1253
01:57:37,140 --> 01:57:43,920
is the emotional component. And by the way, uh, different, uh, spirits and different beings and

1254
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:49,580
creatures come pre-downloaded with knowledge. We don't, right. We have to learn everything as we

1255
01:57:49,580 --> 01:57:55,400
come into this world because the knowledge is in the spirit, in the mind, but not to mistake the

1256
01:57:55,400 --> 01:58:02,320
brain for the mind either. Okay. So this is the, that brain is solely part of the body. But again,

1257
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:09,880
the emotional component is attached to the spirit and there is no reason that has been discussed

1258
01:58:09,880 --> 01:58:15,960
of why it's there. I mean, of course it's in literature, it's in romance, it's in culture

1259
01:58:15,960 --> 01:58:20,740
that, you know, we're emotional beings and also that the Vulcans and other cultures in fiction

1260
01:58:21,240 --> 01:58:26,640
try to eliminate it because it's potential irrationality. But what I'm saying is that

1261
01:58:26,640 --> 01:58:33,980
there is no reason for why we have emotions that's been discussed. And I, through experimentation and

1262
01:58:33,980 --> 01:58:40,040
thought experiments, of course, and practice have figured out that it is a way to actually

1263
01:58:40,040 --> 01:58:44,960
manifest things into the physical reality, manifest them through a form of movement.

1264
01:58:44,960 --> 01:58:52,060
So we discuss movements. There is a psychic movement that we hear about and there is the

1265
01:58:52,060 --> 01:58:57,700
emotional movement that sets up the environment to accept what we want to project into it. So the two

1266
01:58:57,700 --> 01:59:03,840
examples was the giving and the other one was the protection or the, which comes through the emotion

1267
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:09,260
of denial. There are many, many, many, many emotions. You know, after we spoke a little bit,

1268
01:59:09,300 --> 01:59:13,780
I looked up online the list of emotions. They give only six emotions. How ridiculous. And then they

1269
01:59:13,780 --> 01:59:19,360
give lists of feelings. So whenever you see something as prominent as the emotional body

1270
01:59:19,360 --> 01:59:25,860
of the spirit, not to really say that it's a body, but it's part of the spirit. And it's almost

1271
01:59:26,500 --> 01:59:31,140
obscured in the information or the data packets that they give online or reference material.

1272
01:59:31,360 --> 01:59:36,560
Again, I think that's deliberate. Something is being hidden. A lot of the ancient cultures,

1273
01:59:36,920 --> 01:59:42,780
you'll find that in there, either we want to call it mythological or religious texts or whatever,

1274
01:59:43,240 --> 01:59:47,920
the gods have the potential of manifesting things in various states of emotion.

1275
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:55,240
So just to add that in the sonic event is very important because we can, we have talked about

1276
01:59:55,240 --> 02:00:02,460
spirit, soul and body, but never really leaned heavily on how the emotional function works.

1277
02:00:03,340 --> 02:00:09,700
And this is a special project, by the way, because we can discuss just the emo work for eight hours.

1278
02:00:09,700 --> 02:00:17,180
I just wanted to bring this up because many people are affected by it. It goes both ways.

1279
02:00:17,760 --> 02:00:22,800
We were speaking about when you gesture a hug, it sets you up for giving and projecting,

1280
02:00:23,140 --> 02:00:30,640
which also being very happy sets that up. Then the protection, which is the next most typical

1281
02:00:30,640 --> 02:00:36,840
one. If you understand the feeling that you have of emotion when you deny something, that is the

1282
02:00:36,840 --> 02:00:42,440
protective emotional carrier. So then you put out what you'd like to be protected from,

1283
02:00:42,500 --> 02:00:47,800
or a general protection, almost like a force field. But most people are aware of,

1284
02:00:48,440 --> 02:00:53,040
through especially since the 80s, there was a book called Subliminal Seduction

1285
02:00:53,600 --> 02:01:03,500
on how the advertising industry manipulates the public through advertising, right? Like drink

1286
02:01:03,500 --> 02:01:11,140
Coke, between every 15 frames in the film, they'll have a flashing image and your mind picks

1287
02:01:11,140 --> 02:01:19,480
it up, right? Right. Also, when a clock is present in a public space, it makes you conscious of time

1288
02:01:19,480 --> 02:01:24,280
and makes you more conscious of what you're doing. For example, if you have a small business

1289
02:01:24,980 --> 02:01:29,940
and you have a problem with point of sale theft, petty theft, people just pocketing stuff and

1290
02:01:29,940 --> 02:01:37,800
not being able to find it out, you thwart that by opposite the entranceway, you have a very large

1291
02:01:37,800 --> 02:01:44,860
clock. So you enter the space, the store, and you cannot help but notice the clock in the back. That

1292
02:01:44,860 --> 02:01:53,460
will thwart petty theft, believe it or not. Another emotional thing that's used, and by

1293
02:01:53,460 --> 02:01:57,680
the way, the person is not really aware of it. They might come in thinking going into a store

1294
02:01:57,680 --> 02:02:05,460
to hawk a candy bar, but because the clock is there, they say, it doesn't feel like the right

1295
02:02:05,460 --> 02:02:11,020
place to do it, and they leave, right? And I've done this with maybe two dozen businesses that

1296
02:02:11,020 --> 02:02:15,540
I said, put a big clock there. We just go and get the biggest possible clock. It doesn't matter if

1297
02:02:15,540 --> 02:02:19,660
it's four feet in diameter. If it fits on the wall, put it there. It's really gaudy. And they all

1298
02:02:19,660 --> 02:02:26,440
reported the theft went down every single time. Another one is fast food restaurants. They don't

1299
02:02:26,440 --> 02:02:31,800
want patrons sitting in a small space after they have their burger or whatever, and sitting and

1300
02:02:31,800 --> 02:02:37,440
lingering. So they paint all the colors that are chosen are these gaudy greens and oranges,

1301
02:02:37,680 --> 02:02:43,960
right? Very unappetizing colors, right? To deflect the patrons from spending much time there.

1302
02:02:44,700 --> 02:02:51,580
This is also part of the emo. So it's colors, it's shapes, it's devices, and the subliminal

1303
02:02:51,580 --> 02:02:59,280
seduction, right? Where you're subject to a microsecond or a millisecond flash of something.

1304
02:02:59,400 --> 02:03:03,500
You don't cognitively see it, but it's there. That affects the emotional body of the spirit

1305
02:03:03,500 --> 02:03:09,880
or of the mind. So this is an entire special ops project, call it Greek-speak or it's only in the

1306
02:03:09,880 --> 02:03:16,880
Greek special ops, and it's a study that I'm kind of going back and forth. Maybe it should be

1307
02:03:16,880 --> 02:03:20,980
in a book where it could be referenced or sonic events that could be referenced.

1308
02:03:21,580 --> 02:03:28,380
But I felt like this had a very, very prominent part of the way we exist, the emotional body,

1309
02:03:28,400 --> 02:03:32,660
that is not discussed in this way. Well, it certainly does. And you know, look,

1310
02:03:32,780 --> 02:03:40,740
it requires examination because it is key to so much of what is done. And I was thinking about

1311
02:03:40,740 --> 02:03:47,700
this, the why. You know, like you said, nobody talks about the why. And I was thinking, well,

1312
02:03:48,320 --> 02:03:54,040
perhaps because it should be self-evident. And maybe this is, again, one of my juvenile ideas.

1313
02:03:54,820 --> 02:04:00,520
But it seems to me as though the why this is there is about, well,

1314
02:04:02,680 --> 02:04:10,240
how do you call the species to propagate, right, to continue to breed? I think a lot of these

1315
02:04:10,240 --> 02:04:15,320
triggers have to do with that. I think a lot of these emotional keys have to do with that. So

1316
02:04:15,320 --> 02:04:21,760
you're encouraged to go back to that, Chuck, to propagate. You know, you're going to propagate

1317
02:04:21,760 --> 02:04:26,740
more readily when you're enamored, right? Well, you're turned on emotionally in a positive state.

1318
02:04:26,880 --> 02:04:31,860
As a matter of fact, if you're in too much of a negative emotion, the sperm and the ovum

1319
02:04:31,860 --> 02:04:37,600
stop being fertile, right? It literally has a physical element to it. It plays out physically,

1320
02:04:37,820 --> 02:04:43,040
just like, you know, not just you react and by gesturing, but your body will change based on

1321
02:04:43,040 --> 02:04:46,980
your emotional state. Sure, but stay with the propagating. What is that formative? It's

1322
02:04:46,980 --> 02:04:51,940
creation. So like the gods create when they're happy and they also create destruction when

1323
02:04:51,940 --> 02:04:57,400
they're not happy. So it is part of the formative, creative aspect of the spirit.

1324
02:04:58,880 --> 02:05:06,880
So, yeah, propagation is a great example on that. Well, propagation in itself, you know,

1325
02:05:06,880 --> 02:05:14,280
anyway, is one subject that again... And self-preservation too. Both of these things

1326
02:05:14,280 --> 02:05:20,460
are essential, right? Because look, if you can't continue the species, there's not much history to

1327
02:05:20,460 --> 02:05:26,240
discuss. If you can't protect the species that is there, if you're not triggered to protect your

1328
02:05:26,240 --> 02:05:30,500
children, yourself and everything else, you're going to get eaten. I mean, even if we go back

1329
02:05:30,500 --> 02:05:35,300
to the caveman example, so to speak, right? You would say, well, look, if you're not encouraged

1330
02:05:35,300 --> 02:05:42,040
by your emotions to protect the family, the core, the tribe, whatever, you know, the other animals

1331
02:05:42,040 --> 02:05:46,760
are going to come along and pick you off, right? Yeah, so that's the conventional. Let me just

1332
02:05:46,760 --> 02:05:53,200
expand that a little bit. When you start noticing that we're in a waiting room situation,

1333
02:05:53,360 --> 02:05:57,980
we're subject to all these anti-human forces here since the beginning in this epoch,

1334
02:05:58,540 --> 02:06:03,520
and you realize the difference between the spirit, the soul and the body. And, you know, the way you

1335
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:08,940
pay rent is by food, clothing, shelter, right? You have to maintain the food, clothing, shelter

1336
02:06:08,940 --> 02:06:16,000
for the spirit to be animated. When you ditch the body and the soul, let's say at death, the spirit

1337
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:21,440
is still there. I mean, it's disanimated. It can be destroyed by special means,

1338
02:06:21,800 --> 02:06:29,320
but essentially you go on. Now, whatever existential belief you have, I assure you the spirit goes on

1339
02:06:29,320 --> 02:06:36,100
unless it's thwarted and hampered not to. So, are we really the species? We're not.

1340
02:06:36,620 --> 02:06:41,620
We're manifesting in this particular thing. So, one side of me is like, screw the species,

1341
02:06:42,180 --> 02:06:48,540
let's get this over. As far as Greek-speak goes, I tell people not to propagate. By the way,

1342
02:06:49,800 --> 02:06:55,940
the worldwide strike, just don't do anything for three days, you know, don't work, don't use banking,

1343
02:06:57,760 --> 02:07:04,780
you know, don't turn on the electricity, don't use banking, don't turn on the water,

1344
02:07:05,540 --> 02:07:12,700
right? Don't turn on the TV, don't use banking. You see what I mean? If you stop all that for

1345
02:07:12,700 --> 02:07:17,220
three and especially don't have children, you know what the elites are going to do? They're

1346
02:07:17,220 --> 02:07:21,040
going to perk up, right? Especially no children, right? They're going to listen. They're going to

1347
02:07:21,040 --> 02:07:27,020
say, okay, what do you guys want, right? But from the formative and creative perspective,

1348
02:07:27,340 --> 02:07:34,020
what I'm suggesting is once the emotional state is recognized that's appropriate for what you

1349
02:07:34,020 --> 02:07:40,880
would like to do, that carries that energy and manifests very much like, again, the X-Men or

1350
02:07:40,880 --> 02:07:45,760
the hero type thing. You notice before they perform whatever special function they can do,

1351
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:52,400
they either cringe or yell or they get into a Mr. Freeze state or fire state or whatever.

1352
02:07:52,880 --> 02:07:58,200
There's an emotional reaction there and also it's used against us and we can use it for us.

1353
02:07:58,440 --> 02:08:01,560
Right. Even the Hulk has to get angry before he turns green and pops up, right?

1354
02:08:01,720 --> 02:08:05,780
There you go. Yeah, you'll see it. That's the thing they all have in common. Even

1355
02:08:05,780 --> 02:08:13,300
inanimate in a pathetic fashion in machines also tend to exhibit some sort of pre-reaction. So,

1356
02:08:13,300 --> 02:08:19,620
in art, in literature, cartoons, whatever, anime. So, here's the interesting part.

1357
02:08:21,260 --> 02:08:28,380
We've been bouncing around the metabolism, which is the soul, the breath, the body and the spirit

1358
02:08:28,380 --> 02:08:34,840
and kind of lean heavily on the emotional part because when you say emotion, it goes into the

1359
02:08:34,840 --> 02:08:39,780
airy-fairy category and I'd like to filter it through that category and make it usable.

1360
02:08:40,800 --> 02:08:46,560
What all this talk essentially is about is so you can view the parade from a helicopter

1361
02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:52,200
instead of on the ground. I think I've given the analogy before, a helicopter is a time machine.

1362
02:08:52,920 --> 02:08:57,900
If you're on the ground viewing a parade and you want to find out what the last float is,

1363
02:08:57,980 --> 02:09:02,360
especially in a big parade, you have to wait four hours. But if you have a friend in a helicopter,

1364
02:09:02,980 --> 02:09:06,900
you give him a call and he sees the parade, the front and the back of it all in one time

1365
02:09:06,900 --> 02:09:12,660
and he could tell you what the last float is and to everyone else, you seem like you know the future,

1366
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:18,220
but you don't. So, not necessarily for knowing the future, but you're going to rise above,

1367
02:09:18,580 --> 02:09:23,380
you're going to have a high vantage point. So, again, with the body, we spoke about

1368
02:09:23,380 --> 02:09:29,120
how if you look, download a cross-section or bring up a cross-section, put in steel-belted

1369
02:09:29,120 --> 02:09:35,160
tire cross-section, automotive tire cross-section and just study it. You'll see layers and rubber,

1370
02:09:35,160 --> 02:09:39,940
it's thick, whatever, whatever. And then do a cross-section of the human intestine or lung

1371
02:09:39,940 --> 02:09:45,960
tissue or whatever. It's like as if the same engineer put that together and neither one,

1372
02:09:46,040 --> 02:09:52,380
anything is absorbed or passes through unless there's a failure. So, we know the body is a

1373
02:09:52,380 --> 02:09:56,980
complete sealed system. So, when you have a cut in a tire, what's the first thing you want to do

1374
02:09:57,460 --> 02:10:03,640
or puncture? You want to seal it up. So, it could go back to its function. Now,

1375
02:10:03,640 --> 02:10:07,920
the same thing with the body. You notice even a child will tell you or anyone young will tell you

1376
02:10:07,920 --> 02:10:13,300
if you have a cut or a puncture in your skin, you put a bandage on it, but it's almost like a custom.

1377
02:10:14,160 --> 02:10:19,800
But really, what you want to do is maintain that pressure difference from the internal body to the

1378
02:10:19,800 --> 02:10:24,740
outside body and the only way you could do that, I mean, can you put a loose piece of duct tape on

1379
02:10:24,740 --> 02:10:29,380
a car tire? No, because it can't handle what? It can't handle the pressure difference.

1380
02:10:29,380 --> 02:10:33,660
Right. Same thing with bandages and wrappings. You make them as tight as possible

1381
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:40,240
without cutting off all the circulation and if it's a severe injury, you want to make it so tight

1382
02:10:40,240 --> 02:10:44,460
that you monitor the extremities and when they start to go numb and turn blue or purple,

1383
02:10:44,740 --> 02:10:49,800
you release it so the flow returns and then you again make it tight and then you release it until

1384
02:10:49,800 --> 02:10:54,800
you'll see the wound starts to close and heal. Now, I mentioned I don't like to give personal

1385
02:10:54,800 --> 02:11:00,640
stories, but I had a very sharp axe. Anything that I have that cuts, a scissor, an axe,

1386
02:11:00,900 --> 02:11:08,360
a knife is all razor sharp. I maintain them very, very well. I'm holding a log with my left hand

1387
02:11:08,360 --> 02:11:12,680
leaning over and I'm shaving and gleaning the little branches off before I start chopping it

1388
02:11:12,680 --> 02:11:18,680
with my right hand. I go a little too far and the axe swings into my left thumb that's facing the axe

1389
02:11:18,680 --> 02:11:22,980
and it slices the entire below the nail down to the palm open to the bone.

1390
02:11:25,300 --> 02:11:29,560
The blood is instant and all that. You have a pulse in your thumb, right? It looks like

1391
02:11:30,360 --> 02:11:35,920
who are those Monty Python guys, right? You're losing quite a bit of blood. Anyway,

1392
02:11:36,460 --> 02:11:40,380
I go in a little bit of a panic, but I know what to do. I need to seal that up.

1393
02:11:40,760 --> 02:11:44,720
If I gave you an image of what it looked like, it would look totally normal,

1394
02:11:44,720 --> 02:11:53,800
but if I outlined where the injury was, you would see it like a palm line. I've done nerve damage.

1395
02:11:53,940 --> 02:11:57,640
My thumb is numb. You know how the feeling you have when your leg or hand falls asleep or your

1396
02:11:57,640 --> 02:12:05,780
arm falls asleep? Well, my thumb is asleep. I have an acquaintance who is a neurosurgeon. He

1397
02:12:05,780 --> 02:12:11,060
says, well, I could probably come back. If not, he'll deal with it. I'm like, no, no, no. It's

1398
02:12:11,060 --> 02:12:18,340
too obtrusive, right? So what does this mean? Well, first of all, if this happened to your

1399
02:12:18,920 --> 02:12:22,540
normie, you know what would happen. Not only would they say you have to go to the hospital,

1400
02:12:22,680 --> 02:12:25,900
they would call for an ambulance, right? Which is a $1,000 cab ride, right?

1401
02:12:26,620 --> 02:12:31,620
And what happens? They have you sitting there. They wrap it real loose and in two hours later,

1402
02:12:31,680 --> 02:12:34,600
they might give you a bunch of stitches, which will look like, you know, you're not going to

1403
02:12:34,600 --> 02:12:38,680
go to a plastic surgeon for that. It's not going to heal well. It's not going to look like it

1404
02:12:38,680 --> 02:12:43,460
ever happened. They might even offer you neurosurgery. So I just gave this example because,

1405
02:12:44,200 --> 02:12:50,260
by the way, I've also done a tibial compound fracture. That's all. I'm going to stop right

1406
02:12:50,260 --> 02:12:55,540
there. And the person was able to walk on it in two weeks, where if you had gone to a hospital,

1407
02:12:55,700 --> 02:13:01,180
they put pins in it and you'd be on crutches for six months. This is all by wrapping it really,

1408
02:13:01,280 --> 02:13:05,560
really tight, but being smart about it, right? And I'm talking tourniquet tight in the beginning

1409
02:13:05,560 --> 02:13:11,160
because you're sealing it up. What happens is with the physical body, there are impulses in

1410
02:13:11,160 --> 02:13:14,960
the brain, the management system, and in the heart. By the way, when you have a cut, you know,

1411
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:20,000
there are platelets that come through the blood to seal, supposedly. They don't really do that,

1412
02:13:20,060 --> 02:13:26,460
but they do a little bit more. Those platelets are shed from the heart. So when people are losing a

1413
02:13:26,460 --> 02:13:29,880
lot of blood, they literally can go through a heart attack because the heart is trying to

1414
02:13:29,880 --> 02:13:36,260
shed all those platelets to send. You see what I mean? Okay. The other thing is when blood tests

1415
02:13:36,260 --> 02:13:42,340
are done, they look at, oh, these are red cells. These are white cells. These are this, this is

1416
02:13:42,340 --> 02:13:47,240
lymphatic fluid. This is right. You know, they just, whatever. Okay. Well, what they don't see,

1417
02:13:47,340 --> 02:13:53,100
which is a study is when you see a red blood cell, do they see that this one is for the ear?

1418
02:13:53,180 --> 02:13:57,840
This one's for the big toe. This one's for the liver. No, they don't. No, there is a way to

1419
02:13:57,840 --> 02:14:04,300
discern that though. It's actually very simple. So once you start studying this, the human body

1420
02:14:04,300 --> 02:14:08,720
and seeing that it all relies on a pressure differential in order for it to work right,

1421
02:14:08,780 --> 02:14:13,980
just like a car tire, then you can go to the stuff that I just discussed. Where do we know? How does

1422
02:14:13,980 --> 02:14:18,660
the wound heal from platelets? What the different types of blood and all that. So it all gets

1423
02:14:18,660 --> 02:14:23,240
wrapped up. But no matter what you study about biology, you must understand that there is a

1424
02:14:23,240 --> 02:14:28,460
pressure differential. It's called a, well, I like to call it a biological vacuum. Anything

1425
02:14:28,460 --> 02:14:37,220
that's alive forms a vacuum, right? So now we understand that, right? When you eat seasonally,

1426
02:14:37,660 --> 02:14:44,820
you're taking in food that will regenerate the body based on the environment that the body is in,

1427
02:14:45,320 --> 02:14:51,080
right? I think we've gone over this. So if you, if it's cold outside and you eat tropical fruit,

1428
02:14:51,920 --> 02:14:56,340
what happens? You're going to be adjusted to a tropical climate. You're in the cold.

1429
02:14:57,520 --> 02:15:02,060
What's the first symptom? Well, you're going to feel colder. You're going to feel colder. And

1430
02:15:02,060 --> 02:15:08,180
then the next symptom, you get congestion. Your nose starts running. You get mucus children,

1431
02:15:08,300 --> 02:15:15,200
especially, right? Right. Okay. More quickly. All right. If you understand when a woman is in

1432
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:19,840
gestation, she has a baby right at the cervix. What keeps the baby from falling out and all the

1433
02:15:19,840 --> 02:15:25,540
liquid? You could look it up and you look at the drawing and it says, it's a mucus plug.

1434
02:15:26,340 --> 02:15:31,260
Just like you have a plug on a bottle of wine or something or something to keep it closed.

1435
02:15:32,080 --> 02:15:38,060
Okay. So the mucus developing in the body is a signal that you're losing what? You're losing

1436
02:15:38,060 --> 02:15:43,720
vacuum. It's trying to plug up and it's trying to tell you, look, all these holes you have in

1437
02:15:43,720 --> 02:15:48,260
your body, I'm going to start plugging them up because you're not working with me here. So I

1438
02:15:48,260 --> 02:15:52,980
need to a signal you that you're, um, I'm plugging up your holes because you're not

1439
02:15:52,980 --> 02:15:59,340
be getting the hint that you're losing vacuum. So when you switch back to eating food,

1440
02:15:59,440 --> 02:16:06,340
the biological food, uh, that is, uh, within the same environment, the vacuum will be restored.

1441
02:16:06,500 --> 02:16:12,800
It's very, very simple, but it's so simple. That is a complete, imagine a fork in the road.

1442
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:18,440
You have the materialist takes one fork. You know, the, the main, the main road is

1443
02:16:18,440 --> 02:16:23,020
what makes our bodies work health and all these other things. There's one fork in the road.

1444
02:16:23,120 --> 02:16:27,540
That's the materialist. It's all chemical. And the other fork in the road is the biological

1445
02:16:27,540 --> 02:16:33,940
vacuum and it's energetic and the chemicals are also included in that. So this is a huge study.

1446
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:38,420
And by the way, I've been leaning and hammering on this publicly with people locally on the

1447
02:16:38,420 --> 02:16:43,680
internet, on the phone for over 20 years. And I, no one's ever come back and said, Hey Greek,

1448
02:16:43,760 --> 02:16:48,719
we need to start a study and Institute something around this. Right. And it still hasn't happened.

1449
02:16:48,820 --> 02:16:53,100
So it tells me it's not, this is not the right planet, the right society or whatever for this,

1450
02:16:53,200 --> 02:16:56,320
but it doesn't mean we can't talk about it on the Sonic, these basic things.

1451
02:16:56,660 --> 02:17:00,379
Well, right. Which leads me to a question by the way, because I understand the,

1452
02:17:00,440 --> 02:17:05,059
the concept of look, eat the thing that has grown locally at that time. Because

1453
02:17:05,059 --> 02:17:09,639
if you eat with the season, then it makes sense that that's what would be

1454
02:17:10,480 --> 02:17:14,780
created by induction in your body. It would be natural in the environment,

1455
02:17:14,820 --> 02:17:18,860
in the atmosphere of your body and in the atmosphere that your body is in.

1456
02:17:19,360 --> 02:17:23,639
But you can, but yes, you said something very important, but there are exceptions

1457
02:17:24,180 --> 02:17:29,260
that are also inclusive. Okay. So let's say we go out, Chuck, you want to have some burgers?

1458
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:33,000
Well, let's go have some burgers. That was the thing I wanted to get to is the meat

1459
02:17:33,680 --> 02:17:38,400
because okay. Wouldn't that mean, hold on for you. Remember, hold on. This is very important.

1460
02:17:39,059 --> 02:17:42,379
Eating seasonally, things that are grown. All right. We're going to burger. I'm going to order.

1461
02:17:43,100 --> 02:17:48,320
Do I say I want mine with milk and cucumber, or do I say I want mine with a pickle and some cheese,

1462
02:17:49,120 --> 02:17:54,620
pickle and cheese, right? I didn't say, I didn't say cucumber and milk. No. Right. If you tell

1463
02:17:54,620 --> 02:18:00,639
someone you want some cucumber and milk on your burger, well, what's a pickle? The pickle that

1464
02:18:00,639 --> 02:18:07,320
they serve traditionally with burgers is a cured cucumber, cucumber. Okay. So when you cure it,

1465
02:18:07,379 --> 02:18:11,299
you change it completely. If you take a slice of cucumber, fresh or in the fridge or whatever,

1466
02:18:11,440 --> 02:18:15,219
and a slice of pickle and they're cured different ways and preserved different ways,

1467
02:18:15,240 --> 02:18:18,340
they taste completely different. Might as well be a completely different animal. Right.

1468
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:24,520
Right. So when you have a cheese and you have milk, there's almost no similarity unless someone

1469
02:18:24,520 --> 02:18:30,420
tells you they both come from a cow. Okay. So when the milk becomes cheese, it's completely

1470
02:18:30,420 --> 02:18:36,059
transmuted. I mean, it becomes a completely different. So cucumbers are grown seasonally.

1471
02:18:36,280 --> 02:18:42,760
Right. But when you pickle it, we just, right, you can have it off season, but you shouldn't

1472
02:18:42,760 --> 02:18:46,840
have the fresh cucumber brought over from a warm place when you're in a cold place.

1473
02:18:47,559 --> 02:18:52,260
Do you see, you see how the exceptions work here? Look, the people that lived out on the range in

1474
02:18:52,260 --> 02:18:56,639
the country or whatever, what do they do? The farmers, they, in the winter, they, they pickle

1475
02:18:56,639 --> 02:19:00,200
everything, right? They preserve it. They canned and pickled one way or the other. Canned and

1476
02:19:00,200 --> 02:19:06,020
pickled. And they eat that in the winter and they're still doing fine. So there is a natural

1477
02:19:06,020 --> 02:19:13,440
system here. So yeah, it's, it's, so it's the change that makes it. The same goes for many of

1478
02:19:13,440 --> 02:19:19,440
the tropical foods, but it doesn't hold true when you refine it. They say sugar rots your teeth.

1479
02:19:19,440 --> 02:19:24,820
Bologna doesn't do that at all. What happens is the sugar that you add to foods or the sugar

1480
02:19:24,820 --> 02:19:30,040
itself, because they talk, let's talk about real cane sugar here or whatever. It's separated from

1481
02:19:30,040 --> 02:19:34,340
the plant, which, and when it's in the plant, it's attached to minerals, water, protein, fiber,

1482
02:19:34,940 --> 02:19:39,820
and refined when you put it in your body. Okay. Well, when it's refined, it's in a,

1483
02:19:39,840 --> 02:19:43,660
it's in a dry package. It's not attached. It's just itself. And maybe it touches the

1484
02:19:43,660 --> 02:19:49,960
wrapping or the container. Once you put it in your body, the sugar from an energetic point of

1485
02:19:49,960 --> 02:19:55,380
view says, Hey, look at all this water. I remember being in water. Look at all this protein and all

1486
02:19:55,380 --> 02:20:00,200
this starch and all this fiber. I remember being around that. Let me grab some of that. You see,

1487
02:20:00,640 --> 02:20:06,600
and attach to it. And that you see, so now it's robbing you or attaching or depleting you of all

1488
02:20:06,600 --> 02:20:11,860
the other things that it needs when it was not refined to be itself. And that's why it rots your

1489
02:20:11,860 --> 02:20:17,340
teeth. You see, so the refined foods. So the same thing happens with medicine. See,

1490
02:20:17,900 --> 02:20:22,740
if someone has a illness or an ailment and they find a plant that treats it or cures it,

1491
02:20:23,180 --> 02:20:28,200
you give it to a materialist or actually just most people. And they'll say, we need to, we need to

1492
02:20:28,200 --> 02:20:34,840
do an assay, break it down and find the active ingredient. Does it work? No, very rarely. What

1493
02:20:34,840 --> 02:20:40,500
it'll work in the way, the same way fertilizers do on crops. You know how they use the nitrate

1494
02:20:40,500 --> 02:20:45,120
based fertilizers and farms, the chemical based fertilizers. They think they're getting more

1495
02:20:45,120 --> 02:20:50,640
growth. All it's doing is getting the plants high. It's not creating more growth because,

1496
02:20:50,780 --> 02:20:54,020
you know, if you use that same system for more than two or three years, what happens,

1497
02:20:54,500 --> 02:20:59,860
right? The crops do not work, do very well. So they blame it on their formulation. It has to do

1498
02:20:59,860 --> 02:21:08,100
with it being synthesized. So in essence, when you understand this, you don't have to even be

1499
02:21:08,100 --> 02:21:13,640
in the study of it. Just the sonic is enough that if you understand this and comprehend it

1500
02:21:13,640 --> 02:21:21,180
even better, you'll be able to apply it. You see? Well, see, that's why when they say a naturally

1501
02:21:21,180 --> 02:21:27,540
occurring sugar in a food already, it has all those other things attached to it. So it doesn't

1502
02:21:27,540 --> 02:21:33,440
seek to rob the body in order to recreate itself effectively. I mean, from a certain point of view,

1503
02:21:33,480 --> 02:21:37,720
that's the way it could be described, right? Sure. I mean, look, for example, even in a car,

1504
02:21:37,720 --> 02:21:42,080
they have carbon buildup. It gets dirty when they burn clean gasoline. Well, what does clean

1505
02:21:42,080 --> 02:21:46,900
gasoline look like when it's in the ground? It's brown and black. That's why if you run a car long

1506
02:21:46,900 --> 02:21:50,680
enough, the inside where the gasoline is supposed to be, it turns brown and black. Everything wants

1507
02:21:50,680 --> 02:21:58,060
to go back to that. So anyway, there's an old lascivious joke. All the men, they come out of

1508
02:21:58,060 --> 02:22:03,740
it and they try to spend their whole lives to get back in it, right? Oh, yeah. Yeah. So, you know,

1509
02:22:03,740 --> 02:22:08,180
it's this really strange. And it's not duality. It's all about direction and pressure and all

1510
02:22:08,180 --> 02:22:11,560
this. When you have two things next to each other and there's a pressure differential,

1511
02:22:11,660 --> 02:22:15,200
they want to equalize the one with the high pressure is going to go to. You could either

1512
02:22:15,200 --> 02:22:20,980
raise the pressure of one to go against the other, or you could lower the pressure of one

1513
02:22:20,980 --> 02:22:27,200
to go against the other. Right. So this is basically the the crux of all this, because as we continue

1514
02:22:27,200 --> 02:22:32,260
with sonic events, people are going to be, you know, we'll make a comment or a remark

1515
02:22:32,260 --> 02:22:37,060
on something and it attaches to this very thing that we've been discussing on this particular

1516
02:22:37,060 --> 02:22:43,380
sonic. We have brought this up before, but you cannot separate the the body, the health of the

1517
02:22:43,380 --> 02:22:49,400
body, which is the metabolism and the mind. But they must be known as separate things. It's really

1518
02:22:49,400 --> 02:22:55,020
the original trinity. You see, all of these religions are allegory. You know how they have

1519
02:22:55,020 --> 02:23:03,120
Trinitarian based stuff. It's it's no, we do have a it's not a duality. It's a it's a three part

1520
02:23:03,120 --> 02:23:08,820
that makes us. But the thing that is that the three parts are working, actually, two parts are

1521
02:23:08,820 --> 02:23:14,500
working to preserve the spirit, the mind, because the mind can be transferred. Right. And this

1522
02:23:14,500 --> 02:23:20,640
sounds a little crazy, but we give many fictional examples. So the the soul and the body are not

1523
02:23:20,640 --> 02:23:24,760
important. It's the spirit that's important, not because we make it important, because it's what

1524
02:23:24,760 --> 02:23:32,090
the soul and the body, you know, the breath and the body are there to animate. No, I understand

1525
02:23:32,090 --> 02:23:38,950
all this. But back to the one question I had about the meat, right, which is, wouldn't it be more

1526
02:23:38,950 --> 02:23:47,010
proper than to consume an animal which is freshly killed? Because, again, look, people often say,

1527
02:23:47,110 --> 02:23:51,790
well, I'm a carnivore. You're not a carnivore. You're you're you're a carry on eater because

1528
02:23:51,790 --> 02:23:55,730
you're eating something that's dead for a bit. OK, carnivore eats things that are alive.

1529
02:23:56,730 --> 02:24:03,270
All right. So that's right. But the bottom line on this is, doesn't it make more sense not to

1530
02:24:03,870 --> 02:24:09,330
freeze? Now, does that change it? If you freeze meat? Probably getting into preparation.

1531
02:24:10,710 --> 02:24:21,770
Overall, if it has eyeball and a heart and lungs, you're it's a it's a different type of being. It's

1532
02:24:21,770 --> 02:24:28,170
to a certain way. What law form do you function in? Because, by the way, cannibalism is alive and

1533
02:24:28,170 --> 02:24:33,770
well. And I would I would tell you that maybe two to five percent of the world population is

1534
02:24:33,770 --> 02:24:39,570
engaged in cannibalism, at least two to five percent. And it's not really well known. And

1535
02:24:39,570 --> 02:24:47,390
I mean, straight up cannibalism. Right. OK, so. What I mean by your law form is just that

1536
02:24:48,790 --> 02:24:55,370
a food preparation is a whole different thing. Like it give you the eating. If you can avoid

1537
02:24:55,370 --> 02:25:00,750
like, for example, in the biblical text, it indirectly promotes vegetarianism indirectly.

1538
02:25:01,050 --> 02:25:05,810
It doesn't tell you you shouldn't eat meat, but it says that if you touch the flesh of a of a

1539
02:25:05,810 --> 02:25:10,410
dead animal, you are in an unclean state until noon, you know, the next day when you wash.

1540
02:25:11,150 --> 02:25:15,930
Right. And most people say, well, I'm not going to be touching any unclean animals while they're

1541
02:25:15,930 --> 02:25:19,610
eating a chicken sandwich. If you're eating a chicken sandwich or a fish sandwich, are you

1542
02:25:19,610 --> 02:25:26,530
touching the flesh of a dead animal? The answer is yes. So. Yeah. Yeah. So if the biblical text

1543
02:25:26,530 --> 02:25:32,470
actually promotes indirectly. Indirectly, I mean, doesn't come out and say it in many ways to be

1544
02:25:32,470 --> 02:25:38,730
to eat vegetable, but there is a certain hierarchy in the animal kingdom and the biological kingdom,

1545
02:25:38,730 --> 02:25:45,730
like each what we call lower life or manifestation aspires to be the next. So if you go into the

1546
02:25:45,730 --> 02:25:51,690
kingdom, the plants want to be like animals and the animals want to be like humans and the humans

1547
02:25:51,690 --> 02:25:56,830
want to be like gods. Right. You see how each one aspires to the next, like a child wants to be

1548
02:25:56,830 --> 02:26:03,190
like the parents. OK. For example. OK. Now, plants are the most readily available to be eaten. Right.

1549
02:26:03,570 --> 02:26:08,830
By every everything and everyone, let's say they're always constantly in this dream state.

1550
02:26:09,250 --> 02:26:14,430
So imagine you're dreaming as a human. Right. And you're a plant. And, you know,

1551
02:26:14,430 --> 02:26:18,390
here comes this thing and it bites off your arm, starts chewing on it. You're like, oh,

1552
02:26:18,610 --> 02:26:23,950
man, that was really that wasn't too cool. You're OK with it. Right. Because you're in this dream

1553
02:26:23,950 --> 02:26:30,550
state. By the way, when people take all these naturally, if you indulge in that kind of thing,

1554
02:26:30,630 --> 02:26:35,950
hallucinogenics or whatever, where do those things come from? Plants. Interesting. Right.

1555
02:26:37,430 --> 02:26:42,170
So then you have the animals, the animal state. Right. You know, at one point,

1556
02:26:42,170 --> 02:26:46,470
animals were not afraid of humans. Actually, if you go to certain parts of the world, they're not.

1557
02:26:47,270 --> 02:26:51,230
You know, if you go down to Antarctica or North Pole, penguins, seals,

1558
02:26:52,710 --> 02:26:58,010
polar bears on the other end, they're not afraid of humans. They don't run away. Right. Certain

1559
02:26:58,010 --> 02:27:03,470
places, they're not. But at that point, they feel like they could relate. And only other certain

1560
02:27:03,470 --> 02:27:09,170
places they run naturally, like deer in the forest. You know, you have a certain innocent demeanor

1561
02:27:09,170 --> 02:27:12,830
with some people, you know, when the butterfly lands on a little girl's nose and there's a wild

1562
02:27:12,830 --> 02:27:19,970
bull or a bull in a ranch that will just gourd anyone except for this little girl's best friend.

1563
02:27:20,070 --> 02:27:25,930
You know, there are these spiritual connections also. But the the animals, by virtue of them,

1564
02:27:26,630 --> 02:27:34,250
let's say, meaning to be domesticated. You see, and working with humans is the next level.

1565
02:27:34,250 --> 02:27:38,730
And then the humans wanting to be like a godlike state or whatever, even when

1566
02:27:38,730 --> 02:27:42,990
in certain religious practices, when they say they want to ascend, you hear that a lot,

1567
02:27:43,070 --> 02:27:49,110
that ascension stuff. Well, what they don't know is if when you study the text that actually it's

1568
02:27:49,110 --> 02:27:54,310
a very selfish thing to do, because in the in the Buddha's Sapa, when you do approach nirvana

1569
02:27:54,890 --> 02:28:00,770
and ascend right before you're ready to enter, you're supposed to say, out of selflessness,

1570
02:28:00,770 --> 02:28:08,290
I need to go back and not ascend myself and help the others. So you never really do ascend. I mean,

1571
02:28:08,350 --> 02:28:16,790
a true master would not do that. It would be selfish, you see. So anyway, I think that's

1572
02:28:16,790 --> 02:28:24,010
pretty much the, you know, the wrap on this particular sonic, because I've always wanted to

1573
02:28:24,590 --> 02:28:31,310
say the same thing different ways, but also implore the listener that how important this is to myself

1574
02:28:31,310 --> 02:28:38,090
and to them has yet to be realized. An example of that is if you injure yourself physically

1575
02:28:38,670 --> 02:28:44,310
enough, you go into a panic, you may not do what you tell other people, do you have to actually

1576
02:28:44,310 --> 02:28:49,910
make a very big concerted effort to remind yourself, hey, dummy, no matter how bad this

1577
02:28:49,910 --> 02:28:54,690
looks, you know what to do, do it. It's kind of hard to do it. That's always my first order of

1578
02:28:54,690 --> 02:29:00,770
business upon an injury to myself or someone around me is is I first have to shut that down.

1579
02:29:01,470 --> 02:29:06,490
That that panic reaction, that's my first order of business, right? You know, because otherwise,

1580
02:29:06,890 --> 02:29:11,270
I'm not thinking clearly, and I'm not going to do the right thing. And I might just react. And

1581
02:29:11,270 --> 02:29:15,770
yeah, no, like like you said about the personal story about splitting your hand.

1582
02:29:16,210 --> 02:29:20,630
You know, the first thing to say is, I know that I need to take care of this a certain way.

1583
02:29:21,670 --> 02:29:25,310
You know, and you don't do that if you're going, oh, I'm bleeding, I'm bleeding, you know, it's

1584
02:29:25,310 --> 02:29:30,330
it's kind of hard to do, you know, the worse the injury, the more easier it is to go into shock.

1585
02:29:30,490 --> 02:29:33,930
And, you know, when someone has a bad injury, the last thing you want to do is let them see

1586
02:29:33,930 --> 02:29:38,810
the injury because they'll go into shock and you can die from that. But it wasn't that bad,

1587
02:29:38,830 --> 02:29:42,930
but borderline, but but also, you know, eating seasonally, you know, when you're,

1588
02:29:42,930 --> 02:29:48,630
you might have a craving for something and it's out of season. Learn in the beginning,

1589
02:29:49,510 --> 02:29:54,790
train yourself to, to not, it's difficult in the beginning, like with anything until you

1590
02:29:54,790 --> 02:30:01,750
until you it becomes natural not to. Like, for example, there's many people have heard me speak,

1591
02:30:01,850 --> 02:30:05,570
and I'm like an Old Testament kind of guy. And I don't know pork on my fork, right?

1592
02:30:06,370 --> 02:30:12,710
And let's say you enjoyed pork products before and you decide that you're not going to do that

1593
02:30:12,710 --> 02:30:17,090
anymore. Right? Well, it's in everything, by the way, if you see gelatin on an ingredient,

1594
02:30:17,290 --> 02:30:23,550
if it doesn't say bovine gelatin, it's pork gelatin, right? And even Altoids, breath mints,

1595
02:30:23,830 --> 02:30:30,030
candies, right? Oh, yeah, there's pork in that. So So anyway, in the beginning, it's going to

1596
02:30:30,030 --> 02:30:35,290
be difficult. But once you train yourself, and it's also like shrimp, lobster, clams, oysters,

1597
02:30:35,730 --> 02:30:39,850
right? Because if it comes out of the water, it should have fins and scales.

1598
02:30:40,950 --> 02:30:44,410
And I'll say that again, if it comes out of the water, if it lives in the water, it has to have

1599
02:30:44,410 --> 02:30:49,570
what should have fins and scales. Right? So obviously, clams don't know these other, you

1600
02:30:49,570 --> 02:30:55,690
know, and catfish, shark, well, they have fins, but they don't have scales. They have a skin

1601
02:30:55,690 --> 02:31:00,390
eel, right? Well, so in the beginning, you might have enjoyed these things before. And in the

1602
02:31:00,390 --> 02:31:04,490
beginning, you're it's going to seem like you're depriving yourself of something that you enjoyed.

1603
02:31:04,530 --> 02:31:08,030
And then you're living in a world that you want to enjoy as much as possible when you know,

1604
02:31:08,030 --> 02:31:13,430
it's opportune to Well, I noticed that after a few years of not doing this or less, I didn't

1605
02:31:13,430 --> 02:31:18,410
even view it as food anymore. Well, see, there's an interesting thing too, because

1606
02:31:19,350 --> 02:31:24,030
Alright, so I think this is a helpful hint, but maybe it's not you'll correct me.

1607
02:31:24,630 --> 02:31:28,410
When it comes to candy, though, somebody might say, well, that means I can't have a lot of candy

1608
02:31:28,410 --> 02:31:36,070
things that I enjoy. That's not necessarily true. Because I've seen things that are, you know,

1609
02:31:36,510 --> 02:31:41,990
they're just fine as far as the, the Orthodox are concerned, because they have like one of the

1610
02:31:41,990 --> 02:31:47,450
rabbi symbols on it. Oh, no, no, no, that's totally different. Remember, I assure you that

1611
02:31:47,450 --> 02:31:51,690
there's no religion on the planet that knows or does anything that's in the text that supposedly

1612
02:31:51,690 --> 02:31:56,210
is supposedly subscribed to. Well, I understand that it's the opposite, just just like if you go

1613
02:31:56,210 --> 02:31:59,510
to a lawyer, you think he knows the law, he doesn't. Well, I understand that. But what I'm

1614
02:31:59,510 --> 02:32:03,690
saying is that I think they try to avoid all that stuff, though, when it comes to the,

1615
02:32:03,690 --> 02:32:08,030
well, first of all, the pork product, but oh, yeah, yeah, well, that's they have a,

1616
02:32:08,710 --> 02:32:14,630
they have the haraka, which is an excessive law where where if the law says you got to be in by

1617
02:32:14,630 --> 02:32:18,590
six, they tell everybody to be in by four. So if you're running late, you'll still be in before

1618
02:32:18,590 --> 02:32:24,590
six, right? So what they do is they ban pork to come in from coming into a certain city.

1619
02:32:25,910 --> 02:32:30,250
You see, and pigs, by the way, just the people, you know, when they're running in the what pigs

1620
02:32:30,250 --> 02:32:33,590
like, you know, when you hear about tuna or sharks, if they stop moving, they die.

1621
02:32:34,070 --> 02:32:38,650
Yeah, right. They have to keep moving. Pigs are like that. They never stay in one place.

1622
02:32:38,670 --> 02:32:42,830
But when you put them in one place, it psychologically damages them. And they're

1623
02:32:42,830 --> 02:32:47,130
rolling around in there, right? They're constantly pooping and digging up stuff constantly. Right

1624
02:32:47,130 --> 02:32:50,190
there. They trench. That's where these pigs to find truffles in the ground, right?

1625
02:32:50,550 --> 02:32:53,850
They scoop down into the ground to find something to eat and they keep moving.

1626
02:32:54,410 --> 02:33:00,010
So once you try to farm them, they get very, very messy because they they're always pooping

1627
02:33:00,010 --> 02:33:04,430
and they're always digging. Right. OK, so in a nutshell, people say you're dirty like a pig.

1628
02:33:05,270 --> 02:33:10,470
Basically, if someone's you hear someone saying that what you say is, well, a wild pig or one in

1629
02:33:10,470 --> 02:33:15,710
a farm because wild pigs are very clean, actually. Right. I was just going to say the wild the wild

1630
02:33:15,710 --> 02:33:21,350
pig or the wild hog or whatever that you say is actually not the same as the one on the farm.

1631
02:33:21,490 --> 02:33:25,430
No, they're they're the opposite. So the thing it's the same thing with the religious people

1632
02:33:25,430 --> 02:33:30,530
or the attorneys or the doctors. Look, how many times more than a dozen times with people that

1633
02:33:30,530 --> 02:33:36,190
are in the medical profession, I've pulled out a cross image of a cross section of a tire and an

1634
02:33:36,190 --> 02:33:41,310
image of a cross section of the lungs, the any organ in the body and the intestines. And I

1635
02:33:41,310 --> 02:33:47,470
explain this to them. What do you think they say? I can't acknowledge that. I'm not saying

1636
02:33:47,470 --> 02:33:54,710
what you're saying is not true Greek, but I can't I can't go that route. They all say that or some

1637
02:33:54,710 --> 02:34:00,530
variation of that or that's a very they're very or they could be very dismissive. They say

1638
02:34:02,030 --> 02:34:06,410
that's an interesting way to look at it, like, you know, little boy, pat you on the head. Right.

1639
02:34:06,630 --> 02:34:10,330
Well, it's so funny because that sounds like conversations I used to have with rabbis,

1640
02:34:10,390 --> 02:34:18,050
actually. Exactly that kind of conversation where it's just ended on that either not the

1641
02:34:18,050 --> 02:34:22,890
pat on the head for the little boy. But, you know, I'm not saying that what you're saying is wrong.

1642
02:34:22,890 --> 02:34:27,610
It's just that I well, you know, when you approach an authority figure, by the way,

1643
02:34:27,670 --> 02:34:33,610
you have to speak their language out of respect. Right. You know, like, for example, I have I there

1644
02:34:33,610 --> 02:34:40,950
was a client that someone recommended I work with and he's from Korea and he was highly bred in

1645
02:34:40,950 --> 02:34:46,530
Korea and he came here want to do some things. So I learned a little bit of Korean. So so,

1646
02:34:46,530 --> 02:34:50,610
you know, it comes to the door and I say, I'm young as hell, you know,

1647
02:34:50,710 --> 02:34:56,230
John, but I'm going to let me die. And, you know, I started speaking mild conversational. So every

1648
02:34:56,230 --> 02:35:01,130
white guy that he saw that he knew by facial expressions had a hard time with his English

1649
02:35:01,130 --> 02:35:06,650
accent because very, very little English, but he was educated in English. When I saw that,

1650
02:35:06,670 --> 02:35:12,870
I wanted to meet him there halfway. It was not to impress him. It was to say, I want to I want

1651
02:35:12,870 --> 02:35:19,070
to work with you and to prove that I'm going to meet you halfway by by learning how to communicate

1652
02:35:19,070 --> 02:35:29,390
the way, you know, you see. Right. So when you run into a rabbi. And he sees that you're a Gentile,

1653
02:35:29,810 --> 02:35:35,010
you know, you have to be able to tell them that, you know, suffer better. She's better. She's

1654
02:35:35,010 --> 02:35:40,530
better. He touched me in the head to audits. Right. And which is I could keep going on with

1655
02:35:40,530 --> 02:35:44,610
this, but that's basically you have to memorize the first chapter of Genesis to be bar mitzvahed.

1656
02:35:44,670 --> 02:35:51,530
So I basically have passed all of the requirements to be bar mitzvahed. So what is you know what I

1657
02:35:51,530 --> 02:35:56,150
mean? I basically tell him I have all the I can be you could bar mitzvah me right here on the spot

1658
02:35:56,150 --> 02:36:01,810
right now. I have all the requirements. What am I saying? I'm not I'm not saying I'm like him,

1659
02:36:01,890 --> 02:36:07,850
but I've met him halfway at least, you know, I've done work on my part, done work on your part to

1660
02:36:07,850 --> 02:36:12,310
meet him, to say, I'm going to meet you. Yeah, I'm not somebody down here on the outside giving

1661
02:36:12,310 --> 02:36:17,530
you a hard time. If you don't try to make an effort into that person's life, whether it's

1662
02:36:17,530 --> 02:36:21,250
language or knowledge or whatever, it's no different than being a salesman knocking on

1663
02:36:21,250 --> 02:36:25,270
your door or Jehovah's Witness. Hey, do you have a moment? I want to talk to you about something.

1664
02:36:25,810 --> 02:36:32,470
You see now with doctors, you they have a particular language. Right. And, you know,

1665
02:36:33,270 --> 02:36:38,470
you learn a little bit about that, too. You know, if I basically said, you know, epithelial

1666
02:36:38,850 --> 02:36:44,730
apoptosis, all it is, it's when cells are replaced in the body. That's all it is. You know how the

1667
02:36:44,730 --> 02:36:50,090
cells replaced, you know, drop off. Right. And and grow back. OK, that's epithelial epithelial

1668
02:36:50,090 --> 02:36:54,530
tissue cells that are replaced. And apoptosis is the removal. So you get into all this, by the way,

1669
02:36:54,570 --> 02:36:58,110
the epithelial apoptosis, I've been hammering it for a long time because that's what the AIDS

1670
02:36:58,110 --> 02:37:04,730
thing is about. So I think we've covered this before. You know, all the people, you know, there

1671
02:37:04,730 --> 02:37:08,910
is no AIDS test, by the way. It's demographic, right? Just like PCR doesn't work. Right. That's

1672
02:37:08,910 --> 02:37:15,210
where really part of it started. And they went after certain groups, the needle, the people

1673
02:37:15,210 --> 02:37:22,910
with needles and drugs and the homosexuals and the low, the ghetto and other. Right. OK. They

1674
02:37:22,910 --> 02:37:27,170
targeted those people with this thing called an AIDS test. And they said it's very serious.

1675
02:37:27,170 --> 02:37:33,350
So if you got positive on it, which is like there's no positive or negative PCR test, by the

1676
02:37:33,350 --> 02:37:39,790
way, if you eat raw meat or rare steak steak and you have a real PCR test, it'll show that you're

1677
02:37:39,790 --> 02:37:45,890
positive every time because of the blood tissue stimulant hormone in the blood. But the way the

1678
02:37:45,890 --> 02:37:50,030
AIDS scam worked and they've killed like 50 million people this way, it sounds very nefarious.

1679
02:37:50,050 --> 02:37:54,270
How could it be going on? Right. It's kind of like Santa Claus can't be a hoax Greek because

1680
02:37:54,270 --> 02:37:58,150
you know how many people would have to be in on it. You know, AIDS can't be a hoax because I mean,

1681
02:37:58,250 --> 02:38:04,230
a lot of people are in on it. I've been to a graduation party where someone had just gotten

1682
02:38:04,230 --> 02:38:09,970
their Ph.D. and the older doctors are going on saying you should just do a AIDS test. You know,

1683
02:38:10,090 --> 02:38:14,490
you get paid five hundred dollars up front. And then if they follow treatment, you can get up to

1684
02:38:14,490 --> 02:38:20,130
twenty five hundred dollars. It's all about money. Right. OK, so I mean, I was really I just wanted

1685
02:38:20,130 --> 02:38:24,990
to tell the guys, all those doctors to go outside so I could back up. Don't move. So I could back

1686
02:38:24,990 --> 02:38:32,290
up my truck over them. But anyway, what what they do with the AIDS test is they come up with that

1687
02:38:32,290 --> 02:38:37,670
you're positive and then they barrage you with literature and phone calls. Do you know that you

1688
02:38:37,670 --> 02:38:43,250
might have tested positive, not tested positive, you know, Santa Claus shoe size for a very

1689
02:38:43,250 --> 02:38:49,750
serious disease? You should consider treatment what the treatment the AZT is. It's a drug that

1690
02:38:49,750 --> 02:38:56,690
when you put it in the body, it tells the body that the cells that were are that are being

1691
02:38:56,690 --> 02:39:03,710
replaced have already been replaced when they haven't. So epithelial tissue, some of it only

1692
02:39:03,710 --> 02:39:08,470
like inside of your mouth, the cheek tissue that only lasts a few days. It comes off. Right.

1693
02:39:10,110 --> 02:39:13,970
You know, they do a scrape on the inside and that's the easiest tissue to get. Right, right.

1694
02:39:13,970 --> 02:39:20,390
Uh, well, there's a particular is a series of hormones, let's say, and proteins are more

1695
02:39:20,390 --> 02:39:25,350
complex than proteins that call them hormones. Let's say that the body releases once the cell

1696
02:39:25,350 --> 02:39:32,390
has grown back. The AZT is that hormone. So your body is still shedding. But your body is not

1697
02:39:32,390 --> 02:39:38,170
regrowing because it has an abundance of the hormones that said it's grown back. So you end

1698
02:39:38,170 --> 02:39:43,070
up looking like you're starving to death with body sores and you can't breathe because the lung

1699
02:39:43,070 --> 02:39:46,990
tissue is very important. Now, what when they show you pictures of AIDS victims, what do they

1700
02:39:46,990 --> 02:39:53,370
look like? Skin sores, skinny, can't breathe. Right. Right. That's what the other thing it

1701
02:39:53,370 --> 02:40:00,370
could do is develop these fat like tumors. We're talking about a criminal cabal, like criminal

1702
02:40:00,370 --> 02:40:05,270
group locked into the medical because what I just I just broke it all down how it is.

1703
02:40:05,590 --> 02:40:09,590
Now, if you bring up what I said to any medical person, they're going to deny it.

1704
02:40:10,450 --> 02:40:13,850
Remember, we talked about they want to. Why? Because they want to protect themselves.

1705
02:40:14,250 --> 02:40:20,790
Right. Yeah. And this is a fact. There are actually several people there. I remember not not anymore

1706
02:40:20,790 --> 02:40:28,150
on YouTube, but there were people that were explaining this this condition. Right. It's a big

1707
02:40:28,150 --> 02:40:33,710
scam. And, you know, whose fault it really is. It's the people's fault, because I put out the

1708
02:40:33,710 --> 02:40:37,770
information. Other people have put out the information where, you know, the end of the

1709
02:40:37,770 --> 02:40:42,930
Frankenstein movie, where the villagers find out what Frankenstein was doing and they show up

1710
02:40:42,930 --> 02:40:48,230
with torches and pitchforks. Right. Right. How many people does it take to tell the public this

1711
02:40:48,230 --> 02:40:56,150
before the people pick up their torches and pitchforks? Only one. Right. Only one person

1712
02:40:56,150 --> 02:41:03,010
should be right. It should be enough, but it does. It has not worked because I heard about this

1713
02:41:03,530 --> 02:41:10,390
many years ago from someone else. And it sounded crazy to me, to be honest with you. It was just

1714
02:41:10,390 --> 02:41:17,590
like, how is this possible? And they basically said almost verbatim what you just said. Okay,

1715
02:41:17,710 --> 02:41:21,810
good, because I've never heard anyone else say it this way in two minutes. I mean, I mean,

1716
02:41:21,870 --> 02:41:26,750
I could get it down to 30 seconds, but that's good if there are others out. I know there's

1717
02:41:26,750 --> 02:41:30,830
others out there. But the thing is, you got to be able to communicate in a neat little package

1718
02:41:31,390 --> 02:41:35,550
that is not intimidating and people can remember and repeat it. Yeah, but still,

1719
02:41:35,670 --> 02:41:41,750
but still I was taken aback by it because it was like, look, I saw people that seemed to be dying

1720
02:41:41,750 --> 02:41:47,850
from this. I mean, I saw, you know, people that had been in this condition. I mean,

1721
02:41:48,490 --> 02:41:52,490
sure, anyone can be positive for it because there's it's like Santa Claus shoe size.

1722
02:41:52,750 --> 02:41:57,890
Who's right? Who's wrong? Right. No, I get it. But it was just like,

1723
02:41:57,890 --> 02:42:01,850
see, that was the evidence to me that that meant that this was a real thing. But

1724
02:42:03,250 --> 02:42:07,010
you know, it was a real thing that people dying or the AIDS. Well, no,

1725
02:42:07,030 --> 02:42:10,310
people dying was a real thing. Oh, yeah, yeah. It was real because they were being

1726
02:42:11,730 --> 02:42:16,370
executed slowly by their own. Every time they receive treatment, they have to sign a whole

1727
02:42:16,370 --> 02:42:20,610
new set of contracts, which, by the way, are monetized. They they're 50,000 a piece. Like

1728
02:42:20,610 --> 02:42:27,630
when you get the Vax or by the way, not you, but whoever the paperwork is good for 50 grand

1729
02:42:27,630 --> 02:42:34,910
a pop, your signature right is like a gold bar. Right. So this is pretty this is very well known.

1730
02:42:36,350 --> 02:42:41,570
But the thing about this is I have seen people say, oh, I got tested for AIDS positive and I

1731
02:42:41,570 --> 02:42:44,110
have a girlfriend want to get married. I'm going to get treatment. So you're going to die.

1732
02:42:44,690 --> 02:42:48,450
They're going to kill you. Right. So in six months, you'll be dead. Well, I hadn't heard

1733
02:42:48,450 --> 02:42:55,830
from him again. But two years later, I asked about it. So he died. Yeah. Right. And with the new

1734
02:42:55,830 --> 02:43:00,910
thing now, there's a woman very fit. Well, she had a thing where her fingers and toes were really

1735
02:43:00,910 --> 02:43:04,950
cold and they were turning like a bluish color. And they said, yeah, it's because you just got

1736
02:43:04,950 --> 02:43:09,530
a new job and your stress goes. No, I got tested positive for this and that. I said, if you go to

1737
02:43:09,530 --> 02:43:16,990
the hospital, you're going to die. She was dead in a week. Right. Totally fit woman. So just like

1738
02:43:16,990 --> 02:43:22,650
9-11, if the buildings came down and no one died, it would be people would be so relaxed and say,

1739
02:43:22,650 --> 02:43:26,570
wait a second, there were no planes in there either. Right. You know, if you ever see a

1740
02:43:26,570 --> 02:43:33,010
video of the plane going into the building off a street view, everyone is looking across and down

1741
02:43:33,010 --> 02:43:39,590
until the building explodes. Now, that that plane was put in with CGI. Very obvious, because I don't

1742
02:43:39,590 --> 02:43:45,190
know about you, but if you go by an airport and a plane is coming in, not even as low as it was to

1743
02:43:45,190 --> 02:43:50,230
come into the building, everybody looks up. They would have looked up. But you know how loud that

1744
02:43:50,230 --> 02:43:55,470
is? Instead of coming in at maximum whatever, that would be so loud, it would be shaking the

1745
02:43:55,470 --> 02:44:00,010
ground. You would have looked up way before every film that they show of someone on the ground.

1746
02:44:00,110 --> 02:44:05,570
Pay attention. No one looks up until after the building has exploded. No one heard the air.

1747
02:44:05,850 --> 02:44:12,830
Right. That's your psychological thing. But if no one died on that day, people would be talking

1748
02:44:12,830 --> 02:44:17,910
more about what I just said. But because they allowed those people to get fried in there,

1749
02:44:17,910 --> 02:44:21,810
how many it was to be vaporized. By the way, you know, the original coroner's report,

1750
02:44:22,570 --> 02:44:26,710
the New York City coroner, state coroner for the people that died in the buildings,

1751
02:44:26,830 --> 02:44:33,450
you know what the cause of death was listed. They were vaporized. Right. And a lot of the

1752
02:44:33,450 --> 02:44:36,910
family members, what do you mean? What do you mean? And they and then they just redacted it and

1753
02:44:36,910 --> 02:44:41,610
they never replaced it because the coroner really shouldn't be lying, you know. So anyway,

1754
02:44:43,030 --> 02:44:48,010
what happens is we are mucked about with the people dying. So if you bring this up,

1755
02:44:48,190 --> 02:44:51,430
the AIDS, you know how many people have died? How dare you, Greek? Disrespectful,

1756
02:44:51,650 --> 02:44:56,210
right? You see, this is always brought up, right? Right. The Ukraine war thing. Oh,

1757
02:44:56,250 --> 02:45:04,610
what about the children? What about the children here? You see, so when you're you know that you

1758
02:45:04,610 --> 02:45:08,550
are really a spirit and I don't want to go with the airy fairy say this. So you're just a spirit

1759
02:45:08,550 --> 02:45:14,130
having a human experience. You hear that all the time. I think the stuff we spoke about on this

1760
02:45:14,130 --> 02:45:20,290
broke it down. So you have technical access to who you are. Technical access means if I have a

1761
02:45:20,290 --> 02:45:24,730
problem with this, this is a mind spirit problem. Or if I have a problem with that, that's my soul,

1762
02:45:24,830 --> 02:45:29,450
that's my breath, my metabolism. Or this is a physical body problem. And by the way,

1763
02:45:30,170 --> 02:45:34,270
whenever you're doing anything with the body, it's the soul because it's alive.

1764
02:45:35,190 --> 02:45:38,390
Right. So as long as the body is alive, the soul is part of the body.
