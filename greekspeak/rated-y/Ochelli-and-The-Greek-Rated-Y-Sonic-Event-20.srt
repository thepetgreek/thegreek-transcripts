1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:14,300
Sonic event 20 rated Y and here we are again, my apologies right out of the gate for my

2
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,320
voice tonight.

3
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,880
But then again, who knows what day it is, what time it is, as you hear us because they

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,040
are recorded for later listening.

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:32,000
Anyway, Greek, how are you on this wonderful occasion of Sonic event 20?

6
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,520
Yeah, 20.

7
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,240
Ecosy, right?

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,440
Ecosahedron.

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,820
That's one of those weird platonic solids.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,820
Have you ever heard of Ecosahedron, which is 20?

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,120
It resembles water, supposedly.

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,260
I have a bone to pick with all that stuff that they've pushed on the public because

13
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,520
there's more to it about the ether.

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,120
They're supposed to be ethereal shapes.

15
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,840
But anyway, that's another Sonic probably.

16
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,240
I wanted to bring up an email back in the day a few months ago when I started putting

17
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,160
out notices that we're going to be doing rated Y.

18
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:14,200
I got an email from someone and it was like it would be aired as being sarcastic and fiery

19
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,860
and forward, but I did enjoy it.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,920
And it started off paraphrasing something like, yeah, I see you're going to be speaking

21
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,200
again.

22
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:20,680
That's great.

23
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,580
What are you going to be talking about?

24
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,360
How to make perfect rice and everything else that's going on?

25
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,340
I don't know if you're familiar with it.

26
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:33,680
I did a couple of either private, semi-private public Sonics on Common Radio back in the

27
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,620
day about cooking.

28
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,560
I think we have Joe, I think.

29
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,440
I'll mention him by name.

30
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,000
He doesn't mind.

31
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,440
He really liked the potato recipe for baked potatoes.

32
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,180
Fire up an oven where you can do it stove top, right?

33
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:48,680
Right.

34
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,680
No, he still loves that.

35
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,280
He does that.

36
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,900
He mentions it to me all the time.

37
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,280
Yeah, yeah.

38
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:01,960
Well, the thing is, the point of that is Native Americans said white man, racist voice, white

39
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,400
man, big fire, a lot of smoke, little heat.

40
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,740
Indian, small fire, no smoke, a lot of heat, right?

41
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:10,300
Right.

42
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,880
So being efficient is really where it's at.

43
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,040
So the email went sort of fiery like that.

44
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,280
Anyone else, I think, could have taken it like as a sarcastic, but I like that kind of

45
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:21,540
stuff.

46
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,760
I like fire.

47
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,260
I mean like people on edge about a subject or an approach.

48
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,900
Not that they are on edge as a character, but it's fine to have edgy talk, right?

49
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,000
Let's have edgy emails.

50
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:41,180
So start off, I thought about that because I've kind of reflected on several things

51
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:41,960
that this is pertinent.

52
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:42,260
Why?

53
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:47,780
Because first of all, I want to mention again, when you're making rice, folks, I've talked

54
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,640
about pressure cooker is the way to go.

55
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,560
No matter what rice, you just have to know how to use a pressure cooker if you don't

56
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,060
have one.

57
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,460
Anything with a pot with a really tight lid.

58
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,300
If you buy Allclad, it's a brand.

59
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:06,160
I'm not sponsored or anything, but the Allclad, all their lids kind of fit inside of the pot,

60
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:11,540
most of them, and they kind of like with a nice tight fit.

61
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,800
Not quite a press fit, but a very tight slip fit.

62
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,160
And if you put a weight on it, a coffee mug turned upside down over the handle.

63
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:23,060
If it's a strap handle, you have to grind it out so the strap fits through.

64
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,960
And a brick wrapped in aluminum foil, because you know how bricks like to give off sand

65
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,480
even if you clean it.

66
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,360
They're soft.

67
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,540
And keep the lid on really tight.

68
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:36,220
It is a ghetto, I call, on the make improvisation cooker, rice cooker.

69
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,880
And the other thing that's imperative, which I've always used, but I haven't for a while,

70
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:46,140
and I've gone back to even making more perfect rice, is one thing that's indispensable in

71
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,760
a kitchen, especially if you understand the subtleties of cooking, which is management

72
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,200
of heat, is what's called a heat diffuser plate.

73
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,360
You can get them anywhere.

74
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,920
I mean, they're really, really cheap.

75
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,720
I remember back in the day they were a dollar in Chinatown on Canal Street.

76
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,080
Boy, I'm giving too much geography here.

77
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,980
But meaning like, I mean, if anyone's been lower Manhattan, Canal Street, you can pretty

78
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,300
much get anything there.

79
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,220
Yeah, pretty much.

80
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,520
It's real inexpensive.

81
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:18,680
So, I mean, you've got those places, parts of town in most big cities.

82
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:24,420
So, heat diffuser, you won't get that crusty burn on the bottom and it just cooks more

83
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:24,760
evenly.

84
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,200
You just got to give it a little more heat in the beginning, put the diffuser under the

85
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,380
pot once everything comes up to temp.

86
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:37,320
So, these are all very subtle, subtle things to manage.

87
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,820
By the way, one of the most difficult, not daunting, it can be based on the person's

88
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,020
character and skill level.

89
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:50,920
Again, that's why I keep insisting through Sonics that people need to increase their skill

90
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,200
level on anything.

91
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,560
But cooking is extremely challenging because there's no limit on how fine and how perfect

92
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,820
and how delicious it can be when you think about it, right?

93
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:07,400
If you ever remember, I remember when I was young, there was the Abbott Ice Cream Company

94
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,600
under the 86th Street subway and we'd go there with our bikes.

95
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,600
This was back in the mid-70s, early 70s actually.

96
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:18,580
And you know those Abbott, I don't even know if they're in business anymore, the little

97
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:23,320
ice cream sandwiches for nickel, they'd be in the freezer, you'd go to the newspaper

98
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,060
stand, right?

99
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,900
And you get the little ice cream sandwich wrapped in wax paper.

100
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,760
It was like the cheapest thing to get.

101
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:30,880
Oh, yeah, yeah.

102
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,260
I don't know if Abbott still exists, but yeah, of course.

103
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,360
Yeah, it was Abbott or something like that or Clark or something.

104
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,240
We knew where they were making them and we would go knock on the door of like four or

105
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,820
five of us on our bicycles, right?

106
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,360
Training wheels that come off like a month before, right?

107
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,040
So when I say bicycles, you get the picture here.

108
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,520
Kind of like E.T., the movie or Stranger Things.

109
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,860
Anyway, we knock on the door and a guy comes out.

110
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,760
He's got the big plastic rubber apron and the galoshes and the boots because it's all these

111
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,100
machinery.

112
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,280
It's cold and wet and all that.

113
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,100
Oh, you guys.

114
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,960
So he comes out with a cardboard box.

115
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:06,780
How many are you here?

116
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,460
All right, here, here.

117
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:13,840
And he's handing out these fresh ice cream sandwiches and they tasted nothing at all

118
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,060
like the ones you bought in the store because the ones that the wafer was soft when you

119
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:24,100
bought it in the store, but when you got it initially at the factory, it was very crispy

120
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:24,680
and crunchy.

121
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:25,380
Right.

122
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:29,720
The reason why later on I found out is because water evaporates at a higher rate once the

123
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,220
temperature goes below minus 20, right?

124
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,340
And it goes even, that's why you get freezer burn, right?

125
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,860
The evaporation water rate starts to rise very fast.

126
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:47,700
That's why, for example, you'd see people in the mountainous areas, let's say northwest,

127
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,720
they saw a Sasquatch footprint, right?

128
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,140
Well, a size nine foot overnight, if the temperature drops, that snow evaporates and now it's a

129
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,960
size 16 or size 18, right?

130
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,280
I don't know if you've ever noticed that.

131
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,640
Only happens when it gets colder, though.

132
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,620
It's a phenomenon.

133
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,700
Well, I can tell you, you know the Carvel ice cream, right?

134
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,040
For the whole northeastern area.

135
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,520
I got to tell you the reason why people love those flying saucers, which is what they call

136
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,940
a round one, is exactly this reason.

137
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,420
The cookie is still crisp because-

138
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:17,620
That's right.

139
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,340
If you wrap it, later on when it was wrapped in plastic and put it in the freezer, it was

140
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:22,560
not.

141
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,260
Right.

142
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,540
But the thing is, but still you stand a chance, even today, if you go and get them, if they

143
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,560
freshly made them.

144
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,660
See, that's the thing.

145
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,440
It hasn't had time for this other stuff to happen.

146
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:39,560
So, in a lot of cases, I don't know if Carvel still exists, but maybe about 10 years ago.

147
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,160
Yeah, I think they were absorbed.

148
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,020
There was an old Greek guy who did it.

149
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,700
He wanted soft serve ice cream.

150
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,420
You know that motion, that motion that you, you know, when the soft serve, you have to

151
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:52,500
move a cone a certain way when the soft serve's coming out of the machine, right?

152
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,680
To make that swirl?

153
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:53,960
Yeah.

154
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,020
That motion you do with your hand?

155
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:00,900
Okay, well in the fourth grade, I don't know, back in the elementary school days, right

156
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:05,880
before classes started in the homeroom or whatever, the principal or notary would make

157
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,340
a speech.

158
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,880
You know, you do this Pledge of Allegiance and then the, on the PA and all the classrooms,

159
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,320
there's this important things or whatever.

160
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,080
It was the assistant principal or principal.

161
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,700
I don't know if you remember that or they did that.

162
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,200
Yeah, they did that in high school, yeah.

163
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:18,660
Okay.

164
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:25,860
Well, when the assistant principal came on, he sounded just like the owner of the Carvel

165
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,660
ice cream company on the TV commercials.

166
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,200
Exactly.

167
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:29,320
Exactly.

168
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:35,080
So, when his voice came on, I started gesturing that I was making an ice cream cone and the

169
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,480
teacher points me out and sends me to the principal's office for being rude.

170
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,539
So, I really know what his voice sounds like.

171
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,420
True story, you know.

172
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,820
So, I just wanted to, you know.

173
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,280
Yeah, no, look, and if people are not familiar with the Northeast, he did have a distinctive

174
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,260
sound, the guy's voice on the TV commercials was.

175
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:52,820
Right.

176
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:58,120
Very distinctive and of course, my favorite is when they introduced cookie puss, which

177
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,560
Right.

178
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,940
And they made fun of it.

179
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,300
Yeah.

180
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,120
It was good.

181
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,420
It kind of sounds like you if you had a really bad sinus congestion.

182
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:05,980
Yeah.

183
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,280
And went maybe half an hour, a little bit lower.

184
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:11,740
Anyway.

185
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,720
So, I want to bring up food, food, food, food.

186
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,460
What's that we're going to be talking about?

187
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:22,680
What I wanted to get to was basically back the feeling in that email was kind of like

188
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,560
excitement that there's going to be more sonic events, but you know, like what are you going

189
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,040
to talk about?

190
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,800
I make perfect rice in this world, you know, meaning in this world, you know, however you

191
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,620
want to take it, right?

192
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,500
It's pretty shitty, right?

193
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,480
So, I want to attach this also to the topic that I've been bringing up, which is the

194
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,560
email and clearing one's mind and all that.

195
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:46,940
But before we get into any of all that directly, I'm going to do this in real time.

196
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,660
Hopefully, my memory serves me right from what I've been doing and walking around here

197
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,320
in the office.

198
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,780
Let me pull this book out here.

199
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,220
This is a – I got an Aramaic English New Testament recently.

200
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,300
Thank you very much.

201
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,220
Let's see.

202
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,720
And I'm going to do what I normally don't like doing, but it's important because it's

203
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,880
the most poignant way to describe what I'm doing with Rated Y with you as well.

204
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,480
And so – and what's coming?

205
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,160
What's this all about?

206
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,520
And it's poignant, meaning it's a lot.

207
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,560
It means a lot.

208
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,020
It's very much encompassing.

209
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:32,120
And also, I want to use it to correct the context that many, many, many, many people

210
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,820
use a particular term, that the kingdom of heaven or kingdom of God is within you.

211
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:44,540
And you hear all of these people constantly saying, not that they're religious, God

212
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,380
is within you.

213
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,620
How many times have you heard that?

214
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,540
It just makes me – yeah.

215
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,360
Okay.

216
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:49,980
Now, here's the thing.

217
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:50,840
You can say that.

218
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,760
You can say anything.

219
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:57,420
But once you start – let's say that God is within you, kingdom of heaven is within

220
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:03,020
you, extended a little bit more in the conversation, they'll say something like, yeah, Bible,

221
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,500
whatever it is, it's got some good stuff in it anyway.

222
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:06,420
Right?

223
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,220
So they always reference that comes back from the Bible.

224
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:13,300
I want to know where they got the license to use it out of context.

225
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:20,020
As far as I know, there is no license to use anything literal out of context, as far as

226
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:20,380
I know.

227
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,400
It can be done.

228
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:22,260
Right?

229
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,960
You know what I mean, using it out of context.

230
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:29,180
And I always made the analogy of, you know, you can take a chocolate chip – you want

231
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:29,840
to start a religion?

232
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,480
Real simple.

233
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,100
Don't think about it too much, because the more you think about it, you're going to

234
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:33,580
screw it up.

235
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,480
Keep it really the KISS principle.

236
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:42,400
You get a chocolate chip cookie recipe and you rewrite it a certain way.

237
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,900
You get it, rewrite it, and you make a cookie.

238
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:51,560
And one of the cookies eventually is going to come out looking like the Virgin Mary.

239
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,580
And you put it all over.

240
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,680
You show the cookie, right?

241
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,780
And you have your recipe rewritten.

242
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,800
And you know how many people – you're going to get thousands of people asking you,

243
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,460
how'd that cookie crumble, man?

244
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,180
Right?

245
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,040
You get it?

246
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,560
It's kind of like – it's so simple to do this.

247
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:13,540
So where do they get license to take things out of some place and apply it to however

248
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,740
they want to use it?

249
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,660
That's the baseball bat principle again.

250
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:24,540
So what I want to do – what I don't like to do is read from what they call the Bible.

251
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:29,740
This is – I like this because it has a better texture than King James.

252
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,720
And it actually – a while back I did look at the Aramaic on this, and it was pretty

253
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,320
clean.

254
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,720
And this one is pretty clean.

255
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:46,460
So I'm going to start sort of in the middle of chapter 17, because it's chock full of

256
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:47,980
stuff.

257
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,660
It's got about five different subjects.

258
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,380
But this is the important part.

259
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,760
Now, keep in mind, as I'm reading this whole thing, the reason I'm bringing this

260
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:02,160
up is because people – I hear people still, videos or whatever, say that God is within

261
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,400
you, the kingdom is within you.

262
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,940
And I'm going to say a little more after that.

263
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,120
Right?

264
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:06,460
You ready?

265
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,180
Sure.

266
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,560
This is the context, okay?

267
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:08,940
Okay.

268
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:15,480
And when he was near to entering into a certain village, ten men who were lepers met him,

269
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,660
and they stood from a distance.

270
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,100
And they raised their voices and said, Our Master Yahshua, have mercy on us.

271
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,080
And when he saw them, he said to them, Go show yourselves to the priests.

272
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,220
And they were cleansed while they were going.

273
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,200
But – I'm going to stop right there.

274
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,700
So you'll notice he doesn't heal anyone, right?

275
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,580
Every time that people – it's – right?

276
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,040
All these miracles, you know, when he – the water to wine, he didn't turn the water

277
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,340
into wine.

278
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,200
He told the servants, Do this and do that.

279
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:41,920
Right?

280
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:42,800
Remember?

281
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,600
The loaves of – all the fish and the loaves of bread to all those people.

282
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,580
He says, Just grab those baskets and do this.

283
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:49,220
Right.

284
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,000
You ever notice that?

285
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,320
It's all third – people think he did these miracles.

286
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:56,640
He was a component, the catalyst of it.

287
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,380
Right.

288
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,280
Okay?

289
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:04,600
But one of them, when he saw that he was cleansed, returned with a loud voice, giving praise

290
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,160
to Elohim.

291
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,300
And he fell upon his face before the feet of Yahshua while thanking him.

292
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,540
And he, this man, was a Samaritan.

293
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:15,500
And Yahshua answered and said, Were there not ten who were cleansed?

294
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,440
Where are the nine?

295
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,820
For what did they separate?

296
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,060
There's – actually, there's more in there in the Aramaic.

297
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:26,720
But for what should they separate that they should come and give praise to Elohim?

298
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,500
Only this man did, who was from foreign people.

299
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,360
And he said to him, Arise, go.

300
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,340
Your faith has given you life.

301
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:39,220
And when those from the Pharisees asked when the kingdom of Elohim would come, he answered

302
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,460
and said to them, The kingdom of Elohim, or God, does not come by observation.

303
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:48,140
Neither will they say, Behold, here it is, nor behold, there it is.

304
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,400
For the kingdom of Elohim is within you.

305
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,660
I'm going to stop right there.

306
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,940
I should keep going to keep the context.

307
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:58,500
But if you remember, I said, I'm going to start in the middle of chapter 17.

308
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:04,640
And the first thing I said, and when he was near to entering into a certain village,

309
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,360
ten men who were lepers met him, right?

310
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:06,660
Okay.

311
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:14,980
When that statement is used in context, that the kingdom of Elohim is within you,

312
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,440
he's referring to the village, not the individual's body.

313
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,580
You get it?

314
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,880
You ever hear about, What the hell's going on in this place?

315
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,100
Right?

316
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,080
Someone walks in here, in a room, let's say, What the hell's going on in here?

317
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:31,440
Right.

318
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,880
Does he mean like in your body, or does he mean in the room?

319
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,380
Within the place, yeah.

320
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,180
The approximation.

321
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,520
Yeah, it's an approximation.

322
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,320
Right?

323
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:41,740
Yeah.

324
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,140
Because the whole context here is about him going into a village,

325
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,080
and the setting are the lepers and the Pharisees and whatever.

326
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,940
Later on, the village is identified.

327
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:57,180
Okay, so when he says the you part, it's because the group is asking him.

328
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,280
You're in the village too.

329
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,260
He's asking him.

330
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,840
The group is asking him, so he's saying it's within the group there.

331
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,400
It's within you, where you are.

332
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:04,820
Yeah, exactly.

333
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,960
It's the same thing as saying you walk into a room right now,

334
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,140
wherever there's something strange.

335
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,340
It's like, What the hell's going on here?

336
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,060
Well, where's here?

337
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:16,140
Well, the easiest way to define it in context would be,

338
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,500
is it the house?

339
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,820
You walked into the house or a room or a town, right?

340
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,360
Can you say that if you just drove into a town?

341
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,360
What the hell's going on here?

342
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,880
What's going on with you?

343
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,700
No, you're looking at the one area of observation,

344
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,880
the one area that's being addressed.

345
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,580
Yeah, it could be a room.

346
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,560
Okay.

347
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,540
Yeah, it's not a spiritual.

348
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:39,020
In other words, the point is that it's within the village context,

349
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:44,940
because he is there, wherever he is representative of the kingdom.

350
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,760
Okay, so this is very simple.

351
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,320
People want to think about it.

352
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,740
Actually, I can continue,

353
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,000
because the rest of this is important to what I wanted to discuss,

354
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,660
including what goes on in the mind.

355
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,760
Yeah, you said the rest of it would set the rest of the context.

356
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,140
So please, yeah, go ahead.

357
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,280
The context of more of the sonic.

358
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:05,819
Yeah.

359
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,900
But I just want to bring up,

360
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:11,520
there is no license for changing or reapplying things, right?

361
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,579
You know, they call those memes and things like that, you know,

362
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,599
urban myths, urban myths or falsehoods, right?

363
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,800
Okay, so this was pretty easy.

364
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:29,000
But to continue, and he said to his disciples,

365
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,120
now this is where I want to get in,

366
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,780
this is what the sonic is going to be,

367
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,600
and basically what I've been discussing indirectly for all these years.

368
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:36,160
Okay.

369
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:41,300
The days will come when you will covet to see one of the days of the son of man,

370
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,560
and you will not see it.

371
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,220
And if they say to you, behold, here it is,

372
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,920
and behold, there it is, do not go.

373
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,220
As for flashes of lightning from heaven,

374
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,400
and all that is under heaven is lit,

375
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,300
such will be the son of man in his day.

376
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,280
But first it is necessary that he suffer many things

377
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,040
and be rejected by this generation.

378
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,880
And it is what is in the days of Noah,

379
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,280
likewise it will be in the days of the son of man.

380
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,260
For they were eating and drinking and taking wives

381
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,400
and giving them to husbands until the day of Noah

382
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,480
entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed everyone.

383
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,580
And again as it was in the days of Lot,

384
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,540
and they were eating and drinking and buying and selling,

385
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,660
planting and were building.

386
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,800
But on the day Lot went out from Sodom,

387
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,660
Master Yahweh rained down fire and brimstone from heaven

388
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,800
and destroyed all of them.

389
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,300
Thus it will be in the day of the son of man as revealed.

390
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,280
In that day he who was on the roof

391
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,420
and his possessions are in his house,

392
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,400
don't let him come down and take them.

393
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,080
And he who was in the field, do not let him turn back.

394
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,620
Remember the wife of Lot.

395
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,480
He who desires to save his soul will destroy it

396
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,760
and he who destroys his soul will make it live.

397
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,520
So all those contexts there cover up on very, very heavy stuff,

398
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,000
even to the point where, you know,

399
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,960
don't come down and get your stuff when you see this

400
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,280
because, oh, my stuff, right?

401
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,440
My stuff, are you sure?

402
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,740
So I'm going to close this.

403
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,420
That was a very poignant, that's been buzzing around,

404
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,340
bouncing around in the head for a little while

405
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,860
because it covers so many things.

406
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,280
Internally, I stopped myself a few times

407
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,020
and I said the next time I hear on a video

408
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,040
or someone say the kingdom of God is within you,

409
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:17,200
meaning that, you know, we're not in that village

410
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,580
and it's way past gone, so you really can't use that properly.

411
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,460
You can use, you can say anything you want.

412
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,720
You could say you're the guy who started the Carvel Ice Cream Company

413
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,500
if you want, right?

414
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,340
But guess what?

415
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,040
It's not true.

416
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,440
Right.

417
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,460
So if you notice, the rest of it was about catastrophism.

418
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,500
He brings up Noah.

419
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,020
He brings up Sodom and Gomorrah.

420
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:39,500
Right.

421
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,820
Those were local events, except for, well,

422
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:45,780
the flood of Noah was a global, but it went across the planet, right?

423
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:50,400
And if, again, Jason Breshears talks a lot about the vapor canopy.

424
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:54,760
I started talking about the vapor canopy in the mid to late 2000s,

425
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,280
back in the Revolution Radio days,

426
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,700
about how we had the canopy theory, right?

427
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,240
We were completely covered.

428
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,660
The sky was nothing like this.

429
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,240
But Jason Breshears would be the vapor canopy guy to go to.

430
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,840
I don't endorse him, but he has good info on that.

431
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,360
Okay.

432
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,100
Okay, and that's the thing.

433
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,420
I'm always looking for people that put out good info,

434
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,700
and if I find them, I'll tell you, hey, this is what I think about it,

435
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,940
and yeah, definitely, right?

436
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,100
Okay.

437
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,640
Now, it's interesting.

438
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,700
You say, well, someone might think, well, Greek,

439
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,760
there haven't been any catastrophes since then.

440
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,240
Yeah, there are.

441
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,120
They're always local.

442
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,840
Back in 2004, what was it, a quarter of a million people,

443
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,420
some tsunami, some island got washed over.

444
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,320
Remember in 2004?

445
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:40,660
Right?

446
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,420
So for them, that was really bad.

447
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,700
So you have these very localized events.

448
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:50,080
There were many worldwide events that had been redacted from history, okay?

449
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,760
Because remember, they don't want to advertise.

450
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:57,440
The forces, the human forces on Earth don't tell

451
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,900
and don't want memorialized in history things that they did not create

452
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,060
or have full control over.

453
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:02,760
Right?

454
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,440
So that's why I say when there are real terror events,

455
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,240
you just never hear about them as such.

456
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,600
There are military exercises, they call them, you know.

457
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,660
Everybody's wondering what the hell is going on here,

458
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,280
and there's no answer until the next day.

459
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,800
Oh, we were just doing something.

460
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,580
Sure you were.

461
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,080
Right.

462
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,540
Some idiot got a hold of something, usually idiots,

463
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,080
and they found out, well, this is too dangerous.

464
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,800
We're going to look bad if it goes off.

465
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:27,140
But what they call terrorists are just basically exercises,

466
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,200
most of them nuclear.

467
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,080
And when you say nuclear, people wonder, you know.

468
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:35,560
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, you know, they're so small

469
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,240
they could basically look like the older cell phones.

470
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:39,800
Right?

471
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,440
That's how small they are now, 15th generation.

472
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:49,920
So the catastrophe element is what Earth is about.

473
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:54,280
You know, okay, it's the blue marble, beautiful Earth, Mother Earth.

474
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,560
It is a sentient being, by the way.

475
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:03,960
All these other things, we are on the catastrophist planet.

476
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:09,920
Meaning, I once was discussing this with someone on Skype

477
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,220
invited me years ago, and one of the women started crying

478
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,900
because she was actually from Jersey, had a real heavy Jersey accent.

479
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:15,480
Yeah.

480
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,380
And she was crying, I don't know if I could take this.

481
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,900
I was like, oh my gosh, you know.

482
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,260
So it's not for everyone.

483
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:22,800
Right.

484
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:28,360
What I see the catastrophism that comes in the 500, 1500, 2000,

485
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,460
and then 6,000 years, it's like blinking an eye.

486
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,440
You know, when I say not blinking an eye in terms of time,

487
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,940
but you blink to clear the lens, right?

488
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:38,420
Yeah.

489
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,040
And to moisturize, right?

490
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,120
Yeah, it does many, many things.

491
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,900
So it's basically a dog shaking off, right?

492
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:52,940
And the value of humanity is as high as you want to consider it,

493
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:58,080
but like I've always said, most of the population does not matter

494
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:03,100
to the powers that be, both human powers and non-human powers.

495
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:03,480
Right.

496
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,260
And you know what?

497
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,340
It never did.

498
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,620
Most of the population, it was always a small group.

499
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:14,780
Just like you have a seed bank to store seeds,

500
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:20,560
that's how the society has always been running, as long as there's a remnant.

501
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:26,240
And the thing is, what do you do here while you're here?

502
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:31,140
To a certain amount, you have more choice than you think you do

503
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:35,700
once you know more about things, let's say.

504
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,320
That might sound confusing.

505
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:38,560
Right.

506
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:39,940
So, okay.

507
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:40,660
You ready?

508
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,200
Yeah.

509
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,260
If you hear a lot of Greek-speak, or since I've been doing Greek-speak

510
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,740
on the Internet or whatever,

511
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,340
because I've been doing it for more than a decade and a half before,

512
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:58,380
you hear a lot of things that you don't know about things you already know about, right?

513
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:58,720
Right.

514
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,160
Like the body induction, the money system, the government doesn't exist.

515
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,440
Those are a lot.

516
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,260
I really talk about a lot of things that most people don't know,

517
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,480
but it's about things that they know.

518
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,280
Okay.

519
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:16,560
How about talking about things that people don't know about things that they don't know?

520
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,480
Oh, my gosh.

521
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,180
Then you have no place to start.

522
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,940
You don't have a point of reference.

523
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:22,760
Right.

524
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:28,040
Now, the problem that I have with that is when I start to get into that zone,

525
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,920
because there are things that are not known,

526
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,360
using language and means of communication that are known,

527
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,460
that were designed to communicate known things,

528
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:45,460
how are you going to use that toolbox and apply it to things that are unknown

529
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,960
and not known that those words don't really do, let's say,

530
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,400
quote-unquote, justice to describe?

531
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,440
You need new words now.

532
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,040
You need new words.

533
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,520
It becomes a challenge because the old words don't match the new thing.

534
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:58,800
It doesn't.

535
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,260
Right.

536
00:24:59,460 --> 00:24:59,660
Exactly.

537
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,520
It's not a matter of square peg in a square hole or round peg in a round hole.

538
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,520
These things, there's no pegs.

539
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,640
There's no pegs.

540
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,180
There's no holes.

541
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,120
This is a completely different setting.

542
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,780
And when something new is introduced in general, right,

543
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,560
it's usually because it's an adaptation from the language.

544
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,000
Okay.

545
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,440
Technically speaking, right, at one point there was a clock.

546
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,620
At another point, there's a wristwatch.

547
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:23,600
Okay.

548
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,400
Why is that called a watch as opposed to a clock?

549
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:26,840
Right.

550
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,440
Okay.

551
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,780
Well, computer.

552
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:30,460
Yeah.

553
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,740
Well, look at the computer language.

554
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,640
Why do they call it Windows?

555
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,720
Is it a name?

556
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,300
Is it a window?

557
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,880
Why not just call it an operating system?

558
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,020
Well, there you go.

559
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:38,940
But they do.

560
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,180
But the thing is, operating system.

561
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,180
Even again, it's still not, you know, here we go.

562
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:50,240
They usually build off of something that's semi-familiar and then sometimes, you know, like an airplane.

563
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:51,780
Okay.

564
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,060
There's a good example.

565
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,740
There were not airplanes for a bit.

566
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,120
Right.

567
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,640
So how did we build an airplane?

568
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,640
And then how did we name it?

569
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,580
Well, it had to be named something that was semi-familiar.

570
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,240
So you have to build off of it somehow.

571
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:14,640
But until it's done, until the new thing is there, I mean, you bring up that word to somebody 100 years before it showed up.

572
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,320
They don't know what you're talking about.

573
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,380
Most didn't, but it was already known.

574
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:25,220
Everything was already known by the late 1890s.

575
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:25,720
Okay.

576
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:30,760
But if you went to somebody in the 1890s and you said cell phone, they'd say, what?

577
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,340
What is that?

578
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,180
But, you know, there were cell phones that existed since the 40s.

579
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,160
Truckers had them, right?

580
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,220
Because they had the cell towers along the highway.

581
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,180
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

582
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:43,240
It looked like a regular telephone, a wooden box.

583
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,200
Yeah.

584
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,980
So they kept that name, by the way.

585
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,240
Cell towers.

586
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:58,000
No, the thing that I'm trying to pertain to here is that one way, okay, it's episode 20, which is kind of funky.

587
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,920
It's a funky number, by the way.

588
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,360
Yes.

589
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:09,720
You're in a place, on a place, near a place that is reset by catastrophes.

590
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:17,920
More than you believe to know and know, meaning you, as it's discussed in society,

591
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,320
the thing is most of these things have been brought down to myth.

592
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:31,140
You know, a myth is designed for a society.

593
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:39,200
For an individual, when an individual has a story or an idea, it's a dream, right?

594
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,700
Or it's a fantasy.

595
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,860
But when you have a dream or a fantasy applying to a society, it's called a myth.

596
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,160
It's interesting how this works.

597
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,180
But here's the analogy.

598
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:56,520
The analogy is you're in a place, one of the things they used to say, it's very, very violent.

599
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:02,660
If you woke up this morning and you hadn't had someone crawl into the room while you were sleeping

600
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:07,620
and try to rip the liver out of your body or your kidney, you're fortunate.

601
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,560
You're fortunate.

602
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,960
You know, they say you should be appreciative, right?

603
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,060
But here's the thing.

604
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:17,560
If you're not so fortunate but you're fortunate enough to hear me means you survived it

605
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:22,140
and you caught the guy or the gal and you said, why are you trying to do this to me?

606
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,320
All they do is say, because I feel like it.

607
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,320
Right?

608
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,100
You see what I mean?

609
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:31,180
This is the type of world you're in.

610
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,540
So how does anything else matter?

611
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:41,960
Well, the only way things matter is if you create a very organized structure of thinking and perception,

612
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,700
a box, and you keep people in that box, right?

613
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,820
Kind of like a pet, but not really a wild animal, but a pet.

614
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:53,320
You put them in a box, and that's where it gets used to being, right?

615
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:01,160
It's a very small box that has been made for society and the individuals within it

616
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,340
regarding any field, any topic.

617
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:10,440
But when you understand that the earth goes through a series of catastrophes, minor and major, on schedule,

618
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:18,140
and it's to reclaim the setting, meaning like there are people here and now there are not,

619
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,180
and we start all over.

620
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,740
Yes, that's where you are.

621
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:27,420
Just like think of this world as when you go to an amusement park, you go to one particular ride,

622
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,240
that ride has its own attributes, right?

623
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,260
Whatever it might be.

624
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,040
So the ride you're on is called earth, and what is this ride about?

625
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,260
That's the ride.

626
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,180
That's how it works.

627
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,040
Resets, wipeouts, and then you start all over.

628
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,820
Very little remnant.

629
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:43,040
Right.

630
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,220
Now, some people call these epochs, right?

631
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,280
Or ages.

632
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:46,960
Ages.

633
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:47,380
Okay.

634
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:47,980
Right.

635
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,100
So the whole thing now, how are you here?

636
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:59,000
Most people don't give this, and I'm not saying that you should lean on this and make it an obsession.

637
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:05,080
You can, but you have to do it very orderly because it's kind of like I give the analogy,

638
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:11,380
could it be one of the last things a fish realizes right before he dies is that he spent his whole life in water?

639
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:12,800
Right.

640
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:13,760
The obvious, right?

641
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,620
They don't think about it, but fish drink water.

642
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:17,780
They do through the gills.

643
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:20,040
The water passes through the gills and osmosis, right?

644
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:26,760
That's why when you poison a lake, not all the fish die at once.

645
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,440
Eventually they all do.

646
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:32,940
The fish that were drinking water at the time early on die first.

647
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:36,180
The ones that weren't thirsty die a little later.

648
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,620
Greek, that doesn't make any sense.

649
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,020
They're in water.

650
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:38,340
I know.

651
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,180
Think about it, though.

652
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:39,820
Right?

653
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,700
That's how things are.

654
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:41,980
Okay.

655
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,740
It's kind of like someone goes and gets a boat loan, and he says,

656
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,120
a bank just gave me $40,000 for a boat.

657
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,340
I said, but bank doesn't have any money to lend anyone anything.

658
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,520
He took your signature amount.

659
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,240
I don't know, Greek man, you got that weird sense of where do you get that from?

660
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,620
Nobody talks like you.

661
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,620
You know what I mean?

662
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,140
I said, yeah, go ask them.

663
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,640
Show me the money.

664
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:01,840
They don't have any money.

665
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,640
It's very easy to start a bank.

666
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:09,400
All you need is a room with a ledger and a computer to some Fed window, and that's it.

667
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,340
We have loans.

668
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,100
We give loans.

669
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:11,500
Come in.

670
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:11,900
All right, boom.

671
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,220
You just get a transaction number.

672
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:13,520
You're done.

673
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,120
You don't need any money.

674
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:19,060
Anyway, this is bizarre compared to how people think.

675
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:25,360
But when you see people who study fish know that the fish that die first are the ones that were thirsty.

676
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,540
The ones that died later were not so thirsty, you see.

677
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:33,580
So it's them not being in the poison but drinking the Kool-Aid, so to speak, right?

678
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,060
Okay.

679
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,740
That's what the punchline is.

680
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,120
So they make this very, very little narrow box.

681
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,840
Now, you don't feel like you're in a box because you're not in a physical box.

682
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,780
It's a mental box.

683
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:47,620
The topic, and let's just say, when you're listening to what I'm saying,

684
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:56,360
even now you're referring to the words that I'm using by whatever definition you apply based on previous thinking and your current thinking.

685
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:08,520
What I wanted to do is go back to the previous sonic or two about how emptying the thought is not really a good way.

686
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:15,420
Like the voice that you have that you think is you that sounds like you in your head, I'm telling you, is not you.

687
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:16,340
Right.

688
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,220
It's not you.

689
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,460
It's playing you.

690
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:23,200
In other words, you wouldn't listen to it if it didn't sound like you.

691
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,520
Well, that's the thing.

692
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:29,420
If you heard a strange voice in there that didn't sound familiar at all to you, you'd be disturbed by it.

693
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,320
I mean, well, most people would be.

694
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:32,580
Exactly.

695
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,760
Now, that's the interesting thing.

696
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:40,840
You know, there's a thing about the silence between the notes makes the music because if there's no silence between the notes, there's no music, right?

697
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,240
Of course.

698
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,100
So you're going to find out who you are when you make it quiet.

699
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,200
Now, here's the other thing.

700
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:55,920
The perception, whether you view the world as being a series of catastrophes, oh, no, what do we do, or this is where we are, let's make the best of it, is based on your thinking.

701
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:04,960
But when you're thinking, you're placing these things through various conditions within the box that you were born into, first started with your parents.

702
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,120
You know, I used to go on calls, by the way, years ago.

703
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,760
People used to blame, you know, it was the blame game on the politicians.

704
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,040
What was the alternative?

705
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:19,700
Whatever alternative or mainstream was talking about this week and everybody gathered on a Skype call and talked about it.

706
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:25,900
They said, oh, how screwed up Soros is or how screwed up Bush or Obama is, right, all this other Trump or whatever.

707
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,840
I'm like, oh, look, okay, okay.

708
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,480
I've been listening to you guys for a while now.

709
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,540
You're looking to blame.

710
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,080
You know who you've got to blame?

711
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,740
Your parents.

712
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,960
Your parents screwed you up, right?

713
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:43,300
Did Soros put the little pacifier in your mouth and change your diaper and say mommy, say mommy, say daddy?

714
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,000
Did Trump, right?

715
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,300
No, none of those guys.

716
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,220
Those guys don't even exist as they are.

717
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:50,960
They're puppets.

718
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,140
Your parents screwed you up.

719
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:57,060
So if you want to call someone an asshole, call up your mom and dad.

720
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,500
You see, that's where it started, the position you're in right now.

721
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,920
They're the ones that actually built the box for you, right?

722
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,300
Well, they're the ones that introduce you to the world, right?

723
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:14,980
They're the ones that initially provide you with everything that is required.

724
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,560
They're the ones that begin to teach you how to relate.

725
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:19,520
As they know.

726
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:25,620
They're the ones that teach you what the name of everything is, where things are, how things work.

727
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,900
That all comes from them to begin with, doesn't it?

728
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:28,159
Right.

729
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:34,219
Now, if you're in a society where you're not complaining and everything's fine, even if it's worse than George Orwell,

730
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:37,219
you thank your parents, right?

731
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,440
Because everything's going fine.

732
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:40,239
You know, it's all a matter of how it is.

733
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:41,639
But here's a point.

734
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,380
If you, Steiner, Rudolf Steiner, talked about a lot of stuff about thinking spiritually.

735
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,120
It's a little too airy-fairy.

736
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:56,380
The thing about studying or reading Steiner really pisses me off because you've got to go through a lot of lengthy stuff to get something.

737
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:01,160
It's kind of like, you know, when you're squeezing a lemon and you don't want to throw it away.

738
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:05,000
You want to get every last drop out of it because it's wasteful, right?

739
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,200
It's kind of like that.

740
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,940
It's like everything's been squeezed out.

741
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:11,340
Anyway, it's too airy-fairy for me.

742
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,640
I'm not saying it's not good.

743
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,120
It's too airy-fairy for me.

744
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:22,380
But one thing that I got from Steiner was that if we really cleared our thoughts and we didn't have thoughts

745
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:29,020
and we got into this world without the box, without the overlay, the brainwashing and the convention,

746
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:32,800
we wouldn't see anything as we see it.

747
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,160
Everything would appear to us.

748
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,460
And you can do this now, by the way.

749
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:43,520
If you didn't have any thoughts and you really cleared that voice, you would see everything as shapes and colors.

750
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,660
You wouldn't say, oh, look, I'm in the room.

751
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,380
That's the chair.

752
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,100
That's the speaker.

753
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:47,920
This is a microphone.

754
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,540
This is the computer.

755
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,440
This is the fan.

756
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,620
You wouldn't say that.

757
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,800
You would just see colors and shapes.

758
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,300
You would not acknowledge them.

759
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,980
And you wouldn't call it by a color, by a name either.

760
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,500
It would just be what it is that you're interpreting.

761
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,000
Right.

762
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,300
When I say color, it's because there's a variation in the frequency, let's say.

763
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,060
That's why.

764
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:16,440
And the shape, there's a variation in the plane, whether it comes towards you, away from you, is it curved, flat, whatever, pointy.

765
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:22,200
All you would see is color and shape.

766
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,880
And there would be no, this is not a book, this is not a chair.

767
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,620
It would just be the color and shape of each item.

768
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:32,360
And you would not acknowledge it as, yes, the book, of course.

769
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,520
I'm not saying not acknowledging its function.

770
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,740
If you can do this, by the way, if you can just see things.

771
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,520
This is what inventors and designers do, by the way.

772
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,420
I'm giving away a big secret.

773
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:51,760
I took a, well, when I was in, I was trained as a designer years, years ago.

774
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,380
I was very, very young.

775
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:57,820
And I was, people, anyway, my history, I was very advanced.

776
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:02,880
And they put me in places where when I hung out with other people, it's a student body.

777
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,780
They would come to those other people and say, hey, did you bring your little brother to school?

778
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:07,280
How cute.

779
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,580
No, he's not my little brother.

780
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,420
He's here with us.

781
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,220
I'm like, oh, okay.

782
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,640
That's my young life situation.

783
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:19,720
But I had a really good designer teacher, and he said, the first day in class, we walked in.

784
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,860
He introduces himself, says what the class is about.

785
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:26,280
He says, everybody in this class gets a B automatically.

786
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,120
And we're all looking at each other like, whoa.

787
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:35,480
He says, don't think you can't show up because if you don't, it's based on attendance school policy.

788
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:39,840
I'll have to give you a failing grade if you don't, if you stop showing up, right?

789
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:46,280
But everyone here does a B, and you're going to think it's not fair because somebody might do better work than someone else.

790
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,320
But everybody gets a B.

791
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:57,000
The reason why is because this is design, and I want to bring out the most fundamental creativity that I could possibly get out of you.

792
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:00,920
Leave everything you've ever forgotten, anything you've ever learned or seen or thought before.

793
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:01,880
We're going to start new.

794
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,240
Sounds like what I'm talking about, right?

795
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,140
And then someone says, well, why does everyone get a B?

796
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:07,940
Why?

797
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:14,000
The reason why is because when you go out into the world and you're a designer, no one looks beyond five feet in front of them.

798
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,380
You'd make a beautiful building.

799
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,880
No one notices it.

800
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,100
You make a beautiful teapot.

801
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,400
Very few people will ever notice it.

802
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,680
So no one's noticing anything.

803
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,640
You're going to put your whole life in there, just beautiful stuff.

804
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,420
So I'm going to give you a taste of what it's like.

805
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:36,720
See, because someone might want to get a higher grade, and someone might slack off and get a lower grade.

806
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,820
And the person with a higher grade wants to feel the reward of a higher grade, right?

807
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:40,160
Right.

808
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:42,960
But he's telling you, don't look for rewards in this world.

809
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:43,760
Do you see what he's saying?

810
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:44,580
Mm-hmm.

811
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:49,420
And he basically is telling you the slackers are going to get rewarded just as well as the overachievers.

812
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:50,160
Mm-hmm.

813
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,140
Right?

814
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,020
How many times have you heard that, right, in an office situation?

815
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,080
The guy's a total slacker.

816
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,440
He's making more money than me, right?

817
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,180
Right.

818
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:05,040
So he actually set up a real-world situation within a situation within the real world,

819
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:09,020
which is to really break out of design and how to look at things.

820
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,540
Just forget it.

821
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:11,880
I'll give an example.

822
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:12,860
This is very pertinent.

823
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,780
This was architecture.

824
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,560
So what do you do in architecture class?

825
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,320
You draw buildings, usually, right?

826
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:20,220
And there's industrial design, like Frank Lloyd Wright.

827
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:24,220
He did furniture and down to forks and knives and lamps, chairs, right?

828
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:28,000
From what I understand, you draw a lot of stuff is what you do.

829
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:28,760
Mm-hmm.

830
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:28,980
Yeah.

831
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,480
And it usually has to do with building stuff, right?

832
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,360
When you start, there's typically buildings.

833
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:33,800
Right.

834
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:38,700
You have landscape architecture, there's parks, you know, all forms of it, down to furniture.

835
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,220
Yeah.

836
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:39,860
All right.

837
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,980
So, see, he really got us on this.

838
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,880
So he says, I'm going to give you three pieces of paper, no, five pieces of paper.

839
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:48,380
Mm-hmm.

840
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:50,140
And you're going to go home with these.

841
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,220
It was a two-hour class.

842
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,060
We're 15 minutes into the class.

843
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,520
And he says, take these five pieces of paper.

844
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,040
He gives us these five pieces of blank paper.

845
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:02,040
So I want you to mark them one through five, and I want you to take them home.

846
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:07,020
And on each page, I want you to draw five lines, three intersecting or two intersecting,

847
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:11,580
on each page that are aesthetically pleasing to you, however you want to put the lines, you know, on the page.

848
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:12,100
Okay.

849
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:12,780
One through five.

850
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,700
All right, go home.

851
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,500
Go to the lunchroom.

852
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,200
He's like, oh, what do we got, another hour and 45 minutes?

853
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,180
Ah, just go to the lunchroom.

854
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,460
He was so cool like that.

855
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,060
You know, in a two-hour class, they want to keep you there for two hours, right?

856
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,520
Yeah, well, not in this case.

857
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,440
Okay, just go ahead.

858
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,920
Yeah, in this case, he's like, go to the lunchroom.

859
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,320
So we're like, this guy is so fucking cool, right?

860
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:28,740
Right.

861
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,040
So we go home.

862
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:31,700
I draw the lines.

863
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:35,840
The next day we go in, or two days later, he says, take out those five pages.

864
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:36,600
We got them.

865
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,780
We're like, oh, this is so great.

866
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,860
He's such a cool teacher, right?

867
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:45,120
So he says, out of those five that you have aesthetically pleasing lines,

868
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,440
I want you to pick three out of the five, put two away.

869
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,260
All right, we do that.

870
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:52,480
And he says, I want you out of the three, pick the two that you like the most.

871
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:53,620
Right?

872
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,140
So he picked the two, put the other ones away.

873
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,900
He says, right, mark one of them letter A and one letter B.

874
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,560
All right, what the hell, where's he going with this?

875
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,720
Where's he going with this, right?

876
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:04,720
You know?

877
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,080
And he goes, okay, letter A is going to be the floor plan of the house you're going to design,

878
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,500
and letter B is going to be the elevation.

879
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,700
We're like, holy shit.

880
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:19,700
Because I've got lines here that are like really, really skinny lines close together, two of them,

881
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,440
and three of them are off to the side.

882
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,060
Okay.

883
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:22,960
What the hell?

884
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,340
How are you going to build a house with the interior floor plan with these two little skinny lines

885
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,400
with the rooms three feet wide and 40 feet long?

886
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,280
What are you going to do with that?

887
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,340
Mm-hmm.

888
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:32,060
Right?

889
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:35,260
And then the elevation, you've got like three skinny lines close to the bottom,

890
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:38,960
and this big square on top, so you're going to have three floors with each the height

891
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,940
and the floor to ceiling is three, four feet in each floor.

892
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,520
And the other one's got a 30-foot ceiling.

893
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:45,700
How are you going to build anything?

894
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,720
How are you going to make that usable?

895
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,520
So he screwed us.

896
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:50,760
You know?

897
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,340
Mm-hmm.

898
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,260
But he says you made your own bed, right?

899
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:56,100
But he didn't tell us why we were drawing lines, you see.

900
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:56,500
Right.

901
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:00,760
So now we're spending, we're racking our brains for three, four, five, six months.

902
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:01,880
How the hell?

903
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,540
You know, because when you have those lines, those are your floor plans and elevations,

904
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,800
you do a scale to it, right?

905
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,360
So you can imagine some random lines on a page.

906
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,660
If that's a floor plan, it's like you can imagine one room being 20 by 30

907
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:15,600
and the other room being four feet by 30.

908
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,160
What are you going to do with that?

909
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,780
That's your bedroom?

910
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,840
I mean, how are you going to live in a room that's four feet wide and 30 feet long with two people?

911
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:23,480
Right.

912
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,480
How's that possible, right?

913
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:29,000
So we started making these things where you, like these archways that you have to walk over the ramp.

914
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,040
So when somebody's coming this way, you can't pass them.

915
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:31,900
You've got to walk over.

916
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:36,800
So we started designing all this weird shit, really got out-of-the-box thinking, right?

917
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,600
And the whole time, no matter how frustrating it is, you made it, right?

918
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:42,960
You made it.

919
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,080
You're the one that drew it.

920
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,180
So he was really cool.

921
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,380
Then he became a real asshole.

922
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:53,380
He was like, I can't figure out how we're going to make two bedrooms in a four-foot-wide by 35-foot-long space

923
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,000
with a 25-foot ceiling.

924
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:59,140
That sounds like the back of an accessory in an industrial place.

925
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,460
You know, you can't use that.

926
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:01,260
What is that?

927
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,620
That's not usable.

928
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,380
You made it.

929
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:04,940
You drew it.

930
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:05,620
Don't look at me.

931
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,380
You got to do it, right?

932
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:12,680
So I was like, that was the most frustrating six months or five months of my life.

933
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,820
I was around 15 at the time.

934
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:21,800
So at that point, I started picking up on other things, and I always referred to being so frustrated,

935
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:25,100
but being reminded I made it, I made it that way.

936
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:31,440
But I made it that way because I didn't know what the hell, what it was for, what I was doing, right?

937
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,480
So I'm in this place where I have to blame myself,

938
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:38,440
but I can't blame myself because I didn't know what I was doing, right?

939
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:39,260
You get it?

940
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:44,500
How many times have I gotten messages about people saying, I didn't know what I was doing.

941
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,700
I went and got a bank loan.

942
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:48,820
I heard you talk about how the money works, and now I feel like shit

943
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,540
because I thought they were lending me money.

944
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:52,760
Right.

945
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:53,800
Right?

946
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,140
You get it?

947
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:58,660
No, if you don't know in the first place, I mean, yeah, I got it.

948
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,180
I got it.

949
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,460
But you're stuck with it.

950
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:02,040
Okay, so here's the thing.

951
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,140
There's a level of creativity.

952
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:08,360
The whole class was not about sitting there and being frustrated about it,

953
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:09,700
but what are you going to do about it?

954
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,920
And the only way we could have do something about it is by seeing what needed to be done,

955
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:19,620
having it all preplanned as much as possible, and then having it executed

956
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:22,220
because the whole thing was we were just designing.

957
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,320
We're not executing anything.

958
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,100
We're not building anything.

959
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,540
This is all specifications for someone else to build, let's say.

960
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,540
That's what architects do.

961
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:28,920
Right.

962
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:32,460
So that's what they're hired for.

963
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:33,600
Right.

964
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:38,700
By the way, if you know any architects, the more, let's just say,

965
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,520
cerebral ones are really weird people.

966
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:44,020
I worked for some of them, for actually pretty famous ones.

967
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,460
One of them, their dad comes from a very famous art family.

968
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,060
We visited this one house that he had.

969
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,080
It was on the Hudson Valley, right?

970
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:53,660
Okay.

971
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,100
And I'm on the second floor bedroom, and he's like,

972
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:58,300
be careful when you open the sliding door.

973
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,260
It's like a cabin-ish kind of wood.

974
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,200
They never built the balcony.

975
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,220
So you're up like on a cliff.

976
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,540
You open the sliding door.

977
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:07,720
You look, oh, man, oh, shit.

978
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:08,640
There's nothing here.

979
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,380
I could fall down and kill myself.

980
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:15,760
So they left things like that really strange because it wasn't – anyway,

981
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:17,820
very odd stuff going on.

982
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:26,560
So anyway, you end up making – you end up – even though you don't know –

983
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,280
look, here, most of the people listening to me,

984
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,740
I know you don't have to tell me.

985
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:30,340
You don't have to agree.

986
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,620
I know, like, your parents didn't know what the hell was going on.

987
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,760
Nobody around you knows what's going on.

988
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:39,400
I usually – when people come to me and discuss a problem,

989
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:42,760
and it usually errs on their personal – it sounds like it's a personal problem.

990
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:46,060
I say, well, first of all, you know that everyone around you is a moron.

991
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,960
You're completely surrounded by idiots, right?

992
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:52,860
I've been saying this for about three decades now, and not once, not once,

993
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,180
has anyone stopped and said, Greek, how dare you say that?

994
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:56,500
I'm not surrounded by idiots.

995
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:57,340
No one.

996
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,580
Everyone acquiesces to it, right?

997
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:01,120
Everyone.

998
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:04,840
Okay, that's how I start off because it's the same thing.

999
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,060
Yes, you're not in a good situation, but you know what?

1000
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:10,820
You're in that situation, so no one put a gun to your –

1001
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:16,980
somehow you got yourself into it, and you're in it now, and if you think about it – right?

1002
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:17,620
Right.

1003
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:21,740
Okay, so you don't want to think about it in the way that they tell you to think about it, right?

1004
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:22,100
Right.

1005
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:27,760
How many times do you hear people, oh, go to a doctor, go to the hospital, or get a lawyer, right?

1006
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,640
Worst thing, worst thing, worst thing.

1007
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:35,140
So the whole thing is how do you pull back enough and balance the blame game,

1008
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:39,100
how am I in such a shithole situation or not such a shithole situation?

1009
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,540
For me, I think on the cooking thing, I said nightmare hell for me in a twilight zone

1010
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:46,000
would be living with a white Midwestern American family.

1011
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:46,580
Right.

1012
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,060
That would be like hell, a twilight zone hell for me, right?

1013
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:53,360
For other people, it's fine.

1014
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:55,780
That's what they aspire to, but I'm saying personally, right?

1015
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:59,100
So everyone has their own personal adjustment or view,

1016
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:02,740
but what I'm saying here is if you can eliminate all –

1017
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:06,280
just look at the shapes and the colors and not what it really is.

1018
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,960
It takes on a completely new meaning.

1019
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:13,020
Not always, but usually does, but how are you going to do that?

1020
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:15,500
You know, when you think of a situation, whether it's good or bad,

1021
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:19,420
you know that little inner dialogue, that little inner voice pops up in your head

1022
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,160
and starts making chitter-chatter, doesn't it?

1023
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:21,640
Yeah.

1024
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:21,880
Right?

1025
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:26,440
Either making you feel self-important or making you feel like crap.

1026
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:27,040
Right.

1027
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:31,100
Or second-guessing or whatever, whatever.

1028
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,580
Or it wanders off.

1029
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,520
It tries to wander off so you don't address the problem.

1030
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:37,880
Don't do it again, a whole other thing, right.

1031
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:38,560
Yeah.

1032
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:42,480
I mean there's so many possibilities, but typically that little voice,

1033
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:46,560
what it's doing to most people, if not all people, believe it or not,

1034
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:51,380
it's putting in thoughts of food, thoughts of sex,

1035
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:55,000
and thoughts of play as priority every single time.

1036
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:56,120
Right?

1037
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,960
You can go and – you've seen this even in the media.

1038
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,360
There's nothing to do here today at work.

1039
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:03,140
Oh, let's go play.

1040
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:04,300
Right?

1041
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:04,960
First thing.

1042
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,160
Let's not edify ourselves.

1043
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:10,880
Let's go get that Soros or let's go get that Trump guy, right, whatever.

1044
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,080
You know, I'm just saying, right?

1045
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:12,360
Right.

1046
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,340
Like it matters.

1047
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:19,240
You see, so that's why getting – people say,

1048
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:21,800
don't you get into people's – it's easy.

1049
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,380
You don't even have to get into people's head.

1050
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,820
You could predetermine what they're thinking about,

1051
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:31,200
and it's usually sex, food, or play or combination of that, right?

1052
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:33,700
Very, very simple.

1053
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:36,940
And then you have the other group, which is obsessing about things.

1054
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:41,280
They have this tape that's running, like background, like elevator music

1055
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,680
or music running constantly about some problem that came up.

1056
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:49,680
It could be a consistent thing of how am I going to pay the bills kind of thing too or whatever.

1057
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,000
That's not you.

1058
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:53,000
None of this is your voice.

1059
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,240
Now, here's the thing.

1060
00:48:54,880 --> 00:49:02,140
I'm not saying it should be eliminated because it will be eventually as we transition,

1061
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:06,340
but give yourself a break from it, and how do you clear the mind from that?

1062
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:13,340
The easiest way to do it is to start attaching however – some people have –

1063
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,820
they're called visual kinesthetic.

1064
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,660
You show me versus linguistic tell, right?

1065
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:25,320
I put in the chat recently about someone who had gone through a Qigong or something,

1066
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:28,940
Tai Chi meet, and there was a negative energy no matter – it was the people, right?

1067
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:32,920
And I said just when you pick up on that, it's a feeling.

1068
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,260
It's very internal, let's say.

1069
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:38,780
It triggers off chemical things as well.

1070
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:45,180
When I say it's internal, meaning it has a physical manifestation and emotional

1071
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:47,320
because feeling and emotions are different.

1072
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:51,980
But just if you could visualize them as soap bubbles, they're harmless, right?

1073
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,460
They could be a pain in the ass, those soap bubbles too, right?

1074
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:55,640
Because it's soap, right?

1075
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:56,160
Yeah.

1076
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:58,120
But it's not so bad.

1077
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,240
Just like soap bubbles.

1078
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,600
So you're going to get hit with those thoughts and you're going to get hit with soap bubbles, but so what?

1079
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:10,320
If you're wearing a tuxedo, by the way, and you get hit with a soap bubble, it will leave a mark.

1080
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,840
So depending on the fabric, right?

1081
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,800
Something that's, let's say, fine clothing.

1082
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:16,900
All right.

1083
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:26,200
So the way you do it, again, think about – don't think about the voice, but if you don't think –

1084
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,860
how do you talk about not thinking?

1085
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:28,960
We're using the word thinking.

1086
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,820
If you had no thinking, again, this is the premise.

1087
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:38,260
If you have no thinking, which is, by the way, not you, that little voice,

1088
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:45,360
everything would be perceived as colors and shapes and textures and temperature, right?

1089
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,080
Right, right.

1090
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:49,000
You wouldn't say, hey, it's hot in this room, right?

1091
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:50,740
Look, here's the other thing.

1092
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:55,700
You could be in an office doing the recording, whatever, windows closed, doors closed.

1093
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:58,960
Somebody walks in, says, hey, Chuck, it's hot in this room.

1094
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,300
Another person walks in and says, hey, it's stuffy in here.

1095
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:02,360
They didn't say it's hot.

1096
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,360
They said it's stuffy, right?

1097
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:07,120
So everyone's got this slightly different variation of it.

1098
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:12,980
But how about getting rid of all that and just feeling and perceiving it, being in the moment, right?

1099
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:13,900
Yes, of course.

1100
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:18,720
Yeah, but then again you have to understand there's another level of danger,

1101
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:23,480
and that's something I've never really discussed in all this.

1102
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:27,920
There is an innate sense of danger, and I've never really got into it.

1103
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:29,060
This is more of a protocol.

1104
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:30,620
I don't think we'll do it on this sonic.

1105
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:31,180
Okay.

1106
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,280
But you know how these preppers talk about stuff?

1107
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:37,680
Usually you watch a prepper thing and they show you knives and guns, right?

1108
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:38,820
And bottled water.

1109
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:39,720
Always, yep.

1110
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,740
Yeah, it's like, no, no, no, no, no.

1111
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:44,520
You don't prep for that, right?

1112
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:52,840
You need to be prepping every day for everything that's going on every day is a different kind of prepping, right?

1113
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:59,780
An example of that is electrical tape, always at arm's reach, in the car, at work, at home, in a drawer.

1114
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:04,720
It's a flexible binding, just what I mean.

1115
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,740
It sticks to things, right?

1116
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:11,360
Imagine you could use it, a hose, your arm, a broken bone, right?

1117
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:12,060
It's flexible.

1118
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:12,840
Yeah.

1119
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:16,400
It binds, multipurpose, right?

1120
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:22,020
That's what I mean about doing a thing on things to keep around that you're going to be using.

1121
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,220
And you have to know how to use it also.

1122
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:30,280
Like a sharpening stone, for most people, has no use for them at all, right?

1123
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:33,420
You know, you go to most people's kitchens and they have all these gimmicks.

1124
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:34,220
They don't know how to cook.

1125
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:39,560
They think if they buy these, right, kitchen gadgets, not gimmicks, yeah, they're gimmicks, they'll be better cooking.

1126
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:46,020
No, it has nothing to do with it because a really good chef just has three knives, small, medium, and large, two pans,

1127
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:52,440
small pan, big pan, and two pots or three or four pots, small, medium, large, and extra large, and that's it.

1128
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,420
And a cutting board and a sharpening stone, that's it.

1129
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:55,360
No, right?

1130
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,700
Everything is done with that.

1131
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:05,560
So we are taught to buy all the gadgets and gimmicks and this and that, Band-Aids, all the way to whatever, right?

1132
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:10,540
That's one aspect of how to deal with things that are dangerous.

1133
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:16,700
But when I mean danger, there's another aspect to it that you have to mitigate within yourself,

1134
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,660
and that little voice rarely helps, by the way.

1135
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:24,160
That little voice that you think is you confuses that.

1136
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,480
There is an evil behind that.

1137
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,120
Just put it this way.

1138
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:34,260
You'll never catch me amongst a group of a large crowd of people.

1139
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:34,660
Why?

1140
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:41,440
Potentially dangerous, always, especially morons, right?

1141
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:41,980
Yep.

1142
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:47,400
And by the way, if you had a crowd of people that were not morons, there wouldn't be a crowd.

1143
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:48,560
There'd be like two people there.

1144
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,740
Anyway, that was a bad joke.

1145
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:51,480
Yeah, well.

1146
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:55,280
Hard to find people that aren't morons anyway.

1147
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:57,960
Well, the thing is, are you looking?

1148
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:00,120
You'll be looking for a long time.

1149
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:02,140
Here's the point.

1150
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:07,940
There are general things also discussing danger that that little voice –

1151
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:10,640
I wanted to go to this because it doesn't help.

1152
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:15,800
That little dialogue that's within the self that people think is their own self, right?

1153
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:21,120
You don't really get to yourself until you get the silence, but the thing is to maintain the silence.

1154
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:26,020
That is one of the important factors of avoiding danger, right?

1155
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:27,340
I'll give you an example.

1156
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:35,460
You're, let's say, well-to-do, upper blue-collar, middle-class, white-collar guy, whatever,

1157
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:39,040
and the bank is offering you a loan at whatever.

1158
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:42,860
They'll even pay you to get the loan, right, a certain amount, give you a toaster.

1159
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:45,400
It sounds like a good idea because you might want to go.

1160
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:47,840
You think the bank is lending you.

1161
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:49,500
Your little voice inside says, yeah, go do it.

1162
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,000
It sounds good.

1163
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:51,160
It's a good deal, right?

1164
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,220
It's a good deal.

1165
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:54,400
There's no deal there at all.

1166
00:54:54,780 --> 00:55:01,860
It's so backwards and so upside down and not so that you can't perceive it

1167
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:05,460
because that little voice is egging you on and saying, oh, that's a really good deal.

1168
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,420
I never saw a good deal like that before, right?

1169
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:10,800
Many times you hear people saying stuff like that, right?

1170
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:15,000
The same thing works with avoiding danger.

1171
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:19,200
I think we were discussing the sound.

1172
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:22,640
People say, hey, Greek, do you want to come to a live show?

1173
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:23,960
I'm like, is it really live?

1174
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:26,720
Well, you know, it's going to be at that venue over there.

1175
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:27,400
It's this band.

1176
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:28,500
Are they on stage?

1177
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:30,740
They're like, yeah, of course they're on stage.

1178
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,220
I said, do they have a PA system?

1179
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,340
Of course there's a PA system.

1180
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:34,180
Oh, no.

1181
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:35,620
That's not live music.

1182
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:39,460
The moment you put something through speakers, it's not live.

1183
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:41,200
I can't stand it.

1184
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,440
When I do go, after like two minutes, I get up.

1185
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:46,320
I'm going to go outside and have a cigarette, walk around.

1186
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,660
So I walk around the whole neighborhood, see what else is there.

1187
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:51,860
So if it's late at night and they're doing the day, I might want to come back.

1188
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,180
They're like, hey, you were gone for an hour and a half.

1189
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:54,540
Are you okay?

1190
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:55,140
I'm like, yeah.

1191
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,240
Are you okay listening to this crap?

1192
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:57,860
Right.

1193
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:02,840
They have a little voice inside of them telling them that that crap sounds good.

1194
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:05,500
Do you see my point?

1195
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:06,520
Yeah, I can't help it.

1196
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:07,980
How can you sit there?

1197
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:08,580
Right.

1198
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:10,200
And listen to that.

1199
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:15,700
Something inside of you is telling you it's good.

1200
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,980
And another part of you is telling you, sit down and enjoy it.

1201
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:25,100
And the part of you that is like, this is bad for me, you don't even hear.

1202
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:25,620
You know why?

1203
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:27,020
Because it doesn't make sound.

1204
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:40,700
So you see how we were speaking earlier about how do you explain,

1205
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:48,080
how do you talk about things that are typically not known about things that are not known

1206
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:51,320
with words that are used to only describe things that are known?

1207
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,620
Very, very difficult.

1208
00:56:54,480 --> 00:57:02,780
So this is a point of mastery, I would suggest, that if one follows what I've been saying,

1209
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:10,080
if you can, bless your heart as the Catholics say, right, on this level of Greek speak,

1210
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:13,960
then what am I supposed to listen to?

1211
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:18,900
It's not a problem, but let's just say there's nothing to listen to.

1212
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:19,780
It's all feeling.

1213
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:24,480
There isn't going to be another voice, getting rid of the voice that sounds like you.

1214
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:26,740
Are you going to get another voice that sounds like you that's you?

1215
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:28,160
No.

1216
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:31,080
No, you just have to be open to the experience objectively.

1217
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:31,860
Exactly.

1218
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:35,000
It's so objective, it's totally quiet.

1219
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:40,600
And once you understand the sound of silence, you're going to go to a different level.
