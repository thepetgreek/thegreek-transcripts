1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,340
Sonic Event 21, Ocelli and the Greek Rated Y.

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,700
Anyway, I keep announcing that as if, you know, there's some explosive thing happening

3
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:21,000
and we're not broadcasting, but if you're hearing us, then you've subscribed and welcome.

4
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,080
Anyhow, Greek, how are you doing tonight?

5
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:25,480
Pretty good.

6
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:31,479
We had a pretty interesting moon yesterday, the day before yesterday, so I'm reckoning

7
00:00:31,479 --> 00:00:35,260
roughly two and a half days into the third month.

8
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,820
Yeah, it was a big temperature change.

9
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:45,780
I always make a note that whatever's happening, I'm in the desert southwest, full moon comes,

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,400
we got a cooling period, right, and how much it's going to cool by the moon and all that,

11
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,480
and I've been watching that and it's pretty good.

12
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,720
It's interesting, as the lunar influence gets stronger, building up, you know, during

13
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:05,140
the summer months, the cooling is greater, which is unusual, because like I just said,

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,780
it's during the summer months, right?

15
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,180
So what I mean, it doesn't mean we can have snow, it just means that the temperature

16
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,100
drop is greater than it is in the winter.

17
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:21,360
Fair enough, and it's about ten hours after my day started, really, about ten hours after

18
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,820
the solar noon time where I'm sitting, but anyway, that's the way that is.

19
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,780
I noticed in the chat, though, somebody said something about exactly what time a year something

20
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,040
starts, and what would that be?

21
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,420
It was the year, that's what they mentioned in the chat, because yeah, since the year

22
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:38,760
starts.

23
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:44,660
Yeah, that's someone maybe who can get help from other people without going over it.

24
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,560
The year starts when something starts in the beginning, but you don't count it until all

25
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,280
the eggs are in the basket, which would be the seventh month, right?

26
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,580
So you go to the store to buy a dozen eggs, and you got to bring your own container, so

27
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:05,920
you go to where all the eggs are stacked, and you go one egg, two eggs, three eggs, and

28
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,220
by the time you get, let's say, to the seventh egg, let's say you get seven eggs, right?

29
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,980
That's when you finish your count, you see what I mean?

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,060
But you started with the first one, so the year still starts with the first day of the

31
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:22,800
first month, but the count of the year is not done until all your eggs are hatched,

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,300
right?

33
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:24,540
Okay.

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,160
So it makes sense.

35
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,020
It's very different from the pagan papacy, which is they drop the ball or whatever, and

36
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:37,800
the year changes, and it's a new year, all at the same time, and everybody make a New

37
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,920
Year's resolution, it's in the darkest time of the year, they don't realize what they're

38
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,440
doing, right?

39
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,100
Of course.

40
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,280
Speaking of which, before we get into the usual thing and looking at things and having

41
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:54,220
our conversation, have I, from memory, maybe you tell me, or it's just you and I right

42
00:02:54,220 --> 00:03:01,440
now, but did I get into blotting out corporate logos on packages at home on the Rated Y?

43
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,080
I know we did it on the Freeman interview, I don't think we've done that here, have we?

44
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,360
You know, I don't think we have, you might have mentioned it, but I don't think we went

45
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:11,800
into it.

46
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,600
It was really interesting on Freeman, though, because you had even suggested people could

47
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:22,200
go get a marker, and we wound up talking about album covers and all kinds of stuff.

48
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:23,680
Yeah.

49
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,040
Yeah.

50
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:31,600
So it doesn't matter how you do it, but okay, just a quick one, because I think interjecting

51
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:36,120
practical stuff, that's what it's all about, and here's the other thing, people that really

52
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:42,380
like Greek speakers, here, they like it when I'm rough and edgy, because you go on the

53
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:47,180
internet, everybody wants to be your friend, and from the old Greek philosopher, as a friend

54
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,120
to all is a friend to none, right?

55
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,520
So, you know, I'm talking about all these fakers, you know, I love all you guys and

56
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,160
this and that.

57
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,400
Well, how do you, you don't even know them.

58
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,580
I mean, you don't even love the people you know, how are you going to say you love the

59
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,300
people you don't?

60
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,220
Anyway, anyway, okay, don't go down that line.

61
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:03,820
I got you.

62
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:07,700
I often say that I appreciate people that tune in and stuff like that, because I do,

63
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,740
I appreciate that they're there.

64
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,120
Yeah, and that's right, hold on, that's another thing, tuning in, there's no tuning here.

65
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:12,760
Well, yeah.

66
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,480
You're clicking, yeah, I know, but it's an old language thing, like glove compartment

67
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,740
in the car, we don't put gloves in there anymore, right?

68
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:24,720
Well, and frankly, even though you're casting, right, you're broadcasting, you're not exactly

69
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,120
broadcasting.

70
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,880
Yeah, it's just digital.

71
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:30,580
Yeah, because tuning, I don't know if you, well, if you ever did, built your own radio,

72
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,140
but the crystal tension and all that, it literally is a tuning, well, an instrument,

73
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,380
you know, when you leave the guitar in the trunk of the car and it's on a rainy day,

74
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,480
you take it out, try to play it, what does it sound like?

75
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,700
Yeah, right, things go out of tune depending on the conditions, yeah, but no, I played

76
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,160
bass a little bit.

77
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,260
It's a fine, there's nothing fine, see, tuning requires a fine adjustment, there's no fine

78
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:56,000
adjustment on the internet, it's either there or you got it, it's just like back in the

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,760
day, getting those digital cables, HDMI cables and this and that, you go to a big box store

80
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:07,180
and they got one for $5 and they got the monster cable, one for $75, this is better, and I

81
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,980
say, well, come over here, come over here, I tell the salesman, come here, come here,

82
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,320
what is it?

83
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:16,680
I said, listen, this is digital, it's zeros and ones, the $5 cable and the $80 cable will

84
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,560
do the same thing for resolving that, you know, and he's like, yeah, yeah, I guess you're

85
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,160
right, you know, so the only difference is durability and capacitance, you know, but

86
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:32,780
so, yeah, there's no tuning, all these things are interesting, it's kind of like being edgy

87
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:38,080
and rough about it is the only way that it gets across to people, now here's the thing,

88
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,100
most people, if you're part of the collective Greek speak, you'll freak out, you'll think

89
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:49,340
the guy's angry, he's an asshole, what's wrong, you know, no, he thinks he's better and all

90
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:54,640
that stuff, the collective is, anyway, we know the collective is finished, in other

91
00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:01,260
words, when the catastrophes come, that's who it goes after predominantly, the tears,

92
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:09,640
you know, whatever, the chaff, okay, so then you have, let's go to the other end, there's

93
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:15,860
only about half a dozen, maybe a dozen or two dozen people max, I think, out there that

94
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:20,580
have really gotten what I'm trying to say and then the percentage of everyone else,

95
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,420
that is, not to disparage subscribers, you know, it was the subs and all these other

96
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:31,600
people that like Greek speak, it's somewhere between entertainment, information and whatever,

97
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:37,220
but I don't think a lot of people really get it, you know, there's, what I mean by get

98
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:44,640
it, okay, it's a smattering of finesse, it's a smattering of skill, if you're not improving

99
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:50,620
your skill, you know, people who do yoga or martial arts know this, right, you know, people

100
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:55,680
go to the gym, know this, right, they're getting better as they do it, play the piano, whatever,

101
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:04,280
if you're not doing things to, where you either gain new skills, increase your finesse, your

102
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,600
ability to perform physically and mentally, you don't really get what I'm saying, because

103
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:15,700
that's what it's all about, there's something that the, I forgot the name of the award,

104
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:22,860
there's a managerial award in Japan, the Deming Award, Deming was a statistician and in the

105
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:29,060
army and he basically told, back in mid 20th century, he was one of the good guys, let's

106
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:34,240
say, he was saying there's no quality control, you can't control quality, you're either improving

107
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,180
it or you're letting it degrade, there's no, you can't keep it stable, there's no way you

108
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:42,600
can keep something consistent, you're either constantly improving it or you're letting

109
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,580
it degrade, so if you think you're doing quality control by keeping it at a certain rate, you

110
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:52,780
know what's happening really, it's degrading, so Americans kicked him out, they didn't like

111
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,200
him, so he went to Japan with this concept, they loved him and the highest award, I think,

112
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:03,180
was up until the 80s, was the Deming Award and that was about constant quality improvement,

113
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,160
constantly, how to make things better is really the point.

114
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:14,540
Okay, the other thing is about Greek speaking, what's rough is you came into this world alone,

115
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:21,020
you're going to leave alone, well, you know, whatever, unless you all do, you all decide to

116
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,280
jump off the bridge at the same time without a bungee cord, you know what I mean, you're going

117
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:30,960
to leave alone, even then, you're going to sense the leaving and coming in the same alone and you're

118
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:37,220
going to be alone for your whole life, period, you think you have a good relationship, whatever

119
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:43,740
more power to you, but I'm telling you, you're still alone, that's why I got into speaking

120
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:50,060
about the inner voice and learn how to read the quiet and one thing I mentioned in the

121
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:57,820
chat there was the inner voice that we're used to, that we think is us, is like reading

122
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:03,340
signage, reading a book, you know, reading letters, but the silent voice, reading that

123
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:10,580
is like reading braille, you're removing that sense, so listen to the silence, it's based

124
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:15,140
on feeling, I know I've talked a lot about the emo, but emotion and feeling are different,

125
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:21,020
right, the emotion is labeled and discounted where the feeling is what we really should

126
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:26,200
be driving us and that comes through, by the way, you know how they say it's not what you

127
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:33,880
say, it's how you say it, right, so that's the emo coming through, so yeah, I noticed

128
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:39,880
that there's a, it's not like Dr. Phil tough love, but there's a certain rough element

129
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:44,920
that I like to portray, it's not quite being angry, it's not quite being irritated, it's

130
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,300
not quite asshole-ish, but a mixture of those things, you know, a little bit of that, a

131
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:53,080
little bit of this, just to get people kind of like, you know, snap out of it, was it

132
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:59,100
Cher and the moon, was it moon, whatever struck, she says, snap out of it, she smacks

133
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:04,260
some kind of, if I could just do that for an hour straight with people, you know, I

134
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,080
want to get one of those big cartoon gloves, you know, like the Mickey Mouse that has

135
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,620
four fingers on a stick and just drive down the highway, have everybody stand on the side

136
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:15,220
of the road and just smack them all, just wake up, you know, but there's nothing, I

137
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:20,400
mean, you're already awake, right, so the whole thing here is you're really doing solo,

138
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:27,800
you know, you're all doing a solo, everyone is doing a solo with a particular arrangement,

139
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:36,520
whether it's familial or spousal or acquaintance, you're all here solo, so it's really what

140
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:43,620
do you do, why do you empower the solo and all that, so with that said, I want to get

141
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:52,000
back to the rough aspect of it, I don't think we've ever really got into it, maybe some

142
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,780
people have gotten the notion about blotting out corporate logos, okay, I was having a

143
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:01,260
conversation recently, go ahead, let me hit you with this, because here's the thing,

144
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:08,440
you know, we talked about it and I always like to go straight for the why, because everybody

145
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:14,500
talks about, or not everybody, I'm exaggerating, there are a certain segment of individuals

146
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:20,000
out there that like to talk about the symbolism in different things, it means this, it's the

147
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,280
eye of Horus, it's actually this, it's actually that, yeah, those people, those are the ones

148
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,560
that think everyone, that want everyone to be their friend too, yeah, it doesn't work

149
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,180
that way, get Horus out of it, I tell them, what did he do to mess, even the Satanists,

150
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:38,240
it's like, why are you bitching about the guy being a Satanist, what did Satan ever do

151
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,700
to mess you up, right, and what is this guy messing you up for, right, because, you know,

152
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,800
when I say, wait a second, Greek, isn't Satan the adversary, yeah, he is, but you've got

153
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,900
to realize what he uses, so, and it's not he, it's a collective, right, so.

154
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,160
But the thing about it is this, they talk about the symbols, they go in all these different

155
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,760
directions and by the time you're done, your head is spinning, whatever, but here's the

156
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,020
thing, I think you should be able to universally agree that you don't want any part of these

157
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:07,940
things, you don't want any part of the empowerment, the messages being sent, whatever it might

158
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:13,640
be, that is being transferred via the symbolism, okay, so we can boil it down to that, you

159
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:20,000
don't want this, okay, so if you don't want it, how do you get rid of it, alright, to

160
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,200
extract yourself completely, look, there are certain people that could probably live off

161
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,640
grid and never see a corporate logo attached to anything because everything they get is

162
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:34,000
from the forest, from the earth, from the animals they raise, et cetera, okay, but outside

163
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,280
of that, the majority of us, okay, are going to go ahead and purchase stuff from what we

164
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,720
call a store, we're going to go get things, it's going to be in packaging, it's going

165
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:49,960
to have these symbols, so let's get into the why, why do this even, to block this out,

166
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,200
yeah.

167
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:55,200
Alright, if you ever build a house and you've got a liberal budget, hopefully you do, one

168
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:01,820
of the things I used to do was be a liaison for the client to the contractor and architect

169
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,380
that because people, when they want to build a house, they go hire an architect that designs

170
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:10,060
it, then it's either one of the architect's buddies or their own quote-unquote general

171
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:17,780
contractor that builds it and most clients are not aware that the architects and contractors

172
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:23,260
are full of ego, they're so full of ego that part of like prosecutors, you know, like they've

173
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:29,640
won 99% of the cases, right, it doesn't matter if the people, right, so what the architects

174
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:38,080
and the builders say, oh, I built the most expensive house, right, so a $400,000 house

175
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,740
that cost you ends up costing you 1.2 million because he wants to say he builds 1.2 million

176
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:49,300
houses, he's kind of stupid if you ask me, right, so what I used to do is represent the

177
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:54,920
client and the architects hated me and the contractors hated me for that because I'd

178
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:59,500
say, wait a second, what the hell is a shelving unit, $75,000 shelving unit, oh, yeah, yeah,

179
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,240
I've never done that, you know, it was like, no, no, no, no, no, first of all, you don't

180
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,860
want a built-in because what if you want to rearrange the room, what if you want to put

181
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:12,780
the couch there, that's built-in, make it, you know, oh, oh, so the shelving unit price

182
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:17,580
goes down to less than 12,000, architect's like, I hate this guy, I hate him, right,

183
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:23,820
but the client loves me, so another quick story is they build these bathrooms, you

184
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:28,140
know, like you walk in, shower, beautiful, all this stuff and I said, okay, you got a

185
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:32,600
beautiful bathroom and when you move in, your wife's going to go to Bed Bath & Beyond

186
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,980
and buy one of those cheesy racks that you hang on the shower so she could put all her

187
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,720
shampoo bottles because you only have one shower niche, right, so right now, before

188
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,480
you put the marble up, why don't we use the space in between the studs and build these

189
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,300
little niches, you know, pockets, you know, shelves, they have marble and put pool lights

190
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:54,840
in them too on a dimmer, right, and the client's like, oh, this is great, so anyway, I shaved

191
00:14:54,840 --> 00:15:00,740
the price of the, the building would come out better and the price would go down, way

192
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:04,480
down the cost of building and all that, but the contractor and the architects hated me,

193
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:09,080
so I couldn't work in those fields, I could only work by representing clients, you see

194
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:18,100
what I mean, so what does that mean? When you understand instead of building it and

195
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,860
just having it done with anything, how is it going to go, how are you going to interact

196
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:27,140
with it over time is what it's about and what I mean by this is this, again, going

197
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:32,300
back to the building aspect, you know, they have fiberglass insulation, they put it in

198
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:37,680
attics and walls to keep the house, you know, insulated, right, so when I see a house going

199
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,200
up, especially in the bedroom area, I want insulation in the walls and they're like,

200
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:46,440
great, we don't need insulation in the walls, yes, you do for sound, right, so if you want

201
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,240
to sleep and someone's playing a radio in the next room, you don't want it to coming,

202
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,540
through, as a matter of fact, you don't even want the drywall applied directly to the stud,

203
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:59,640
you want to put a shim that absorbs vibration more in the bedrooms than in the living room,

204
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:04,560
dining room, like in other words, in the chances that someone is making noise in the living room

205
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,680
and bothering someone in a dining room is very slim, but if you got two bedrooms next to each

206
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:13,680
other, at least try to make it a common closet wall, so you got that two feet of airspace,

207
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:19,180
but if you don't, you want to heavily insulate and isolate those walls and you'll thank me

208
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,940
later, but like in 30 years, you'll thank me for having such a quiet home, but you'll

209
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:27,900
never thank me because you thought it was supposed to be like this anyway, you see what

210
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:32,860
I mean, it's kind of thankless, because you didn't suffer the noise, you know, and it's

211
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,640
too late, you could still do it after the house is built, you see, it's kind of like

212
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:41,840
one of these subtle things that doesn't make, that's in your face while things are happening,

213
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:48,840
so okay, so what do I mean by this, I was having a conversation today about food supply, Cisco

214
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:54,640
and American Foods and one other supply all the foods for all the restaurants in the country,

215
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,740
pretty much, unless, you know, there's some restaurants that source out their own stuff,

216
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:04,359
of course, but the majority, now here's the thing, the people that own those companies

217
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:09,240
or CEOs are Satanists, all of them, not some of them, all of them, and this is something

218
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:15,160
that was established 100 years ago, all of these large companies that supply your food,

219
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,640
and the things that you rely on, your car dealers, by the way, new car dealer,

220
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:24,839
also they're a part of the brotherhood, whatever, yeah, they have, you know, the 85,000 missing

221
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:30,300
infants, and not children, but the ones that go missing from hospitals, I'm talking about now,

222
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,820
the newborns, they tell the mom, the baby died, it never did, and look, I see the baby,

223
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:40,540
why do you want to see the baby, she just chalks it off, right, these are all your business people,

224
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:45,740
right, and what they do is they're very much attached into the other realm where

225
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:49,520
they offer human sacrifice, you can get more and more and more and more into this,

226
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:56,800
you're politicians also, you don't need to look at Pizzagate or whatever, all that crap they're

227
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,880
putting on the past 10 years, this is, you just go back to the beginning of mankind,

228
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:08,780
you know, a civilization that we're in today, it's been so also, what they understand is

229
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:15,640
energy transfer and control of their subjects, so you're eating their food, which you mitigate,

230
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:20,640
by the way, what I mean by mitigate is this, let's say you go get some spring water,

231
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,500
and it's the, I don't know if you've ever, people have ever had really good spring water,

232
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:29,600
when you drink it, it's almost like a drug, when you drink it, well, then immediately you get this

233
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,080
incredible refreshment, and then like a lightheadedness, and then you feel really

234
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:42,180
invigorated and almost effervescent from it for about 20 minutes, okay, and you could put this in

235
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:46,560
a bottle, keep it in the dark, keep it cool, and it'll give you that for a few days, maybe even a

236
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:51,020
week or two, but if you take that same spring water and put it in a pot and bring it to a boil

237
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:55,680
and cool it down, it doesn't do that anymore, it doesn't have that feeling anymore, because you've

238
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:03,380
changed it with the energy transfer, so, all right, you can, you research sigils and all this stuff,

239
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:09,420
it's all over the internet, what they do, there's plenty of hoop to do on this corporate,

240
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:15,840
occult corporate logos, right, there's plenty, even Jordan Maxwell did a book on it, and David Icke

241
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,320
and all these guys, right, sure, yeah, it's been around for a while, so everyone's familiar with

242
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:26,980
it, these things are very carefully engineered and designed to transmit, literally transmit

243
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:31,780
from a radionic perspective to the living beings and the space a certain energy,

244
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:37,600
right, now let me give you an example, there's something I used to do, there's two things that

245
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:44,100
you could do with sound, and this is much finer than sound, one is Sonic Bloom, there was a company

246
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:50,440
that grows roses in greenhouses, if you bought a rose, it probably came from Holland, they grow

247
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:56,340
almost 90% of the world's flowers, they had problems with some of the plants blooming or not,

248
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:01,900
so some guys said that, you know, birds play birdsong, record birdsong from dawn till about

249
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:06,620
10 a.m. and play it in the greenhouses, what do you know, they put speakers everywhere,

250
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,900
birdsong was played for three, four hours, all the plants started blooming in unison,

251
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:16,580
wonderful, right, another thing is you do like what's called like silent space recording,

252
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:22,580
you go to a place that is a wonderful place like a spring or a mountain, a power spot on the earth,

253
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:26,780
and you set up a microphone, it could be completely damped and quiet where you don't

254
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:30,640
hear any wind or it doesn't sound like anything and you made a CD recording of this for an hour,

255
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:37,860
you give the CD to someone and you say play this CD, whatever volume, it doesn't matter,

256
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:43,840
for an hour and you see, tell me how the place feels, this is great, I put it on, there's no

257
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:49,480
sound coming out of it, right, but everyone else, you know, but other people say, yeah,

258
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,540
there's no sound coming out, but I could really feel it, you know, and I didn't tell them how

259
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:59,900
they should feel or anything, right, so these are two more like things regarding to sound,

260
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:05,820
right, now if you get finer than sound is light, right, the color of things, right,

261
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:14,000
and then finer than that is geometry, shape, proportion, and then finer than that is the

262
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,960
intent behind those geometries and proportions and back to what we're talking about, corporate

263
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:27,180
logo, it's the intent behind it, an incantation, like you can empower something, an object,

264
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:33,160
through an incantation or a ritual and that will transmit that, right, it'll hold that energy,

265
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:39,260
all of your logos are like that, little corporate logos, even if it's just a word, the font,

266
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:45,800
like craft or whatever, right, it's still enchanted, okay, it's a form of enchantment,

267
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:53,320
all right, so what you do is you blot that out, basically two ways, several ways to do it,

268
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:59,940
piece of masking tape, real cheap, right, electrical tape, real cheap, one of those

269
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:05,660
fat magic markers, the tapes will work better than the marker because if the marker dries,

270
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:11,220
it's not going to completely cover the logo, you can still see it, right, and if it's a piece

271
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:17,580
of glass or something, it might wipe off, right, so people used to, when I first settled in here

272
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:24,040
in Tucson, then I had met my wife, she comes over where I was staying and she goes, this is really

273
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:31,520
weird, why do you have marker over this and that, and I said, oh, don't worry, I just cover up all

274
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:39,880
logos, I know it sounds crazy, but you know, so this is how it's done, when you go, let's say

275
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:45,720
you just moved into a place and you do your first shop, you usually show up with shopping bags or

276
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,900
a bag or something you have all your goods in, right, what do you do, you bring in and you put

277
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:56,240
it on a table or somewhere and you start putting, unloading it into your cabinets, drawers,

278
00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:00,340
wherever, you unload it, put it in its appropriate places, this goes in the refrigerator, this goes

279
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:04,940
in the cabinet, that's when you do it at that point, so as each thing comes out,

280
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:09,360
book, tape, craft this, shame on you if you're buying craft products, by the way,

281
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,840
but you know what I mean, right, it doesn't matter, baking soda, it doesn't matter, detergent,

282
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:18,140
whatever, some of these things are pretty big, you know, don't tell me you're buying Cap'n Crunch,

283
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:25,240
right, then it would be post, right, or whatever, you cover just the logo, you don't have to cover

284
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:31,140
okay, right, now the other thing is I had done this, it was a total NPC woman who was constantly

285
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:36,320
ill, she worked for like the government accounting office here, it was a federal office,

286
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:42,020
and our sister used to visit and do stuff for her and all that, and she, her sister was into,

287
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:47,960
the woman was not into holistic or this kind of, any, anything natural, she was loaded up with

288
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:57,220
pills, and her sister was into it, but they both listened, so one day I asked her, can I go

289
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:03,360
through your apartment, would you give me access to everything, if it was anything personal,

290
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:08,040
just put it away, but she was, no, no, I have nothing personal, you know, actually she did,

291
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,420
but you know, she was very open about it, she was very cool for, you know, very just

292
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:18,160
oblivious person that was always ill, anyway, so we went through with her sister and we covered

293
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:23,340
everything, and we didn't tell her why we want to do this or what we were going to do,

294
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:28,740
but the next day, the next day, the next day, how are you feeling, I feel great, I never felt better,

295
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,700
next day I feel even better, I feel even better, she goes, yeah, I noticed there's some,

296
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:37,940
what'd you guys do, I noticed, she wasn't even curious, she says, oh, I noticed you put a piece

297
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:43,700
of tape through the whatever, you know, thing here, okay, but what'd you guys do, I noticed

298
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:49,720
there's a mark, she says she noticed it, but she didn't make a point, is that what you guys came

299
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,820
here to do, right, so it was perfect example, and she got better and better, and then she kind of

300
00:24:54,820 --> 00:25:00,300
leveled out where what she had was treatable and, you know, normal, you know, ailments until her

301
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:04,760
body recovered, so in other words, it affected this person's health, I've done it with other

302
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:14,080
people as well, okay, what this does is it's a fractal antenna, if you open up the cell phone,

303
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:18,200
you know how it's not like so sensitive, you could walk around, you know, as long as the energy's

304
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,960
getting to it, it's not like a ham radio, it's what's called a fractal antenna, these logos are

305
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:30,200
designed like fractal antennas, look up fractal, look up antenna, put the two terms together,

306
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:36,680
what they do is they emanate the intent behind that corporation, which is not only that corporation,

307
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,400
but they're part of an elite group, call them the brotherhood, brothers of this, this of that,

308
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:46,080
blah, blah, blah, blah, it doesn't matter, and they're not your friends, as a matter of fact,

309
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:50,560
they hate you, they hate your guts, and your children's guts, and they want you all dead,

310
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:56,980
yes, they do, but in the meantime, they're gonna make sure that you get your products

311
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:03,420
and are as miserable as possible within what they can offer through their products, I know,

312
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,020
it sounds crazy, right, but welcome to planet earth, if you don't know this right now,

313
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:13,880
this is going on on this earth, then you got a lot, you got a long way to go, it's very simple,

314
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:21,780
so it doesn't mean that these products are lethal, it just means that's the intent behind it,

315
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:28,280
so and if you don't believe that, look at what happened in 2020, right, so anyway,

316
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:34,160
by the way, when it comes out that what happened with that pandemic was a total scam,

317
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:40,220
what are the people going to do, yeah, right, not much, it's not going to be like the end of the

318
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:44,280
frankenstein movie, where they all show up with pitchforks and torches at frankenstein's castle,

319
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:49,520
right now, it's not going to be like that, it should be, okay, so these little, all these logos

320
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:55,720
and things are these fractal antennas and they're constantly emanating at a very slow drip, drip,

321
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:00,680
drip rate, now, I don't know if you've ever had a leaky faucet or a leak where it was a drip

322
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:07,800
and then a drip and then a drip, all right, put a five-gallon bucket on there and come back the

323
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:13,440
next day, how much water did you collect, a lot of water, sometimes, right, sometimes you're like,

324
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,400
well, that was a drip, but you got to dump the bucket, right, not a five-gallon bucket,

325
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:22,480
but a nice-sized pail, it's like, oh, shit, I got to dump that, look at that, it's almost full,

326
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:28,940
right, that's how it works, drip, drip, right, so get these things covered, the hard part is books,

327
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,280
these publishers, when you have books, like I'm in the office, you have a library wall

328
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:39,520
and they're all over the place, I have not defaced those or covered them, but the blue tape is very

329
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,720
good, there is a blue painter's tape that has an adhesive that does not leave a residue and it's

330
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:50,680
good for 10 years, 15 years, even more, I've tried it, the blue tape, don't be a cheap ass and get

331
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:56,280
the white masking tape, the cheap one, you can on a throwaway product, yeah, get that one, but

332
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:00,680
something like a book or a CD or an album where you want to remove the tape and you don't leave a

333
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:05,400
bad residue, get the blue tape, there's also, they have it in yellow and green, it's painter's tape,

334
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:09,500
it's like five bucks a roll. Yeah, I have a roll of that, yeah, right over there. Yeah, it's great

335
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:15,300
stuff. Yeah, I use tapes for all kinds of, before tape, it was string, you know, if you watch an old

336
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:21,720
movie, everything was tied with string, right, and ribbon, now it's tape. All right, so this is the

337
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:28,360
thing I wanted to get across because it's a constant feed, here's the thing, yes, the 5G,

338
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:34,960
the cell tower is harmful, yes, it is harmful, but it's not as harmful, the reason why you don't

339
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,420
have people dropping from that is because it's not that strong, but when you combine that with

340
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:46,360
the company logos emanating, the intent, the frequencies of everyone with all the crap

341
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:50,380
they're thinking, you know, someone, not even your neighbor, let's say down the street turns

342
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:55,600
on Fox News or CNN, the garbage that's emanating from that TV, even though it's not near you,

343
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:02,680
is still enough, but it's faint, right, it's like if someone makes a barbecue three houses over,

344
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:08,840
you can still smell it, right? Well, I don't think people notice it anymore because you're bathing

345
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:14,280
in electromagnetic fields everywhere you go, pretty much, I mean, whether it's emanating from

346
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:21,340
an electronic device or it's coming from a Wi-Fi that you don't see or, you know, it doesn't matter,

347
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:27,400
it's constant everywhere, so, you know, but, yeah, go ahead. It's not the electromagnetic so bad as

348
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:33,180
how the electric magnetic is done at the pulse rate, and that's a very subtle thing. Okay,

349
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:38,800
we, you go to a room, you open the door, walk in the room, there's a light switch on the wall,

350
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:44,380
and you go on, off, on, off, on, off, right? Now, I go into the same room, and I go off, on, off, on,

351
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:49,840
off, on. What's the difference? It sounds like the same thing. It sounds like I'm just playing

352
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:55,460
around with words. No, it's very different, right? If I go off, on, off, on, off, on, and you go on,

353
00:29:55,460 --> 00:30:01,360
off, on, off, on, off, it's a different frequency. You see, like, you see, when I'm turning off and

354
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:06,100
then turning on, you're turning on and turning off. Okay. The way they, it's where the two pass each

355
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:11,740
other, at what point do they pass is whether it's harmful or not. It's pulse width modulation

356
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:18,220
is the key. Okay. It doesn't even have to be electromagnetic. Here's the thing, it's when

357
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:23,920
all of these things start building up, and you're not aware of it, then they could be fine-tuned

358
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:31,420
to be harmful, but they never, but they, you see, in war, wounded cost the army more

359
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:37,760
than the dead, right? You understand that principle? Of course. So, also, the wounded in this case,

360
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:44,740
they, see, when, here's the thing, if you die, the government has plenty of insurance policies,

361
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:50,380
and they cancel, and they cash you out, but they think they can get more out of you if you're alive

362
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:57,040
and sick. It's kind of sick, but, right? The same thing with all loans, by the way, they're all

363
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:01,120
insured. So, when they repossess a house, a boat, or a car because you didn't pay it, they already

364
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,240
got paid with the insurance that they have on it. So, it's all about keeping you miserable,

365
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:11,840
keeping, you know, the penalty, motivated by penalty, having people do stuff because if they

366
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,760
don't do it, they get punished, not because if they, right? Not because they should do things

367
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:21,820
because it's the right thing. This is the type of society, the way it's set up. Okay, so, back to

368
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:27,340
the labels, what it does, it just compounds, but here's the thing, if you acknowledge that there's

369
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:33,760
5G and it's harmful and say, that is not for me, I understand, I comprehend why they're doing it,

370
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:41,120
right? It's not for me, it's for them, whoever the them is, you know, you just wipe the whole

371
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:47,840
intent out. Like, people get upset about chemtrails, I'm like, it's all right, it's not for me,

372
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:55,380
right? Did they say we're going to set up the 5G and give a list of people who it's for to hurt?

373
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:02,060
No, it's for those that don't know that it's happening and then are susceptible to it and

374
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:08,120
then chase treatments the other way, right? Like, somebody might be sensitive to 5G and they get

375
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:12,940
sore throat or red or skin rashes from it. So, what do they do? They get skin rash medicine and

376
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:19,060
throat medicine, right? Does it get any better? No, because it's, you see, so those are the people

377
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:25,040
that it's for. So, all these things, it's like transmuting it because it's not going to hurt

378
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:30,880
you unless your body induces it. Now, if it's turned up enough or whatever, then you can't

379
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,100
physically avoid it, just like, you know, crossing the street and getting hit by a car kind of thing.

380
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:41,600
It could be that strong for some and not for others. So, here's the thing. What you're doing

381
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:49,280
here is, I used to say, you come into this world, it's a shithole and ethically and morally for sure,

382
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,440
but you want to like, you know, and the people that are doing this are, we don't know who they

383
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:58,720
are and they're way out of reach, but if you had a chance once in your lifetime to kick them in

384
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:04,160
the shins at least once, wouldn't you do it, right? Hell yeah. All right, so this is how you do it.

385
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:12,440
Cover up their logos. You see, what's one way, right? Because it's always about choice, you see.

386
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:17,160
If you look at what they call the founding fathers of the U.S., they gave some pretty stark

387
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:23,800
messages. It's a republic if you can keep it. Or another quote was, yeah, we were doing this,

388
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:27,540
their constitution and the Bill of Rights, but they're going to forget about it and they're

389
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:32,040
going to get tyranny because that's what the people want, right? I don't know if you've read

390
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:36,780
quotes like that, you know, in fact, all those papers and all that. Okay, they're very, they had

391
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:41,720
the people in very negative light, as do I. You know, I got an email recently from someone I

392
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:46,000
consider very friendly and he says, I don't like it when you call people morons, so I'm putting

393
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,700
it out to everyone. If you got a better term for it, moron or idiot, I'll use it, but you know,

394
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:56,040
hey, because, you know, obviously there are people we love that are morons and if I tell,

395
00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:00,440
like I said, look, if I tell people, everybody you know is a moron and you just sat there and agree,

396
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:10,239
who might argue, right? So I know that. So anyway, all this stuff that's going on,

397
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:18,219
there's nothing going on unless you don't know about it or you know about it and see it a certain

398
00:34:18,219 --> 00:34:25,699
way. And you'll notice that all of it is based on intent, right? So just like when people get upset

399
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:30,600
about the media and all this stuff, they're past, or what they call science or doctors,

400
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:37,060
they're past the point of reason. How do we know? How many times have people confronted or try to

401
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:41,560
confront media scientists, academics with logic and reason and they're from their own stuff and

402
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:46,040
they don't want to listen, right? Well, at this point, they're past that. Now they just make fun

403
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:54,460
of them. Like they're a bunch of retards that they are, right? Just make fun of them. Well,

404
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:58,820
what do you do with someone who is completely insane? And how do you define insane? Well,

405
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,620
somebody who's denying reality, no matter how much you try and show it to them,

406
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:08,800
what are you going to do with that? You're done arguing. You don't handle them that way anymore.

407
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:15,080
So just contain them if you can. And if you can't contain them, make them an object of entertainment,

408
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:25,460
at least. Because that's all you can do. All right. So I hope this message about the message

409
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:34,740
that the corporations try to put out is effective for those who try it. Because it is, it does work

410
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:43,400
on a very subtle level. And none of this stuff is based on time and distance. So ultimately,

411
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:48,520
what I mean is, if your neighbor has it, and you've blotted out all your logos,

412
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:54,520
it could still affect you, right? But not as much as being in your space, right?

413
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,720
Well, let's just be a little more specific about the logos, though, just to make sure,

414
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:04,640
because look, there are corporate mascots. And there are things that are meant to represent,

415
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:10,340
you know, they're, again, I guess, mascots. They're meant to represent because there's intent behind

416
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:14,060
them. Yes. Right. But some things are there, like you mentioned, Captain Crunch. Okay,

417
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,200
well, there's a cartoon guy on the box. You don't have to cover the whole cartoon guy on the box.

418
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:22,320
No, just Post. Yeah, I think it's Post or General Mills, whatever it is.

419
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:28,460
Whichever cereal company it is. You'll find the main corporate, the parent company.

420
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:34,160
Right. Like Crest, hopefully you're not using that. But if you look at the back on the

421
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,140
bottom right, it's Palmolive or whatever, Gamble, cover that.

422
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:43,640
Right. So it's like your Procter & Gamble, your Kraft, as you mentioned before, the,

423
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,720
oh, Purina, the, oh, man, what is that other thing that's out there?

424
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:55,480
Well, here's the thing. You know, when you go to Starbucks, and they have a marker, and they mark

425
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:01,380
which one it is, latte, they'll put latte or whatever flavor, you know, on the side of the

426
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:05,320
cup, they'll put a marker. They have a marker at the barista. Yeah, and they also put the name

427
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:09,160
on there. Yeah, they always try to get it. Yeah. And so what I do is give me the marker,

428
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:14,200
I said, and I go across the whole Starbucks logo of the woman and all that, and through the name

429
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:19,980
and it there, thanks. And they look at me like, what did you just do? You get it? Anyway.

430
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,880
No, I'm sure nobody has the logo on the cup, right? Yeah, yeah.

431
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,740
Just give me the marker. And I go through the whole, I fill in the whole logo.

432
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:37,680
Ah, much better now. There you go. See? So, yeah. But don't, you don't have to obsess with it,

433
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:44,000
but just try it. It works really well. All these things work on a level that is beyond

434
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,120
what we're taught, you know? Well, I think-

435
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,520
So there, we got it out. I don't think, because I was doubting, you know, I thought because we,

436
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:58,360
I thought we got this on Rated Y. I think we might have, but at least it's a, it's a vital recap.

437
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:03,080
No, look, it's an excellent recap. And one thing to go, to go after it in another way, just really

438
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:09,660
fast, is the reverse engineering really, really quickly, is they often encourage things like,

439
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:16,920
you know, showing the logo, representing the logo, this kind of thing. That's why-

440
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:22,920
Yeah, because the intent, it's a weapon. It's weaponized. It's not a weapon. It's weaponized.

441
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:23,960
Weaponized, right.

442
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,540
If you say it's a weapon, I would know, come on, Greek, now it's pushing it too far. No,

443
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,820
it's weaponized. Yeah.

444
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,880
Yeah, yeah. No, but that's the thing. It's weaponized. But the thing is, this is the reason

445
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:40,840
why, you know, they put your, you know, your brand of soda or whatever, they put the corporate

446
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:46,400
logo on a t-shirt, too. You know what I mean? To continue it, to have it, you know, to encourage

447
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:54,140
you to constantly put it out there. And again, you know, but what is the why? Is it all the same?

448
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,740
I mean, does it all come down to the same thing, where it's just, you know what-

449
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,140
And it's just about-

450
00:38:59,140 --> 00:38:59,760
It's all about intent.

451
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:04,060
Just about the intent to be miserable. Be miserable, be unwell.

452
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:09,520
No, to influence. To influence them as subjects, because it's branding. What do you do when you,

453
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:16,960
with your animals, you brand them with a hot iron or a tag, right? So, but by the way,

454
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:22,860
I've been saying this stuff since the 80s. In the 70s, by the way, the polo shirts with the

455
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:27,420
Izod Lacoste, the crocodile, and then the polo emblem sewn in.

456
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:30,700
Oh, yeah, yeah. And then later on, they put other little animals and stuff in.

457
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:35,840
Yeah, that was really popular. Well, that was, the Izod Lacoste was for golfers, and it took

458
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:39,900
off for the main shoot. And then the polo, and I would see people, this is back in the 80s,

459
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,940
they would approach me, you know, whatever, they're wearing a fine shirt, and I'm zeroing

460
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:48,000
in on the logo, and I'm squinting my eyes from a distance as they're walking towards me,

461
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,520
and they're getting self-conscious. And they say, I think you got some bird shit on your shirt.

462
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:56,080
What is that? And I point to it, and they're like, really, what? And I point, right, point

463
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:01,280
finger right on the logo, and they look at me like, oh, you know, what's, is that bird shit

464
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,320
on your shirt? What is that? You know, just to make people conscious, because sitting there and

465
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:13,160
going over all this 40 years ago is still just as, you know, nutty as it is now, let's say. So.

466
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:15,320
Anyway.

467
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:42,020
Continuing with the look at the chat, I found some interesting things in there,

468
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:47,920
and I know you did too. So there was a reference to one of the previous Sonics now,

469
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:55,120
where you mentioned the Heavenly Father. So that, that, that's super, super common people

470
00:40:55,120 --> 00:41:00,620
use that phrase. But yeah, go ahead. Yeah, I put it actually, I didn't mention it was actually

471
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:05,100
something I typed in. There's a lot of stuff going on BS about this, this, that and Heavenly Father,

472
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:10,080
right? They don't know what that means. Just like, you know, God is within you. I think we went over

473
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:14,940
that. By the way, just do a quick recap. Oh, yeah, there was within you, besides you, inside you,

474
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:19,120
remember, Kingdom of Heaven is in you and all that. Someone also mentioned that they remember

475
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:25,460
looking this up, which I do. Also, decades ago, two decades ago, looking it up, and it said beside

476
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:31,580
you. Now it says inside you. So it's changing, right? Right. But here's the thing inside you,

477
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:37,880
meaning beside you, meaning amongst you, meaning in the village, there's no God in you,

478
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:43,020
because then that would be the only two ways someone else can be in you. One is through

479
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:53,120
physical penetration, surgery and sexual or assault, or possession. So when you say God in

480
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:59,300
Kingdom of Heaven is in you, you are possessed. Well, you still sound like yourself. Right? And

481
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:05,020
you're not being penetrated as you're walking down the street saying this. So you are in you.

482
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:12,060
And when you couple that with who you think your inner monologue is, that is an external

483
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:18,540
influence, but it's not in you. It's external influence. Now, here's the thing. If God was

484
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:24,060
already inside of you, why would you go through all the stuff that you're going through?

485
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:29,900
Well, I always found that strange when I saw, you know, I used to love to observe

486
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:36,960
these preachers, you know, and it was interesting, because sometimes they would use the phrase like

487
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:45,420
I'm possessed with the Holy Spirit. And sure, I don't say that. Well, okay, but it's not true.

488
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:50,120
It doesn't. You could say, Yeah, you want to know people saying things is not true. Turn on

489
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:55,940
politics. Look, I can tell you. I can tell you I'm from the planet. Where was Superman from again?

490
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:02,520
Xenon or Krypton? Krypton. That's right. I can tell you I'm from Krypton. It doesn't mean it's

491
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:09,020
true. I don't believe I am. I'm just saying, I could tell you that, though. And I could act

492
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:14,260
like that's something because I'm able to do something that Superman does somehow or way.

493
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:22,440
Yeah, either way, the thing is, either way, even if it's not true. If you remember, you just asked

494
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:26,780
me what planet is he from? You didn't want to make up a planet because it was already written

495
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:31,320
out. Right? Yeah, I didn't notice how you said which planet was he didn't want to make it because

496
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:36,580
you know, it's already been written out from the Superman genre. We need to go. If he neither one

497
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:41,640
of us knew what the planet name was, hold on a second. Let me what? Look it up. We'd probably

498
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:46,680
look it up and find where it's written. Yeah. So do we have license to change it and say he's from

499
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:52,640
Jupiter? No, we can say that, but we don't have any license, meaning permission to do that. So

500
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:59,140
when you start using things out of scripture, you don't have any license to change it. And that's

501
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:04,540
right. Ultimately, here's the thing. I've confronted a lot of higher ups in the religions,

502
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:09,740
rabbis and in the Christian, the Catholic bishops, Eastern Orthodox. And as you go high up,

503
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:13,840
the low guys, the ones that always look government, if you go to the DMV office

504
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:21,320
and the clerk or where any registrar office or attorney court, you're talking to the clerks,

505
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:26,960
they don't know shit. They don't know anything at all. No, eventually you get the I just work here

506
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:31,320
explanation. Yeah, because they don't know anything. So that your local pastors, priests,

507
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:36,120
you know, they don't know anything. Okay, when you are have a control mechanism, as it is on the

508
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:43,080
planet, those that are interred, the less the ones that interact with the populace, the masses,

509
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:48,560
the collective know the better. Because, you know, I don't know if you remember 9-11,

510
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:54,660
some of the politicians and other people in the in quote unquote, government, the acting government

511
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:58,840
were clued in on what happened. And they would be on an interview and by accident say, Oh,

512
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:05,920
the missile that hit the Pentagon. Right? Yeah, oops, or whatever. So it's best not to tell

513
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:10,660
put people that don't know anything. And also, there's no such thing as what they call a Freudian

514
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:18,480
slip. Alright, so this is what the people have. morons, you know, basically acting as there or

515
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:27,080
whatever. So yeah, so you there's no license to change it. But the interesting there's two

516
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:31,100
interesting points here. One is no one's really thinking about it when they say it's just one of

517
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:35,200
those feel good things. But if lies make you feel good, you still feel good, right? So it doesn't

518
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:42,000
matter. The other thing is, if any God is in you, that God has a voice. And if they're in you,

519
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:48,800
they're not meek enough and meager enough to sit there and be totally silent. If they're here to

520
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:54,240
experience something with you. So yeah, it's not going to happen, guys. It's not happening. And

521
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:58,040
again, the interesting point is how the scripture is actually changing, even in the interlinear,

522
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:01,520
it was noted by someone else. I don't want to make a big deal about it, because things are

523
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:07,620
changing. Look, have you ever noticed your own body changing? I have, of course, I've noticed

524
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:12,780
my sometimes like, like, I'll get up and tell the wife, I think I got a I got, you know,

525
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:19,980
time slammed, because I know I trimmed the nails, toenails, fingernails really close three,

526
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:24,480
two or three days ago, and now they're long, right? That's not possible. I mean, I'm not eating my

527
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:30,240
diet is excellent, but not that excellent. And I'm not on steroids. So in other words, how do

528
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:35,100
you get two weeks of fingernail and toenail growth in two days? Right? You see what I mean?

529
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:40,860
So anyway, I don't lean on this too heavily. I might in the future, if I can put it all together

530
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:47,020
in a more cohesive way. But again, there's no God inside of you, you are you. But the problem is

531
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:52,040
because you are you and you're you are who you are a human surface dwelling earth inhabitant

532
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,720
that has been throttled back, you know, governors have been put on you there, you know, they say you

533
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:02,820
use 10% of your brain. No, you're always using 100% of your brain in essence, but you you're

534
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:08,840
actually 10% of your abilities. In other words, the the the most masterful, masterful master

535
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:13,880
you've ever heard of even people walking through walls are only 20 or 30% of what they can still be

536
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:19,980
done. You see how we've been, let's say, dumbed up, dumbed down, throttled back governor, you know,

537
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,380
like Volkswagens in Europe go 150 miles an hour, but when they ship them here to the US,

538
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:28,800
they put a governor, they can't go over 110. It's on the computer. As soon as the speedometer goes

539
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:33,940
to 110, boom, it throttles, right? The same thing with semi trucks, right? 75 miles per hour,

540
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:39,940
usually or 80. They put a governor on there, so that we have that now that's being done by a

541
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:45,520
species that's outside of this realm, that physical realm that is within the physical

542
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:51,960
realm non physically. If you could follow what I just said, and they duplicate your voice

543
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:58,880
and inject it in you as a child, here's the thing. There's a point that some people remember,

544
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:03,680
I remember it and other people that I've discussed this with, within the right setting,

545
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:09,360
because you can't just bring this up, you have to prepare people. Sometimes it means just chilling

546
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:14,560
out, turning the lights down, everybody laid down on the couch and on the floor, and start slowly,

547
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:20,720
get them to recapitulate their memories, let's say, right? Okay, from a child, there's some point,

548
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:27,560
usually between the ages of five and eight years old, remember where you were, where you develop

549
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:33,420
the inner voice that you rely on is your inner voice right now. That's when it usually comes in

550
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:38,660
and gets into if you remember your youngest, youngest years, your voice was different.

551
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:45,040
Actually, here's the interesting point. You ready? If you remember your earliest, earliest thoughts,

552
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:52,420
they were actually more sober and reliable than they are now.

553
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:58,740
Right? I remember being about a year and a half standing up in the crib and I'm like,

554
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:05,960
why am I surrounded by stupid people? Right? I'm still asking that today. But anyway,

555
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:11,940
if you can go back to about what you call, let's say, within this,

556
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:18,540
let's say the social parameters that we are in kindergarten to third grade between there,

557
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:22,060
let's say, right? Because you're out in the world, you're forced to be out in public, right?

558
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:27,900
Right. You're in an unfamiliar, very rarely is anyone in kindergarten with their brothers and

559
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:33,180
sisters and mom and dad in the same room for four hours, right? So now you're thrust into a public

560
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:39,920
setting, semi-public setting between, let's say, kindergarten and third grade. See if you could

561
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:45,100
remember what inner voice you had back then. And I'm telling you, that is more you than the

562
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:50,600
influence that was put upon you later. You see? So if you could quiet that, here's another thing,

563
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:55,240
because we did talk about, and I'm going to go back to the heavenly father. This is not a tangent.

564
00:49:55,400 --> 00:50:00,320
It is a tangent, but it's relevant because it's how we dictate and talk to ourselves.

565
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:07,560
You know how they say, be a good listener. Okay. When you're listening very acutely and intently,

566
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:16,400
that inner voice that you think is you, mutes out. So that's why people, car stereos are so

567
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:22,160
important, right? Because they like to put the music on it and that inner voice goes away, right?

568
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:25,000
Where you should actually be listening to everything that's going on. But anyway,

569
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:30,700
if you're going for a walk, if you're doing something or whatever, try to also listen.

570
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:37,140
If you're sitting down eating, try to listen. The more you try to listen, even to the finest sounds,

571
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:44,660
that inner voice, but while you're listening, don't try to describe or explain what you're

572
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:50,780
listening to. Just take it in. Like when you hear, well, let's say you're going for a walk

573
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:54,940
and it's really quiet. Initially, it'll seem really quiet, but if you start relaxing and say,

574
00:50:55,120 --> 00:51:00,100
there's got to be some sounds out there other than my feet on the ground, you start honing in

575
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:04,920
and honing and tuning in your ear and you'll start hearing things off in the distance that you didn't

576
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:12,500
hear before you, let's say, made yourself go into the finer hearing. And when you're also seeing,

577
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:18,460
when you try to look at something very carefully, that inner voice mutes out also. That's another

578
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:24,280
way to mute it. So that cliche about be a good listener, there's more to it than you think.

579
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,960
It doesn't mean listen to whoever's talking because what the hell are you going to say

580
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:34,420
that makes sense anyway? You're on earth, right? Remember, well, they tell you before you come to

581
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:39,560
earth, listen, it's beautiful here, enjoy it, but don't talk to the humans because anything

582
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:47,040
you say is going to confuse them. They're idiots, right? That's why. Yeah. So I remember. Well,

583
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:52,520
anyway, that's another story. Well, I constantly have audio. I constantly have audio going when

584
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:57,020
I'm doing things because it does allow me to focus on what I'm doing better.

585
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:02,240
Okay. Yeah. As long as you don't start asking yourself things or in other words,

586
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:07,440
if it mutes that inner dialogue, I think the best way to do it is with silence.

587
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:13,980
If you're in a silent room, you can still hear things. You just ask yourself to reach your hearing

588
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:18,880
senses and your sight senses out and don't try to discern, like, but describe or explain what you

589
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:24,500
see or hear or think about it. You'll notice that voice mutes out and then you'll have a chance to

590
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:30,260
pick up on the silent part of yourself. Eventually, most people that exercise on this will

591
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:36,400
develop their own voice, who they really are. In other words, through the silence. What I mean by

592
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:42,260
that is like learning to read Braille instead of reading with your eyes, right? By feeling and

593
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:47,900
touch. Okay. So there is no God in you other than you. What's in you is you, your spirit.

594
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:54,900
But unfortunately, the voice that you think is you within your dialogue is not you. It's influenced

595
00:52:54,900 --> 00:53:00,820
externally, kind of like the old cartoons where someone's faced with a decision in the cartoon

596
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:06,360
and there's an angel on one shoulder and a devil on the other. That's a perfect analogy of what's

597
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:10,720
going on. But instead of being an angel and a devil on one shoulder and a devil on the other,

598
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:19,280
two different, it's one thing that's influencing you. There might be people out there that are

599
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:25,580
not under such influence, by the way. But I'm just saying that I found that as the general

600
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:35,280
whole, most people are, including myself. So there's no God in you. Everything that's being

601
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:43,760
done and said about the gods would be completely futile if there was. The other thing is the

602
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:48,860
Heavenly Father. That's a thing that people are using and it's very inspirational. It sounds good.

603
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:57,040
Okay. When we look at the structure, let's say through scripture, it's a series of counsels

604
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:05,700
down from God beings down to human counsel, which are in temples and the authority.

605
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:14,440
It's all about counsel and it's all about knowledge on how to manipulate both realms, let's say.

606
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:23,960
When they say Heavenly Father, it's very similar to the way that the Catholics do it when they

607
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:32,580
call the priest Father because that's an authority figure. Also, there's a verse in scripture more

608
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:37,620
than one place, I'm going to paraphrase, and it says that a son does the will of his father.

609
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:43,280
So where you get your law, where you get your education, where you get your right and wrong,

610
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:51,860
where you go for counsel is your father. How many times have you heard that... I've seen this

611
00:54:51,860 --> 00:55:00,100
many times where someone has a biological father, but another person raised him and mentored him,

612
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:04,900
and he considers him more of a father than the biological father who was never around.

613
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:12,660
You see? Also, the Catholics, you go to the father, he's the priest. You go to confession,

614
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:19,200
which is a form of blackmail, by the way, and all this other stuff, right? Because you go to him as

615
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:25,960
your leader for whatever it is, right? So where you get your law from, it also shows inheritance,

616
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:34,200
by the way, and authority. So where you go to get your guidance from is your father.

617
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:40,980
It's not a physical father. It's not a genealogical father. It's not a father as one

618
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:47,200
would consider in a family, because like I said, why do the Catholics... the priest is not... they

619
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:51,580
call him father. He's not your family. He's the priest. He's family. I mean, he's not family. He's

620
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:57,260
a priest. He's called the father because he's an authority. So the heavenly father is basically

621
00:55:57,260 --> 00:56:07,120
referring to the heavenly authority as personified by one, let's say, not the council, right?

622
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:12,260
Because, you know, a lot of people, you know, they blame the president, for example,

623
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:17,640
but it's really Congress that calls the shots, right? If you have a beef with an aid government

624
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:22,760
agency, you know what they say? Well, you don't talk to us. Congress is the one who ratified us.

625
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:30,200
They don't say the president, never, right? But he's just an executive body. I told you what

626
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:35,700
presidents are for. The mobs wanted to do a shell company to pass off cordless tools back in the 90s.

627
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:40,540
They needed a CEO. Who's going to take the hit? Because, you know, they were going to take a hit.

628
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:44,120
I said, there's a bunch of homeless people out there that look good.

629
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:49,240
Buy him a suit. Give him a thousand bucks. He'll go downtown and sign up as the CEO.

630
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:54,180
Sure. You know what I mean? Yeah. Who knows? He might run the company.

631
00:56:55,880 --> 00:57:01,440
Remember, there was one guy, he used to hang out there, a homeless guy, had a very nice angular

632
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:07,840
chin. He almost looked like Gregory Peck, if you remember the actor. He says, yeah, man,

633
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:16,020
I got involved with some stuff. I was an American Airlines pilot, and I had a house in Nevada near

634
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:19,480
Las Vegas with a kidney-shaped pool. He opens up his wallet, and he has all the photos.

635
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:25,600
This is my Jaguar. This is my garage. I was like, oh, man. This guy had some life experience.

636
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:37,300
Anyway, so you're looking at a series of authorities. It's not a familial term.

637
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:43,040
When people say father, they don't understand. Here's the funny part, right? You have these

638
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:48,860
Christians going on. Oh, I'm washed in the blood of the lamb. Jesus took all my sins.

639
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:53,400
I'm born again. My favorite is born again. Oh, my gosh. That's like saying moron right

640
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:58,620
on your forehead tattooed. I said, why go to that church and say you're born again? Just tattoo

641
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:03,760
moron and white on your forehead or whatever color skin you have. It's the same. You're being

642
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:12,060
made fun of. Anyway, they have no law. You know where they get their law from television and all

643
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:16,220
that? Then they say they have a heavenly father. What a mockery. What a mockery.

644
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:21,240
The reason you call the heavenly father is because you're doing his laws. By the way,

645
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:28,220
verses in scripture where the Christ says, when I return, will there be anyone that has the faith

646
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:39,040
or keeps the law? He's asking, will there be anyone left? I don't know. Here's the thing.

647
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:46,780
If he says on the 13th and the 14th days of the first month or on the 10th day of the seventh

648
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:55,860
month, it's not January. It's not September. With no sunset, sundown, with no sliver moon,

649
00:58:56,040 --> 00:59:05,260
I'll tell you that for sure. Is there anyone left? I doubt it. Very few. Here's the thing.

650
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:10,060
When I make fun of all these things, it's on a double level. It's like when people say,

651
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:14,480
Greek, are we in a simulation? No. Right away. Of course, we're in a simulation.

652
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:20,880
But I say no. Why? Because if I said yes, all the junk that they've gotten in their head,

653
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:25,900
defining what a simulation, how it works, is going to be validated. You see what I mean?

654
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:36,060
Greek, is there any reincarnation? No. Right away. 0.3 seconds. No. No. Because if I say yes,

655
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:39,420
they're going to take all that junk that they've been heard about, reincarnation,

656
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:43,260
and they're going to say Greek validates all that garbage. You see what I mean?

657
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:48,660
All these things, I say no. No, it's not like that at all. Do you believe in the Christian? No,

658
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:58,480
I don't. No, I'm not Christian. Of course not. You see? Because you start agreeing to these

659
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:02,580
things. What you're doing is you're anchoring yourself, and it's all these attachments.

660
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,480
You're signing up for all the rest of the crap that comes along with it.

661
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:09,780
Yeah. And even though it's not, who has enough time to sit there and correct all that?

662
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:15,000
Right. Yeah, it is, but it's not like this and that. You're going to be there for eight hours

663
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,980
later. They're drooling, and I don't know. What do you say, man? You talked for a long time.

664
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:26,940
I don't know, man. I don't know. Something about, you know? Yeah, so I just don't bother.

665
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:30,840
That's why even recently I was out and said, you need to write a book. I get a crowd around

666
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:36,320
me publicly, and I'm like, yeah, I don't write books. Just go to this hotel or whatever.

667
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:47,760
Anyway, I want to do a plug for Greekspeak.com. That's Sam or the Archon. He spent a lot of time

668
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:53,100
writing articles about stuff that I've talked about, very professionally done. So if you guys

669
01:00:53,100 --> 01:01:00,880
want to check out some stuff there, that's another place to get Greekspeak stuff. Speak with a double

670
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:08,100
E. People write a book. I say, well, look, if you write a book, you're presuming people have

671
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:14,040
reading comprehension, right? You're writing a book for moral and ethical reasons, not to get 50

672
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:19,120
cents or a dollar per copy. You're not going to make a living writing books. I know someone who

673
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:25,140
moved down South America as an American guy. Anyway, he's written books and sold over a million

674
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:33,260
and a half copies and he's barely over 15 years. That doesn't end up being like, I don't know,

675
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:37,640
you can't make a living on that. No. No. Over 10 years, a million and a half books,

676
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:41,260
he's not going to make a living from that, right? So what are they doing? What are they using the

677
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:44,580
books for? I mean, I don't know. I said, how many responses? Yeah, I get very few. I was like,

678
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:50,880
what the hell? What are they doing with the books? It doesn't make any sense. There's no

679
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:56,040
comprehension here. How about one book that gets a million and a half people excited

680
01:01:57,100 --> 01:02:01,800
versus a million and a half books that get no one excited? I would rather do the other one, right?

681
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:06,440
One, get people excited with one thing, but no, I'll never write a book. Never write anything.

682
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:12,840
Why? There's no reason for it. The reason you wrote things is to memorialize. Now you memorialize

683
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:18,240
it on the internet. After the internet and all this stuff goes away, you won't care about the

684
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:24,560
stuff I'm saying. You're going to be more interested in how to stay alive. I've got a lot

685
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:31,440
of stuff on that as well, but there is no heavenly father as the way people are using it. It's a

686
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:39,080
heavenly authority. If you are doing what TV tells you, like the latest keto diet and blood pressure

687
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:45,640
and wearing a mask and all that, wherever you got that information from is your father.

688
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:54,860
That's why the Christ said that Satan had sex with Eve because Jesus told the Pharisees that

689
01:02:54,860 --> 01:03:00,440
Satan's your father. Remember at the rocks, he says, we're sons of Abraham. He says, we could

690
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:06,840
turn these rocks, which were the stones that they put when they crossed the Jordan, Elohim could

691
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:11,880
turn these into sons of Abraham. Your father is Satan. Well, that means if their father is Satan,

692
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:15,620
a spiritual means that they're doing what you say, that's where they're getting their

693
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:23,920
law from. So it's where you get your law from. And most people that say, use the term

694
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:30,520
heavenly father have no law. They're lying because it's not a heavenly father. It's a CNN,

695
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:36,900
doctor, father, whatever, whatever, whoever came up, whatever bullshit, they have many fathers.

696
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:43,420
You see the collective and the Christians or whatever, whatever the Catholics bless their

697
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:49,480
heart. The Pope is their father, whatever the Pope says, you see, that's pretty clear by the way,

698
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:56,080
or their local father for the Eastern Orthodox and the Catholic people. Right. So then I've

699
01:03:56,080 --> 01:04:00,260
said this many times, the way you become Christian is very simple. You get yourself a saw. It doesn't

700
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:05,380
have to be so sharp. Cut the top of your skull off, lean over real good. All your brains fall

701
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:10,480
out. Leave them off. Leave the brains on the floor. Put the top of your skull back on. Voila,

702
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:18,940
you're converted. You're Christian now. Now you're Christian. Congratulations. Yikes. Yikes.

703
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:24,900
A lot of times I get really harsh and I say, listen, has anybody ever told you any of this

704
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:28,320
before? No. I said, you know what? You're never going to hear it from anyone else anyway. So,

705
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:36,620
you know, they're like, yeah, thanks, man. All right. So where you get your law, think about

706
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:42,420
that by the way. Think about that. Think about that. Where you get what you do from is your

707
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:46,660
father. That's pretty freaking scary when you think about it for most people. For a lot of people

708
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:51,540
it is. For a spiritual level, from a spiritual point of view. And is there anything else other

709
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:57,400
than spirit? Right. Because we already know that the physical is, you know, manipulated to the

710
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:02,660
point where, and the spiritual is manipulated to the point where, you see, you can change things.

711
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:10,020
But the spirit, the physical can be destroyed. The spirit, not so easy. Because when you destroy the

712
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:15,720
physical part, it just jumps out and it's not animated anymore to be either animated or not

713
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:22,760
animated again, right, in another state. But it's easy to destroy the physical. The spirit will go,

714
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:30,080
when you die, it leaves and it goes into a disanimate space, but it's still there. It's

715
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:36,720
destroyed directly later, but it automatically leaves the body, you see, and the body gets trashed.

716
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,740
So either one is influenced very heavily. So where you get your law, your morality, you know,

717
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:50,340
when I say law, I'm not talking about traffic law also. Everything is part of law, because when you

718
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:55,360
go live amongst a certain people, just because you're a highly ordered individual doesn't mean

719
01:05:55,360 --> 01:06:00,920
you need to create chaos, right? You shouldn't. The best place to create chaos is when you go out

720
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:04,240
into nature. I'm not talking about making fires and things, but you know what I mean?

721
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:12,440
I mean, if you've ever found a secret little body of water in a forest, you just want to take all

722
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:16,660
your clothes off and run in the water, right? Or a waterfall that you didn't know was there,

723
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:22,740
no one knows is there, but you want to just get naked and, you know, just get in there, you know?

724
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:27,860
So yeah, it's a form of chaos, but you know, the thing is not to create chaos.

725
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:34,460
So that's what I have to say about that's my story, and I'm sticking to it. It's very, very simple.

726
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:42,620
By the way, you know, this is probably another thing, but I can go through the most popular

727
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:49,020
biblical cliches and stories and give the interpretation for those things based on the

728
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:55,260
Bible, right? Because, you know, there's only one interpretation, but there are many versions,

729
01:06:55,440 --> 01:07:04,100
right? You know, when you go to the UN and it's cohorts of different languages, who do you have

730
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:09,820
next to you? What's he called? An interpreter. Now, they have to be very specific, right?

731
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:10,420
Yes.

732
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:14,300
About what you're saying. Actually, there was years ago, one of the guys made a mistake,

733
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:17,740
and they brought him, went back, and they shot the guy. Do you remember that?

734
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:23,440
I remember reading it. It was an interpreter that either deliberately or indeliberately

735
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:26,200
misinterpreted things, and they killed the guy.

736
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:30,800
Yeah, I do remember something about that. I don't remember exactly which country it was,

737
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:32,820
but it was a long time ago, right?

738
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:35,340
Yes, I don't remember the details, but it's serious stuff.

739
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:39,580
But versions, you know, the versions are, you know, the funny papers, you know?

740
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:44,720
And the thing is, if you have something as comprehensive as what's known as the scripture,

741
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:51,600
it gives you enough definitions of what it's talking about that you can use it to define

742
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:58,240
itself, like the Mark of the Beast, right? And all that stuff. There was a lady who was

743
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:03,840
blaming the Illuminati. I forgot her name. She was into Orgo and all this. They killed her.

744
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:09,600
She's one of those people they found hanging. I was on a Skype. It was Revolution Radio a

745
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:13,620
long time ago, and she was talking about this is the Mark of the Beast, and it's gotten popular

746
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:18,359
about that. I don't know. I forgot who it was. It wasn't Tracy Twyman. It was someone before that.

747
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:23,220
And I said, oh, Mark of the Beast, that's in Numbers. It's in Deuteronomy. It's defined.

748
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:32,319
It's not a chip. It's not whatever. She's like, oh. It's like, ah. She's like, ah. She was like

749
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:37,000
going through some kind of like Wilhelm Reich orgasmic thing. And I'm like, here, here it is.

750
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:40,899
Using it from the Bible, this is what it is. It's defined right here, by the way. It's not a chip,

751
01:08:40,899 --> 01:08:45,620
microchip, right? Again, it has to do with law. It's the way you function, is the Mark of the

752
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:53,060
Beast. It says, my law will be a mark on your hands and a mark on your forehead. So whoever's

753
01:08:53,060 --> 01:09:01,760
law you follow has a mark on you, right? Anyway, make your mark, right? Yeah. So the Heavenly Father

754
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:05,920
is the heavenly authority. If you say you're Christian, you go ahead and do whatever you

755
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:12,779
want to do, and you do whatever, whatever, that's not from the Heavenly Father, I assure you for sure.

756
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:20,279
So, yeah. So is there a Heavenly Father? Yes, but it's not a father. It has to do with

757
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:26,899
the father being called and the authority where you get your guidance from. Not the familial term.

758
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:33,880
It's the, yeah. Not lip service, yeah. Right. Yeah. So, yeah. I just wanted to cover that because

759
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:42,060
we can cover any aspect of scripture and just show you what's in there about it in a practical

760
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:47,880
way, and it's not what you think, but it's so easy that, you know, what was that commercial,

761
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:54,480
oh, I could have had a V8, you know, right? And it's so simple, right? If you don't get ticked

762
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:59,360
off or triggered from it, right? And by the way, you're not going to make friends, right? Because

763
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:05,540
part of the friendship and the social stuff is to be like everyone else, right? Oh, yeah, right.

764
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:12,300
Everybody wants to fit in, you know. Do you feel we covered that satisfactory?

765
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:17,320
I think you can't cover it any better than that. Yeah, and if you go to the...
