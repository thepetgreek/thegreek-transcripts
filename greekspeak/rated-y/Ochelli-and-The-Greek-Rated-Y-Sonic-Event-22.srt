1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,460
The sonic entity known as Ocelli,

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:04,880
erred in the Greek.

3
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,700
This evening, because the sun's down where I am.

4
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,980
Yeah, it's going down here.

5
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,160
Yeah, well, the thing is that people like the Greek speak,

6
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,100
the Greek perspective,

7
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,760
and, well, not the Greek perspective,

8
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,060
but I'm the only Greek I know, but meaning Greek speak.

9
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,300
So, yeah, we were talking about water, concrete, magnetism.

10
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,340
You said you were dealing with a car mechanic.

11
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,940
I got a lot to say about that, right?

12
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,280
So, you got a car, right?

13
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,320
And you went from one mechanic to another or whatever, yeah?

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,240
Had to, because, quite frankly, look,

15
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,120
I'm not great with the mechanics,

16
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,940
so I seek out somebody who is,

17
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,420
and hopefully they help me to maintain the vehicle, you know,

18
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,900
so that it doesn't break down, or when it does break down,

19
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,180
then we got to get it back to running.

20
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,780
And, you know, now I'm stuck,

21
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,260
because I laid out money to a guy

22
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,800
who was really pulling me along there,

23
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,580
due to my ignorance.

24
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,180
And, you know, it's a common problem, I think.

25
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,060
But go ahead, yeah.

26
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,580
You know, here's the thing about that.

27
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,720
Okay, forget about the car.

28
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,560
Let's say it's a horse.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,840
You don't have a horse for transportation for too long

30
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,240
if you don't know enough about horses.

31
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,380
It'll die on you, right?

32
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:39,060
Of course.

33
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,540
So you need someone who knows about horses

34
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,120
that you cohort with closely,

35
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,880
and is hopefully close to the horse.

36
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,540
And, by the way, when you have a horse,

37
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,440
you know, you can have a car parked for a month, right?

38
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,880
Forget about the title, insurance, all that stuff,

39
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,760
but you can park for a month and just get in and go.

40
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,280
If you have a horse sitting in a stable for a month,

41
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,720
you still have to feed them and water them every day,

42
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:59,940
even if you're not using them, right?

43
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,720
That's right, yeah.

44
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,920
So cars are a lot cheaper.

45
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,000
But it's all about maintenance.

46
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,860
So what happened was people got very distracted.

47
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,540
I used to go into a car dealership and say,

48
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,560
Hey, this car, I was in here a year or two ago,

49
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,680
and the cars are different now.

50
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,780
Oh, yeah, these are the new models.

51
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,500
He's so happy, right?

52
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:19,980
These are the new models.

53
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,280
I'm like, what do you mean new models?

54
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,300
I mean, that just means you haven't figured out how to make them yet, right?

55
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,180
I went to the hardware store and I got a hammer,

56
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,680
and I saw an East Wing hammer,

57
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,280
and the one I've been carrying around all my life was made in the 1940s,

58
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,280
and the one I just bought is exactly the same.

59
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,310
East Wing, an East Wing 18 ounce or 16 ounce hammer.

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,180
It's exactly the same.

61
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,180
You know why?

62
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,220
Because they figured out how to make hammers.

63
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,240
You don't have to change it.

64
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,680
So they have this vanity thing, right?

65
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,000
People say I got a new car.

66
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,900
I said, well, what's the engine made of?

67
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,600
Is it an aluminum block, aluminum head?

68
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,120
I don't know.

69
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,180
What's the compression ratio on the engine?

70
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,400
I don't know.

71
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,540
You went $50,000 into it?

72
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,400
It's like, what kind of horse is it?

73
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,500
What is a horse like?

74
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,420
Hey, what kind of temperament?

75
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:09,960
I don't know.

76
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,140
I don't know.

77
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:17,540
So all this vanity stuff, the new model, the year, all that stuff, the fuel.

78
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:24,200
On one of the Hiresite chats, it talked about – I'll get to the mechanics here shortly,

79
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,440
and this is the buildup.

80
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:27,560
You know what?

81
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,340
I don't know if you've ever visited a place where they manufacture cars.

82
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:35,140
Well, the car comes off the assembly line, and they start it up,

83
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,500
and it doesn't run very long.

84
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:40,420
And a guy comes over, and he puts like this cushion over the fender

85
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,080
so he doesn't scratch it with his belt buckle,

86
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,440
and he hooks up a laptop or an iPad kind of thing.

87
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:46,940
Okay.

88
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,680
And they check the computer, and they adjust the computer

89
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,560
so it gets close to the mileage that's on the sticker.

90
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:54,720
Why?

91
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,360
Some of the cars come off the assembly line.

92
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,540
Let's say it's a Ford pickup truck.

93
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,540
It's supposed to get 18 miles to the gallon average, let's say, right?

94
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:03,880
Sure.

95
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,860
Okay, it comes off the assembly line, so he tests one,

96
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,520
and it's getting five miles to the gallon.

97
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:08,980
No good.

98
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,640
It has to be 18 close to it.

99
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,340
So he tunes the computer to give you 18.

100
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:14,500
All right.

101
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,220
It does that.

102
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,480
It does a couple more similar.

103
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,600
And then another one comes off.

104
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,320
It's getting 75 miles to the gallon.

105
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,800
Oh, we can't have that.

106
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,860
So we tune it down, right, to dump fuel so it gets 18 miles to the gallon.

107
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,640
You see what's going on?

108
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,260
So I do modifications on what they call combustion engines,

109
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,780
and if it doesn't have a computer, I double the time or the mileage.

110
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,320
The reason I say time is a neighbor who was cutting the lawn,

111
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,100
and every 20 minutes, like clockwork, what does he do?

112
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,320
He stops, and what does he do?

113
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,160
He has to put gas.

114
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,040
He has this little can, and he puts gas in it, runs it for another 20 minutes,

115
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:50,820
runs out of gas.

116
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,140
I said, look, how would you like for that thing to run for 40 minutes instead of 20,

117
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,920
which is double, right?

118
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:57,320
Right.

119
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,080
An hour and a half later, boom, here you go.

120
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,380
Now it's clockwork 40, 45 minutes before he refills it, right?

121
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,220
It has to do with the spark plug and the carburetor.

122
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,980
But the moment you have a computer controlling stuff,

123
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,540
it's going to introduce sabotage.

124
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,880
All right, so put that together with the vanity that started.

125
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,140
When did the vanity start?

126
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,640
Probably in the 30s with the Model T or before that,

127
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,060
because Model T is the Model A.

128
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,140
Model T stands for tall, right?

129
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,020
Okay, right.

130
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,020
And they started the new car model years.

131
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,460
I think it was really popular in the 50s, right?

132
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,440
And still is, okay?

133
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,900
Total bullshit.

134
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,840
They keep the people completely ignorant of cars,

135
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,960
which is very simple technology, by the way.

136
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:46,420
But if you're not familiar with it, right, it's complicated, right?

137
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,960
Think about any subject.

138
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,800
Think about, for example, we're doing these Sonics,

139
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,020
and you've been, quote, unquote, involved with radio,

140
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,400
and you know how to push buttons and record something and broadcast, all that stuff, right?

141
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,100
I don't know if you've ever worked in a TV or radio station, a proper one.

142
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:02,620
I have.

143
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,340
I've been in proper radio stations.

144
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,380
A TV station, I've only ever seen the one side of the camera,

145
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,720
but I've actually been throughout a radio station, yeah.

146
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,000
Yeah, okay.

147
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,720
So basically what you're doing right now is just that, an extraction, an adaptation of the same thing.

148
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,140
Right.

149
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:22,400
Except there you have to consider the high power and the distribution and all that other stuff.

150
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,880
But here's the thing.

151
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,860
If you have someone who has no experience and you throw them in a radio station

152
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:33,160
or where you're sitting right now to do what you're doing and say go, they go into a panic.

153
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,020
Right, they have no idea what to do, right.

154
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,760
No, well, they might think they do, but they won't succeed, you know.

155
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:39,480
Right.

156
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,200
Okay, so this is what they're doing with the car culture, right.

157
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,260
I just buy a new car or whatever, and then when it comes time to the mechanic,

158
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,760
the mechanic is good and ready.

159
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,300
The mechanic culture has adapted to this as becoming predatory.

160
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,020
Right.

161
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,700
Okay, same thing with health.

162
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,240
Oh, I'm not feeling well.

163
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:58,620
What do you do?

164
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,640
I'm going to go to the doctor, right, because it's like the doctor, right.

165
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,060
Right.

166
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,260
How many times have you heard that?

167
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,180
Somebody's hurt.

168
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,600
You need to go to a doctor or you need to go to the doctor, right.

169
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,180
It's even worse.

170
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:09,960
Why?

171
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,180
Why?

172
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,720
Because they keep you away.

173
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:20,200
Most people, what they know about the human body is what they got from grandma

174
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,560
or their parents or television.

175
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,440
Think about how pathetic that is, right.

176
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,960
And then they try to look at the alternatives, which tells you take this supplement

177
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,580
and it lowers your blood pressure.

178
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,300
Oh, my goodness.

179
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:31,920
Oh, my.

180
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,520
Or I don't know if I've been on, maybe if you were around,

181
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,620
a couple of alternative medicine people were on a Skype

182
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,940
or I might have been in Revolution Radio Days.

183
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,120
Yeah, we invented this nutrition thing.

184
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,520
You absorb it ten times more.

185
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,440
I said, Absorb it?

186
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,480
Are you sure about that?

187
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,100
And I explained it.

188
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,140
He says, Well, I've been doing this for 35 years.

189
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:52,980
Right.

190
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:53,680
It's like, What?

191
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:56,220
You could be doing it for 3,500 years.

192
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,240
Right.

193
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:57,840
It's wrong.

194
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:58,820
Okay.

195
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:03,220
So, in other words, what's happened is people have gone away from the reality

196
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,760
of their responsibility to that reality.

197
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,180
That reality could be the health, right?

198
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,820
The health is like the car, right?

199
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,340
You don't feel sick?

200
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,420
Go to a doctor.

201
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,600
Go to the hospital, right?

202
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,980
Your car's not working?

203
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,980
Go to a mechanic, right, right away, right?

204
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:19,980
You need a mechanic.

205
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,380
Right?

206
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,460
What about the ordinary person?

207
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,840
Hey, listen.

208
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,240
I want you to start broadcasting or do some podcasting or whatever.

209
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:29,940
I don't know, man.

210
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,020
I need a radio set.

211
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,600
I need a pocket.

212
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,120
Why?

213
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:33,760
Why?

214
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,700
Get familiar with it quickly, right?

215
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:37,020
Don't panic.

216
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:43,280
So, what's happened is people are being led away from their own responsibility

217
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,760
to their own reality.

218
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,500
Here's the thing.

219
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,320
That's the culture, right?

220
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,100
Well, I don't know.

221
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,580
I'm not a plumber.

222
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,520
I can't fix a broken pipe because I'm not a plumber.

223
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:54,780
What?

224
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,820
Were there plumbers around?

225
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,560
What came first, the plumber or the pipe?

226
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:00,460
Right?

227
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,240
You know what I think?

228
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,480
Well, I think what you're trying to say is not really just the responsibility,

229
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:12,700
but look, if you're going to utilize something and you're going to be in charge of something,

230
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,300
maybe it's a good idea to know how it works unless you're going to sit there

231
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,880
and just toss it away and get a new one every time it doesn't work.

232
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,260
Well, that's part of the ritual that's taught, but this is not on you.

233
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,880
This is not a stain on your side.

234
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,440
The reason I'm saying this is because it's developed this type of culture.

235
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:34,740
Yeah, can you have honest, diligent, economic-to-use mechanics?

236
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,340
Of course.

237
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,420
The culture could have been built around that, but it hasn't.

238
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:42,760
The culture's been built around laziness, basically.

239
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,960
Yeah, some of them work hard, but dishonest and shabby.

240
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,360
That's the culture.

241
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,660
That's the standard.

242
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:50,680
Right?

243
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,700
So I'm not saying this is what you're doing or not doing.

244
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,440
I'm saying the culture's built around that.

245
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,760
The culture's not built around people knowing what they're getting, like compression ratio,

246
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,720
what the materials are, what the tolerance are.

247
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,420
You know, the higher the tolerance is, the longer the engine's going to last, right?

248
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,820
And all this other stuff.

249
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,320
They're not taught that.

250
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,160
They're away from it, so they could focus on who has a newer car,

251
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,440
because they obviously still haven't figured out how to make them.

252
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,340
So this is the culture.

253
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:25,520
The same thing, the culture, especially in white America.

254
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,800
Someone gets sick for more than a day or two or three,

255
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,700
and people can't fix it with something, what do they say?

256
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,380
Go to the hospital.

257
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,580
Go to the doctor.

258
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,200
Why?

259
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,600
What does he know?

260
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,400
You see, the culture has led people into this.

261
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,660
Because the doctors are predatory.

262
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,120
You know, we never talked about how hospitals work, but they're the banks.

263
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,160
The real bank is the hospital, right?

264
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,740
The banks that you call the banks are not banks.

265
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,080
They're national associations.

266
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,580
If you have a checking number, it says N.A. at the end, right?

267
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,660
And then they have another name, which is Inc., which is the corporate part,

268
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,820
which is different, right?

269
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,260
Where the money is generated is in the hospital.

270
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,560
That's why old people, when they see that they have like a premium insurance plan

271
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,980
from like the Blue Cross Blue Shield.

272
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,260
I know the CEO from there.

273
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,080
It's called Anthem Corporation.

274
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,220
He's got a $36,000 a month pension.

275
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,780
I tell this to people.

276
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,940
I say, what was he making if his pension is $36,000?

277
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,180
What was he making when he was working, right?

278
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,220
Yeah, right.

279
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,180
Yeah.

280
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:41,320
So anyway, when you have like a premium insurance policy like that,

281
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,100
you go in for like a stubbed toe, they want to remove your lungs

282
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,440
and give you a kidney transplant for a million bucks

283
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,920
because the insurance will be unnecessary completely, right?

284
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:55,820
You know the majority, 75% to 90% of all diagnoses are completely fictional.

285
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,040
I used to tell people, I don't know, I went to this to diagnose me.

286
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:01,960
I think I better do it.

287
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,840
I said, all right.

288
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,040
They didn't really diagnose you.

289
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:10,040
What they did is they said you got to get a lab test, urine, feces, blood, whatever,

290
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,620
and they just show you the lab test and then they make a recommendation.

291
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,700
That's not a diagnosis.

292
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,340
Tell the doctor if he's diagnosing you with this disease or ailment or cancer

293
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:23,480
to write it down on paper in an affidavit form and sign it.

294
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,780
None of them will do that.

295
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,880
None, not a one.

296
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:31,020
They're specifically told never to do that, ever.

297
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,120
You'll never get that.

298
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,280
It's all presumption, all of it.

299
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,020
Well, you know what occurs to me while you're talking about this is that,

300
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:41,060
you know, in recent years I've noticed that they have actually started to develop

301
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:45,020
like an insurance kind of scheme for cars as well.

302
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,000
Have you seen this?

303
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,180
Yeah, for repairs.

304
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,620
The TV commercial late night, I was watching Star Trek.

305
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,980
$35 for a transmission, get this insurance repair.

306
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,460
And, oh, thanks, it's fixed now, right?

307
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,300
Yeah, actually, I first saw it on Star Trek, too.

308
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,060
Yeah, commercial.

309
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:06,340
Yeah, the old one with William Shatner, I think is the last one alive.

310
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:07,960
I think so, yeah.

311
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,080
Techie.

312
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,660
But here's the thing.

313
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,460
Insurance companies don't have any money either.

314
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,240
What insurance companies really are, they are a privilege.

315
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,220
They're access, they're a middleman to the Fed window.

316
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:25,980
See, if you go to the Fed window, it's not, we're talking about electronic convention now.

317
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,740
But years ago, the Fed had windows in all the 12 major cities, right?

318
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:38,240
San Francisco, Dallas, New York, Chicago, the other one, St. Louis.

319
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,840
Yeah, these are the main Federal Reserve Bank branches, right.

320
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:46,540
Yeah, and then they had small sub ones, and you took a document, a contract, a bond,

321
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,260
and you had a signature or two signatures on it, and they gave you an account.

322
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,380
They didn't give you cash anymore.

323
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:55,560
That was good, a check to deposit in the bank for the value.

324
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,000
So insurance companies, they have access to that window.

325
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,180
That's why the claim forms, they ask you all these questions.

326
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,020
You can't get insurance without a Social Security number,

327
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:08,720
because that's to show that you're part of the administration of the bankruptcy, right?

328
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:13,780
So the United States went bankrupt, so you're exempt from it.

329
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,440
All debt belongs to the United States.

330
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,600
You could look this up.

331
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,440
But what happens is you waive it different ways, you know.

332
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:26,280
Anyway, the insurance company just takes the claim, so the premiums that you're paying,

333
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,660
takes the claim to the Fed window and it monetizes it and gives it whatever.

334
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,520
The reason you have to pay a premium every month is to give you the impression that you're paying into something, right?

335
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,500
It's like tax.

336
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,280
I heard there was a video of someone talking about government funding.

337
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,700
It doesn't know a damn thing.

338
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,900
It's got like 100-something thousand subscribers.

339
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,600
Someone says, oh, this guy's alive right now.

340
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,140
You want to listen to it?

341
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:48,820
Put him on.

342
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:54,100
Saying, oh, yeah, the taxes, once the state pulls their federal taxes,

343
00:14:54,100 --> 00:15:01,140
the federal government is going to – there's not – 0% of taxes since 1938 have gone not even for nothing.

344
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:07,380
You know, not one even stick of chewing gum has been bought from anybody's taxes,

345
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,460
the trillions and trillions.

346
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,760
None of it has nothing to do with – doesn't work that way, right?

347
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,780
The problem that the tax collection agencies have is not that you didn't pay.

348
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,960
It's that you didn't what?

349
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,880
File a report because they're monetizing their report.

350
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,580
People – I think I've run over this many times.

351
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:29,540
You know, if you're minus $1,000 in the bank and I write you a check for $100, right?

352
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,240
Remember that, right?

353
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,020
Oh, yeah, of course.

354
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:31,520
Yeah.

355
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,700
But, you know, the government, if the government wants to fund something, the so-called government,

356
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,300
they send everybody a check for $1,000.

357
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,260
You know, it turns into $9,000, right?

358
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,200
They give you the $1,000.

359
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,820
The government gets $3,000.

360
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,160
The bank gets $3,000, right?

361
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,220
And then the other third goes to the other parties.

362
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,160
Yeah, right.

363
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:48,900
See how it works?

364
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,500
That's why, you know, checks are good for 180 days.

365
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:58,720
You know, when the last stimulus check program went out, exactly 180 days later, according

366
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:05,300
to the Paperwork Reduction Act 2002 or 2003, all those documents go to the DTCC, which

367
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:11,240
is the Deposit Trust Clearing Corporation in Manhattan, and they become re-monetized

368
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,280
after 180 days, right?

369
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,000
You know, after the last stimulus was sent out, exactly 180 days after the inflation

370
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,280
started going up or the prices started going up because it flooded the market with trillions

371
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,320
and trillions of credit, right?

372
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,340
See how it works?

373
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,740
You don't see that anywhere, though.

374
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,720
Nobody tells you that.

375
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,620
I think I'm the last person on Earth.

376
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,420
Years ago, I ran into someone.

377
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,500
Well, recently, someone called me out of the blue I hadn't spoken to in 15 years, and

378
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:45,080
he came over here from California and all this, and he found out about me because he

379
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:50,280
went to a seminar with Austin Fitz, whatever her name is.

380
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,140
Catherine Austin Fitz, yeah.

381
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,420
Catherine Austin Fitz, and he went to talk to her after the seminar.

382
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:02,020
She had a bunch of questions for her, and she said, if you want those answered properly,

383
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,599
you need to find this guy who lives in Tucson, goes by the Greek.

384
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,619
This is back in the day, right?

385
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:08,500
Right.

386
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,440
And I feel like I'm still the only one around who could do it.

387
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:16,760
It's kind of sad because everything I'm telling you is accessible if you read it, if you could

388
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,960
gather it all in one place.

389
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,280
It's kind of like the crucifixion.

390
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,200
It's right in front of you, but you can't make it out, you know?

391
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:26,119
You know what the Christian stuff is, or the human body, right?

392
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:26,560
Or anything.

393
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:32,060
Yeah, so in other words, oh, there's another thing.

394
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,600
If you want spiritual help, you've got to go to church, right?

395
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,240
Go to the temple, right?

396
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,580
Yeah, okay.

397
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,300
You see the culture?

398
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,220
You see how the people have become devoid?

399
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,420
It's supposed to be this way.

400
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,340
Sorry, I can't help but laugh at that, but yeah, sorry.

401
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,240
No, all of it is.

402
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,440
I don't like Christianity.

403
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,400
Now I'm a Buddhist, or I converted to Islam, right?

404
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:50,900
Or whatever.

405
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,660
Oh, my goodness.

406
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,900
You know, that's like, oh, I don't drink Diet Coke anymore.

407
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,780
I'm going to Diet Pepsi, right?

408
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:57,960
That's better.

409
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,580
Big difference.

410
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,680
It's all the same.

411
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,740
You know, all the religions are Vatican approved.

412
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:10,300
If you had a non-Vatican, all of them, if you have more than 100,000 people, it's not

413
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:14,020
Vatican approved, they're going to do a Waco on your ass, right?

414
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,680
And they're going to set it up that you're a terrorist or whatever.

415
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,180
I'm serious.

416
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,480
They all kiss the ring.

417
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,960
Mormons, Jews, every Jewish sect, every Mormon sect, every Buddhist sect.

418
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,580
Trust me.

419
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,560
Yeah, anyway.

420
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,460
Not trust me, but that's a New Yorker in me.

421
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,060
I know.

422
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,580
Yeah, let me be honest with you.

423
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,540
Trust me, those are New Yorker sayings, right?

424
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,460
Let me be honest.

425
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,240
To tell you.

426
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,020
Or trust me.

427
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,780
Or to tell you the truth.

428
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,740
Yeah, to tell you the truth.

429
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,040
You're breaking my balls.

430
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,260
I love that.

431
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,880
You always got to watch the prefix on the statement, right?

432
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,020
Which is what I call it.

433
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,900
Because it's like, with all due respect, hold on to yourself.

434
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,740
Because that's not going to be good.

435
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,020
Right.

436
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,660
Well, you know, you did couch it a little bit.

437
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,060
You knew something was coming.

438
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:05,780
Right.

439
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,740
Yeah, with all due respect.

440
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:07,920
Yeah.

441
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,200
How much respect is due by telling someone to go F off, right?

442
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,020
Amazing.

443
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,460
So you see, we went from the car to the this, to the that, to the doctor, to the money, to all.

444
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,040
Yeah, you need money, go to the bank, right?

445
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:30,040
So what's happened is the people, if there are any left, have been pulled away from their responsibility to each reality.

446
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,040
So you have like the car is a certain reality, right?

447
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,760
The body, the health is a certain reality.

448
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,520
The banking is a certain reality, right?

449
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,400
These are different sections in reality, right, that affect us.

450
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,180
Because they can be addressed.

451
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:49,400
Well, see, now, I don't think it's a bad thing that I decided to consult somebody that should be familiar with this,

452
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,980
because I don't drive a car, right?

453
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,480
I am not an operator of a vehicle.

454
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,760
But I do depend on it, because I have a partner who drives a car, right?

455
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:06,200
So, you know, therefore, I've got to find some way to deal with, okay, now I've got a malfunctioning vehicle.

456
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,960
Well, you didn't call me.

457
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,460
I didn't call you, no.

458
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:14,400
Yeah, so that means you don't know what I know and what other people know.

459
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,480
No, I don't.

460
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,260
That's another story.

461
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:16,760
Okay.

462
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,600
I fix, most cars I fix over the phone, by the way.

463
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,140
Really?

464
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,280
Or tell you what's wrong with it over the phone.

465
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,000
Yeah, I got witnesses to that.

466
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:33,280
By the way, if anybody's listening or subbed that has had me fix their car over the phone, email Chuck and tell him.

467
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,340
Yeah, please do.

468
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,180
Yeah, how many people, I do it all the time.

469
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,860
It's that simple.

470
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,400
I wasn't aware of that.

471
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:40,940
But, okay.

472
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:50,920
Mechanics don't look, it's, yeah, they're, anyway, anybody's easy to B-rate, right?

473
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:54,400
B is rated B, but there are no A mechanics anymore.

474
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,360
They're all B-rated.

475
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:01,160
So the B, the best B-rated mechanic is now your A mechanic, your C mechanic is your B mechanic.

476
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,180
You see what I mean?

477
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,040
I understand.

478
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,460
Because it's not something that people look for.

479
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:10,480
Look, in America, if you say you're a waiter, that's kind of looked down.

480
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:15,940
But in France, in Paris, if you're a waiter, that's like, wow, you know, it's like an accountant or an engineer.

481
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,340
You know that?

482
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,320
Not anymore, because they have Pizza Hut there now.

483
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,140
Yeah, well, of course.

484
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:25,640
I always found that strange, though, is that, you know, the lack of respect for the people that are actually going to hand you food.

485
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,460
You know, I always found that weird.

486
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:28,820
Here.

487
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,920
Because I would think to myself, yeah, here, exactly.

488
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:37,700
Yeah, a lot of the northern, that's part of the white culture, but a lot of the southern European culture was very high.

489
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:44,080
Well, I would think you would have to have some, you know, look, you know how you respect the shark in the water, right?

490
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:49,240
Because you know that this thing, its place is in the water.

491
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,220
You're in there now, okay?

492
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:56,500
And you better have some respect for it, because it can do some harm to you if it wants to.

493
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,760
Now it could just swim by you, okay, or it could hang out.

494
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,560
I've had that.

495
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:08,180
I've had a sand shark tear up my shin just by rubbing against me very quickly.

496
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,560
They're very fast swimmers.

497
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:10,320
Okay.

498
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,240
And they're just afraid.

499
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:17,100
Just like rattlesnakes, when I first came here to Tucson walking in the desert, an old Indian man told me, he says,

500
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:24,260
Listen, the reason you wear the boots, what you do is you don't walk like you walk on hard ground here.

501
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,920
On the desert, you kick and slide your shoes, so you're always kicking gravel in front of you.

502
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,660
Okay.

503
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,700
And this way you let any creatures in front of you know you're coming, you know.

504
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,820
Because they're just afraid.

505
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,080
If a snake bites, it means it's defending itself.

506
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:39,920
It's afraid, right?

507
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:45,660
Why would you defend yourself if you're not under, you don't see that, it doesn't see you as prey.

508
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,640
It sees you as a threat.

509
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,880
Yeah, well, it doesn't want to get stepped on, so, you know.

510
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Or attacked, yeah.

511
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,420
Right.

512
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,400
So, yeah, but anyway, sharks and all that.

513
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:01,620
Yeah, I don't know if we got our shot, but yeah, the culture is the reality is broken up into many little realities,

514
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,860
and then we interject.

515
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,860
So, let's say you're a chef at a restaurant, someone says, I don't know about how to make this,

516
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:14,180
and you'll, because your reality, because you work in that, you can take responsibility for what you're saying, right?

517
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:18,520
Because you're a chef, you can tell that person how to make this or that, usually.

518
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,180
Right.

519
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:19,420
Right?

520
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,860
You take responsibility for what you're saying.

521
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:26,380
So, most people are, when the car breaks down or the body's not doing well,

522
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,760
they can't take responsibility even if they wanted to.

523
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:33,440
Just like I gave the analogy starting off about the radio function, functioning.

524
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:39,420
They can't take, you throw just anybody in a radio station and tell them we're going to be going live in four minutes,

525
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,900
can they take responsibility for what they're going to do?

526
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,100
No.

527
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:45,620
No.

528
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,120
They're not, because if they're going to, what are they going to say after it's all done?

529
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,960
Well, I didn't know what I was doing, right?

530
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:02,680
Because that means, okay, so the thing is how much time do you want to devote in learning about whatever facet, right?

531
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:08,080
Here, I used to try to, this kind of talk I was doing back in the 80s,

532
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:17,180
and the way I would crack the conversation or the subject matter is being a public laundromat,

533
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:21,600
and I'd see someone, usually they stand in front of the laundry and watch the dryer,

534
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,060
and I'd go up to them and I'd say, hey, it's better than watching television, isn't it?

535
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,120
Okay.

536
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,100
Just to get them going on reality here, you know, reality talk.

537
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:36,660
You know, most of the stuff I've been saying, especially the past ten years or so,

538
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:44,900
I've already said a long, long time ago, a lot of the stuff that we could get into on Rated Y,

539
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:49,080
it, for most people, might shy away because it gets a little technical sounding,

540
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,040
but it's never more than eighth grade, right?

541
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:52,680
Okay.

542
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,760
So, but, yeah, responsibility.

543
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:01,200
That can be very tough if you've never been exposed to first, second, third, fourth, fifth, you know,

544
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,860
I mean, it's a little difficult to jump right into eighth grade, though, isn't it?

545
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:08,160
Yeah, yeah, I liked some of the comments in the chat, some was about phase modulation,

546
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,940
like it was almost like a semi-quippy chat.

547
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,840
Did you guys notice that the Greek was talking about phase modulation?

548
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:21,520
You know, nobody said yes or anything, so I went in there and I thought that the Anon who posted that

549
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,020
has at least, he's got some very moist gray matter, if you know what I mean.

550
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:26,580
Okay.

551
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,840
Which is good to see.

552
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:34,320
So, yeah, so, yeah, it's just sad because, you know, here's the thing.

553
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,120
People say I want to do something to recreate, right?

554
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,720
Or watch a movie or play a video game, whatever.

555
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,460
It's like, what are you talking about?

556
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,560
We're going to learn how to fix the car.

557
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,640
That's a hell of a lot more interesting and it'll serve you better.

558
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,700
Or go learn how to cook, right?

559
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,780
Or learn how to do this, or learn how to, right?

560
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:49,700
Okay.

561
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:53,960
Isn't that, I think that's, they call that infotainment, don't they?

562
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,040
Where you entertain yourself through information.

563
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,560
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

564
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:02,660
Keros One started that a while back in the 90s.

565
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:03,280
Chris.

566
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,560
Smart guy, I thought.

567
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:11,780
Yeah, my roommate was his producer for a while.

568
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:18,120
I had a short time with a roommate, but was producing Keros One.

569
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:26,400
So, anyway, when he was at his peak, like, what was it?

570
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:30,980
The Sound of the Police and all those, remember that?

571
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,260
Made him really popular.

572
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,820
Yeah, like mid-90s, right?

573
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:34,780
Something like that.

574
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,160
Early 90s, early 90s.

575
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,060
Oh, early, okay.

576
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:42,180
Like 91 to 90, or 90 to 93.

577
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,240
Anyway, the chat was interesting.

578
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,240
I think I'm going to open it up right now.

579
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,940
Actually, before we go to it, I'm going to sit back down here.

580
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,140
And I did a search earlier.

581
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:59,980
One thing I mentioned, I put in, let's say I have a, I use Maxton.

582
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,820
I don't know, sometimes I, what do you use on Maxton?

583
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,400
I've never heard of it.

584
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,200
M-A-X-T-H-O-N.

585
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:11,000
It's a bunch of, it was started by a bunch of programmers who wanted to beat Chinese censorship,

586
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,560
the government censorship in China.

587
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:13,120
Okay.

588
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,500
Then it kind of became, it adopted the Chrome format.

589
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,480
I really like it.

590
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,500
I've never gotten an ad.

591
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:21,920
And if I do a playlist of music on YouTube, it never interrupts it.

592
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,920
Are you still listening?

593
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,160
Click here or whatever.

594
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,100
Never get any of that.

595
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:29,560
It's got the most aggressive ad blocking and the most aggressive anti-cookie

596
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,460
and the most aggressive.

597
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:35,720
And you still get through, you know, like certain programs like Zoom or whatever don't work.

598
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:36,380
Okay.

599
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,340
With that kind of aggressive ad blocking.

600
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,240
Right.

601
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,680
But it does.

602
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,760
So it knows when you're, when it's critical and when it's not.

603
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,060
Anyway.

604
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,440
And at Maxton, I'm on Google search here.

605
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,700
I'm going to put in Middle East.

606
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,020
Did this this morning.

607
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,240
Let's see if I get the same.

608
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,140
Just, and then enter.

609
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:56,620
And then I'm going to go to the top where it says tools, anytime drop down.

610
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,740
I'm going to go past week.

611
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:58,480
Okay.

612
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,620
And they changed a lot of the, but this morning it was India.

613
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,720
It's going to get into the Middle East to try to get all the countries organized.

614
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,800
Let's see if I can do past day, 24 hours.

615
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,580
Middle East and Europe times.

616
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,520
Now it's escalating tensions again.

617
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,040
But this morning it was very interesting.

618
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:27,900
It was, it sounded like it was all Kumbaya, everybody holding hands.

619
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,080
It was almost like the twilight zone.

620
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:30,360
Right.

621
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,900
Cause you know, I've talked about what's coming.

622
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:32,120
Right.

623
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,120
The Middle East union.

624
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:33,700
Right.

625
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:38,980
And the search I did this morning, let's just do the past week again.

626
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,160
Middle East history around Middle East, new round of Middle East fighting.

627
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,560
Oh, within eight hours, new round of Middle East fighting again.

628
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:50,360
Well, it seems interesting to me because it's constantly fluctuating the past few weeks.

629
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:50,580
Right.

630
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,760
It seems to me, you know.

631
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:52,460
Yeah.

632
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:52,660
Yeah.

633
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,300
Is it becoming, all right, here we go.

634
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,660
Is the Middle East becoming peaceful?

635
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,320
India's planned to connect the Middle East.

636
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:02,640
Cause you do this every eight, nine, ten hours or so,

637
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,860
and you'll see an entirely different result.

638
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:09,580
But this one, the majority statistically was off the chain.

639
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,100
Here, like Syria rejoins the Arab League.

640
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:12,620
Okay.

641
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:19,680
They're building this huge one billion dollar embassy in Lebanon.

642
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,540
They're doing all this stuff.

643
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,480
It's like all under the radar.

644
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,820
All under the radar, you know, in terms of the mainstream collective.

645
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,900
Collective doesn't know all the development that's going on and how they're becoming.

646
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:36,680
They're getting stuff that, you know how the infrastructure in the West is falling apart

647
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,460
and all the restrictions and austerity.

648
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,760
Okay, well, it's the opposite there.

649
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,920
Everything's booming there.

650
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,060
Right.

651
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,960
But it's not for the collective.

652
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:51,120
It's not booming like for the people on the street, but it's booming behind the scenes.

653
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:59,340
Deals are being made, big multinationals, embassies, trade routes, big infrastructure plans.

654
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:03,960
I thought I saw a lot of stuff on Dubai like last week, right?

655
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,540
Dubai was a big thing.

656
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,900
Yeah, I wouldn't count them in though.

657
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,580
No, okay.

658
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,760
No, that was like never really inhabited area, and they're just a bunch of camel thieves.

659
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:13,980
Okay.

660
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,160
All those people.

661
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:23,860
They're very, I think, okay, just to recap, when you go, let's say you're England or the U.S.

662
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:29,300
or the Dutch 100 years ago, and you go into an area like the Middle East,

663
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:34,420
which is all these tribal semi-pneumatic culture people,

664
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:41,680
and you want to unite them so you can have a body of people that you can rule over,

665
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,480
but you don't want them to do it directly.

666
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:48,580
You want to install a government that's supposedly their own to do it, and that's a puppet government.

667
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,140
Sure.

668
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:55,740
All puppet governments, you always have to take a group of people that the people generally hate

669
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:01,340
and put them in power, and the reason why that works is for this,

670
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:07,600
because they're going to do whatever the suzerain authority says,

671
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:13,320
because if the suzerain, the colonial power pulls their power and drops these guys back,

672
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:18,620
the people are going to just tear them to pieces because they hated them anyway, right?

673
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:19,060
Okay.

674
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,760
But while they're in power, they're going to be less compassionate

675
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,400
because they remember that they were always hated.

676
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,160
You see what I mean?

677
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:26,580
Okay.

678
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,800
By their own people, you see?

679
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:32,340
So whenever you see these puppet governments that are indifferent,

680
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:39,280
like Saddam Hussein was one, he was a CIA puppet.

681
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,440
I think you know that, right?

682
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,260
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

683
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,280
Yeah, yeah.

684
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:47,940
And Saddam Hussein, I got this from, by the way, I'll just interject something,

685
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,740
because that's what this is about, right?

686
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,020
Why?

687
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:55,540
I don't know if you, are you familiar with why they punished him so badly?

688
00:31:55,540 --> 00:32:01,360
Well, publicly, as a lesson, you know, in 2003, and then before that, 1990,

689
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:04,060
what was it, the Desert Storm, and then the other one?

690
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,780
Because he went rogue.

691
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,100
Are you familiar with the story?

692
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,100
I got this from a retired Army colonel.

693
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:15,260
Well, I'm familiar with a couple of different versions of that story, but, yeah, go ahead and tell me.

694
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:19,160
Which one would you think was the one that was told amongst the high brass?

695
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:26,760
I think that there was certain things that he was supposed to do that he refused to do,

696
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:35,040
and when that happened, they tricked him into making this move, you know, against. . .

697
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,140
Oh, with Kuwait, the first one?

698
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,120
Yeah, the first one.

699
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:41,200
They tricked him into making that move, and then it was like, okay, now they took him down for it.

700
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:41,660
The second one?

701
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:41,980
Right.

702
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:45,420
And the second one, which had nothing to do with 9-11, anything serious?

703
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,580
What did you get on that?

704
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,940
What intel do you have on that?

705
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:51,800
Well, what I got on that is that he still did not make the moves that they wanted him to make,

706
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,160
and I think it was a financial thing.

707
00:32:55,640 --> 00:33:00,340
From my understanding, it was a financial thing where there was a lot of money that was brought into there,

708
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,780
and then it was supposed to go certain places.

709
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,720
It didn't, and that's why, you know, people talked about this loosely about the pallets and cash and all that.

710
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,140
That's what I got, but go ahead.

711
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:18,660
Okay, this is what the inner Pentagon, the brass people had.

712
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:24,760
Okay, when we say that he was a Muslim country, right,

713
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:29,280
do you know there are more Muslims in Asia than there are in the Middle East, right?

714
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,480
I think it's like five to one.

715
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,840
There's almost a billion Muslims, right?

716
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,920
There's not even, what, 300 million people in the Middle East, 400 million, not even?

717
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:37,680
Right.

718
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:42,160
Okay, so most of them are Pacific Rim, Malaysia, you know, all those, okay.

719
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,740
But Muslim is Muslim nonetheless, right?

720
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,040
Okay, so bear that in mind.

721
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,080
Okay, this is what I got, and I'm going to say it.

722
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,160
It's rated Y, okay?

723
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:59,200
I was never told not to repeat this or not, so I can say it, but it's not public at all.

724
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:00,480
You ready?

725
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,000
Sure.

726
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:06,820
Okay, all right, so he was kind of sore by 2003 or 2002.

727
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,860
So what his plan was, you know, he had already dealings.

728
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,020
He had plenty of American hardware missiles, long range, medium range,

729
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:17,260
not long range ballistics, but medium range, you know, missiles, right?

730
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,980
You know, could go a few hundred miles, right?

731
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:19,420
Yeah.

732
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,739
Not just the Scuds, you know.

733
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:24,699
That's why they just showed these Scud missiles that were crap.

734
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:29,360
He had missiles that were up-to-date ordnance, Minutemen type stuff, right?

735
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:35,139
No, he had great stuff all the way up to the year 2000, let's just say, technologically,

736
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:38,620
and also had access to, you know, the chemical weapons and all that.

737
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:40,179
They actually did have that stuff.

738
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,239
Yes, yes.

739
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,739
So this is, let me get it.

740
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:47,620
Okay, so what he was going to do was when the big holiday,

741
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:52,500
when everybody walks around Mecca, he was going to take an American missile

742
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,820
that just has not been touched and clean it all up,

743
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:58,820
put a couple of coats of polyglycol wax on it,

744
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:02,040
and shoot it right where everybody goes around Mecca, the cube,

745
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,620
and drop more than one over there,

746
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:08,420
and make sure that the fragments are found that it's an American missile,

747
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,920
and kill a lot of people,

748
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:17,720
and he would go and say the Americans attacked the holiest site on the holiest day

749
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,940
to create a worldwide jihad against the Americans,

750
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,660
and the Americans would have lost, by the way.

751
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:28,360
If every Muslim in the world decided to fight against America,

752
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,040
what would you call it?

753
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,380
Well, if just the population of Malaysia decided to turn against the U.S.,

754
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,300
we're outnumbered by a lot.

755
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,560
Yeah, by a lot, right.

756
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:44,780
So what is an honest-to-goodness jihad is what he wanted to do,

757
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:49,120
and that would be a billion Muslims versus the Americans and their allies,

758
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,760
and most of the allies would cop out too.

759
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,740
But anyway, so that's what he was planning on doing,

760
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:57,260
and days before, if you go back and look at what I'm talking about,

761
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:02,560
there was a lot of stuff talking about telling people not to go to Mecca that year in 2003.

762
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,680
I don't know if you remember that.

763
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,760
I do remember that.

764
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:05,820
Putting all that together.

765
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:09,040
Now that you're talking about this, I do recall this story,

766
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:12,160
but I didn't know how serious to take it that there was going to be.

767
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,880
A false flag.

768
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:14,880
Yeah, a false flag.

769
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,220
That Saddam was going to blame the Americans,

770
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,220
and he was going to pull it off, by the way,

771
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,700
because he had plenty of people around ready to jump.

772
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,280
You have to do it very fast.

773
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,660
Once it happens right away, you call for a jihad,

774
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,740
not like a month or three months later, you know what I mean?

775
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,740
No, you have to have an immediate reaction.

776
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,900
Look, this is the way it went.

777
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,400
We have enough proof that this was an American weapon

778
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,380
because he had actual bona fide American weapons.

779
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,460
Well, no, he had the goods.

780
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,520
No, but that's what I'm saying.

781
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,040
He had bona fide American weapons.

782
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:45,220
It would look the same as one of the missiles that we would have fired, yeah.

783
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:48,340
No, it would have been exactly the same missile that we would have fired.

784
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,220
Because it is exactly the same one.

785
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,820
Right, and it would have looked like it, yeah,

786
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,280
and it would have been very convincing.

787
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:56,900
All you've got to do is throw a live one in a dud one, right?

788
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,240
Because the dud would guarantee that they'd find you, right?

789
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,980
Well, a dud, you can identify it because you can read everything on it.

790
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,960
Yeah, but anyway, all this was put in place.

791
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:07,420
This was seen as very dangerous, not because he was going to do that,

792
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,940
but because the Americans can handle a scandal like that,

793
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,300
but not a worldwide jihad.

794
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:16,100
You see, no country can handle a worldwide jihad.

795
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:17,780
It doesn't matter who it is.

796
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:21,580
Well, no, because honestly, if the attack was wholly of sites,

797
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,940
okay, that would outrage the entire Muslim world, not just, you know.

798
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:26,580
That's what I mean.

799
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,000
Yeah.

800
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,300
People think, most Americans think, when you say Muslim world,

801
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,680
they think those little pity countries in the sand in the Middle East.

802
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,780
They don't know that there's, you know, like you said, billion plus in Asia.

803
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:41,880
Yeah, no, you're not even close to exaggerating when you're talking about

804
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:46,300
you could easily raise an army of a billion people without a problem that would just say,

805
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,220
okay, they have attacked, you know, God, basically.

806
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,860
Right, and you wouldn't have to pay them a soldier's salary either.

807
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:53,560
No.

808
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,700
They would go do it completely on their own.

809
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,280
Every man would finance it his own.

810
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,040
Right.

811
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,520
Because, you know, when you go to the army, I'm not getting paid, you know.

812
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:03,460
Right?

813
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,460
So, no, it would be very, very serious.

814
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:08,980
When you do something in a jihad where you're not doing it for the money,

815
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:14,580
by the way, soldiers do it for the money, it will never stop.

816
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,460
It would still be going on right now.

817
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,160
You see what I mean?

818
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:24,380
So, whether this is true or not, this is what was circulating amongst the high brass.

819
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,260
So, yeah, interesting.

820
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,580
Just file that away.

821
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,040
I think it was notable, right?

822
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,220
Oh, no, definitely.

823
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:36,920
Look, realistically, again, because this is what I always said about this, by the way,

824
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:42,880
is that if there was a real, you know, oh, it's a clash of civilizations and, you know,

825
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:47,500
this idiocy that, oh, well, all the Muslim world wants to kill, you know, all of us Christians,

826
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:52,100
and I used to laugh at every single one of them because I said, if that were the case,

827
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,920
if the whole Muslim world...

828
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,440
Yeah, they could have done it five times over already, right?

829
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,220
You would not stand a chance.

830
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,400
This wouldn't even be a hiccup.

831
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,500
It would be done quick.

832
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,460
Right, yeah.

833
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:04,900
Yeah, because, again, when you tell this to most Americans, they're like,

834
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,440
oh, we're just going to blast and turn the desert into glass.

835
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:12,600
No, most Americans are not aware that the Muslims are not, the majority is not in the Middle East.

836
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,100
No, you're going to level all of Asia?

837
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,720
Because that's what you'd have to do.

838
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:21,780
Yeah, and they'll come over in bamboo canoes, man, if it was a jihad, yeah.

839
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:26,440
So, anyway, yeah, I just thought I'd share that.

840
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,080
I don't think I ever brought this up with you, have I?

841
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,420
No, you have not.

842
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:33,240
That's why I hadn't heard your story about this before.

843
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,120
Well, it's not my story.

844
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,160
I got it from a colonel, retired colonel.

845
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:40,660
But the story that you're repeating, I hadn't heard it from you, is what I'm saying.

846
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,920
I've heard stuff like this.

847
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,080
Yeah, when you contemplate what I just said, it actually makes sense.

848
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,560
It would have been very easy for him to do logistically.

849
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:50,100
He already had the goods, right?

850
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,260
And he already has TV stations, right?

851
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,800
You've got to have a TV satellite link, right?

852
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,840
Well, they had all the attention in the world.

853
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:01,540
Look, and outside of his country, even if you shut down all the electricity in Iraq,

854
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:05,800
right outside of his country, there was whole huge satellite-connected networks

855
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:10,960
that could easily carry the action, even if you knocked out his whole power grid, say.

856
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,560
Okay, you EMP all of Iraq, say.

857
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,980
It doesn't matter, because they could cover that, no problem.

858
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,480
So, no, logistically, you've got a serious problem if that was the undertaking.

859
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:24,920
Yeah, he had everything.

860
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,040
They went over it.

861
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,800
Allegedly, everything was in place, and all redundancies were in place.

862
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:36,800
So, if he had a failure in one part, he had it pretty tightly done.

863
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,060
So, anyway, there you go.

864
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,040
I don't think that's the reason I was doing this search.

865
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:47,280
Well, the very important thing to mention here, though, is that whether it was true or not,

866
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:51,200
whether it was that he had all of his redundancies ready and he was all set,

867
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,680
it doesn't matter if that's what was believed to be true.

868
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:00,140
Yeah, I think it could have been partially true, partially fabricated.

869
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:04,680
Like what I got from American State Department people on 9-11,

870
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:09,680
the higher people got a story that Osama bin Laden put suitcase nukes,

871
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,280
and that's what really brought the building down.

872
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,300
And that doesn't make any sense.

873
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:16,060
That means they're ignorant, because the flash, you know,

874
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:19,040
you would have destroyed half of Manhattan, right?

875
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,340
You would see the flash.

876
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,840
That's what Judy Woodlady said.

877
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,220
It can't be nuclear, because you'd see it blinded by the light.

878
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,720
But she's right about atmospheric, but if you do it underground,

879
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:32,700
which is the way that 99% of all the nuclear testing has been underground,

880
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,320
then there is no flash at all.

881
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,720
It's just a surface reaction.

882
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:43,060
But they believed the suitcase nukes in the buildings,

883
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:49,080
so they're not getting the truth, the higher-ups in the quote-unquote governments.

884
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,780
But, by the way, it's really hard to say.

885
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:56,180
The government, I think what's left, the post office, not the Postal Service,

886
00:41:56,180 --> 00:42:02,320
and the State Department might be one of the last departments that is government.

887
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,420
Like, you know, Treasury, you have Department of the Treasury

888
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:06,980
and then Treasury Department, right?

889
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:09,820
One is the IRS, one is the government.

890
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:14,320
So Department of the Treasury, that's the private credit,

891
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,140
and Treasury Department is closed.

892
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:16,880
There's nothing there.

893
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,320
If you go to the building, there's just somebody sitting there in the office

894
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,320
and playing Scrabble, right?

895
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,760
They have nothing, because they've been bankrupt since 1933.

896
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:29,260
But the Department of Treasury is booming, so because of all the credit, right?

897
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,760
I think we went over that earlier.

898
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:35,960
So there are no, when you hear agency, that is essentially a subcontractor

899
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,940
that is like an NGO but better than an NGO.

900
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:45,300
It's like they work so closely with the government that they're considered to be government.

901
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:46,860
You know what I mean?

902
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:47,240
Right.

903
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,940
It's kind of like when you're raised by someone since a baby,

904
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:53,480
you call them your mom or your dad, but they're really not.

905
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:54,560
You know?

906
00:42:55,560 --> 00:43:00,080
So whenever you hear agency and all that, that's a private group.

907
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:03,420
Like, you know, the FBI is an example of that.

908
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,700
Before the FBI, there was another, a private,

909
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:09,440
it was more candid that it was a private agency before them, right?

910
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:10,780
Who was it?

911
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,160
It was not Wells Fargo.

912
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:13,860
Pinkerton.

913
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,340
The Pinkerton, yeah, right.

914
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:20,240
Yeah, and then they obviously were doing all the work for the Federal Reserve people

915
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,300
and the industrialists, you know.

916
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:26,140
I think the attention, they came to them when they killed all those union people

917
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:27,420
who wanted union eyes.

918
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,600
They went in and shot them up, right?

919
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:30,000
Right.

920
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:33,780
And that's when, yeah, then the FBI, the Jewish,

921
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:38,640
the FBI was started by the Jewish Mafia, by the way, funded and organized, right?

922
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:45,060
Just like the Bolshevik, you know, the take of the Soviet Union,

923
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:50,120
the people that took over, as we know, are not the original revolution.

924
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,320
That's the Red Revolution, which came after the White Revolution.

925
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:58,660
So they sent the White Revolution in to get rid of the czar and what he had in place.

926
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,920
Then they killed those guys and then brought in the Red Revolution.

927
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:04,500
You see what I mean?

928
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:06,900
So anyway, it's a long story.

929
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,360
And that's, again, the Jewish Mafia.

930
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:12,180
If you look at how it started,

931
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:15,080
it's a bunch of guys from Brooklyn and Wall Street, right,

932
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:19,100
that did the White Revolution, then the Red Revolution, FBI, same people.

933
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:23,780
That's why throughout history, FBI busts what?

934
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,400
The Italian Mafia, right?

935
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,760
How many times did they bust the Jewish mob?

936
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,160
Maybe one.

937
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:31,840
Bust was Siegel.

938
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,720
They mentioned maybe one or two, maybe.

939
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:38,080
Well, Siegel wasn't really Jewish Mafia, but when you get to Lansky.

940
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:39,620
Lansky, right.

941
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:40,480
So yeah, maybe one.

942
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,100
Right.

943
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:42,540
They went after one, right?

944
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:46,840
Okay, so yeah, it's very clear how these things work.

945
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,460
These agencies have all, in other words, they're privately funded.

946
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:52,840
They're privately hatched.

947
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,140
Justice Department is privately hatched.

948
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,000
Do a history, do a search.

949
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:00,000
I'm not going to do it now, but put in history of the Department of Justice.

950
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,520
Even Wikipedia says it's a historic anomaly.

951
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,860
We don't know where it came from.

952
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:08,380
Just Grant one morning decided to sign it in as an agency or whatever.

953
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,500
Amazing, right?

954
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:15,460
So yeah, we'll go back to the chat.

955
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:19,080
I thought it was like a potluck of stuff we just went through.

956
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:19,980
Yeah, definitely.

957
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:20,800
Past half hour.

958
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:21,940
Yeah.

959
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:26,040
Somebody asked why – I'm going to open this up, maybe open the chat.

960
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:29,620
Somebody asked about death, right, and what happens when you die.

961
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,360
That's something that I've been thinking about.

962
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,780
A few people – you know, I brought up –

963
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:41,400
I think it was two sonics ago about cooking, dry the meat to make it juicy, right?

964
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:42,240
Right, right.

965
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,080
I even brought that up because when I hear two or three people

966
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,820
or four people bring up the same subject over a period of time,

967
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:50,900
I've got to say something about it.

968
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:53,800
So a couple of people have been bringing up death lately,

969
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:57,640
and I think I – I don't know if I'm hallucinating, but it was in the chat.

970
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,440
It might have been Ed, Heavenly Father and the God's Hymn.

971
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,460
I'm just going to go through it.

972
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,340
I think it was him again.

973
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:06,480
Well, death is always a fascinating subject anyway because, look,

974
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:11,580
it's one of those things where quite frankly everybody's got a point of view on it, right?

975
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:13,360
It's not one of those things where –

976
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:16,480
Well, here's the thing – well, no, it is, yeah, but not –

977
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,300
I don't think I've ever gotten into it from the Greek-speak point of view.

978
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,580
No, I don't think so.

979
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:21,040
Yeah.

980
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:21,960
Well, here's the thing.

981
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:27,200
You're fully – you're fully liable to death all the time, right?

982
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:31,980
Because how many times – there was a TV show a while back called Dead Like Me

983
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:35,340
or something like that about these people going around and they mark people.

984
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:41,340
They have a list of people that have to be taken out today, right?

985
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:41,980
They go to work.

986
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:46,320
It's like the Grim Reaper kind of thing, but they were ordinary people, let's say, looking.

987
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:48,260
Something like that.

988
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,840
I thought it was a good premise.

989
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:51,520
You're always liable to it.

990
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:52,520
I'm going to say, you never know.

991
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:53,360
The guy looked fine.

992
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:54,300
He's crossing the street.

993
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,240
Bam, right?

994
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:56,760
He didn't see it coming, right?

995
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:57,900
It was at lunch break, right?

996
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:04,200
So in the Castaneda – by the way, I've been listening to Castaneda audio books lately

997
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:08,320
in the background here because I have the whole house wired up with speakers and connected

998
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,000
to a computer.

999
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:13,440
Push a button and you can hear anything on the property inside or outside the house.

1000
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,480
You can hear whatever is playing on the computer, right?

1001
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:15,960
Okay.

1002
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:16,960
In high fidelity.

1003
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:22,080
I've been doing the Castaneda books for like 10 hours and I'm in the background.

1004
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,700
I'm doing some stuff here, remodeling the house, but heavy.

1005
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:29,340
When I mean remodeling, like foundation work and stuff like that and other things.

1006
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,800
I like listening to Castaneda.

1007
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:34,480
Most of the stuff really hits home.

1008
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:38,960
I'm happy about it, but it actually pisses me off because I've been saying similar stuff

1009
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:42,080
and I didn't read Castaneda.

1010
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:45,360
How the hell can I be saying the same stuff Don Juan is saying or similar?

1011
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:48,660
It means we're tapping into the same thing, right?

1012
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:53,020
If you get into something that's true, it doesn't matter what language you say it in,

1013
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:55,040
or what part of the world or who says it or when.

1014
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,300
It's true whether they say it or not, right?

1015
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:57,860
Right.

1016
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,920
It doesn't matter who says it or how they say it.

1017
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,360
I like what he says that you consult death.

1018
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:06,180
Don't be afraid of it.

1019
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:06,560
Consult.

1020
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:07,480
This is my time now.

1021
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:12,600
If you're still alive after you ask the question, well, it's not your time yet, right?

1022
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:12,940
No.

1023
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,100
But it's very simple.

1024
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:21,540
You go through it as an organic being, as a baby, all the way through your life as an adult.

1025
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:23,820
They always have old sayings.

1026
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:25,600
When you're a baby, you're crawling on the ground.

1027
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:28,620
On your last days as an old person, you're probably what?

1028
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:29,900
Going to be crawling on the ground.

1029
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:33,020
As a baby, you're pooping and pissing on yourself.

1030
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:36,500
As an old person, I don't have to say it again, guess what happens?

1031
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,140
The full circle, yeah, of course.

1032
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:38,820
Yeah, yeah.

1033
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:39,180
Okay.

1034
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:40,760
Let me ask you this.

1035
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,180
Before you were born, let's just know airy-fairy shit.

1036
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,560
What do you remember before you were born?

1037
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:52,740
As a matter of fact, you don't really have a lot of memories until you're in your mid-formative years, right?

1038
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:53,400
What do you remember?

1039
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:54,060
Nothing.

1040
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:58,900
Okay, same thing happens with consciousness after you die, okay?

1041
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:05,360
The only thing is, were you able to be manipulated before you were born?

1042
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:06,820
Well, yeah, you can say that.

1043
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:07,860
Like, for example,

1044
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:11,500
I would say I don't know because I don't recall it.

1045
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:13,020
I can't recall it.

1046
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:17,940
Well, from the organic point of view, certainly, like if your mom was an alcoholic while she was pregnant with you,

1047
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,380
they have this syndrome, right?

1048
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:20,160
What is it called?

1049
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,200
Oh, this fetal alcohol syndrome is the one.

1050
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:22,920
Yeah, there you go.

1051
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:23,900
Mm-hmm.

1052
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,320
If you survive, let's say.

1053
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:26,600
Right.

1054
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:27,100
And all that.

1055
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:30,240
So you can affect before you're born biologically very, very much.

1056
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:34,620
A lot of eugenics programs are based on that.

1057
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,000
I've never shared this.

1058
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:36,600
This is really private.

1059
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:37,760
I might as well share and rate it why.

1060
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:44,960
Greek was born in a place called Adelphi Hospital, which was 120 beds in Brooklyn,

1061
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:49,840
and it was part of the American Eugenics Society, which also started in Brooklyn.

1062
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:56,560
And I heard that the parents were, let's just say, compensated for me.

1063
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:03,000
In other words, while the mom was pregnant and had me, she was getting compensation.

1064
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,820
So what the hell were they doing?

1065
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,960
The American Eugenics Society, right?

1066
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,540
And every year there's less information about it.

1067
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:17,120
Now Adelphi Hospital has turned into a condo a while back.

1068
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:20,280
But years ago there would be a lot of information

1069
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,180
how the Adelphi Hospital was part of the American Eugenics Society.

1070
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:27,700
What they were doing is they were doing, I don't know about genetic manipulation,

1071
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,000
but that's been around since the 1930s, big time, and cloning.

1072
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:36,100
But they were trying to breed, hire, whatever.

1073
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:38,280
You can fill in the rest.

1074
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,120
So I've never shared this publicly, have I?

1075
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:42,180
Not that I recall.

1076
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:43,480
I think I have.

1077
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:48,420
Oh, and while I'm saying this, the Skype is ringing as if we're not on the call.

1078
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,260
Well, we still are.

1079
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,040
I guess you can hear me still.

1080
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,360
I hear you just fine.

1081
00:50:54,360 --> 00:51:03,460
So, all right, where we are on the death map is what you remember from 500 years ago

1082
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:06,780
is what you're going to remember 500 years from now

1083
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:10,060
within the tuning that your consciousness is in right now.

1084
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:12,340
And Chuck, you're still there, I'm guessing, right?

1085
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,060
Yeah, I'm still here.

1086
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:16,240
Yeah, while I was getting into the Adelphi Hospital,

1087
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:19,800
if you heard all that, the Skype was ringing as if another call was coming in.

1088
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:21,100
No, I didn't hear anything.

1089
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,620
I was just hearing you.

1090
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:23,000
Yeah.

1091
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:24,860
Yeah, interesting.

1092
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:25,480
I like that.

1093
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:25,900
Okay.

1094
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:30,900
Okay, so I don't think I ever went semi-public with that, but at least I might bring it up.

1095
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:31,440
There you go.

1096
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:33,160
That is fascinating.

1097
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,320
It's an interesting history, yeah.

1098
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:43,520
Yeah, so the other thing here is, back to death, is when you go into your memory,

1099
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:48,600
by the way, the better your constitution is here,

1100
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:51,800
for example, I don't want to say I implore,

1101
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:55,860
but if I can get people to stop eating what they're eating,

1102
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:00,360
and I'm not a freak, a macrobiotic freak or whatever, anything like that,

1103
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:03,680
but go get yourself some Lundberg brown rice, learn how to cook it,

1104
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:08,080
L-U-N-D-B-E-R-G or U-R-G.

1105
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,180
It's an organic, very, very high-quality brown rice,

1106
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:17,200
and get yourself some kale and some beans that you cook not from a can

1107
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,180
and eat that for a week, but cook it well.

1108
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:22,180
If you don't cook it well, you'd wish you died, right?

1109
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:22,980
You know what I mean?

1110
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:26,080
Yeah, I think I've gone through that before,

1111
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:28,040
the survivalist packing rice and beans,

1112
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:30,120
and I said, you're going to wish you died if that's what you have to eat

1113
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,320
if you don't know how to cook it, right?

1114
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:32,120
True enough.

1115
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,600
But if you could eat, and I think I've talked about this before,

1116
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:38,680
when the macrobiotic people came into San Francisco,

1117
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:42,040
and this is not a tangent, by the way,

1118
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:44,360
and they were doing seminars in the 60s and 70s.

1119
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,600
Most people from the public came in,

1120
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:47,820
but after like the fourth or fifth week of seminars,

1121
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,480
only the hippies were coming in,

1122
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,460
and they stopped and they said,

1123
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,260
okay, we notice you guys keep coming back,

1124
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:55,380
but no one else is.

1125
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,000
Why do you keep coming to our seminars?

1126
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,480
And they said, well, because we're doing what you're saying.

1127
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:01,840
We're eating the brown rice and drinking the tea and that,

1128
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:05,020
and we don't have to do drugs anymore, but we feel high all the time.

1129
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:06,880
Right?

1130
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,540
It was a lot cheaper than drugs, right?

1131
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:09,080
Sure.

1132
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:10,560
So that's what I'm trying to say,

1133
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,280
is when you eat a really whole diet and very clean,

1134
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,980
this is a very easy way to prescribe.

1135
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:15,980
You don't have to do what I'm saying,

1136
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:17,720
but you can get it easily.

1137
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:20,680
Lundberg is the only rice that does it.

1138
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:25,960
When you eat, I don't know if you've ever gone to a bakery

1139
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,220
where they bake fresh bread.

1140
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,340
Okay, well, of course, but listen.

1141
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:34,020
This bakery, the owner of the bakery,

1142
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,840
he also has 10 acres of land 10 miles south

1143
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:42,020
where he grows his own wheat and harvests his own wheat

1144
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:44,080
and dries his own wheat, organic.

1145
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:45,000
He doesn't spray it.

1146
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,680
And he stone mills it into his own flour,

1147
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,480
and then he bakes it and sells you the bread.

1148
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:50,880
Have you ever gone to a place like that?

1149
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:53,520
I don't think I have.

1150
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:54,100
Okay.

1151
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:58,080
We have one here in town in Tucson, the Barrio Bakery.

1152
00:53:58,300 --> 00:53:58,480
Okay.

1153
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,820
Now, when you get a roll and you put that in your mouth

1154
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:02,940
and you chew it and swallow it,

1155
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,160
you feel like this feeling of love or euphoria.

1156
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,660
Do you remember when you first fell infatuated with someone really young?

1157
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:09,020
Sure.

1158
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:10,220
You know that feeling?

1159
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,420
It's like giving somebody a hug.

1160
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:13,160
You get this rising feeling through your body.

1161
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:13,820
Oh, yeah.

1162
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:16,340
And it feels like you just got some good news.

1163
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:17,200
Right?

1164
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:17,700
Oh, yeah.

1165
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:19,480
That's what happens when you drink spring water.

1166
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:20,840
Right.

1167
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:21,560
Okay.

1168
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,300
So when you eat some of this guy's bread,

1169
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,840
it's like, so in other words, if you can get your diet adjusted to,

1170
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:29,220
you start eating food that when you eat it,

1171
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:32,460
it brings you this feeling, this emotional,

1172
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:35,320
wow, I feel the energy in it.

1173
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,240
And I'm not talking from an airy, fairy side.

1174
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:37,900
It's tangible.

1175
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:41,100
Just like when you feel infatuated with someone

1176
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,960
and you see them, you get that tangible rise,

1177
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,300
that warm rise in your body.

1178
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:48,520
Okay, how many people get that when they eat food?

1179
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:49,700
Very few.

1180
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:51,800
As a matter of fact, if you're American, probably never.

1181
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:52,980
Yeah, right.

1182
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:56,060
But if you do the Lundberg rice, the organic short grain,

1183
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,940
do the short grain because it's wetter,

1184
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:00,820
and steam some veg, however, organic food,

1185
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:03,060
do that for a week and you'll see what I'm talking about.

1186
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,560
If you've ever done any kind of drugs that make you feel good,

1187
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:07,620
that's how you're going to feel.

1188
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:08,740
But you'll have all the energy

1189
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:11,740
and all the cognitive ability and focus, right,

1190
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:13,100
where drugs take away.

1191
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:16,660
I think we've gone into, you know, around musicians,

1192
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:17,880
everybody got high.

1193
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:19,080
We did a recording session.

1194
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,500
That was the best session we ever did.

1195
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:22,000
The next day we listened to it, guess what?

1196
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:23,620
It sounded like crap.

1197
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:24,720
Nothing good, yeah.

1198
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:26,460
So what the hell was going on?

1199
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,320
You thought it was the best while you were high.

1200
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,720
You see, but here, when you get high off of the food

1201
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:31,940
and the water that you drink,

1202
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:36,440
your cognitive ability and your perception,

1203
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:37,440
your awareness and all that,

1204
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,580
will be truly in this reality.

1205
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:41,640
You'll be taking responsibility in this reality

1206
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,440
and be very focused and alert,

1207
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:44,380
and it will be better.

1208
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:45,300
Okay.

1209
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:47,280
If you can operate in that range

1210
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:51,740
and think about the time before you came to this world,

1211
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:54,540
you will not get any kind of a clear thought,

1212
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,680
but you will feel like you've been here before,

1213
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:57,840
not here this earth,

1214
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:01,080
but something is going on that you're not privy to

1215
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,900
in a secure way, not an insecure way.

1216
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:08,340
You see, there's two ways to approach an unknown.

1217
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:10,760
One is from fear and insecurity,

1218
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,780
and the other one is from a security and comfortable way, right?

1219
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:15,020
The same thing, right?

1220
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,840
So if you can get yourself your physical system

1221
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:21,120
or your physical station, your body,

1222
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:21,920
and a high thing,

1223
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,860
and there's other ways to do it, by the way.

1224
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:26,600
If you live near a fishing village

1225
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,080
and you just ate small fish,

1226
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:31,400
fish that was less than a foot long,

1227
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,320
just soak it after the fish has been cleaned,

1228
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:35,840
soak it in salt water for a few hours

1229
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,940
and eat that with some veg,

1230
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:39,440
you know, some local food.

1231
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:42,400
Just do some local high energy food for a week

1232
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,000
and you will start to see you've been here,

1233
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:49,020
something's going on that you're not made privy to, right?

1234
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:50,060
That's where these questions are,

1235
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:52,680
what happens after death or what happens after life, okay?

1236
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,260
That's all I can say about death

1237
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:57,980
is the consciousness that you have in this 3D reality

1238
00:56:57,980 --> 00:56:59,100
will cease to exist,

1239
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:01,760
but that doesn't mean your consciousness ceases to exist.

1240
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,900
That bumps right away into the subject of reincarnation.

1241
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,300
When people ask me,

1242
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:09,500
is there reincarnation in Greek,

1243
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:10,460
right away I say no.

1244
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:11,440
Why?

1245
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:12,820
Why?

1246
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:14,880
Because if I say yes,

1247
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:17,760
they're going to think that I'm giving them approval

1248
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,880
for all the BS that they've heard about reincarnation before,

1249
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:22,960
and if I hear them talking about reincarnation,

1250
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:23,800
I'm like, where'd you get that?

1251
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:24,320
That's bullshit.

1252
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:26,760
They'll say, well, Greek, you said you believe in reincarnation.

1253
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:28,020
You see?

1254
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:28,520
Right.

1255
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:29,640
Right?

1256
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,040
So what I have to do

1257
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,920
is when I hear these things that I assess

1258
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,360
that where they're getting their information from

1259
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:40,160
is not a good thing to, what do you call it,

1260
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:40,880
give approval to,

1261
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:41,520
I just say no.

1262
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:42,420
Like, are we in a simulation?

1263
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:43,260
No, we're not.

1264
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:43,960
Of course we are.

1265
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:44,820
But I say no.

1266
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:46,040
Right?

1267
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,040
Because they're going to, you see?

1268
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:48,540
Because if they say yes,

1269
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:50,360
they're going to attach it to all the,

1270
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,800
you know, was 9-11 an inside job?

1271
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:53,280
No.

1272
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:54,520
And here's the thing,

1273
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:55,520
when somebody asks...

1274
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:56,740
If I say yes, they're going to listen to...

1275
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:57,160
Right, right.

1276
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:57,660
No, I get it.

1277
00:57:57,660 --> 00:57:59,720
But, you know, when somebody asks about death, though,

1278
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,260
they're generally not thinking backwards

1279
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:03,860
to what was before this time

1280
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:05,520
when they are in this conscious state.

1281
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:06,420
They're not thinking about that.

1282
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:07,000
It's the same.

1283
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,400
We just started off by saying the circle.

1284
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:10,280
You said the circle.

1285
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:10,980
When you crawl,

1286
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:12,940
you're peeing and pooping and crawling.

1287
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:14,120
Guess what happened in the beginning?

1288
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:15,360
Guess what happens in the end?

1289
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:16,640
So, okay.

1290
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,740
You're crawling, peeing, and pooping.

1291
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,180
Yeah, no, I just want to make it clear

1292
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:21,300
that what you're saying is

1293
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,880
that it is the same as it was before

1294
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:25,000
as it will be after

1295
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,320
is what you're getting to.

1296
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,420
Yeah, there's no consciousness

1297
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,480
within this 3D realm.

1298
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:30,920
Let's call it density.

1299
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:32,100
Okay.

1300
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:33,800
And this is where it gets complicated

1301
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:34,720
with reincarnation.

1302
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:36,480
The reason I say no with reincarnation

1303
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,220
is very simple.

1304
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:39,160
It's because the people...

1305
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:40,300
How many times do you hear these idiots

1306
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:41,800
on the internet or whatever write books?

1307
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:43,840
You know, I was Einstein.

1308
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:45,860
This is a current person.

1309
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:46,760
I used to be Einstein.

1310
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:48,760
And before that, I was whatever.

1311
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,700
And before that, this linear...

1312
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:51,600
And I was Joan of Arc.

1313
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:53,720
Yeah, and it's linear.

1314
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:54,660
They're going back.

1315
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:55,260
I said, bullshit.

1316
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:56,200
That's not how it works.

1317
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:57,020
Time is not linear.

1318
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:00,040
The people...

1319
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,240
By the way, no one's talking about this,

1320
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:02,960
so I'm going to say it.

1321
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:05,260
If you hear this, it's the real deal,

1322
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,540
not because I'm saying it.

1323
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,320
If you die now,

1324
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:10,260
you can possibly be reincarnated

1325
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:11,760
in ancient Rome.

1326
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:12,780
Well, I agree.

1327
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:14,000
That doesn't make any sense

1328
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,940
because ancient Rome already happened.

1329
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:17,200
No, no.

1330
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:19,000
See, now, here's another thing

1331
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:19,920
that's incorrect, too.

1332
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:22,020
I'll tell you that if you don't hear it,

1333
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:22,980
it's also wrong.

1334
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,240
You could already be here now.

1335
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,080
In other words,

1336
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:31,500
it is possible that you could encounter

1337
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,080
your reincarnated self tomorrow.

1338
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:37,200
Yeah, that's possible.

1339
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,080
Yeah, exactly.

1340
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:39,460
That's if the loops cross

1341
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:40,600
just like the infinity symbol.

1342
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:41,340
You know how it crosses.

1343
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:42,880
That's what makes it the number eight.

1344
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:44,060
But that's more...

1345
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,380
If you want to get into that, we can,

1346
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:47,420
but that's skipping a lot.

1347
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:49,660
Okay, I'm not trying to just skip around.

1348
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:50,520
I'm just saying that

1349
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:51,680
that is another thing, though,

1350
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:52,880
to consider here.

1351
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:54,360
Yeah, they call them doppelgangers.

1352
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,060
In other words, it could be...

1353
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:57,500
That gets into the genotypes.

1354
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,520
There's only about 30 or 40 genotypes.

1355
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:02,280
You know how the genotype

1356
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:03,640
is also reflected spiritually?

1357
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:05,340
You know what Snoop Dogg looks like, right?

1358
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:06,040
Yeah, sure.

1359
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:07,860
Okay, I know a white guy

1360
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:09,160
looks exactly like Snoop Dogg,

1361
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:11,460
but he's got white person hair and all that,

1362
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:12,940
but he's exactly the same demeanor,

1363
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:13,840
speaks the same way,

1364
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:14,780
looks the same way.

1365
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:15,800
What are you talking about?

1366
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:16,680
One guy's black, one's...

1367
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:17,160
No, no, no.

1368
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:19,480
It's the same genotype set in there.

1369
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:19,820
Right.

1370
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:22,360
Cartoonists know genotypes, right?

1371
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:22,860
Of course.

1372
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:25,220
When a cartoonist draws a fat lady...

1373
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:26,180
Right, they have a style.

1374
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:28,480
It's a style in which it's like

1375
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,300
this is sort of the way it is presented

1376
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:30,980
in their particulars.

1377
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:32,580
It's a template, right.

1378
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:34,880
There's only a handful of templates of humans,

1379
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:36,880
and it looks like everybody's different.

1380
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,080
We are like snowflakes,

1381
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:39,140
and hopefully not.

1382
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:40,180
You know what I mean?

1383
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:41,160
Yeah, you're right.

1384
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:42,620
In the term that's being used,

1385
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:43,920
but yeah, everybody's a little different,

1386
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:45,460
but you're still part of the template.

1387
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,060
Even if you made muffins

1388
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:48,160
or bread out of a template,

1389
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:49,620
no two are still baked alike.

1390
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:50,620
I've been saying that...

1391
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:52,300
No, they're not exact, but...

1392
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:54,200
Exactly, but very similar templates.

1393
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:54,980
Yes, right.

1394
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:55,360
Exactly.

1395
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:56,780
That's what I was trying to get at.

1396
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:57,500
And the other thing is

1397
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:58,760
when people look at these pictures

1398
01:00:58,760 --> 01:00:59,160
and they go,

1399
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:00,460
look, okay,

1400
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,020
I'll give you a for instance

1401
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:03,480
that people have publicly looked at,

1402
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:04,620
and they take it the wrong way.

1403
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:06,320
Here's Brad Pitt, right?

1404
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:08,760
Okay, so we know what Brad Pitt looks like.

1405
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:09,040
Fine.

1406
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:10,500
Yeah, there's one in the 1800s.

1407
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,360
It looks just like him, right?

1408
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:11,780
Exactly.

1409
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:12,800
That's what I was going for.

1410
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:14,180
So you look at that,

1411
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:14,620
and people go,

1412
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:16,600
oh, does this mean that this is the real...

1413
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:17,120
Well...

1414
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:17,780
No, it's a template.

1415
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:18,780
It's a template.

1416
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:19,460
It's a template, right.

1417
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,420
There's only just so many...

1418
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:22,560
I call it genotype.

1419
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:23,340
Okay.

1420
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:26,280
So let's get back to the basics on this,

1421
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,720
on the time...

1422
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:28,880
Forget about the...

1423
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,660
You know, we got screwed up with timelines,

1424
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:31,760
the number line.

1425
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:32,800
Remember in elementary grade school?

1426
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:33,180
Oh, yeah.

1427
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:34,040
We had zero here,

1428
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:35,700
and they went backwards and forwards, right?

1429
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:35,960
Right.

1430
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:36,700
Why?

1431
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:38,180
They screwed us up.

1432
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:40,140
Periodic table is also screwed up,

1433
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:42,180
with all these boxes and stuff like that.

1434
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:42,580
Right, right.

1435
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:44,820
Get the elements out of the boxes, right?

1436
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:45,200
Right.

1437
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:47,240
Anyway, okay,

1438
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:48,480
so what's going on is this.

1439
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:48,780
I said,

1440
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,220
we're in this particular density.

1441
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:50,780
By the way,

1442
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:51,800
this is important.

1443
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,540
You know how they say space is a vacuum,

1444
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:55,860
and the Earth has an atmosphere?

1445
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:56,680
It's total bullshit,

1446
01:01:56,820 --> 01:01:59,060
because if you put a vacuum against an atmosphere,

1447
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,240
what's the vacuum going to do?

1448
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,460
Pull the atmosphere off the planet, isn't it?

1449
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,120
Yeah, the Earth,

1450
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:06,000
the atmosphere is actually in a vacuum,

1451
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:07,880
and the space is the opposite of a vacuum.

1452
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,660
It's a very high pressure, ethereally.

1453
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,600
Well, we could go back to the car tire thing.

1454
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:11,880
Look,

1455
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:13,540
if you have...

1456
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:14,760
The only reason why

1457
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:17,780
the air is not rushing out of the car tire

1458
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:18,820
is because of the barrier.

1459
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:20,300
So...

1460
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:20,720
Structure, yeah.

1461
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:22,260
The structure itself holds it together.

1462
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:22,440
Yeah,

1463
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,060
and when you have two different pressures,

1464
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:24,940
you need a barrier.

1465
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:26,180
So the barrier is ethereal,

1466
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,860
but it works on a fourth plane.

1467
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:28,180
You know,

1468
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:28,960
when you look at it,

1469
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:30,820
going back to what they showed us in school,

1470
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,320
they screwed us up with a number line,

1471
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:32,900
not timeline,

1472
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:33,760
they do number lines.

1473
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:34,540
Number line, right.

1474
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:35,480
They get on the chalk,

1475
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:36,340
we had a blackboard,

1476
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,720
and she made a line and a zero.

1477
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:39,900
Well, here's zero in the middle,

1478
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:40,860
and then when you go this way,

1479
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:41,820
it becomes minus one,

1480
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:42,300
minus two,

1481
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:42,840
and you go that way.

1482
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:43,180
Yeah, why?

1483
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:44,640
It doesn't work that way.

1484
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,060
Why, you know, so...

1485
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:47,060
Okay, so...

1486
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:49,920
You have the X, Y, Z axis, right?

1487
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:52,660
So the X is the horizontal,

1488
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:53,980
the Y is the vertical,

1489
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:55,640
and the Z goes through the page.

1490
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:56,220
Right.

1491
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:57,400
All right, so that means, you know,

1492
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:59,000
they're trying to end measurement, right?

1493
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:00,620
So X, Y, what comes after Z?

1494
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:02,380
You have to start all over with A.

1495
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:04,940
And I'm recapping a discussion I had

1496
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:05,820
with someone recently.

1497
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:08,460
That's why I spell ether with an A.

1498
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:10,720
A-E-T-H-E-R,

1499
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:11,720
not just the E-T.

1500
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:13,100
It's the old way of spelling it.

1501
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:13,460
Okay.

1502
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:14,420
That's why I spell ether with an A,

1503
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:16,540
because it comes after Z.

1504
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:17,720
A comes after Z.

1505
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:18,540
Okay.

1506
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,240
The A, the ether dimension,

1507
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:24,060
is around each one of the X, Y, Z,

1508
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:24,780
like a bubble,

1509
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:27,420
and those, when you draw something,

1510
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:28,820
there's a bubble around each axis,

1511
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:30,060
and there's a bubble around that,

1512
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:31,080
and there's a bubble around that,

1513
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:32,020
and a bubble around that,

1514
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:33,400
and that's how you form your vacuums.

1515
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:37,040
Okay, so each bubble is increasing in density

1516
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:38,960
as it gets thinner ethereally,

1517
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:41,900
but decreasing in density materially

1518
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:42,880
as it gets thinner.

1519
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:43,340
You see?

1520
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:43,920
Obviously.

1521
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:45,160
If you said,

1522
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:47,120
hey, why did you thin out that paint so much?

1523
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:48,700
Right?

1524
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:49,920
It's weaker.

1525
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:50,640
It's weak, right?

1526
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:51,820
If I say I thinned out the paint,

1527
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:53,120
it looks like nothing, right?

1528
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:54,460
If it's too thick,

1529
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:55,760
it's much heavier materially.

1530
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:57,700
So it's the opposite.

1531
01:03:57,820 --> 01:03:58,780
When you have a heavy ether,

1532
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:00,620
it's a very thin material,

1533
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:01,820
heavy material,

1534
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:02,780
very thin ether.

1535
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:05,280
That's why the crystals get very dense.

1536
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:06,940
They act the way they do.

1537
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:09,640
Okay, so once you get a hang

1538
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:11,220
of these different densities

1539
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:13,180
and how these things interplay,

1540
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,820
when you hit a tuning fork,

1541
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:16,660
it's in time.

1542
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:19,020
Once the impact is made,

1543
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:20,400
it's at its highest amplitude,

1544
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:22,140
and as time goes down,

1545
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:23,900
it gets quieter and quieter, right?

1546
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:24,340
Right.

1547
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:26,320
But if you put that tuning fork aside,

1548
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:27,120
even a day later,

1549
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:27,700
I'm telling you,

1550
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:28,560
it's still oscillating.

1551
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:29,360
You can't hear it,

1552
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:30,140
but there are instruments,

1553
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:31,320
if you don't touch it,

1554
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:32,700
that still show you

1555
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:33,720
that it's still being affected

1556
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:35,420
from when you hit it a day ago, right?

1557
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:36,240
Okay.

1558
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:39,520
Okay, so we're in this density right now,

1559
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,000
this progressive that we see

1560
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,040
or are taught to see linear,

1561
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,700
and the Roman times,

1562
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:47,140
2,000 years ago, let's say,

1563
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:48,140
already happened.

1564
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:50,160
It was still on the earth,

1565
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:51,060
but I'm not talking about

1566
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:52,320
if you go look at the Colosseum,

1567
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:53,600
how it's in ruins and all that.

1568
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:53,940
By the way,

1569
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:54,980
if all these things are so important,

1570
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:56,420
why are they left in ruins, right?

1571
01:04:56,940 --> 01:04:57,320
But anyway,

1572
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:02,200
if you go back to that time now,

1573
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:04,480
it's going to be a faded memory

1574
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:05,500
that still exists

1575
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:06,940
and is still resonating,

1576
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:08,680
but it's so fine,

1577
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:10,780
there is no material counterpart.

1578
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,420
That's what you get reincarnated in,

1579
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:14,640
but when you're in it,

1580
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:16,520
as of that material,

1581
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:17,580
that ultra-fine material,

1582
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,780
you don't see that you're in a fine material.

1583
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:23,180
It's just a regular normal world

1584
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:23,980
like it is here,

1585
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:25,720
but you don't see the difference in density

1586
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:26,900
because that's all you know.

1587
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:28,240
Well, if you're in tune with it,

1588
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:29,780
wouldn't it mean that you're...

1589
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:30,920
Everything's normal.

1590
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:32,860
...experiencing it in time.

1591
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:33,580
In other words,

1592
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:35,680
since you're...

1593
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:38,300
I guess I had the right word to begin with.

1594
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:39,520
If you're in tune with it,

1595
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:41,340
then it does appear quite normal

1596
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:43,100
because that's where you're at.

1597
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:44,300
If you're resonating...

1598
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:46,560
because everything is the same.

1599
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:47,660
Okay.

1600
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:48,880
Everything's in the same frequency

1601
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:49,840
or in the same realm

1602
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:50,820
or the same density,

1603
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:52,600
so you don't know any different.

1604
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:54,160
You're not a fish out of water.

1605
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:54,980
You know what I mean?

1606
01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:55,540
Well, no.

1607
01:05:55,580 --> 01:05:56,400
There's no contrast.

1608
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:59,540
You're not taking your different density

1609
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:01,140
and introducing it into that.

1610
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:02,380
You're introducing it...

1611
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:06,020
You're introduced into it in that same...

1612
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:06,480
Yeah.

1613
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:07,700
The problem is...

1614
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:09,320
The problem is now...

1615
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:10,640
Once you understand...

1616
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:13,360
This goes into time manipulation.

1617
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:14,560
If you ask people,

1618
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:16,100
what do you want?

1619
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:17,660
We want a time machine.

1620
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:19,920
When do you want it?

1621
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:22,520
Irrelevant, right?

1622
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:24,040
So it doesn't matter

1623
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:26,000
when a time machine is invented, does it?

1624
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,040
That means that if a time machine

1625
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:29,860
is invented a million years in the future,

1626
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:30,920
can they affect us?

1627
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:32,760
Probability says yes.

1628
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:33,200
Yeah.

1629
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:34,520
So we're all being manipulated.

1630
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:37,940
Now, a time machine has to take in accordance

1631
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:40,340
this very fine resonance of things that passed

1632
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:41,440
that are still resonating,

1633
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:43,280
and if you're going to send, let's say,

1634
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:44,520
you and I in the time machine

1635
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:45,700
to go back into ancient Rome,

1636
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:47,280
we can't go as a solid form.

1637
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:49,300
Our consciousness has to be put into

1638
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:51,020
a very fine resonant body

1639
01:06:51,020 --> 01:06:52,700
that resonates with that past residue.

1640
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:53,960
Right.

1641
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:55,280
We would have to be...

1642
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:56,940
In order to even see it,

1643
01:06:57,020 --> 01:06:58,640
in order to experience it...

1644
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:00,320
...we would have to be in...

1645
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:00,960
In the ether.

1646
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:02,420
It would be in ethereal...

1647
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:03,160
Ethereal, right.

1648
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:05,960
...in ethereal Rome compared to this one,

1649
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:07,080
but when you're there,

1650
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:09,020
it's just as solid as it is here.

1651
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:10,840
It might even be more solid

1652
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:12,720
from an ethereal point of view

1653
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,180
because the ethereal would be more density,

1654
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:14,880
more dense,

1655
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,640
just like if you go into the past,

1656
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:18,960
they dig up these cities

1657
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,900
and they're three-, four-story buildings, right?

1658
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:23,600
And they're using two-by-fours

1659
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:25,360
as joists and rafters.

1660
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:27,160
You know, if you look at a joist and rafter

1661
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:28,440
in a two- or three-story building,

1662
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:30,180
they're like two-by-eights, two-by-twelves,

1663
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:31,520
you know, pretty big timber, you know,

1664
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:32,040
to put a floor.

1665
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:32,420
Okay.

1666
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:34,300
How the hell were they using two-by-,

1667
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:35,760
you know, very skinny pieces of wood

1668
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:36,560
to make a floor?

1669
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:38,620
Because the gravity was different.

1670
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:39,320
Mm-hmm.

1671
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:40,560
You didn't need...

1672
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:42,020
If you ever look at how fine

1673
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:45,340
these Egyptian Second and Third Dynasty

1674
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:46,820
chairs and chariots...

1675
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:47,620
You see the chariots,

1676
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:48,980
how fine they were built?

1677
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:50,460
You get an eight-year-old

1678
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:52,080
to jump up and down on a chariot

1679
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:52,580
from ancient Egypt,

1680
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:53,640
it'll break it.

1681
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:55,800
And people would say

1682
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:56,980
that that's because of time

1683
01:07:56,980 --> 01:07:57,680
and this and, you know,

1684
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:58,800
it wears out over time,

1685
01:07:58,920 --> 01:07:59,240
but that's not...

1686
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:00,400
It was made so finely made

1687
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,600
because things were very different back then,

1688
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:04,340
so we have that to contend with.

1689
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:05,440
Well, that's why you never notice

1690
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:06,460
there's never a roof

1691
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:08,940
on any of these structures they ever find.

1692
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:10,660
They never find the roof, right?

1693
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:13,880
Because I think the roof is made so light

1694
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:17,220
that it's, you know, it's scattered about

1695
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:17,779
and they don't need...

1696
01:08:17,779 --> 01:08:18,620
they can't find it.

1697
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:19,479
You know what I mean?

1698
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:20,439
Mm-hmm.

1699
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:22,859
Roof was very important

1700
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:24,859
even if you read in the New Testament.

1701
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:25,520
When you...

1702
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:26,120
Back in the day,

1703
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:28,720
buildings were put close together for safety

1704
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:31,040
from attack,

1705
01:08:31,319 --> 01:08:32,000
from animals,

1706
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:32,779
from whatever,

1707
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:34,899
and it was easier to build.

1708
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:37,140
If you wanted private time,

1709
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:37,960
you went up on the roof

1710
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:39,359
in ancient times.

1711
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:40,140
This was normal.

1712
01:08:40,279 --> 01:08:41,680
Just like in ancient times,

1713
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:42,399
if you went to a library,

1714
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:43,600
you read out loud in a booth.

1715
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:44,460
It wasn't like now,

1716
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:45,279
shh, be quiet.

1717
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:46,040
They expected you.

1718
01:08:46,899 --> 01:08:47,439
In ancient times,

1719
01:08:47,479 --> 01:08:48,180
you went to a library

1720
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:49,160
and took your reading material

1721
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:49,800
and sat in a booth

1722
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:52,100
and you weren't reading out loud

1723
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:53,040
to say something wrong.

1724
01:08:53,479 --> 01:08:53,939
Mm-hmm.

1725
01:08:53,979 --> 01:08:54,180
Right?

1726
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:56,000
So things were very, very different.

1727
01:08:56,540 --> 01:08:57,080
In ancient times,

1728
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:57,720
you wanted privacy,

1729
01:08:57,720 --> 01:08:58,140
you wanted...

1730
01:08:58,140 --> 01:08:59,620
So all roofs were decks

1731
01:08:59,620 --> 01:09:00,700
unless they were thatched

1732
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:01,819
and, you know,

1733
01:09:01,939 --> 01:09:02,380
gimballed,

1734
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:03,279
gabled,

1735
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:05,279
which means pitched.

1736
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:05,900
Right.

1737
01:09:06,020 --> 01:09:06,319
Okay.

1738
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:07,220
So now,

1739
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:08,439
can you be reincarnated

1740
01:09:08,439 --> 01:09:08,979
into the future?

1741
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:09,460
Certainly.

1742
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:10,279
Just like the past,

1743
01:09:10,359 --> 01:09:11,779
but it's a phase shift.

1744
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:14,240
Something that has happened

1745
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:15,920
that is in a very fine density

1746
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,180
that is different

1747
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:17,800
than something

1748
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:19,180
that hasn't happened yet

1749
01:09:19,180 --> 01:09:20,840
that is also in a fine density,

1750
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:22,740
but it's a phase shift.

1751
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:24,439
Once you understand

1752
01:09:24,439 --> 01:09:25,640
frequency modulation,

1753
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:27,160
pulse width modulation,

1754
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:28,340
all this other stuff,

1755
01:09:28,859 --> 01:09:30,060
how you increase power

1756
01:09:30,779 --> 01:09:31,800
and increase,

1757
01:09:32,020 --> 01:09:33,180
how would you say,

1758
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:33,840
manifestations

1759
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:35,899
by turning things on and off

1760
01:09:35,899 --> 01:09:36,859
or off or on,

1761
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:38,399
this is the technology

1762
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:39,939
that you put into a time machine.

1763
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:40,899
Now, is it possible

1764
01:09:40,899 --> 01:09:41,460
that someone

1765
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:43,300
that was living in ancient Rome

1766
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:44,260
that was supposed to

1767
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:45,479
come to this world

1768
01:09:45,479 --> 01:09:46,600
a hundred years from now

1769
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:47,800
is incarnated now

1770
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:48,979
and is really out of whack?

1771
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:51,500
I suppose, yeah.

1772
01:09:51,979 --> 01:09:52,399
Yeah.

1773
01:09:53,180 --> 01:09:53,480
Yeah.

1774
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:54,560
So anyway,

1775
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:58,600
I wanted to give this perspective

1776
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:01,020
of nonlinear time

1777
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:02,260
because all you hear

1778
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:02,700
about reincarnation

1779
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:04,520
is in linear, right?

1780
01:10:04,740 --> 01:10:04,840
Linear.

1781
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:05,640
It's always linear.

1782
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:06,560
I was this.

1783
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:07,600
I was that.

1784
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:08,600
And here's the problem.

1785
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:09,700
You could be again

1786
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:10,740
or you could be

1787
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:12,340
going backward, forward.

1788
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:13,220
That's irrelevant

1789
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:14,060
as to whether

1790
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:15,120
it's backward or forward.

1791
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:16,340
It's just a different phase.

1792
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:16,660
Yeah.

1793
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:17,680
If you have

1794
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:20,100
a good enough container body,

1795
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:21,360
like I gave the suggestions

1796
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:22,460
on what to do,

1797
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:24,540
and let's say,

1798
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:25,560
just give us,

1799
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,160
this is a scenario for a film

1800
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,800
or a TV show

1801
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:29,240
or whatever

1802
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:30,140
to entertain people.

1803
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:32,920
You have a very clear,

1804
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:33,800
confident thing

1805
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,060
that something is wrong.

1806
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:36,380
Like you're here.

1807
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:37,420
There's more to them

1808
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:38,380
just being here.

1809
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:38,760
By the way,

1810
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:39,780
that sounds very cliché.

1811
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:40,640
There's got to be more

1812
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:41,920
to this life, right?

1813
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:45,180
But you have enough intuition

1814
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:46,780
which you can't speak in words,

1815
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:48,300
use words to describe things

1816
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:49,320
that are not known,

1817
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:50,960
but you get a glimpse of them.

1818
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:54,580
Imagine then going

1819
01:10:54,580 --> 01:10:56,100
and searching an archaeological site

1820
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:57,420
in ancient Rome

1821
01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:00,640
and where a garbage dump

1822
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:01,240
is the best.

1823
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:02,600
A landfill, by the way.

1824
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:03,840
That's where you find

1825
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:04,800
the most interesting stuff.

1826
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:06,440
That's how you find out

1827
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:07,240
how a culture lives,

1828
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:07,720
by the way.

1829
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:08,840
If you want to know,

1830
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:11,320
if you go to a landfill

1831
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:11,780
right now

1832
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:13,320
and kept digging down,

1833
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:14,620
on the surface

1834
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:15,000
you would see

1835
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:15,960
the most recent stuff

1836
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:17,280
and go deep enough

1837
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:18,000
and stay long enough

1838
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:18,520
you'll see stuff

1839
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:19,720
from the 1950s, right?

1840
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:20,700
And it'll be very different, right?

1841
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:21,640
Sure, of course.

1842
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:23,580
If you examined all of it

1843
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:25,040
you'd get a very good cultural

1844
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:28,200
slice of what was going on

1845
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,180
and how things changed.

1846
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:30,600
So you go back,

1847
01:11:30,740 --> 01:11:32,180
you do an archaeological dig

1848
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:32,880
and then you go,

1849
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:33,840
just like the oil wells,

1850
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:34,900
you know how they drill them out

1851
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:35,400
and they're empty

1852
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:36,620
and they come back 30 years later

1853
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:37,380
and they're full again?

1854
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:38,040
Right?

1855
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:39,100
Because of the rock oil?

1856
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:39,560
Anyway.

1857
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:41,320
So you go back to an

1858
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:43,380
revisit an archaeological site

1859
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:46,780
and see if you have written

1860
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:47,920
a letter to yourself

1861
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:48,820
from ancient Rome

1862
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:49,640
that wasn't there

1863
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:50,500
before you knew

1864
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:52,120
about what I just said.

1865
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:54,460
You see the possibilities?

1866
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:55,180
Right.

1867
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:57,680
Because if you,

1868
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:58,940
let's say you live another

1869
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:00,620
5 or 10 or 20 or 30 years,

1870
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:01,800
which most of us are not,

1871
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:03,020
believe it or not,

1872
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:06,480
and you're reincarnated

1873
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:07,340
in ancient Rome,

1874
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:08,580
right?

1875
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:10,320
You could find that letter

1876
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:11,000
at any time,

1877
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:12,080
but it may not show up

1878
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:12,960
within the consciousness

1879
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:14,160
that you have right now

1880
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:15,500
because you're not looking for it.

1881
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:17,060
How many times have people

1882
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:18,020
not seen something

1883
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:20,660
because they're not looking for it?

1884
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:22,260
All the time.

1885
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:24,060
Unless you're specific,

1886
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:25,000
that goes again

1887
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,180
back to the reality responsibility.

1888
01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:29,940
Are you responsible for the reality

1889
01:12:29,940 --> 01:12:31,880
that you're aware of?

1890
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:32,420
Well, look,

1891
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,240
if at some point

1892
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:35,180
I went back in time

1893
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:37,920
and placed a letter to myself,

1894
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:38,580
as you said,

1895
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:40,020
and buried it in a box,

1896
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:41,060
you know,

1897
01:12:41,140 --> 01:12:42,840
two yards from where I'm sitting

1898
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:43,880
right now outside,

1899
01:12:44,620 --> 01:12:44,900
right?

1900
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,740
And I did that intentionally.

1901
01:12:46,740 --> 01:12:47,820
If I'm not looking for it,

1902
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:48,560
I don't know it's there.

1903
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:49,260
It could be there

1904
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:50,120
and it could be there

1905
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:51,280
a hundred years from now, too.

1906
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:53,800
Yeah, that's right,

1907
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:56,260
because it would probably be in code

1908
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:56,900
and you wouldn't have

1909
01:12:56,900 --> 01:12:57,640
the same intent,

1910
01:12:58,140 --> 01:12:59,000
which is another thing,

1911
01:12:59,020 --> 01:12:59,640
another quick thing

1912
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:00,240
I want to bring up.

1913
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:01,220
Let's get off this subject.

1914
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:03,280
At least we gave an injection

1915
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:04,240
on the subject.

1916
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:05,620
There's a lot more to talk about.

1917
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:09,180
And I think someone brought up

1918
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:13,140
Ibrahim Karim's stuff on bio.

1919
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:14,060
Are you familiar, Chuck,

1920
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:15,360
with the biogeometry symbols?

1921
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:15,680
You know,

1922
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:16,860
they do work, by the way,

1923
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:17,520
most of them.

1924
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:18,700
Are you familiar with them?

1925
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:20,300
I know very little about this.

1926
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:21,040
Okay, that's fine.

1927
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:22,520
You're aware that they exist?

1928
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:22,840
Yes.

1929
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:23,720
Okay.

1930
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:25,120
I had a conversation,

1931
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:26,440
a very short conversation.

1932
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:28,200
I sent him a Skype request

1933
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:29,140
about ten years ago

1934
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:29,700
and he answered it

1935
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:30,440
and I called him.

1936
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:31,400
And I said,

1937
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:31,640
yeah,

1938
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,320
and I brought someone else on

1939
01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:35,980
as well.

1940
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:37,880
And he does,

1941
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:39,560
I was interested in the health symbols

1942
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:39,980
he did,

1943
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:42,000
and if you're familiar

1944
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,420
with the way he does symbols,

1945
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:44,980
he looks at the function

1946
01:13:44,980 --> 01:13:45,980
of whatever he wants

1947
01:13:45,980 --> 01:13:47,060
to make a symbol for

1948
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:48,960
and then through his intent

1949
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:51,540
does an abstract of the function

1950
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:52,180
through the symbol

1951
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:53,040
and how it's drawn

1952
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:54,060
and all that's very important.

1953
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:55,320
The pen should never be lifted

1954
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:56,000
off the page,

1955
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:56,780
yada yada, right?

1956
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:57,740
That kind of thing, right?

1957
01:13:57,960 --> 01:13:58,380
By the way,

1958
01:13:58,460 --> 01:13:58,580
you know,

1959
01:13:58,620 --> 01:13:59,100
when you're doing,

1960
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:00,840
if you're going to draw a sigil

1961
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:04,020
or do any kind of incantation,

1962
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:05,180
you don't lift the pen

1963
01:14:05,180 --> 01:14:06,100
off the page.

1964
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:07,160
Anyway,

1965
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:08,280
that's another thing.

1966
01:14:09,220 --> 01:14:10,260
That's why if you ever see

1967
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:11,320
like a real grimoire,

1968
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:12,080
it's one straight,

1969
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:13,080
the whole page is written

1970
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:13,720
with one line.

1971
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:15,020
There's no lifting the pen.

1972
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:16,560
I don't know

1973
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:17,380
if you've ever heard of that.

1974
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:17,940
Right,

1975
01:14:18,140 --> 01:14:18,260
no,

1976
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:19,160
you can tell.

1977
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:20,080
It looks very odd.

1978
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:20,720
It's all connected.

1979
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:21,560
that's why a lot of symbols

1980
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:23,120
are that way

1981
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:24,180
so you could lift the pen.

1982
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:24,940
In other words,

1983
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:25,800
the entire thought

1984
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:26,700
has to be complete.

1985
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:28,060
Cursive writing,

1986
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:28,740
curses,

1987
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:29,160
get it,

1988
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:29,640
cursive,

1989
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:30,120
curses,

1990
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:32,080
you know how you don't lift

1991
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:33,160
the pen off of each letter?

1992
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:33,720
Anyway,

1993
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:37,480
I gave him evidence

1994
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:38,840
that the heart

1995
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:39,880
is not a pump at all.

1996
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:41,340
That's why when people,

1997
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,280
it's a breaking mechanism, right?

1998
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:44,240
What moves the blood

1999
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:45,120
is the vacuum

2000
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:46,220
in the capillaries.

2001
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:48,020
When the energy

2002
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:48,680
in the body

2003
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:49,900
converts the nutrition

2004
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:51,740
into energy

2005
01:14:51,740 --> 01:14:53,100
and then into gas

2006
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:54,020
and then into liquid

2007
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:54,940
and solid, right?

2008
01:14:54,940 --> 01:14:55,840
Because in order to

2009
01:14:56,340 --> 01:14:57,600
replenish cells in the body,

2010
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:58,720
you need gas,

2011
01:14:58,800 --> 01:14:59,020
liquid,

2012
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:00,080
and solid, right?

2013
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:00,880
Liquid and solid

2014
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:01,640
are what most people

2015
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:01,980
think about.

2016
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:02,220
Well, there you go.

2017
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:03,300
And then you need valves

2018
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,100
to stop and start

2019
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:05,860
the flow of these things.

2020
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:07,600
The valves are there

2021
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:08,400
to regulate, yeah.

2022
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:09,020
And the heart,

2023
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:09,880
what it does is

2024
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:10,460
when all the,

2025
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:11,680
everything rushes,

2026
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:13,060
the heart is like a dam,

2027
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:14,440
like the Hoover Dam.

2028
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:15,400
Anyway,

2029
01:15:15,620 --> 01:15:16,860
he was not aware of this.

2030
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:17,700
He thought it was a pump.

2031
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:19,060
So he made his symbol

2032
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:20,720
like a pump.

2033
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:22,480
And he says

2034
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:23,260
he might change it.

2035
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:24,040
And he hasn't

2036
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:24,860
as far as I looked

2037
01:15:24,860 --> 01:15:25,620
a few years ago.

2038
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:27,280
So now I don't know

2039
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:27,800
how that's,

2040
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:28,420
if it's helping

2041
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:29,520
or messing people up

2042
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:30,920
because if you put an intent,

2043
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:32,380
an ethereal intent

2044
01:15:32,380 --> 01:15:33,260
that the heart is a pump,

2045
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:33,740
you're going to have

2046
01:15:33,740 --> 01:15:35,280
heart problems, you know,

2047
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:36,060
because it's not intended

2048
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:36,660
to be a pump.

2049
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:37,660
It doesn't work like a pump.

2050
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:38,620
No one's ever proven

2051
01:15:38,620 --> 01:15:39,320
that it's a pump.

2052
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:41,200
Don't listen to

2053
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:42,160
the medical community.

2054
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:43,480
Don't listen to anyone

2055
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:44,020
that says that

2056
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:44,860
they got an education

2057
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:45,840
more than the 8th grade

2058
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:46,460
that's valid.

2059
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:49,060
So.

2060
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:51,040
Anyway,

2061
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:52,360
what I wanted to just

2062
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:53,660
generally say about

2063
01:15:53,660 --> 01:15:54,540
the symbols

2064
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:55,620
and the intent

2065
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:56,020
and all that,

2066
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:57,100
we did a talk

2067
01:15:57,100 --> 01:15:58,260
on the corporate logos

2068
01:15:58,260 --> 01:15:59,160
and what they're doing

2069
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:00,240
with the corporate logos,

2070
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:00,500
right?

2071
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:01,980
The,

2072
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:02,820
what

2073
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:04,560
Abraham Cream

2074
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,000
is doing

2075
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:05,720
is very similar.

2076
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:07,140
So the intent

2077
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:07,960
that we went over

2078
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:08,880
on the corporate logos

2079
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:09,300
and all that

2080
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:09,840
is the same

2081
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:11,420
with the bio signatures

2082
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:12,260
that he calls them.

2083
01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:13,480
I just wanted to mention

2084
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:13,940
that as well.

2085
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:14,600
We did a lot,

2086
01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:15,660
we did a lot of talks

2087
01:16:15,660 --> 01:16:16,200
here tonight.

2088
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:16,900
What do you think?

2089
01:16:19,350 --> 01:16:19,950
Yeah, I think,

2090
01:16:20,170 --> 01:16:21,210
I think we covered a lot.

2091
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:22,730
Went around

2092
01:16:23,310 --> 01:16:24,010
time and,

2093
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:25,390
you know.

2094
01:16:25,390 --> 01:16:25,690
Oh yeah,

2095
01:16:25,990 --> 01:16:26,270
yes,

2096
01:16:26,430 --> 01:16:28,410
it was a grab bag

2097
01:16:29,190 --> 01:16:29,590
potluck.

2098
01:16:30,010 --> 01:16:30,410
Potpourri,

2099
01:16:30,610 --> 01:16:31,130
