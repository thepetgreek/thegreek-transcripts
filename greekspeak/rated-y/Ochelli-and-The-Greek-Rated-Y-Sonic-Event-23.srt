1
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,540
Sonic Event 23, Ocelli in the Greek.

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,300
So I do that at the beginning, I'm not sure if I really need to, but I guess I should

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,140
mark the occasion.

4
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:22,080
Anyway, I'm here with the Greek as per usual, because otherwise it wouldn't be Ocelli in

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:22,340
the Greek.

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,220
Simple things to be pointed out, right?

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,640
Occasionally.

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:28,720
Occasionally.

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,780
You know, I want to start with the chat, but I don't know if I should.

10
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:38,240
I saw something mentioned about water and things like that, I don't know if that's what's

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:38,540
on your mind.

12
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:43,040
Yeah, so I said, let's just start recording, we'll call this shoot the shit.

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,740
Shoot the shit, number 23.

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,740
Yeah, so in the chat, yeah, it's pretty responsive.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,840
Sometimes I'll get on there, it'll just be one.

16
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,380
Sometimes I'll get on there, it'll be nine.

17
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,520
So it's getting some activity, it's a good place to...

18
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,100
It's like the suggestion box, you know?

19
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,360
Right, and if you're listening to this and you haven't been there, by the way, all you

20
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:07,720
got to do is scroll down and toward the bottom of the page where I put the playlist all together,

21
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,420
you'll see that there is a chat box there, and it's a Chatango box.

22
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,360
You don't need to sign up if you don't want to.

23
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,680
You can go in there anonymously if you like, but yeah, people are communicating right there

24
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,820
about these sonics specifically.

25
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:21,880
So there you go.

26
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,060
Yeah, yeah.

27
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,180
Wasn't the one that you...

28
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,540
Bring up some, let's see what you got.

29
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,920
What caught your eye, so to speak?

30
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,860
Well, what caught my attention was somebody was talking about the water and magnets, and

31
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,000
they had gotten, I don't know, magnets out of a speaker.

32
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,360
You had brought that up on a previous sonic.

33
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,740
So I don't know if...

34
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,800
That was my first thought, actually, is that's usually where I find magnets around the house,

35
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:43,620
just laying around.

36
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,180
You know, what about the magnets that are in speakers?

37
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,540
Did you communicate with that guy about that?

38
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,500
Yeah, Vandy, I did drop a message back.

39
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,420
He's using eight small magnets.

40
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,460
I guess they're stacked.

41
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,040
I don't know.

42
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,160
See, if they're stacked, it's not going to work too well.

43
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,660
If they're each separate, it'll work much better.

44
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,500
So he didn't say if he stacked them or had them in series.

45
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,900
But the key with the magnetic water is it's not really even magnetic water.

46
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,960
I think we went over it on a sonic before.

47
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,520
The monkey human is easily fooled.

48
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,440
So you get a magnet, and I'll just do a quick recap here.

49
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,800
And boom, this side sticks to the fridge real strong, or metal, and the other side does

50
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,020
too.

51
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,640
But when we put these two magnets together, they repel, and then when we turn them around,

52
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,480
they stick together.

53
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,800
Wow, that's really a strong magnet.

54
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,800
That's a weak magnet.

55
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,040
Oh, look at what magnets can do, right?

56
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,280
That's the typical...

57
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,600
That's about...

58
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,180
This attitude that I just mentioned, this perception, is you'll get all the way up to

59
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,900
university and research labs, too, everything I just told you.

60
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,740
So they say, oh, we can magnetically treat water.

61
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,380
So they take...

62
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,600
Oh, where's the magnet that's so strong?

63
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,760
Get the strong magnet, Jack.

64
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,500
Get the strong one.

65
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,520
Not the weak one.

66
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,660
Okay, here, it's really strong.

67
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,640
Boom, sticks, pulls it off a piece of metal.

68
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,220
And the side that's sticking to the metal, let's say, he's putting it on the water pipe.

69
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:02,760
Wrong.

70
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,040
Yeah, but see, there's nothing beyond the...

71
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,660
When you're about nine years old, right, and you're in grade school, you're in about the

72
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:15,580
third grade or so, you play with magnets like this, and that's about as far as it goes, to

73
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:15,740
be honest.

74
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,280
Well, they get fooled.

75
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,340
They get fooled.

76
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,640
Yeah, what sticks to it?

77
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,220
What doesn't?

78
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:19,920
What's strong?

79
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,500
What's not?

80
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,960
And that's about it.

81
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,040
I mean, you've never really experienced.

82
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,440
There's that lady, she went to live with the gorillas, and they were always hiding out,

83
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,620
and she took her...

84
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,960
Jane Goodall was her name, I think.

85
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:31,800
I think so.

86
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,160
Yeah.

87
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:36,760
She took a silver bracelet that she had, or a watch, really shiny, and she hung it from

88
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:42,220
a tree branch in an opening, and the gorillas were like, oh, look at that, right?

89
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,280
That's what people are doing with magnets.

90
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:51,820
So what we've discovered, the corporate we, collective we, is that between the two poles,

91
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,020
by the way, magnets do not attract or repel.

92
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,800
That is a vortex, like a screw going through the magnet, right?

93
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,240
So if you spin a globe looking from the top down, it looks counterclockwise, but same

94
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,280
spin direction.

95
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,420
If you look from underneath, it looks clockwise.

96
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,440
It depends on which angle you're viewing that screwing action, right?

97
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,760
It's a vortex that goes right through the magnet.

98
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,220
And by the way, magnets don't...

99
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:20,320
The poles, opposite poles do not attract, because if that were true, if you're holding

100
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,040
a bar magnet, let's say, or a round magnet in your hand, and the poles are attracting

101
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,760
to each other, they would do it already on the magnet, and there would be no magnetism

102
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,140
ever, right?

103
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,800
They would just come together internally.

104
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,540
Why do they need another magnet, you see?

105
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,580
So all this basic stuff, if you want to hear about someone who's more sarcastic, is a lot

106
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:45,140
fatter than me, and has got tattoos, not like me, I have no tattoos, Ken Wheeler.

107
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,420
Ken Wheeler on YouTube.

108
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,640
I don't endorse everything he says, but I endorse his magnetic stuff mostly.

109
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,500
I've always been saying similar things, but his experimentation and point of view, if

110
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,540
he can handle it, is worth a while.

111
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,660
But there's something between the poles where nothing...

112
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,200
If you put it against the fridge, it doesn't want to go there, right?

113
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:09,760
Right.

114
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,300
It doesn't stick.

115
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,460
That's called the block wall.

116
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:15,240
Where it doesn't attract or repel, that's where you want the water to pass.

117
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,680
But what's interesting is now we've developed another way to do it, if you don't have a

118
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,580
round magnet, using any shape magnet in a star configuration.

119
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,320
It's like a daisy chain, and what you basically do is you lay all the magnets out so they're

120
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,000
all attracting to each other, and then you spread them out, so nothing really...

121
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,700
If you put it on a refrigerator, nothing will stick to it, and the water pipe goes right

122
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,140
through that.

123
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:42,500
It's just basically daisy chaining, shorting out the magnetic field.

124
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,140
I know the best way to do this is with pictures.

125
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:51,820
I found that no matter how descriptive I get, people still need pictures to a certain

126
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,220
degree.

127
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:58,220
I do, but when you look at a piece of land, they have the blueprint or the plot on a drawing,

128
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,740
but they also have what's called the legal description.

129
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,700
Oh, how boring.

130
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,240
You ever read one of those legal descriptions, starting from the west-east corner of here,

131
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,500
going to the north-south corner there, and it's so boring.

132
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:15,100
It tells you about the orientation, the actual pitch, here's the angle from this and that.

133
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:23,480
Yeah, but if you read all that, a paragraph of describing the land's location on the

134
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:29,040
earth, it's boring as hell, but if you set your mind to it, you can put those words into

135
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,280
action.

136
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:36,660
That's why, for example, I tell people, people like studying the Bible, I say, look, you

137
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,280
go on the internet.

138
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,920
There's not one image of what the seven-branch lampstand or the Ark of the Covenant on the

139
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,360
internet images that is accurate.

140
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,100
Not a one.

141
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:44,760
Not one.

142
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:50,840
I tell people the way you do that is you get an eight-year-old with a pencil, and you read

143
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,700
the part where it tells you what the lampstand should look like or the Ark of the Covenant

144
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,780
should look like.

145
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:01,240
I said an eight-year-old because that's all you require in terms of education level, which

146
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,280
would be third grade or such.

147
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,320
While you're reading how these things should be made and what they should look like, start

148
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,420
sketching it out.

149
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:14,160
When you're done with your sketch, and by the way, if whoever is sketching the description

150
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,800
that you're reading for the Ark of the Covenant or the seven-branch lampstand, whoever's

151
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,840
sketching it, anywhere in the world, you get a hundred people, as long as they can sketch

152
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:28,280
and do what it says in terms of description, and you've finished, all the sketches will

153
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:34,800
look very similar, by the way, but nothing like what the images they show you in religions.

154
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,040
Not at all.

155
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:43,580
This is a major problem here with descriptions and attitudes.

156
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,020
What I mean by attitude is, you see the magnet's really strong this way, so that's where we

157
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,100
should put the water, right?

158
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,000
No.

159
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,720
No.

160
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,140
That's not how it works.

161
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:00,180
I'm not sure, again, going back to the chat, the orientation, it's got eight 20-millimeter

162
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:00,720
magnets.

163
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,540
Are they stacked?

164
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,300
Are they separate?

165
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:02,860
I don't know.

166
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,380
We'll leave that at best.

167
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,000
I wrote the, if you stack them, I'm presuming they're stacked, what happens when you start

168
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,300
stacking magnets, they get a little stronger, but that block wall, instead of it being an

169
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,720
inertial plane through the middle, starts to spiral and get away from the center and

170
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,240
spread out.

171
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,700
You don't want to stack them more than two or three, three or five.

172
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,180
By the way, when you're doing magnets, odd numbers, please.

173
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,880
Odd numbers, okay.

174
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,720
Don't stack two, stack three magnets, five magnets, seven magnets, why?

175
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,200
Because whenever you do an odd number stack, you're always going to have a center one.

176
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,080
Let's say you do seven magnets, right?

177
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,260
You're going to have a center magnet, the fourth one, and you're going to have three

178
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,560
on the left, three on the right, or three up, three down, right?

179
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,960
Or if it's five, you have two on the left, two on the right, or, yeah, gotcha, okay.

180
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:54,220
So on and so forth, so you're always going to get a better energetic symmetry using odd

181
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:59,180
numbers whenever you're doing stuff, also with capacitors and inductors if you're doing

182
00:08:59,180 --> 00:08:59,760
circuitry.

183
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:10,000
Anyway, yeah, so the magnetic water is quite, it's not magnetic water because if you're

184
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,980
eluding, meaning avoiding what they call a magnetic field, is it really magnetic water?

185
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:16,900
And actually, it's not.

186
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,580
What we're doing is taking advantage of the inertial plane, which is the main part of

187
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,920
the dielectric, has to do with potential.

188
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,500
We're using the maximum potential.

189
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:33,440
Potential is, it's taught, by the way, in rudimentary school, the physics, they do have

190
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,100
a proper description of it.

191
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,880
Potential is something's potential.

192
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,980
Shouldn't I use that word again to describe it, to define it?

193
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,900
No, it's what it could possibly exhibit, but it hasn't done it yet.

194
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,900
So when you're holding, let's say, a grenade, that's its maximum potential, but when you

195
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:57,000
explode the grenade or the fireworks, it has no potential, but most people will think that

196
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,160
explosion or the grenade exploding is the potential.

197
00:09:59,360 --> 00:09:59,860
No, no, no.

198
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:04,400
The potential is when it's sitting on your desk with the ring in it still, you know what

199
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:04,620
I mean?

200
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,540
Well, because it has the potential to do something else.

201
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,520
That's right.

202
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,760
Once it's been exploded, it's, yeah, prior, it's putting it in order.

203
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:17,580
So once it's done what it's done, then it's already done it, there's no potential left.

204
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,080
That's that.

205
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:18,260
Right.

206
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,920
It's like what's in stock.

207
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:25,420
You know, if you open a store and you've got, you know, the fridge is all full of beer,

208
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,980
you've got great potential.

209
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,520
But if you sold all the beer, now you've got no potential, right?

210
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,820
But you'd rather sell all the beer.

211
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:37,060
You saw people focus on the outcome more than the potential.

212
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,380
So what we're doing is chasing the potential energy and leaving it there.

213
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,560
And some real incredible stuff going on with it.

214
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,240
What, okay, before we get on to the next one, what happens is the actual total dissolved

215
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,420
solids goes down and the alkalinity starts to fluctuate.

216
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,380
Yeah.

217
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:00,580
Maybe we'll talk a little bit about transmutation and what's going on with certain things.

218
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,000
What else, what else caught you there on the chat?

219
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,080
Well, on the chat, there was also this discussion about two Adams.

220
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:12,380
Now, I mean, look, anybody who's, again, at that third grade level is probably familiar

221
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,760
with the story of Adam.

222
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,540
I mean, that's supposed to be the first man in quotes, right?

223
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,020
Well, sort of, sort of, it's, it's, it goes back and forth.

224
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,280
It's really a group of people called Adam.

225
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,080
You know, like, I don't know.

226
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,400
It's done.

227
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,700
If you're in England, you know, it's like, I feel like an Indian because Indian food

228
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,860
is their main thing because, you know, white people can't cook.

229
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:35,160
Oops.

230
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:35,960
Did I say that?

231
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:36,840
You did.

232
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:37,080
Oh, no.

233
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,120
Okay.

234
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,640
So they, they adopted a lot of these Northern countries.

235
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,860
Their main dishes are from the, where they colonized and brought over delicious food

236
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,360
and culture.

237
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:50,780
Yeah.

238
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,300
So, say, if I feel in India, let's say you want Indian food in England, they say, oh,

239
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,080
I could really feel like an Indian.

240
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,720
I could just murder one.

241
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,340
Well, so it's used in that sense, you know?

242
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,100
Well, in America, practically none of the cuisine in quotes is actually American in

243
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:09,920
its origin.

244
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,960
I mean, think about the most commonly consumed things.

245
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,040
They mess it up.

246
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,740
Like, pizza in America is not like pizza originally, but yeah.

247
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,300
But it was popularized here.

248
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:19,560
Yeah.

249
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,520
That's the thing, though.

250
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:25,460
It becomes popularized here, but it's not, it's not its point of origin, you know?

251
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,080
Right.

252
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,100
And the thing is, the thing is when you, when you imitate, you should do it better, not

253
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:30,820
degrade it.

254
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,040
That would be the best way to go.

255
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,380
Yeah.

256
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:33,740
I mean.

257
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,440
Yeah, because imitation is flattery.

258
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,660
They're not, it's not flatter.

259
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:41,720
American pizza is not, well, actually a lot of, if you go to Italy, a lot of people don't,

260
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,720
if you're raised on New York pizza, by the way, you're not going to like the pizza there

261
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,920
because they sell it in a bakery cold, you know, unless you go to a Napoli, which is a

262
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,500
different thing.

263
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:56,600
And I, by the way, I want to not talk about food, but I've perfected the Napoli pie.

264
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,500
And you don't have to use the special flour and all the special stuff.

265
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,380
It's a no need.

266
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,000
And you leave it alone and you just do it.

267
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,500
And it's just, yeah.

268
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,600
Best pizza.

269
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,320
I used to say, oh man, I want to go back east and get some pizza.

270
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:11,680
You know what?

271
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:16,880
I make the best pizza right here, right now, here in Tucson, not, I don't have to go to

272
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,620
New York for a slice.

273
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,280
I think I sent you some pictures of pies that I made here.

274
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,340
Yeah, they look great.

275
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,360
I mean, but I'm always thinking about, I want to go back to New York or New Jersey to get

276
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,640
some pizza because God, it's awful here.

277
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,420
If you buy something, somebody eats here.

278
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:30,720
But here's the thing.

279
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,960
I was like that up until about a year ago.

280
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:38,220
And I finally perfected the Napoli style, which is, it's very, very pillowy, soft with

281
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:38,960
a slight crunch.

282
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,300
When, if you remember the pizza in New York and Jersey, it's a little tough sometimes.

283
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,880
You got to pull on it, you know, and it has this high tension.

284
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:46,780
This is different.

285
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:52,460
This is the Napoli style and it's very different, but I've got a way to do it that is just killer.

286
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,200
And anyway, let's not get into the tangent on the food.

287
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:57,820
Well, yeah.

288
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,780
So what were we on?

289
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,360
Well, yeah.

290
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,840
We weren't on pizza.

291
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,540
We were on Adam, but that's okay.

292
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,640
We could, we could go.

293
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,180
That's what I thought.

294
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:05,720
Why not?

295
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,140
Right.

296
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,380
Well, here's the thing.

297
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:11,360
There's a real, real problem and I don't have a filter for this.

298
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,080
I used to.

299
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,940
I used to have a filter for it.

300
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:20,120
Anything that comes from churchianity or Christianity, I have, I take out a big hammer, you know,

301
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,800
the BFH, big fucking hammer.

302
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:23,180
Boom.

303
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,240
Right.

304
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:28,440
Or in the cartoons, they have the four fingered Mickey Mouse hand.

305
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:33,180
I want to put one of those big hands on a stick and you see people left and right.

306
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:33,820
You know what I mean?

307
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:40,860
So the Christianity and the churchianity stuff is like the medical stuff, you know, you got

308
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,940
high blood pressure and your blood sugar is off.

309
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:47,100
Both are fiction, but people rely, I mean, how many people you got on high blood pressure

310
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:47,840
and diabetes?

311
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,960
50 million in the country, at least like that.

312
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:51,220
Yeah.

313
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:51,760
Yeah.

314
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,260
It's, it's all complete fiction, you know, AIDS and all that.

315
00:14:54,280 --> 00:15:00,200
It's, it's, it's, you know, it's made up for, uh, it's kind of like the, um, the printers

316
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,400
and the cell phones, you know, once they've been on a certain amount of copies or calls

317
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,560
that they stopped working, you know, so you could buy another one.

318
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:15,620
It's the same exact, um, which was a topic I might want to touch on how it goes back

319
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,840
to the emo and all that.

320
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:22,300
But yeah, that's, um, the Adam is, is if you read it very carefully, there's, there's two

321
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:22,700
sets.

322
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,760
We've gone over this.

323
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:31,820
You've got, um, men and women that are made together and blessed and then there's a Sabbath

324
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:37,740
and then they make this guy out of the dust of the earth and he's alone, right.

325
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:45,320
And, um, in, in the garden, uh, and they say, it's not good to be alone.

326
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,040
Right.

327
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:46,700
Right.

328
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,520
Uh, he is alone.

329
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,840
It's not good to be alone.

330
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,700
And we, Oh, by the way, we've got, we've got a great, we could make, make a great partner

331
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,260
for you.

332
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:56,600
Adam.

333
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,720
Excellent partner.

334
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,520
Best ever.

335
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,620
Adam says, what's it going to cost me?

336
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,900
This is going to cost you a leg.

337
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,960
Adam says, what do you got for a rib anyway?

338
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,200
Uh, okay.

339
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,420
So, so he gets out of his rib, right.

340
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,220
Uh, they, they make the woman and then they get kicked out and do they get a blessing?

341
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,620
No, it's like actually the earth is cursed.

342
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,280
So we have two completely different stories, two Adams and they're about 2000 years apart.

343
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:31,420
So if you, anyone digests that, you know, you have, I call it six day man and eight

344
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,380
day man, right?

345
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,700
Cause the seven, you have the six day Adam, then you have the Sabbath, the seventh day

346
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,920
and then the eighth day, right?

347
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,340
Cause they didn't make him during the Sabbath.

348
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,420
It was after the Sabbath.

349
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,520
Now I'm not saying that I, you should believe in any of this.

350
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,600
I'm just saying, are you getting the descriptions right?

351
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,140
You see what I mean?

352
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:52,020
This goes back to exactly what I was saying, that if you go online and put in the seven

353
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:56,660
branch lamp stand or the arc of the covenant, there's not one image that's accurate, not

354
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,800
even close, right?

355
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:03,900
But if you actually read the description in the text and had someone next to you pencil

356
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:08,579
it out while you're reading it, you'll compare it to what's out in the world and it's not

357
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:10,859
the same at all, right?

358
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,220
This is the same thing that's going on with Adam and all this other stuff.

359
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,420
Then I noticed there was something else about sin.

360
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,359
Um, yeah, that too.

361
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:23,099
Hey, I just want to break, look, look, I want to let you guys know, I don't sin.

362
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,819
I avoid it.

363
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,359
And this is how you avoid sin.

364
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:32,800
If you don't say you're going to do something and you know you can't do it because the

365
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,720
word sin means to fall short.

366
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,940
So let's say you're throwing darts and you say, I got three darts in my hand.

367
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,920
I'm going to get three bullseyes and you don't, you just send, right?

368
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,380
Cause, because did you make, did you make the mark?

369
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,500
Did you do what you said?

370
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,480
No, right?

371
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,860
So, uh, it's missing the mark.

372
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,840
So if you say, I'm going to do this, this and that, and you don't, or you try to do

373
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,600
it and you fail or don't succeed, you, you, that's a sin.

374
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,680
You missed the mark, right?

375
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,000
Well, that's all it is.

376
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,800
So sin, no one's doing anything about sin.

377
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,860
Uh, if you actually look on a higher spiritual level, the thing about sin in the Bible is

378
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,920
that we are imperfect.

379
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:21,300
In other words, what do they say when you've got more desire than ability and you get yourself

380
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:21,740
in trouble?

381
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,940
There are a lot of cliché terms for that, isn't there?

382
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:25,600
Yeah, of course.

383
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:34,240
Stuff with writing checks, stuff with, you know, my eyes are hungrier than whatever, you

384
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:34,720
know, right?

385
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:35,700
Yeah.

386
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:42,320
So, in other words, man's desires and thoughtful abilities and perspectives on what he can

387
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,280
do overrides his ability and he ends up flat on his face.

388
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,000
So, that's what sin is.

389
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:54,620
Does that mean that it's a sin if you make an attempt, an honest attempt to do something

390
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,580
and you fail?

391
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,280
I mean, that seems a little strange to me.

392
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:04,600
It is a sin, yeah, because no one sets out to build a tower that can't succeed.

393
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:08,280
In other words, you measure twice, cut once.

394
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:13,920
Or what man does is, listen, I cut this board twice and it's still too short.

395
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:15,680
Anyway.

396
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:16,540
Okay.

397
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:17,580
Okay.

398
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,000
Cut it a third time, it's still too short.

399
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,280
It's still going to be too short, yeah.

400
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
So, it's like, wait a second, wait a second, you got your perspective is all screwed up.

401
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:33,620
So, even with the Christ, with the woman being stoned, he says, go and sin no more.

402
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:35,360
Right?

403
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,440
So, in other words, that could mean several things on a high spiritual level.

404
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,600
It means don't do adultery, or if you do adultery, don't get caught, because when you do adultery,

405
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,940
you're not supposed to get caught, right?

406
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,220
Do you see the two levels, the two-edged sword?

407
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:57,220
How I get away from, unless there is a, here's the thing.

408
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:02,980
Why, just like with the magnets, why is it that everything in the world has to be between

409
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,000
five and eight-year-old mentality?

410
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:06,640
Right?

411
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,560
Even spirituality, right?

412
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,780
Like, people convert to other religions because they don't like this one, but they don't pay

413
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,860
any attention to what's going on with the one they're converting to, right?

414
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:17,740
You know what I mean?

415
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:18,780
Okay.

416
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:19,600
Or whatever.

417
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,840
So, what I mean is, when you're reading something like the biblical text, which is on a high

418
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:32,100
spiritual level, if he tells the woman, Christ tells the woman, go and sin no more, that

419
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:32,860
has two meanings.

420
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,260
It has two meanings to it.

421
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:35,900
You see?

422
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,020
Because if you're doing adultery and get caught, you sin, didn't you?

423
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:40,840
Well, what?

424
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,900
If you do adultery, you don't?

425
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,140
On a human level.

426
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:42,660
And you don't get caught?

427
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,840
Because you're not supposed to get caught.

428
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,900
Yeah, but if you don't get caught, then there's no sin?

429
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,680
I mean, a cop didn't see it, I didn't do it?

430
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:47,920
Yeah.

431
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:51,380
No, according to the people, no, because no one knows you're doing it.

432
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,280
Well, but you do.

433
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,520
There would be no stoning there.

434
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,300
But you do.

435
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,200
You know you did it.

436
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:57,620
No?

437
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:03,080
You know you're doing it, but if you have a responsibility to a higher authority or

438
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:09,460
another authority that within that responsibility is not to do it, then you're sinning there.

439
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,520
Let me give you an example.

440
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:11,940
Okay.

441
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:17,600
Someone who's, let's say, a pagan or a Mormon, I don't know, whatever, you know, multi-polygamy

442
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,060
is okay?

443
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:18,720
Okay.

444
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,380
Are they sinning?

445
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:21,880
No.

446
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:24,220
Right?

447
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,560
Actually, in the Bible, is polygamy okay?

448
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:27,740
Yes or no?

449
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:32,040
Well, it appears to be okay because it's in a whole lot of stories among men that are

450
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,340
supposed to be men of God.

451
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,020
I mean, unless I missed something.

452
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:45,840
So, it's a very touchy subject because it's, here's the thing that people forget.

453
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,180
Okay, we say, they say, G-O-D the Father, right?

454
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,400
And he loves everybody.

455
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:57,420
Then why does he kill 185,000 here, 50,000 here, 100,000 here, millions and billions

456
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:57,740
here?

457
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,420
Why does he allow suffering to continue if he loves so much?

458
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,060
Why do people have to suffer then?

459
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,780
Well, because there's a higher level to it.

460
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,740
Because love means to do the right thing.

461
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,900
So, if something is so wicked and bad that the only right thing left to do is to, you

462
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,040
see how this works?

463
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:21,180
But when you go on the internet or listen to people, oh, how could he be a loving God

464
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,020
when he killed all those people?

465
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,680
Because there is thinking between a five-year-old and an eight-year-old.

466
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,140
Again, the magnet's so strong here against the bridge.

467
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,480
Let's put the water where it's strong.

468
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:30,740
Right?

469
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,140
Words sin.

470
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:32,880
Oh, we're sinners.

471
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,640
No, you're not.

472
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:38,920
Look, if you have no desires and you do very little, there's no way you can sin.

473
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:40,800
Right?

474
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:48,820
These are very, very, by the way, these are what the rabbis and the sages used to do

475
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:52,840
and other people used to sit around and contemplate these things.

476
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,040
But when they go to present them to the public and they're like,

477
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,520
they're like, oh my gosh, we can't bring this subject to them.

478
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,740
We got to wait for them to get their diapers off.

479
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,260
Wait a second.

480
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,780
They're 30 years old, still wearing diapers.

481
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,880
No, we're going to just hide it.

482
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,980
There's a natural system, a cycle.

483
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:17,460
What is it?

484
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,000
You've seen the wheel of government.

485
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:29,000
You go from oppression to slavery to dictatorship to revolution to democracy to oppression to slavery to revolution to democracy.

486
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,120
You've seen that cycle, right?

487
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:30,400
Yeah.

488
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,460
How the societies go.

489
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,160
Okay.

490
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,480
You have a society that becomes spiritual.

491
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,720
It develops a priesthood that studies these things.

492
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,580
And then what does it become?

493
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,680
Completely unspiritual.

494
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,080
And then back again.

495
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,480
Why?

496
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:52,320
Because when these things are contemplated, when a development of the mind and quote-unquote law and morality is done,

497
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,160
there's always going to be, everyone's got to do what they have to do to survive.

498
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,020
You're a baker.

499
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,780
You're a radio show host.

500
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,720
You fix cars.

501
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,720
You're a bookkeeper or whatever.

502
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,020
You do your job, right?

503
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,780
But you want to know about spirituality.

504
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:11,000
You don't have eight hours a day for 20 years to study this.

505
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:11,760
But you know what?

506
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,560
There's a group of people over here that do.

507
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:21,660
And when you go to them to see what they're studying and to share it with you,

508
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,460
they don't have like an open door.

509
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:24,940
What is it?

510
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,300
The free software.

511
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:26,980
What is it called?

512
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,580
Open source.

513
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,080
They don't open source their stuff.

514
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,380
They look at you and say, who are you?

515
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,520
And they do a little query.

516
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:33,900
Oh, my God.

517
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,920
And if you go there and you're like...

518
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,900
They're not going to give you anything.

519
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,220
They're going to say, go over here.

520
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,700
We have a temple over here that deals with people.

521
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,540
And they're going to tell you you're a sinner.

522
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,480
But no, you can't get any of this stuff, man.

523
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,180
What are you talking about?

524
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,280
You see what I mean?

525
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:51,700
Okay.

526
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:52,840
All right.

527
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,040
So what happens is the people that contemplate these things,

528
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,380
these high spiritual notions,

529
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,120
they keep it to themselves.

530
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,500
And if the books get lost or they die, what happens?

531
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,460
You end up with a group of people that know nothing about it.

532
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,980
If you don't share the knowledge, then it's not out there.

533
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:10,460
Right.

534
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,000
But before they share, they don't open source it.

535
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,200
They look at the individuals and they say,

536
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,240
these are like highfalutin ideas, man.

537
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,740
They ain't going to get it.

538
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,400
This is a lot of finning and reckoning we've been doing,

539
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,520
and we're going to just hand it over to these guys here?

540
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:29,460
No.

541
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,260
So you get this elitist secreted information.

542
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:38,280
By the way, if you're a contemplative individual, let's say,

543
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,980
you can figure these things out on your own

544
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,260
as long as you parse it out within your time.

545
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,940
You could be a mechanic working eight hours a day,

546
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,960
but you know how you have different tabs open on a computer?

547
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,480
You have to be able to multitask,

548
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:54,300
take in a certain amount of study and contemplate on it,

549
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:57,340
chew it in the background while you're doing your work.

550
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:01,060
Can you do that and still focus on doing what you do well?

551
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,660
Well, people can't do the multitasking like that.

552
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:04,260
True.

553
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,280
But there are some that have.

554
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,280
Years ago, they used to have newsletters.

555
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,520
Now they have websites and blogs, right,

556
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,300
where people are whatever vocation,

557
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,620
but they have an interest in something else.

558
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:17,640
And believe it or not,

559
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,140
that's where you're going to get your best information.

560
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,540
Like, for example, when you look at –

561
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,380
I always – not threaten.

562
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,900
I challenge people.

563
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:25,360
Threaten.

564
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:26,500
Yeah.

565
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,500
Well, it's a threat to them when I bring this up.

566
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:32,080
Name something that was invented out of a university

567
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,240
or one of these big academic institutions.

568
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,780
Name an invention that they put out.

569
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:37,860
And you can't.

570
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,760
I can't think of one, no.

571
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:40,660
Yeah.

572
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:41,540
Right?

573
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,300
The Wright Brothers.

574
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,440
Were they in university?

575
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:44,520
No.

576
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:44,880
Nope.

577
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,780
Bike mechanics.

578
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:46,920
Right?

579
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:47,760
Hewlett-Packard.

580
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,400
They started beating up stuff in a garage, right?

581
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,820
The only thing I can think of that came out of a university

582
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,820
is maybe LSD.

583
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,060
But outside of that, I can't think of anything.

584
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:56,720
I don't even think –

585
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,240
Well, that started back in the –

586
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,440
That came out of the 30s.

587
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,300
Well, that's because of Project Paperclip and stuff like that.

588
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:02,780
Yeah.

589
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,080
They were prescribing –

590
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,000
Well, LSD was supposed to be a truth serum in the 1930s.

591
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,420
Lysergic acid type stuff.

592
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:11,200
Okay.

593
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:12,400
Yeah.

594
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,340
What came –

595
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,440
What was it?

596
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,200
Steve Jobs was a college dropout, if I'm not correct.

597
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,400
Right?

598
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:19,940
Yeah.

599
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,540
Another guy working in a garage.

600
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,140
So I can't think of anything that was –

601
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:25,760
Okay.

602
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,680
So this is still going on.

603
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,980
It's always been going on that way.

604
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:33,600
So what these institutions, churches, universities are putting out

605
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:39,620
is to reframe from what is higher knowledge to fool the collective

606
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,800
to think this is the way to think about something, right?

607
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,280
So that's where the sin thing comes from.

608
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:48,700
Yeah.

609
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,320
So I think I've said enough without –

610
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,420
You can't attack that directly.

611
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,560
It does deserve to be attacked, by the way,

612
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,260
the sin aspect in people's minds.

613
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:03,640
You can't go at it directly because then they turn it on you.

614
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,280
Well, then you're just defending sin.

615
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,180
You're defending blah, blah, blah.

616
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:06,740
No, you're not.

617
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:12,840
You see, you have to go around it, circle the wagons around it

618
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,100
and around and around and then drive away.

619
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,440
You know what I mean?

620
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:18,620
Yeah.

621
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,040
It just means missing the mark.

622
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:28,380
So if you're a very well-measured, I would say humble and well-measured,

623
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:31,540
meaning you think about things before you do them,

624
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,760
you're not going to be sinning.

625
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:37,800
And also what responsibilities do you have to this reality and to who?

626
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,960
And if you follow those and you achieve,

627
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,700
you were within the scope of those things without missing anything,

628
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,060
you're not sinning either.

629
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,160
And that's really the definition of it.

630
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:53,580
That's why it's so strange to people when you talk about these things

631
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,840
because the word love just means to do the right thing.

632
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:00,440
Hey, if wiping out billions of people in the flood is the right thing,

633
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,440
that's love, yeah.

634
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:02,360
Right?

635
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,720
It's not like, well, the apple is red and the car is red.

636
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,220
That means the apple is a car.

637
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:07,620
No.

638
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:12,320
If you define love as doing the right thing, even if it inconveniences you,

639
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:13,680
yeah, it is.

640
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,540
You do that.

641
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:17,080
You do eliminate the entire population out of love.

642
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:17,420
Yes.

643
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:18,680
You see?

644
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,380
But because we've taken the word love to mean someone in a Skype message,

645
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,000
I put a photo of some food and they said there was one fork there, how romantic.

646
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,760
And I'm like, because I said it was a plate for two.

647
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,480
And I said, romantic?

648
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,100
What's that?

649
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,260
I've got to look that word up.

650
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,400
It must be something they use for the collective.

651
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,620
I don't know what that word means.

652
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,020
Now, that's double-sided.

653
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,840
Now, one person will say, oh, man, the Greek must be cold.

654
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,560
He's not romantic.

655
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:48,400
But on the other side, it's like, oh, man, the Greek doesn't fall for that,

656
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,580
get me flowers on Valentine's Day

657
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,960
and rub my feet and tell me sweet nothings just to get something.

658
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:54,780
You see what I mean?

659
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:55,420
Mm-hmm.

660
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:56,360
Right?

661
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:57,600
Okay.

662
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,100
You know what I mean?

663
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,840
No, I'm getting the point.

664
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,700
Yeah, I got you.

665
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,320
I understand.

666
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,700
It's totally, yeah, it's very different.

667
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:08,400
If I say I'm not romantic, most people in the general will say, oh, my gosh,

668
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,720
what is he, a robot?

669
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,520
What is he, you know?

670
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:10,880
Right?

671
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,880
Yeah, it's terrible.

672
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,940
What are you, lack of emotions?

673
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,040
Because if you're romantic, where do people learn how to be romantic?

674
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,300
Television, movies, novels, their friends?

675
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:21,820
Mostly, yeah.

676
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,880
What kind of quality is that?

677
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,160
What kind of reality is that?

678
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,680
No, but if you're doing the right thing by somebody,

679
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:33,920
then that's a lot higher a calling than romance, right?

680
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:34,680
I mean…

681
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:38,620
Well, understanding the reason for it.

682
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:43,320
Yeah, and that word is not even being used probably because it comes from

683
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,840
Romania, Rome, right, and the romantic languages, supposedly.

684
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,200
Are you guys familiar, I think, familiar with,

685
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:54,380
I think it's Winston Churchill, I'm going to paraphrase,

686
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,440
heaven and hell in Europe.

687
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,120
Do you remember that?

688
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,280
Vaguely, vaguely, yeah.

689
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:03,640
Yeah, heaven in Europe is when the Germans are the mechanics,

690
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:07,880
the British are the police, the French are the chefs,

691
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:12,340
the Italians are the lovers, and the Swiss are the bankers, right?

692
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,220
Something like that.

693
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,700
Hell in Europe would be when the Germans are the police,

694
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:22,300
the British are the cooks, the French are the mechanics,

695
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,860
the Italians are the bankers, and the Swiss are the lovers.

696
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,500
That would be hell in Europe.

697
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:29,660
There you go.

698
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,900
So, anyway.

699
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,280
Well, that actually leads to another,

700
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,660
one of the last things in the chat I was going to bring up,

701
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:39,640
which is kind of funny, because it leads perfectly in my mind,

702
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,480
because I always have a mindset like that,

703
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,020
and I get there are many jokes in what you just said,

704
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,480
related to what Churchill, I think, said at one point.

705
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,400
And it makes perfect sense, you know,

706
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,220
once you get to know the culture and you take a look at, look,

707
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,420
some cultures are just geared towards certain things.

708
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,260
It's the way it is.

709
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:02,000
But something you brought up on a previous Sonic was mentioned in the chat

710
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,380
about the, there's only a handful of like spiritual genotypes, you call them.

711
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:13,240
And, you know, we talked about how people just seem to resemble others,

712
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,220
you know, after a while.

713
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:17,040
It's like there's only so many variations.

714
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,520
Well, let me rephrase that real quick.

715
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,480
Not a handful of spiritual genotypes,

716
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:26,400
but in the spirit realm it's divided into various genotypes.

717
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,360
I think it's between, let's say, the high 40s to the low 70s.

718
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,360
And you'll see that reflected in the personage,

719
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,900
and it has nothing to do with race.

720
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,280
Like I think I gave the example where, you know what Snoop Dogg looks like?

721
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,820
I know a white guy that looks exactly like Snoop Dogg, but he's a white guy.

722
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,480
Sounds like him, acts like him, same mannerisms.

723
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,660
How is that possible?

724
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:47,880
But go ahead.

725
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,560
Well, no, but that was the thing.

726
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,400
You brought that up in the previous Sonic, and I remember that,

727
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:55,280
and I was just wondering if you want to comment on that further,

728
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,080
because I think they asked specifically.

729
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,920
I did comment.

730
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,240
Race has nothing to do with it.

731
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:01,900
There was a study.

732
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,560
Yeah, no, not about race.

733
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:04,720
Forget race.

734
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,580
What I'm saying is.

735
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,040
Oh, the genotype.

736
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:11,580
Yeah, I can, but I don't have enough to substantiate it.

737
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:17,360
But you will see similarities in people types, and that is formed.

738
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:21,920
You know, you can affect how the embryo and the fetus is being formed, right,

739
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,440
by external input, right?

740
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:27,940
You know, like what's it called when a mother is an alcoholic, right, when the baby?

741
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,080
That will malform.

742
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:29,860
Fetal malform.

743
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,920
You see, there's thalidomide.

744
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,640
Yeah, right.

745
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,960
And there's thalidomide where you're born with no arms.

746
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:37,220
You know, I suppose in the 50s and 60s,

747
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:40,480
they were giving mothers to not have morning sickness,

748
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:46,000
and the babies were born with the fingers coming out of the elbow, all this.

749
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:46,760
So you can affect it.

750
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,760
So what I'm saying is when the spirit, each genotype,

751
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:56,800
it's a genotype not because it's genetic in the sense that it comes from the genes,

752
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,480
but it affects the genes.

753
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,920
When the spirit comes in, it has a certain effect.

754
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:08,100
You'll see that in personages in cartoon styles that way.

755
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,199
You know how cartoons are drawn, you know.

756
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,940
Isn't another way to look at this, though, that, you know, like, look,

757
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,560
if it is nurtured spiritually in a certain way,

758
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:18,620
you have a very substantial and healthy person in general,

759
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:22,460
and that's just the way maybe they'll be their entire life

760
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:28,159
because that is the infusion that was kind of happening there to the physical.

761
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,060
Like, I'm not wording this correctly.

762
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:32,239
No, no, but hold on.

763
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:32,739
Hold on.

764
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,650
There was a study done in Russia.

765
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,400
I'm going to bring up the one in China and Russia real quick,

766
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,580
where when the woman conceived, for nine months,

767
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:44,960
she was reading to the baby, to the child she's carrying.

768
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:45,340
Right.

769
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:46,360
And guess what?

770
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:50,659
Those children, the majority of them, between two and four years old,

771
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:56,160
by four years old they had a high school comprehension just by reading to them.

772
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,960
And technical stuff, not fun with Dick and Jane and blah, blah, blah, you know,

773
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,360
Barney and stuff like that.

774
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:01,620
Right.

775
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,320
I mean, everything that you would do is if you came to Earth

776
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,640
and you needed a download on what's going on here.

777
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,300
Technical stuff.

778
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,200
The other thing I want to bring up is in China they said,

779
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,880
well, the Chinese people speak Chinese because they're Chinese,

780
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:22,620
so they took a mixed race of, let's say, black, white, northern, southern, European, whatever children,

781
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,820
and they had them born and raised in China.

782
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,880
And they went through the regular schooling, nothing special.

783
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:29,620
And guess what?

784
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,780
Regardless of your whatever race or what part of the world you came from,

785
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:37,500
you spoke Chinese just as well as the Chinese children.

786
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:38,840
Right.

787
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:41,820
So it has nothing to do with you speak Chinese well because you're Chinese.

788
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,360
They have an epithelial flap on your eye or whatever.

789
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,240
No, it doesn't work that way.

790
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:53,600
The majority of what I answered in the comment was you have this influx of a spirit that comes in

791
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,940
that does shape and mold you to a certain degree,

792
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:01,660
but how you perform and behave is all about if you have open, free mind and proper training.

793
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:02,460
Mm-hmm.

794
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:03,680
Right?

795
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,760
This is very well known.

796
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:09,780
This was developed, and if you want to touch on this very closely,

797
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,740
MKUltra was about that.

798
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:16,520
If you're going to raise an assassin, you better start one there, too.

799
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:18,140
Oh, right.

800
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,080
I mean, look, and the other way around, too.

801
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:26,800
You take a full-blooded Chinese person, you bring them here to the United States,

802
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:30,020
you raise them from birth here.

803
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,560
Look, what do they do?

804
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,680
They speak just like if they're in the south, they've got a southern drawl.

805
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,860
It's just the way it is.

806
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:41,620
If they're in the north, they might sound a bit like me in the northeast, you know.

807
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,380
There is a shape to the vocal cords that's different.

808
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,840
Like on the phone, I could tell that seeing someone, if they're black, white, or Asian,

809
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,920
even if they're born here, by the way, there is a very subtle shape.

810
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,320
Yeah, there is a subtle, yeah.

811
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:54,660
Yeah, yeah.

812
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,920
I remember doing Skype calls for someone a long time,

813
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:04,620
and a very intelligent-sounding guy, and everybody thought he was a white guy.

814
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,500
I said, oh, Sam, come here.

815
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,180
He's black, man.

816
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:06,780
What are you talking about?

817
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,080
He's like, he's black?

818
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:09,960
It doesn't sound like black.

819
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:10,440
I said, what do you mean?

820
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,460
Can't you hear it in his voice?

821
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,040
Right?

822
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,400
Well, they're looking for a particular.

823
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,240
But I can.

824
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:16,960
Other people can.

825
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,560
I can hear if someone is Asian, even if they're born and raised here.

826
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,220
It's a very, very, very subtle.

827
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:25,520
So this is something that is now we're getting into the extreme subtleties that,

828
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,900
unfortunately, can be taught, right?

829
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,280
Here is something that's even more important, by the way.

830
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:33,960
Okay.

831
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,120
Well, what's important, it's all behavior.

832
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,240
It's what's done with the personal culture.

833
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,660
You know, you have the overall culture, and then you have the personal culture,

834
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,280
how the individual is raised, right?

835
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,280
If you raise a child, you know, the Olympic swimmers in Russia,

836
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,600
underwater birth, right?

837
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,100
Okay.

838
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:51,980
That's what they did.

839
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:52,400
Okay.

840
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:57,880
So if you want to raise a James Bond, you better start at two, right?

841
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,240
If you want to raise a worker, you could put him in front of Sesame Street

842
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,820
and send him through government schools and high school,

843
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,900
and they're done because they develop their –

844
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:11,360
they'll spend the rest of their life with a high school mentality, right?

845
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:15,860
I've seen people in their 60s, 70s, and older that have a high school mentality still.

846
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:16,560
Right.

847
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,900
That's what they latched on.

848
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,160
That's what they were trained for.

849
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,680
They were trained to be – this is very much like Aldous Huxley, Brave New World,

850
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:28,040
you know, the alphas, the betas, the gammas, the delta morons, right?

851
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:28,360
Right.

852
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,180
Very much that way.

853
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,900
So it's all that.

854
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:42,460
But the higher level to it is the nurturing when you're in the formative years.

855
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,960
But, you know, I think I missed something.

856
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,440
I don't think I went on too much of a tangent there.

857
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,020
No, not too much.

858
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,060
Yeah, not too much.

859
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,480
But there was something important I wanted to bring up, but maybe I missed it.

860
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,600
It has to do with, again, all of this.

861
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:04,880
It's how the person is raised, but there is a very strong, not genetic component,

862
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,360
but a component while the child is being formed in the womb.

863
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,980
Let's just leave it at that.

864
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:10,460
Okay.

865
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:15,740
So when you see a woman who is pregnant,

866
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:22,620
you can follow her around and get a slice of how she acts for those first nine months

867
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:25,480
and then the next five years.

868
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:29,780
And you could pretty much draw up a quick dossier on the child,

869
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,840
what the child will be like or very close for the rest of its life,

870
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,580
depending on schooling and all that.

871
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,540
It doesn't mean all is lost.

872
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,360
You can have even someone go through, what do they call them, a complete normie,

873
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:47,400
go through even high school and whatever and then they wake up.

874
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,860
How many times do you hear people say on blogs,

875
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:54,160
I woke up in 2014 and I found out, right, and they changed their lives, right?

876
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:54,420
Right.

877
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,440
Yeah.

878
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:02,040
But imagine that starting at conception, you see.

879
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,800
So, yeah, it's important.

880
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:11,680
That's why, I don't know, I think, look,

881
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:15,540
either the two kinds of people, the kinds that are self-centered,

882
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,500
just think about themselves and what they can get

883
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:21,180
and then there's the other kind of person that likes to help other people.

884
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,840
Yeah, sort of narcissistic versus altruistic, sure.

885
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,260
Yeah, okay.

886
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:29,620
So, well, you don't want to be altruistic because we're not in an altruistic universe.

887
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,200
It doesn't work that way.

888
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,420
Yeah, the wolf will eat.

889
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:38,300
As long as you have bugs eating, big fish eating smaller fish, if you know what I mean,

890
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,720
you're not in the right universe for altruism.

891
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:48,480
But it can be, let's say, padded as, let's say, altruistic, you know, but it's not.

892
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,280
It's a pretty sad place.

893
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:54,440
Not just the planet, the whole thing, until it changes in any way.

894
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,400
But, yeah, what I wanted to say is, you know,

895
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:04,940
you have to get special permissions if you don't have a license for something.

896
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:09,740
I don't like to use that term because really what it means is something different.

897
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:15,860
But what I suggest is that if I were to be emperor of the world,

898
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,080
everyone would stop having babies

899
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:22,640
and those that wanted to have babies would have to go through very special,

900
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,700
they would have to see it as a privilege.

901
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,240
You know what I mean?

902
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:32,680
They'd have to be screened, you know, your education level, not school, your spiritual level.

903
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,660
Can you see or are you a dummy?

904
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:40,480
And then if you pass a certain amount of basic human requirements, go ahead and have children.

905
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:49,540
Yeah, look, it's very easy to take the earth to the next level.

906
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:53,200
And people, you know, when they say, Greek, what's the right thing?

907
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:54,760
Who makes the law?

908
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,100
I say, you do, you do.

909
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:57,580
You make it.

910
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:01,560
But if you don't want to sit there and reinvent it, it's already been done.

911
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,780
You know, like the thing about government being corrupt.

912
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,060
It's not your government.

913
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:07,560
It's not a government.

914
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,320
It's a corporation.

915
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:13,220
None of them are doing anything that's in the books that they're supposed to be following.

916
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:14,740
No one is.

917
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:19,260
All you got to do with anything is just go back to what's been memorialized.

918
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,840
You know, medical industry, screw up.

919
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,640
No, well, it's not really medical.

920
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,120
It's business.

921
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:28,480
If you just go into the medical books and look at what's been memorialized and how things work, you'll be fine.

922
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:32,380
If you go in the legal books and look how it's supposed to be applied, you'd be fine.

923
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:36,920
If you go to the, you know, financial side, look how it's supposed to be applied, you'd be fine.

924
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:41,640
Nothing is being done the way it's been written to be done, if that makes any sense.

925
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:42,620
You see?

926
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,640
No one's following any rules at all.

927
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,580
It's just the appearance of it.

928
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,660
And here's the thing, though.

929
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:56,600
Once you have a society that, let's say, gets rid of a monarchy where, you know, you have no freedom or whatever, which is bullshit,

930
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,480
the best government is a benevolent dictator.

931
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,260
Dictator means you just dictate, right?

932
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:08,920
A benevolent one, right, would be the best government because, you know, you have a central point.

933
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,160
There's no bureaucracy, really.

934
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,860
Well, you could say there is because how are you going to get to the king?

935
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,740
You've got to go through all these hoops and all these layers, right?

936
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,120
Well, you need to have administrators.

937
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:23,800
I mean, you can't possibly handle every single aspect of everything, so you've got to delegate.

938
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,500
You've got to have the book stops here somewhere.

939
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:31,180
So when you have this system where they tell you you have a free government, it's open government,

940
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:38,920
what happens is the people that want to usurp it will be the ones that will get in there, right?

941
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,420
I was thinking this today based on a conversation recently out in public,

942
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:45,660
is there's no public participation in government.

943
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:46,480
Don't say voting.

944
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,520
No, don't say that.

945
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:50,760
I'm talking about active public participation in government.

946
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:53,140
There is none, zero, anywhere.

947
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:55,520
It's all government employees and agencies.

948
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:56,100
You ever notice?

949
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:01,500
So we're not talking about someone volunteering night watch or picking up litter.

950
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,180
So there is no active public.

951
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,220
So it's all closed off because when they did open it up,

952
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:12,740
all the people that were supposedly doing other things like attorneys of certain corrupt institutions,

953
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,900
find a politician in the U.S. who's not an attorney.

954
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,220
Good luck.

955
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,440
What does that tell you right away?

956
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,100
I mean, come on.

957
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:27,780
So all you have to do is go back to what's been written and do it.

958
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:34,100
If you go in the medical books and it says that there's induction of disease, induction, induction,

959
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:36,120
what does that mean?

960
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:41,340
If you look at the medical diagrams on anatomy

961
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:44,780
and you see that there's three hydrophobic layers and nothing goes through,

962
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,340
well, how is the nutrition getting into the body?

963
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,140
There's no absorption.

964
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,900
Well, just follow what's been laid out.

965
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:55,960
If you look at the legal stuff, all those millions of codes and everyone says,

966
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,880
oh, the cops are code enforcers.

967
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,080
No, they're not code enforcers.

968
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:00,060
They work for the banks.

969
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:03,040
If you go look at the definitions, you know,

970
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,600
in a court case or wherever they're charging someone with crimes and all this stuff

971
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,700
and they list the codes and all that, that's fine.

972
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,700
Let's go back to the definitions.

973
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:17,620
This is supposed to be applying to corporations, trusts, persons, and residents, right?

974
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,060
Where do you fit in there?

975
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:24,760
You know, we're charging you, you know, Title 18, whatever, stealing rocks from the moon.

976
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:25,620
Oh, my gosh.

977
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,320
It has nothing to do with you.

978
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:28,860
Right?

979
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,840
But the people don't know and they buy it.

980
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,860
You know, it's all around, everything, everything.

981
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:39,360
How many times do you hear someone, oh, I got high blood pressure and my blood sugar is off?

982
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,240
Both are fictional.

983
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,360
Both are completely fictional.

984
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:48,780
But, Greek, I get sick if I don't, no, you get sick after you start taking treatment, right?

985
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:49,580
Yeah.

986
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:52,740
But without the treatment, I'd die.

987
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,760
Like, okay, that person is finished.

988
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:55,820
They just, you know what I mean?

989
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:59,400
If they never got treatment, they would, right, never been sick.

990
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:07,620
So we have this incredible situation here where things look like they're in control,

991
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:11,220
but they're out of control because the control mechanisms that were set up,

992
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:14,820
the way we're supposed to do things, whether it's legal, medical, or whatever,

993
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:17,000
or even religious, is not being followed.

994
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:22,600
So you've got to see, again, you know how we started off with the magnet.

995
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:26,480
Well, this is the strong part of the magnet, so we should put the water on this, right?

996
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:26,940
See?

997
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:30,360
It's the same exact ideology.

998
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:31,820
All right.

999
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,260
That was a tangential rant.

1000
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:39,040
But it's all about, again, genetics and hereditary.

1001
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:44,500
No, it's very subtle, very, very subtle.

1002
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:47,920
It's from when the sperm meets the egg and before.
