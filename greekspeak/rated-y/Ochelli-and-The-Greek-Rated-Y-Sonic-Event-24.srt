1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,140
The sonic entity known as Ocelli is here to greet you.

2
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:59,600
Today, we're going to be talking about Ocelli, the sonic entity known as Ocelli.

3
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,920
with the patriot movement de facto du jour.

4
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,020
Du jour means by law, by how things should be done, and de facto is by force.

5
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,140
But it ends up being done that way anyway.

6
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,440
You know, like a stolen election, for example, would be a de facto leader, right?

7
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,320
Because a du jour leader would be, you know, the votes are counted and blah, blah, blah, right?

8
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:25,220
See, I always took du jour to mean, look, you have a choice.

9
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:31,540
And I always took de facto to mean, this is just what ends up happening because this is the way things go.

10
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,940
Either one, you don't have a choice.

11
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,600
But no, actually, de facto, you have more choice because this is how it works.

12
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,940
Du jour just means by the book, by the law, by the day, like soup du jour.

13
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,380
That's how I learned about du jour.

14
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,900
When I heard de facto and du jour, I said, I know about soup du jour.

15
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,300
You know, the sandwich boards, you know, at the diners or whatever.

16
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,400
And then I said, well, what's de facto?

17
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,960
And if the people don't go along with it, it won't last.

18
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,860
You know, here's the thing.

19
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,940
They give you this false history about all these dictators, right?

20
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,420
In other words, they're painted in a bad light.

21
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:12,140
And no dictator, no matter how powerful they seem to be, will last more than a week if the people don't want them there.

22
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,940
This is just how it works.

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,400
And the people, you know, the military come from the people, right?

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,100
Conscription or whatever it is, whatever kind of military you have.

25
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:30,160
And, you know, by the way, you know, the modern militaries are not really du jour militaries.

26
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,640
They're all contract militaries.

27
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,200
And there's a movie called Jarhead, which I enjoyed because of that,

28
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:40,760
because whenever they were questioning orders, they'd be told, you know, you signed a contract, right?

29
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,860
Well, I always found it interesting, the people that told me about getting out of the military,

30
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:50,820
even when they were, you know, drafted, because I always thought of drafting as one of those things that you can't get out of.

31
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,240
But apparently you still require consent, right?

32
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,320
I mean, that's the word I always think of is, you know what, it still requires your consent.

33
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,780
And a lot of people say, well, look, there's no choice here.

34
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:08,480
And I always say, but at some point, they do require the consent of the people, otherwise they can't operate, right?

35
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,980
I mean, or am I crazy?

36
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,980
No, that's right.

37
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,220
You are crazy, too, though.

38
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:18,960
But let's just say the de facto part, anyone who's hanging around with me long enough has to be crazy.

39
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:25,180
But the de facto is by the people allowing it or a significant portion.

40
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,160
By the way, it's not 51 percent.

41
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:34,220
Anything more than 10 or 15 percent of the people or definitely more than 20 or 30 percent can rule the rest.

42
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,120
You know, it's not that much.

43
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,860
You know, that's the funny thing is everybody seems to think that it takes an actual majority.

44
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,340
Now, that may be the way voting goes in Congress or whatever, supposedly.

45
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,640
But truth is that when it comes down to it, it's a vocal minority.

46
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,380
And I think you're exactly right.

47
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,640
It's about 30 percent.

48
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:57,760
If you get a very vocal and active minority at 25 to 30 percent, game over.

49
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:03,500
It looks like everyone's in step because then they can cover up any dissent very easily.

50
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,160
Well, yeah.

51
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:09,760
And you also have just the general apathy, too, where, you know, there's plenty of people that it's like, oh, today it's a dictatorship.

52
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,800
Tomorrow it's a benevolent dictatorship.

53
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,280
Whatever.

54
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,520
You know, like they don't engage.

55
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,959
Well, a benevolent dictatorship would be a benevolent monarch.

56
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,899
And that's the best government for humans.

57
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,160
Yeah, you said that.

58
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,880
Because they form that anyway.

59
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,580
Look at Lord of the Flies or Animal Farm.

60
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,580
You throw a bunch of people on an island or an isolated area, they're going to form.

61
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:36,400
They're going to get the alpha dog up with his cohorts and, again, 30 percent of the group.

62
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,040
And they're going to make them the rulers.

63
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,960
That happens every time, everywhere.

64
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:48,020
So that's how you know there's a real revolution, when you have a group of people, not just one leader, you know.

65
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,980
So it's always done by council.

66
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:58,040
But, again, it's a very small – Animal Farm, Lord of the Flies, you know, is a group.

67
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:03,220
You know, you'll have the alpha pair or a single, and then he has his two or three sidekicks.

68
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,860
He's number one, you know.

69
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:12,700
Well, and some people say, look, you need administrators to, you know, exercise authority, right?

70
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,120
And I get that, and that's true.

71
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,940
I mean, one man, unless there are people that follow his orders, can't really do much, right?

72
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,840
I mean, what do you think of that?

73
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:32,640
I think it's – well, you don't want to do much.

74
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,020
You can't do much.

75
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:37,580
I was having a conversation about this with someone, and it's like, man, you could do all this stuff.

76
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,980
How come you're not like a billionaire, or why aren't you so successful?

77
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,280
I mean, define success, right?

78
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,280
I don't want to do anything.

79
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:51,080
Because I know, like, for example, personally, whenever I get into a project and I put 150 percent into it –

80
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:56,240
and by the way, if you, let's say, start a business or do a project, you can put 150 percent into it.

81
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,860
What that means is 100 percent is all of your time now,

82
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,180
and the other 50 percent you get from planning on doing stuff next week.

83
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,140
You know what I mean?

84
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,400
That's how you could put 150 percent.

85
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,080
So if someone calls you and says, hey, you want to go fishing next week?

86
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,260
No way, man.

87
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,200
I got things I got to do.

88
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,520
So that's how you put in 150 percent, right?

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,380
By blocking out your time.

90
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:25,500
You've already allotted all your present past time and your future time to it, right?

91
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,800
But it always gets very successful and prospers and does all this well.

92
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:36,560
But the moment I decide to take a day off, and even though everybody seems like they're running fine, everything falls apart.

93
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,860
So the thing is, no, I'm never going to do any solo projects again.

94
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:49,840
Whatever I put out, solo sonics are different, but a solo project in any field is not for me,

95
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:56,300
because it means that it's going to take up 150 percent of my life or the life that I'm living, let's say.

96
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:02,660
So I'm always looking, putting out stuff, and then trying to find other people that are interested.

97
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,880
Yeah, I'll guide them.

98
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,500
I'll be the alpha for a while, whatever.

99
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,320
But don't get it running and then step back, take a day off.

100
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,020
Start taking days off in the beginning, right?

101
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,860
So this way you're not surprised, you know what I mean?

102
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,600
So that's how I've been functioning.

103
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,380
Yeah, you find out really quickly how the people that are working under you are functioning.

104
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,800
If you take your days off early, that's for sure, right?

105
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,880
Yeah, so that's the way that these administrations are run, because there's no way –

106
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,140
that's what the administration is, basically.

107
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,140
It's always a group.

108
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,140
Now, it's all paint by numbers.

109
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,600
They tell you directly that you've got plenty of, quote-unquote,

110
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:49,020
in a lawful sense, subversive organizations like the CFR and the Council of Foreign Relations

111
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,640
and the Trilateral Group and all that.

112
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:56,720
They make no bones about it, about the State Department and other branches of the government.

113
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,120
Let's say State Department is not a branch of the government, it's part of the executive,

114
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,320
but agencies and departments, they make no bones about it

115
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,480
that they take orders from these other organizations, right?

116
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,380
You've heard this, right?

117
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,060
Oh, yeah, and I don't think I've ever actually asked you about Bilderberg.

118
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,060
I think they're meeting sooner now, right?

119
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:16,440
I stopped paying attention to them a while ago, but I know that that's what they're meeting.

120
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:21,660
Yeah, Bilderberg is just the extension of the National Socialist Party of industrialists.

121
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:27,340
The Bilderberg – when I say National Socialist Party, it's the Nazis, right?

122
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,960
It's just their political group.

123
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,559
The people that propped them up, like the King of Belgium and all these other groups,

124
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:40,720
they were all forming these other sidekick groups known as the Bilderberg.

125
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,600
There's more.

126
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,140
There's other groups, actually.

127
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,480
I don't have it off the top of my head, but years ago I used to show this to people.

128
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,900
You know the United Nations, right?

129
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,360
Before the United Nations, it was the League of Nations.

130
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,220
Well, there was one that was formed even before the League of Nations that still exists.

131
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,000
You can look it up.

132
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,120
What is the oldest international administrative group?

133
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:05,440
It still exists, but no one talks about it, right?

134
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,380
Then there's the Vatican, where the state – not the Vatican, where the Pope is,

135
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,500
but they used to have a website and it says we're an 800-year-old red building behind.

136
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,800
We're in Vatican City.

137
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,980
We have nothing to do with the religious part of the Vatican,

138
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:27,900
but all state departments of the world subscribe to basically what our policies are,

139
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,240
and they can't appeal them.

140
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,680
You know what that means?

141
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,480
They tell all the state departments what to do, and you can't say no.

142
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,460
They used to have a website.

143
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,140
If anyone wants to find them, they were calling themselves something Vaticanus,

144
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,940
nothing to do with Catholicism.

145
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,560
So there's all these groups.

146
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,920
So that's what I mean by paint-by-numbers now.

147
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,560
You don't have to do much anymore because it's all international.

148
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:56,820
I've also been saying for a very long time there are no national enemies.

149
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,500
Everybody's in the same boat.

150
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:03,700
It's just like you have the NFL and the whatever, and then the other league,

151
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,640
and the baseball, they have the American League and the National League, right?

152
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,320
Right.

153
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,620
Well, at the end of the day, they're all under the banner of Major League Baseball, right?

154
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:12,320
Sure.

155
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,820
The divisions, right?

156
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:18,780
So each team is part of a different – they play the Super Bowl and the Stupid Bowl

157
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,380
and all that stuff.

158
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,120
Well, they're not really enemies because they get traded, don't they?

159
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,480
Players get traded from teams and all that, right?

160
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:25,940
Oh, yeah.

161
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:30,080
But it seems like they're having a war when they're on the field.

162
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:30,980
Get it?

163
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:31,800
You know, the theater?

164
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,440
Oh, sure.

165
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:32,760
A war.

166
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,980
So they're all the same.

167
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,520
They do – you can catch what I'm saying behind the scenes.

168
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,920
Like North Korea is supposed to be bad, but who's that basketball player, Rodman?

169
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,700
Rodman, yeah.

170
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,400
He goes and has dinner.

171
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,880
They love him there, right?

172
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,740
He has dinner with them.

173
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,300
But anybody else, you're a spy, right?

174
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,180
Mm-hmm.

175
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:53,240
Well, he gets sponsored by PotCoin, you know, so it's helpful.

176
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,880
You have the nuclear – you have the real Manhattan Project on 9-11.

177
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,820
So what does Iran do?

178
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:06,160
Because they're – you know, Obama gives them like $800 million in cash on a private airplane.

179
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,080
I don't know if you remember that.

180
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,460
That kind of went under the radar.

181
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,180
And they – what do they do?

182
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:18,660
They have the tallest building in Tehran, the PLASCO building, P-L-A-S-K-O.

183
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,180
Okay.

184
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,440
And there's a fire in it for three hours, and it suddenly collapses.

185
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,640
And when they go to clean up the debris, there's molten iron underground as they're digging it.

186
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:27,820
Right?

187
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,240
Get it?

188
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:28,720
Get it?

189
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,620
You know, it's justified.

190
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:34,920
So they say, we have nuclear devices also, you know, but not to tell the United –

191
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,760
the United States knows that.

192
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,520
They're not enemies.

193
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,900
There are no national enemies.

194
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,920
There is no – China is not a national enemy.

195
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,820
The current CCP was set up by the people who set up Roosevelt,

196
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,340
and the people who set up Roosevelt set up Stalin.

197
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,380
The people who set up Stalin set up Hitler.

198
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,080
You know, the New York Jewish accent, Hitler.

199
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,720
You want to talk about Hitler?

200
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,260
Anyway.

201
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,940
Well, I always find it funny when they bring up Mussolini, too,

202
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,080
because Mussolini is a little bit different.

203
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:06,700
But, you know, because he actually had this idea about unifying and creating –

204
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,880
because Italy, again, is a fabricated country, right,

205
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,620
which Mussolini is partially responsible for.

206
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,200
Yeah.

207
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,920
You know, but so he has –

208
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,160
Duque, right?

209
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:17,880
Wasn't he El Duque?

210
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,420
Well, El Duque, yeah.

211
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:23,720
But the thing is, he was part of fabricating that country, though,

212
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,720
because initially it was the kingdom of Sardinia, the kingdom of Sicily,

213
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,540
and what was left of Rome, right?

214
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,780
So you had these three things come together that were just battling city-states,

215
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:38,080
and he said, well, why don't we just, you know, form a cooperative here?

216
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,600
And they even instituted the Italian languages,

217
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,140
even instituted through the military.

218
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,280
It's funny because people think of it as, you know, this very ancient thing.

219
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,320
Italy has been around forever.

220
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,580
And I'm like, no, it hasn't, actually.

221
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,120
It's only – it's actually a younger country than America.

222
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,900
And they change their government every three years.

223
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:59,980
They've had like 50 different governments in the past 75 years since World War II.

224
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,900
But here's the thing about him.

225
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,120
He was a fall guy.

226
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,840
No one wanted to get in that power seat, let's say,

227
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,320
and declare the Vatican City a sovereign state.

228
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,620
Then whoever would do that would take a lot of flack for it, and he did it.

229
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,060
That was his job, by the way, to declare Vatican City a sovereign state.

230
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,800
So that's all he was good for, basically.

231
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,460
Yeah, it's –

232
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,280
But if you study it, I'm just saying it still stands, at least,

233
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,460
that unified thing that he created that people think of as Italy.

234
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:34,900
And, again, even the language was not something – because if you know about it, right,

235
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,720
Sardinians and Sicilians did not speak the same as Romans, okay?

236
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,340
They just didn't.

237
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,560
But they blended their language together.

238
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,440
And so you know about the Italian language, right?

239
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:46,640
Mm-hmm.

240
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,260
Yeah, so they –

241
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,980
Not in great detail about those differences, but, yeah,

242
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,780
I know that the North and the South are in a big contention always,

243
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,560
politically, culturally, and so on.

244
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,520
Well, right, but that's more of a monetary problem

245
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:05,440
because the South never was permitted to prosper under the same rules as the North did.

246
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:09,140
And it didn't matter if the country was unified or otherwise, right?

247
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,360
I mean, look, you've had enough Italian friends.

248
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,340
I'm sure you've heard a hundred different stories about this.

249
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:18,420
But, you know, there were a whole bunch of wars and things that nobody puts in the history books.

250
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,080
Mm-hmm.

251
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,800
Yeah, they call them civil wars.

252
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,460
They call them whatever – yeah, divisions.

253
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,100
Right.

254
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,720
Spain had similar stuff.

255
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,040
You know, like recently Catalan wanted to declare its independence, which is –

256
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,940
Catalanese is not Spanish.

257
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,540
But Franco here, we're talking about all these leaders.

258
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,820
Franco, you've got to really tip your hat off to him.

259
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,720
Yeah, there's an interesting –

260
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:38,960
Because he –

261
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,500
Nobody talks about him, by the way.

262
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,760
Nobody really –

263
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,160
Yeah.

264
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,140
You never see –

265
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,220
He gave everybody the finger.

266
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,120
After World War II, he says, look, I've got the best German technology,

267
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,840
and I know you guys want to do cessations of hostilities,

268
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,120
but if you think you're going to come over here and mess with me,

269
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,280
I'm going to give you some demonstrations.

270
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:01,640
And he used electric rockets to blow out – blow some American transports out of the air

271
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,820
that were crossing Gibraltar into the Mediterranean.

272
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,680
He radioed them and says, I know you've got a couple of transports with troops.

273
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,880
I want you to watch what happens.

274
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,620
And electric rockets from the Germans, not –

275
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,480
you know, so they're not powered by rocket fuel, you know,

276
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,640
chemicals coming out the SN.

277
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,840
These are powered by electricity.

278
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,360
Right.

279
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,940
And, you know, talk about hypersonics.

280
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,260
And so they said, okay, let's leave this crazy guy alone.

281
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:29,280
Well, that would explain why Spain was one of the only major nations in –

282
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,780
you know, there's been various skirmishes all across Europe constantly, right?

283
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,900
I mean, you can't even keep track of how many different little, you know,

284
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:41,080
civil wars and international, you know, one nation slugging it out with another one

285
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,320
for a couple of months, a couple of years at a time, left and right, right?

286
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,900
But you ever notice that Spain is like the only major country that nobody steps up to attack?

287
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:50,920
Nobody.

288
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:51,160
Yeah.

289
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,560
I mean, France is invaded constantly.

290
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,640
They still have enough of it.

291
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:59,480
Enough of it is dug up underground that they've got a lot of goodies that are 50-,

292
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,820
75-year-old ordnance that still rivals anything the Americans are telling you

293
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,960
in public that they have.

294
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:05,600
Right.

295
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,320
I mean, it's just – so that explains that.

296
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,640
Hey, you know, speaking about things that have been dug up,

297
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,600
and you were talking about, you know, how you sort of become the alpha

298
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,960
and inspire or, you know, give a few pointers to people and see where they go,

299
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:25,020
I did note in the chat that there's a few people starting to work with magnets a bit, huh?

300
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,940
Yeah, that's a good thing.

301
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,880
It's impressive.

302
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,980
Even if they don't do it well or right, according to what I've been professing lately,

303
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,820
it still works.

304
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:44,940
But what I'm really leaning on very heavily is when you pass the fluid near the magnet,

305
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,860
don't pass – make sure you're not passing it anywhere where everyone else is passing it,

306
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,280
like not where the magnet is reactive, right, or the center, the outer edge,

307
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,740
where nothing's going on is where you want it to be.

308
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,460
Right, not where the pole is, not where you're trying to actually –

309
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,100
you keep bringing it up, stick it to the refrigerator.

310
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:01,340
Yeah.

311
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,380
Oh, that sticks really hard.

312
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,460
That must be a strong magnet.

313
00:17:03,579 --> 00:17:04,060
No, no, no, no.

314
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,980
Go exactly in the opposite direction.

315
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:06,619
Not there.

316
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,400
And I haven't defined the block wall.

317
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:14,020
I just say put it on the block wall because, you know, enough people can look up what that means.

318
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:17,700
It's the center point where nothing – if you hold any shape magnet to the refrigerator,

319
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:22,140
you'll notice that there's part of the magnet that does not want to go to the refrigerator.

320
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,540
That's where you run the fluid.

321
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:28,300
Right, and I have several other ways to do it because some of the really large magnets

322
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:32,600
that I've been using lately, they're $500 magnets, right, for one magnet,

323
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,240
and it's not really cost effective.

324
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,960
I have a photo of one in the chat.

325
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:47,040
No, but if you want to spend money, you know, they make – you've heard of the band Monster Magnet, right?

326
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,460
No.

327
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,640
Well, there's a band called Monster Magnet from New Jersey,

328
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,020
and they got the name because they were UPS delivery guys

329
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:59,080
and they were delivering what was referred to as a monster magnet in the early 90s.

330
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,200
And I'm giving you this weird back story, but the thing is –

331
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,740
Yeah, they couldn't get it out of the truck.

332
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,260
Well, it was funny because it had to be handled just a certain way and all that,

333
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:11,420
but those magnets, if you want to spend a whole lot of money, you can.

334
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,640
Back then, those were the magnets for what they call MRI machines, right?

335
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,880
And they called them monster magnets.

336
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:23,880
And you don't need a giant expensive magnet to accomplish most things like that.

337
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,020
I mean, you know, what are you doing?

338
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,420
You're picking up cars?

339
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,260
You've seen the wreckers that pick up the cars, right?

340
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,740
Well, you do what's called a Halbach Array with small magnets,

341
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,340
but the thing here is there's a way to do it with any shape magnet.

342
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,340
You just stack them like they normally stack together

343
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:41,120
and then bend them around the, let's say, pipe if you're doing water.

344
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,640
And if you show it to an engineer or a scientist, they'll say,

345
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,420
that's not going to do anything.

346
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,400
That's not where the field is.

347
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,860
That's exactly how you want it.

348
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,680
But the thing that I'm excited about is there is a major reduction in mineral content

349
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,240
with no loss of volume.

350
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,860
What that means is this.

351
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:02,500
When you have a liquid and you have something diluted in it,

352
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,140
it affects the volume of the liquid, right?

353
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,000
To a degree.

354
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,120
And when you remove that, whatever is diluted in the liquid,

355
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,420
you should have a change of volume and weight, and there isn't with this.

356
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,220
So where is it going?

357
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,240
Where are the minerals going?

358
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,560
And when I first started measuring this,

359
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:21,300
I noticed a 40 to 60 percent decrease in mineral content.

360
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,360
And I thought, I've got to go buy a new meter.

361
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,980
There's something wrong, right?

362
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,340
Then I get a report back from someone else.

363
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,620
They noticed the same amount of decrease.

364
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,620
I'm like, well, a meter is just fine, right?

365
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,080
And then someone else noticed the same kind of decrease

366
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,220
and said, wow, this is really playing with the ether.

367
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,320
So this is even more exciting.

368
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,640
Yeah, I want to ask a couple of stupid questions, if you don't mind, about that,

369
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,620
because here's where it doesn't make sense, right?

370
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,580
I mean, literally speaking, if I was to think, okay, you have mineral content in water,

371
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:54,920
and if the mineral content is removed, if it's no longer present,

372
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,780
then that means you must have removed a substance from the water.

373
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:06,440
If you didn't remove it, and it appears to have the same exact volume in whole, right?

374
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,960
The whole thing has the same volume, whether it has the minerals present or not.

375
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:10,860
Where did it go?

376
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,160
And in fact, what is actually keeping the content of the water at the same volume

377
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,160
if you didn't remove anything?

378
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,400
So here's my stupid question.

379
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:24,780
Doesn't that mean that you've literally come up with a way to have something be transmuted,

380
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,180
turned into something else?

381
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,180
Into water, yeah.

382
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,980
If it spends enough time in the water, those minerals are water-based, right?

383
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,580
So the minerals become more water.

384
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:37,240
Yeah.

385
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,860
Okay, I know it sounds like a dumb question.

386
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,220
It's not a big deal.

387
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,000
They don't want to, the establishment is, they're morons, right?

388
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,200
I mean, you know how I've said this.

389
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:52,240
If you spend more than, by the eighth grade, if you haven't realized you've been bullshitted to,

390
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,200
and you're going to be bullshitted the rest of your life,

391
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,100
and you continue past the eighth grade and get university,

392
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:01,220
you deserve to be bullshitted to even more because it's pretty obvious.

393
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,920
So these guys, you know, they're in bad shape.

394
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,660
But transmutation is a bad word.

395
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,920
Ether is a bad word, all these things.

396
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,240
So you don't have to use those words.

397
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,300
You can use other words.

398
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,300
What's the use of transmutation?

399
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,520
I mean, because that's all I can think of.

400
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,340
That's what would happen.

401
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:21,720
If you turn something into something else, I mean, other people would say,

402
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,480
Oh, that's alchemy.

403
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,720
But no, that's not alchemy exactly.

404
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:25,540
It is.

405
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:31,380
It is alchemy because alchemy means you're using the spirit, you know, the essence of the human.

406
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,740
And by the way, you need to be like a, quote, unquote,

407
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:41,980
a special person spiritually to be an alchemist, just like to be a shaman or a magi.

408
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:48,260
By the way, it's funny, I put sorcerer in a translate to see what it was in Greek, and it's magi.

409
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,120
Okay.

410
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:49,940
Magus, right?

411
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:50,140
Right.

412
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,360
Very interesting, right?

413
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,560
So you need to be above the rest.

414
00:21:54,680 --> 00:22:00,140
In other words, lesser people can't do this kind of stuff, alchemy, you know, in the traditional form.

415
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,900
Like when you read about, like you watch Lord of the Rings, they show the wizard.

416
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,980
He's a higher being, you know, as terms of humans are concerned, right?

417
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:15,500
They have to be very sensitive and sensible and very much aware of their own stuff.

418
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:21,000
You know, they've already learned to cancel the voice in their head, which we could get into a little bit.

419
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,820
I've been getting a lot of feedback on that.

420
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,200
And people are starting to talk about it more and more, by the way, I heard on the Internet, synchronicity.

421
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:34,140
Well, actually, yeah, that's funny because people totally separate from you or people that I know listen to you.

422
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,800
I have taken note that a few people are talking about this now.

423
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,220
And, you know, look, not the same way you are.

424
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,780
But they are beginning to mention it.

425
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:48,160
And that was not present even a year ago, I'm sure.

426
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,580
No, not even recently.

427
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,920
It's because you have to be in tune with there's a collective, but you don't want to be part of the collective.

428
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,600
But you just kind of look, you're a cattle rancher, right?

429
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,920
You're not a cow, you're a man.

430
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,100
But you have to be in tune with the herd, right?

431
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,220
There's nothing wrong with being a cattle rancher and being in tune with the herd.

432
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,540
It's totally fine.

433
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:12,560
But once you become part of the herd, well, now you've got a problem, right?

434
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,840
Well, look, it's good to know when a stampede is coming.

435
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,840
I mean, you should be in tune enough to know that, right?

436
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:17,540
Sure.

437
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,120
And you also want to know what calms them down, too, right?

438
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:21,680
Oh, yeah.

439
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,700
Just for your own self-defense, right?

440
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:27,020
Yeah, and also it doesn't have to be cows or sheep.

441
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,260
It could be fish and birds.

442
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,120
But, yeah, so where are we going with this?

443
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,580
There's no national enemies de facto and du jour.

444
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,080
You live in a de facto.

445
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:43,860
Okay, it's a de facto world, but it's not like they're imposing things on people.

446
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,120
The people want it that way.

447
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,900
They're accommodating the people, right?

448
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:52,240
I think I've mentioned to you before, I was at the pharmacy, drugstore,

449
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,880
one of these big chain ones getting various sundries, gauze and things like that

450
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,740
to re-up a first aid kit.

451
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:04,400
And there was a man, a tall, skinny, white guy in his late 70s, probably 80,

452
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,840
yelling at the pharmacist about why they're taking so long

453
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,960
to get his blood pressure medication, right?

454
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,280
Because if he doesn't get it, he'll die.

455
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,920
And I was like, oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh, where do you start with that guy?

456
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,200
What did you decide to do with that guy?

457
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:23,000
I'm curious because I know you probably sat there and said, oh, my,

458
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,540
and shook your head at least.

459
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,160
He's a goner.

460
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:26,800
He's dead.

461
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,780
He just doesn't know it.

462
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,460
He's one of those, like the Christ said, let the dead bury the dead, right?

463
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,320
See, I don't know.

464
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,480
When I hear people uttering things that are completely ignorant, though,

465
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:41,760
I often feel obligated to step forward and see if they don't want to be ignorant

466
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,000
for a moment.

467
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,680
I don't know why.

468
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:49,820
He was enraged, and he was one of these nuisance individuals

469
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:54,000
where you need one of those bug zappers, a big one, like an eight-foot one

470
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,900
that you'd slam him with.

471
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,820
But anyway, that's not my job.

472
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,340
That's public service that someone else is going to have to do.

473
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,940
But here's the thing.

474
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,660
What I do with the pharmacists is I always go, when they're not busy,

475
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,320
I get their attention, and I point to the blood pressure machine.

476
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,440
You put coin in it, right?

477
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,000
Oh, yeah.

478
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:11,340
You sit down.

479
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,880
You put your arm in it.

480
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,720
You put the coin in it.

481
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,660
Where do I get one of these?

482
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,540
I need one of these.

483
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,020
And he's like, well, why do you want it?

484
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:18,620
He says, I don't know.

485
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,420
We just rent it, you know, or we share, you know, whatever.

486
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,780
They pay or we pay to have it here.

487
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,600
I said, well, why do you want it?

488
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,460
And I said, because I'm starting a museum on medical quackery and fakery,

489
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,200
and this is going to be one of the displays.

490
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,540
And they kind of looked at me, and they nodded their head.

491
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,740
None of them defended.

492
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,060
You know, you could say they're busy and what they're doing.

493
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:42,440
But one day, one guy, when I said that, I went around.

494
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,140
I did some more shopping in the store.

495
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,840
It's one of these large, you know, grocery stores or like a Safeway type thing.

496
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,380
And he was leaving.

497
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,700
It was the end of his shift.

498
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,660
And he says, so really?

499
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,300
Is it medical fakery and quackery?

500
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,560
And I went over, and he just agreed with everything I said.

501
00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:00,280
I gave him five minutes of Greek speak on how the body works, and he says, yeah, that's right.

502
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,640
But he just goes back and does what he does, you see.

503
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,280
So his moral and ethical content.

504
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,300
Anyone who is moral ethical will say, I better quit my job.

505
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,120
This sucks, right?

506
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,140
So that's the de facto.

507
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,920
The people, they know what's wrong.

508
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,520
This is, you know, and they just keep going along with it.

509
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,700
That's why I keep saying it.

510
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:21,280
You cannot have a better society with the people that are here now.

511
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:28,720
So you don't think it's moral or ethical to sit there and leave it there and tell people maybe, hey, look, you know, let me enlighten you to something here.

512
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,900
You know that that's a bunch of bullshit sitting there, right?

513
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:37,700
I mean, you don't think that that could be a useful thing to do to try and get people to start to think about it, that at least maybe there's something to.

514
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,120
Not these people.

515
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:45,520
What you would do, let's say you told me tomorrow the population will be down to just a few million across the world.

516
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,640
Then you can travel and every hundred miles you see a dozen people.

517
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,860
You could talk to those people.

518
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,260
Oh, OK.

519
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:53,520
Right?

520
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,640
But not the masses that are here now.

521
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,500
They're goners.

522
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,880
They were goners a long, long time ago.

523
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:03,020
They were goners when the World War started because they would have never gone for it.

524
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:07,200
And by the way, you don't hear about the call about World War II, the Great Generation, all this bullshit.

525
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:18,460
All the protests against fighting the Pacific and the European theater, there were huge protests and they've been completely scrubbed from history.

526
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:26,980
The only way you can hear about that now is if you talk to somebody who was alive then who remembers because that's it.

527
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,820
There's no books on that.

528
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:34,660
Even up until the Vietnam War, a lot of people were jailed, especially of the black community.

529
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,240
Directly?

530
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:35,500
Hell no.

531
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:36,660
Yeah.

532
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,340
Muhammad Ali was one of them, right?

533
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,240
They call them protesters.

534
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,460
How many people went up to Canada, right?

535
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:41,840
And all that.

536
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,160
Even that was covered up to a degree.

537
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:49,040
But, yeah, so the de facto and de jure, I've revisited this because it's all de facto.

538
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:58,340
But when enough people, we're not talking about just the 20 or 30 percent, let's say sort of a requirement to keep the entire population in check.

539
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,600
But it seems like everyone, if you're going along with it, right, you're still part of that de facto system.

540
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,660
So is there really a de facto and de jure?

541
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,760
I think it's all de facto.

542
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:15,600
I think the last time I kind of ranted about no one is following anything that they have memorialized in their reference books at all.

543
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:25,280
That's why it's interesting if you read old encyclopedias, let's say the authors or the compilers of encyclopedias,

544
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:34,780
there were companies that hired people to do research and compile encyclopedia definitions and stories about the subject matter.

545
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,340
You look up in an encyclopedia.

546
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,660
Yeah, they just aggregate all kinds of information.

547
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,440
Yeah, they were not part of the standard academic community.

548
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,700
They were encyclopedia compilers, right?

549
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:48,640
And they weren't invited to the same parties that the academics were in all this.

550
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:55,580
So when you read the old encyclopedias, they put little digs, especially with scientific stuff.

551
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:01,400
When you read in an old encyclopedia, they'll put a little dig against the academic community if you know how to pick it up, right?

552
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:05,380
It's kind of funny if you're reading it with comprehension.

553
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:12,660
Like we look up water, they'll tell you, you know, one cubic centimeter or one gram of water is supposed to be one gram of water.

554
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:17,620
But it's really not because when they took the measurements in the reference books, it was at room temperature, not at 39.

555
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:20,240
So it's really 0.99994, right?

556
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,200
So it's like a dig, you know, that's basically telling you that, you know.

557
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,540
There's lots of little digs that you'll see in old encyclopedias against the academic community.

558
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:34,340
So I feel like the sentiment that I have against academia is not I'm not against academia.

559
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,080
I'm just against what they're doing, the same with the attorneys and the doctors.

560
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,680
It's not I'm not against attorneys or doctors.

561
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:45,520
It's just that the ones that we have worldwide are not doing what they're supposed to be doing, right?

562
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:50,940
So and there really are going to movies on the job.

563
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,020
You know, imagine going to work in a factory.

564
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,260
You put the punch card in and then you go to the movies.

565
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,840
That's not what you were hired for, right?

566
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:06,540
You know, but maybe it was actually because if you're supposed to do nothing and make nothing move forward, make nothing be accomplished.

567
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,340
Well, then you are doing your job, aren't you?

568
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:09,720
Yeah.

569
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,020
You're doing the job you were given anyway.

570
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,040
You know, that's what it's like.

571
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:24,560
Yeah, I actually thought of this last week because I had somebody on my show that I had a thing that went on where people could sign up to volunteer to be guests on the show.

572
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,360
People I've never met before, you know, didn't encounter on my own.

573
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,960
And the one guy made a documentary, which I don't know.

574
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,280
I don't know what you would think of it.

575
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:36,660
I actually meant to pass it by you, and I don't think I've gotten to it yet.

576
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:43,980
But the premise of this, he starts, you know, he talks about COVID and all this and how it's a big scam, right?

577
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:50,380
But he's coming at it from a slightly different angle, and I'm sort of surprised that this has been allowed to even exist.

578
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,260
It's been out for a couple of years now.

579
00:30:53,120 --> 00:31:02,080
He attacks the whole thing about virology and how this is like just quackery and that, you know, viruses are quackery.

580
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:09,320
And, you know, look, at a certain point, there was just this ridiculousness where they started agreeing that viruses are what's making people sick.

581
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:14,940
And I said to myself, you know, that is vaguely what the Greek has kind of said.

582
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:23,020
I know it's not exactly the same, but it's very similar to a lot of what you've said about the medical community and the things that, you know, on and on.

583
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:27,420
I mean, when we touched on COVID on here, you pretty much said very similar things.

584
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:34,820
But he was breaking it down and showing people that, like, even the concept of this is a virus and everything else is all a bunch of fiction.

585
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:35,820
It's garbage.

586
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,020
Well, I've been saying the same things.

587
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:43,620
If you took a transcript of what I said about the medical community in the 1980s, mid-'80s,

588
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:51,580
and you took a transcript of what I've said about it recently and you held the two transcripts up to the light, it would be identical.

589
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:55,960
I haven't really changed because I've been watching it closely and studying it.

590
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:00,860
I stopped studying it over a decade ago because I found out that they're no longer doing research.

591
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:01,620
Well, nothing new.

592
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,860
There's no reason for it.

593
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,320
It's so funny, though, because I think you would find it interesting.

594
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:07,720
This is weird.

595
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:11,520
I don't think I ever recommend a documentary to you, but I think you might want to look at this one.

596
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,880
Okay, well, are you familiar?

597
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,720
There was a major lawsuit.

598
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,740
Well, it became major sort of in the 1990s.

599
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:25,160
A group of doctors in Germany were suing the textbook companies and whatever for writing down viruses.

600
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:33,960
It went on for about a decade, and at the end, in a little court date thing, they said, well, it's inconclusive,

601
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:39,660
so the doctor that's suing the textbook companies for talking about viruses and the health authorities has to pay their legal fees

602
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,560
because you can't conclude this case.

603
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,200
So that's how they shut him up.

604
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:49,600
Yeah, he touched upon that in the documentary but didn't really give us the conclusion to it

605
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,660
because the whole thing ends up being kind of tossed aside as inconclusive.

606
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,980
And the medical establishment, yeah.

607
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:00,160
Well, the medical establishment just basically said, look, it doesn't matter if it's real or not.

608
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,660
This is the direction we're going in.

609
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:07,160
I mean, that was the general point after an hour of listening to this whole thing.

610
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:12,440
And he was going to people that were scientists and stuff going, you know, look, here's what the scientific method should be,

611
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,440
and here's what they did, and they were trying to illustrate it.

612
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,520
So I just, I don't know.

613
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,460
I found it interesting.

614
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:18,660
Well, you're not.

615
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:24,100
Title 12 U.S.C. 411 says it all, you know, about the lawful money.

616
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:24,540
Right.

617
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,100
The Federal Reserve.

618
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:30,760
You're not authorized to use the money, so everyone's using it, so you're a scofflaw.

619
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,400
Your scofflaw means that you know the law, you just don't care about it, right?

620
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,000
So, yeah.

621
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:41,640
Speaking of medical, I want to throw in something on the cancer thing we did last time.

622
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:49,340
A while back, when you study just a segue in a way, people fear it, right?

623
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:53,560
And, by the way, most people that I diagnosed with cancer don't have cancer.

624
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,720
They get sick from the treatment, just like AIDS or whatever, right?

625
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,520
You know AIDS is completely fabricated, right?

626
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,080
I think just to recap.

627
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:06,700
Another thing that was in that documentary, by the way, is how that was all a complete hoax as well.

628
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:12,739
It's just like 19 Arab hijackers vaporized the World Trade Center with box cutters.

629
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:13,860
It's that stupid.

630
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:17,199
You know, when I tell this to people, they say, that's not how the story goes.

631
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:17,639
Oh, really?

632
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,820
Well, tell me the official story then and compare it.

633
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,340
It's so stupid.

634
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:26,159
So, the AIDS thing is that first, they always do propaganda.

635
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,280
You know, get the test, get the test.

636
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:33,219
And once you get the test and they decide to make it positive, just like the COVID, by the way.

637
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,620
I met a nurse at the smoke shop.

638
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:42,699
Because I was talking in Project Event 201 in November.

639
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:43,600
Oh, yeah, right.

640
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:49,159
In 2019, I was telling people, watch what they're going to do with this because they're ready to lock down 100 million people in China.

641
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,820
There's an example that you could lock.

642
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:54,960
If you could lock down 100 million people, you could lock down 500 million.

643
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,360
If you could lock down 500 million, you could lock down a billion.

644
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:00,500
If you could lock down a billion, you could lock down 5 billion, right?

645
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:03,480
So, I was saying this before it all started.

646
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,940
And it's all a fraud.

647
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:10,060
But I met a nurse and she says, yeah, we got 10 COVID tests.

648
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,000
We put on gloves.

649
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,600
We went into a clean room.

650
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:18,400
We took them out of the delivery package and just opened all the packages and then put them back in the send-back packages.

651
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,440
Nothing touched anything.

652
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,280
And seven out of the ten came back positive.

653
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:23,500
Right?

654
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,780
It's all scam.

655
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,780
No sample whatsoever.

656
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:31,340
You're telling me no sample whatsoever in a clean room and they just send them back?

657
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,420
Because when you get the box, it has the tests and then the package you're supposed to send it back.

658
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:43,480
And all they did was transfer it out of the new, open the package and transfer it into the send-back package without touching anything.

659
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,840
And sterile.

660
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,220
Nice.

661
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:50,300
In a clean room with gloves and masks and everything to, you know, a nurse-type setup.

662
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,060
Make sure it doesn't touch anything.

663
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,640
Very little contact with the air.

664
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,080
And 70% came back positive.

665
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:56,820
It's complete fraud.

666
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,040
And they do that.

667
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:05,880
And when people working in the hospital say this is a fraud, the administrators will say, well, you know, you know, you know.

668
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,060
That's all they would say.

669
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:07,340
Right?

670
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,260
It's about money.

671
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,460
Right?

672
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:13,440
So the AIDS thing was very similar, actually worse.

673
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:21,400
What they did is once you got the AIDS test, which was not a test for anything, actually it was like a PCR-type test.

674
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:27,480
I told people if you take an AIDS, if you want to test positive on it, eat a raw steak, like rare steak or a couple of hamburgers.

675
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:35,680
And four or five hours, the PCR will always show an explosion of those mucus in the blood, let's say pus in the blood from eating meat.

676
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:42,560
But what they do is once you test positive, they have your information, contact information, right?

677
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,920
Because they won't test you.

678
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,280
How do you know you got positive?

679
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,500
Because they contacted you.

680
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:50,240
They'd send a barrage of contacts.

681
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,680
Well, you know, they don't say you have AIDS.

682
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,340
They said you tested positive for a very serious thing.

683
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,460
You should consider treatment.

684
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,240
Three days later, you get another envelope.

685
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,380
You tested very serious for this.

686
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:07,820
If you really want to continue in your life, and they start telling you about yourself, you have two children, this and that, you should consider treatment.

687
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,920
Well, once you start getting the treatment, then you come down with AIDS, right?

688
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:20,500
Basically, the AIDS treatment is a hormone that the body naturally produces when a cell is replaced, epithelial apoptosis.

689
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,400
Apoptosis is when the cells are replaced in the body.

690
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,600
Some are replaced daily.

691
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:36,160
And when the cell falls off and goes out to be distributed, turns into energy, and then it's excreted, again, as material, a hormone is produced.

692
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:36,580
I forgot.

693
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:39,920
There's three or four different hormones stemmed from the same thing.

694
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,600
So what they do is that AIDS treatment has that drug, that hormone in it.

695
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:50,400
So when you take the treatment, it tells the body that the cells have been replaced.

696
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,860
But they haven't been.

697
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:59,320
So your cells start falling off internally and externally, but they're not replaced because the body's been tricked thinking that they're replaced.

698
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,580
And you start looking like crap.

699
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,660
You get all the sores.

700
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,820
You whittle away.

701
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:07,100
Children get these big tumors of fat under the skin, and you die.

702
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:11,420
And, of course, everybody claps their hands because you died of AIDS.

703
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,400
Stay away from whatever, you know?

704
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,020
It validates it, right?

705
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:20,700
Just like the people who were put on ventilators during COVID, and they were not given any water for a week.

706
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:22,440
They jam the ventilator.

707
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,240
They sedate them.

708
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,320
Make sure they give them extra sedation.

709
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,960
No water, no food, very little.

710
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:32,500
And they adjust the mixture just right until you cease to exist.

711
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,160
And I know two people that have gone that way.

712
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,320
And I have no pity for them whatsoever because I told them, you go to the hospital, you're going to die.

713
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,780
So, you know, that's the thing.

714
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,020
Actually, their family didn't either.

715
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,480
They said, we knew that was going to happen.

716
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,460
That's really interesting, right, how humans really work.

717
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,440
It just shows you you're just passing through here.

718
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:56,480
Death is not as big of a deal as it's been made.

719
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:02,500
You know, in ancient times, the more people cried for someone when they died, the more honorable they were.

720
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:08,000
So what you did is you went and hired mourners, professional mourners, to come to the funeral.

721
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,940
And what they did was they stood around where they were in high visibility areas, and they cried and cried and cried for hours.

722
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,520
Talk about vanity.

723
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:20,480
That's the kind of vanity that, remember when the cell phones came out in the 90s?

724
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:20,960
Right.

725
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,720
It was like, oh, wow, you know.

726
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:26,800
Well, China made like 500 million fake cell phones, passed them out.

727
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:30,880
So in China, people, you know, they were walking around like they had a cell phone.

728
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,680
It was a piece of plastic.

729
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:32,400
Vanity, right?

730
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,240
It was a marker of prestige.

731
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,200
Yeah, exactly.

732
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:40,520
So this is what, you know, the play on death is, is they see, oh, I'm so sorry.

733
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:46,140
That's why it's like don't ever invite me to do a eulogy or whatever, because I'm going to tell you the truth about the person.

734
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:52,860
You know, I've been, even with family members, do you want me to go to the eulogy and actually stand up and tell everyone what a scumbag this person was?

735
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:53,700
No, no, don't do it.

736
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,400
You better not come.

737
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:54,980
Yeah.

738
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:55,360
Right?

739
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:59,120
So, yeah, I'm not going to mince words on that.

740
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,300
Just tell them what should be said.

741
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,220
So let's stop.

742
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,740
You know, it's very simple.

743
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,880
So that's how that works with the AIDS thing.

744
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:13,100
And, actually, there's a lot of medical people that know this, but they just go along with it, you know.

745
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,060
So what do you call it when you're an accomplice?

746
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,380
That's a criminal thing, too.

747
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,220
Right.

748
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:31,000
So, yeah, cancer, one of the things that I spoke through about it was tagged on with the allergies and all that, is that in a complex way, this is very advanced, by the way,

749
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:42,840
the material that you find in these tumors is either a biogenesis of the body reproducing teeth or hair inside of a tumor that's under, like behind someone's kidney, let's say.

750
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,040
How can you have teeth and hair in it once they remove it, right?

751
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:49,040
The body is just flipping out, and I'll talk about that.

752
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:54,500
But in some of the fluids, when they're tested, it's plant matter, right?

753
00:40:54,500 --> 00:41:04,100
In other words, it's not like chewed up plant matter, but it has the same material that you find in pre-digested or semi-digested plant matter or meat.

754
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:14,120
The food that goes into the body, that energetically goes into the blood by the intestines through induction, reverts back to food.

755
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:18,300
So if it reverts back to food when it's in the blood, it's very, very dangerous, right?

756
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:22,520
You know, you don't imagine injecting someone with spinach juice, right?

757
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:29,240
You don't want to have, like, a steak, you know, a purified steak in your blood injected, and that would be messy.

758
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,460
Yeah, so this is what's happening.

759
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:41,480
Now, from the other hand, what they call a cancerous tumor or malignant and all this other stuff is the body is in such disorder that, for example,

760
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:46,300
I have a hazmat manual somewhere, you know, the hazardous material.

761
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:52,120
And a lot of the stuff is very practical, by the way, the hazmat manuals, because it's about spillage control.

762
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:57,460
Usually with hazmat, it's liquids and gases, mostly liquids, and how to stop.

763
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:00,700
So when the liquid spills, the first thing you've got to do is stop it from spreading.

764
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:06,500
So they have, like, these tubes, like sandbags, right, like these 10-foot-long sandbags that you lay down on the ground, and they're heavy.

765
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,180
They prevent the liquid from spilling, right?

766
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,780
Well, that's what the body is doing with cysts and tumors.

767
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:14,460
There is an energetic flow in the body.

768
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,060
The left side, the energy flows down.

769
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,340
On the right side of the body, the energy flows up, both men and women.

770
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:28,760
The way that it works, the difference between men and women is from the top down.

771
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:33,300
When you're looking at the crown of the head, one is counterclockwise, one is clockwise when they're standing up.

772
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,820
But the energetic flow, the general major flow in the body, the entire left,

773
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:45,100
you just draw a line through your nose and center your head down through the groin, between your legs, your left leg, your whole entire left side.

774
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,580
Energy goes down, right side energy goes up.

775
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:55,200
So you'll notice that these energy points, where the tumors form along the body,

776
00:42:55,320 --> 00:43:00,640
is what level of energy is either being blocked or is deficient.

777
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:08,360
So when an energy needs to be blocked, and let's say you're eating foods and chemicals and things,

778
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,440
that the energy is always rising and it has to be discharged.

779
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:16,300
When it gets to the left side of the body, that kind of energy needs to be discharged upwards.

780
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:19,560
But the side that discharges energy upwards is completely saturated,

781
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,080
so it starts to go on the side that wants to go down.

782
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:28,740
Let's say the left side, and it doesn't want it to go down, so it puts a tumor there to block it.

783
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:31,560
So the tumor kind of, it's like the hazmat sandbags, right?

784
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:36,200
So what it's telling you is that you've got a messed up energy flow.

785
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,380
It's all energy because there's no absorption, right?

786
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:44,320
So when you take nutrition in the intestine, it's broken down into energy,

787
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:48,860
just like you would transmit a signal, and it's received on the inside of the body,

788
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:53,300
and then it rematerializes like the Star Trek beaming up into the material that the body needs, right?

789
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:53,840
Okay.

790
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:59,840
So that energy, even when the cells can't use it or don't want to use it,

791
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:03,500
once it gets until the wrong, if it's an energy that's supposed to go down,

792
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,800
and you have too much of that, once it gets to the right side,

793
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,220
which is where all the energy goes up, it'll form a tumor.

794
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:13,180
So it's very interesting when I've spoken to oncologists and this and that,

795
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:15,180
what side, where's the tumor?

796
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,800
Is it on the left side or the right side?

797
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,280
And depending on what side it's on, it's, oh, this person's doing too much of this.

798
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,320
You found this in their blades.

799
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:23,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

800
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:28,160
How can you figure that out just from the side of the body that it's on, right?

801
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:29,660
Duh, you know?

802
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:31,800
But they're not taught any of this.

803
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:38,180
So what these tumors are and these cancers that form that are measurable tissue,

804
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:41,360
it could be on the skin anyway, internally, it could be external,

805
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:46,240
they're blockages just like the hazmat sandbags to stop,

806
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:48,260
and it has to do with up and down, right?

807
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,360
The left side going down, the right side going up.

808
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,600
Very, very interesting.

809
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,340
I just wanted to mention that's what it is.

810
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:58,380
And, by the way, let's go back to the hazmat.

811
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:04,920
If you've got to call a hazmat crew in to come and put leak or spillage protection down,

812
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:08,580
that's pretty serious stuff, isn't it?

813
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,360
Well, it is.

814
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,640
They make you do it, though.

815
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:14,600
Okay, so I told you I ran gas stations,

816
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,420
and allegedly we were supposed to do that if one gallon of gas hits the ground,

817
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:20,160
we're supposed to call in a hazmat crew, right?

818
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:22,880
Yeah, they got the absorbers and all that.

819
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,820
Yeah, but I mean, generally speaking, in a practical sense, look,

820
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:29,560
I mean, I could keep a bag of kitty litter around and control small spills.

821
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:30,700
You know what I mean?

822
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,260
Not that big a deal.

823
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,800
But that was the general consensus is that you had to call them in,

824
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:41,520
and every industry like that has a level that they determine,

825
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,400
okay, you know, you've got this dangerous whatever,

826
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,060
and you have different ways that you're supposed to act,

827
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:51,400
and eventually, yeah, you call in a team that's dedicated to dealing with it,

828
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,720
and that's that, right?

829
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,680
Sure, it could be over, but that's a good point you made.

830
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:56,160
You know why?

831
00:45:56,260 --> 00:46:00,640
Because a lot of the missed, no doctor will say you have cancer and sign to it.

832
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:02,240
They'll show you a lab report,

833
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,600
and it says, oh, because it has a presence of this and that,

834
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:06,000
and it could be one cell, right?

835
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:10,960
And a lot of people go under therapy and they, you know, whatever.

836
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,240
So, yeah, it could be over, like you said, one gallon.

837
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,860
It could be one cell on the test, and they say you have cancer, right,

838
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,700
which was just something that appeared and disappeared.

839
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:24,500
Well, that's why I found it interesting that people started just getting, you know,

840
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:28,380
like these melanoma, they were calling it, you know, being removed from the skin,

841
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:31,540
and it's like, okay, so you got rid of the cancer on the skin,

842
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,720
and then that's the end of it, right?

843
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,860
And, no, it's not because, you know, they have to actually cut around

844
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,960
and take away some healthy tissue and this and that,

845
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,520
and the next thing you know is then they got you in treatment,

846
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,400
and then the treatment makes them sick, and I go, oh, man, you know.

847
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,080
Yeah, I wouldn't remove it like that.

848
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:49,700
It depends, because when they remove the healthy tissue,

849
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,780
see, the reason it's there is to block an energy,

850
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,060
and when you remove the extra tissue around it, now it's like, wait a second,

851
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:01,000
we need that to block the energy, so now we got to spread more in a bigger area.

852
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,020
That's usually what happens.

853
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:07,040
I've heard many people whose parents go to a medical technician.

854
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,060
Calling them doctors, they're not deserving of that.

855
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:12,980
But you would have a spot on their ankle, and they remove that,

856
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:15,500
and it gets infected, then they have to remove the leg,

857
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:17,580
and then they get cancer, and then they die, right?

858
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:20,920
So if they left the spot there, it would have fallen off in a year or two,

859
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:23,440
depending if it's on the left or the right.

860
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:28,200
Usually the society that we live in, it's eating chemicals and expansive things,

861
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:32,760
what's called the yin type foods, expansive, very fast-moving,

862
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:38,200
high-dispersing energy, chemicals, plants that are from the tropics,

863
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:39,300
out of season, all that.

864
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:40,480
It's mostly too much yin.

865
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:43,640
And it discharges on the right side of the body,

866
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:46,140
but if you have too much of it, it has to go over to the other side

867
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:48,340
and discharge from there, right?

868
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,740
Just like if you put too much gasoline in the piston,

869
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:53,020
it's going to come out the exhaust, raw gasoline, right?

870
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,900
That's where you get that backfiring, right?

871
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:58,040
So it's going to backfire to the left side of the body,

872
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,860
and the body's like, we don't want this upward energy, only downward energy,

873
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:04,500
so it forms a tumor on the left side, depending on what height of the body.

874
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,300
Usually it's center mass.

875
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,720
If it's legs or arms, it'll be on the skin.

876
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,520
So basically eating a holistic diet, fasting first,

877
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,080
and we'll normalize the body.

878
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:25,080
Some things that get stuck inside the membrane of the body,

879
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:28,660
literally like World Trade Center,

880
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:31,320
if you were there that day, you breathe that dust in.

881
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,140
If it happened to be from deep underground,

882
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:36,540
it's going to be irradiating you from the inside out

883
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:39,860
if you have the physical dust in your lungs, right?

884
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:42,580
If it goes through the body, your intestines, and you swallow,

885
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:45,480
it'll come out in a few days, and you might actually feel better from it,

886
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:46,800
give you a little boost.

887
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:51,100
But if it gets stuck in the lungs, it's microwaving you,

888
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,380
irradiating you day and night, day and night, day and night,

889
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,360
and the body needs to block that, and it forms cancers.

890
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:01,500
And it's funny, there was a fireman that, before the towers came down,

891
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:03,640
he was running towards the building,

892
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,960
and about 20 feet in front of him, the sidewalk exploded,

893
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:10,160
and a stream of hot steam went up about 50 feet in the air.

894
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,920
And he kind of, even though he was far away from it,

895
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:16,760
he got blasted by it, and he had to have his nose removed

896
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:19,080
because he had all these melanomas developing on his face.

897
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:21,860
And he still didn't, you know, you told me it was nuclear.

898
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,140
He said, oh, no, they never told us it was nuclear.

899
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:28,000
And he's having all these cancers that are only caused by radiation.

900
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,460
So, you know, you can't help people like that.

901
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,940
And that's why the truth will never get out to the masses.

902
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:36,260
Well, you know, because Christy Todd Whitman would never lie to anybody or anything, right?

903
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:37,280
Right, right.

904
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,580
But it's all, look, Napoleon lied.

905
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,420
Everybody, they go all the way back.

906
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:43,540
Caesar lied, you know.

907
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:45,160
It goes all the way back.

908
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:47,140
It's just the way business is done.

909
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:52,000
So, yeah, so the cancer thing is really your body's trying to block it.

910
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:54,620
Now, here's, I've been getting some messages on food.

911
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:59,940
The last time I did discuss one way to, a healthy body, healthy mind, right,

912
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,240
and healthy mind, healthy body.

913
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:06,200
So if you have a healthy body, the mind will function better, right?

914
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:07,520
Well, one assists the other.

915
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:08,980
And if you have a healthy mind, you keep the body healthy.

916
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,080
Well, one will assist the other anyway, right?

917
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,520
I mean, if you physically feel better, your mind is clearer.

918
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,780
And if your mind is clearer, you'll physically feel better.

919
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,400
I mean, it's just simple.

920
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,180
I mean, that's observable, right?

921
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:22,560
I mean, that's, I don't know how much more to simplify that.

922
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:28,980
And the easiest way to do that is to put what the body works best with, which is whole food.

923
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:36,020
And it could be, I kind of talked about macrobiotics because of the analogies.

924
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,980
Like I said, when they first started introducing,

925
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:41,300
I knew Shizuko Yamamoto and Michio Kushi personally.

926
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:46,260
And when they first came in the crew, when they landed from Japan and California,

927
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,900
like I said many times, it's worth repeating,

928
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:53,120
they would do these public seminars, invite the public in to introduce them to eating.

929
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:56,360
It was basically a modified Japanese diet, right,

930
00:50:56,360 --> 00:51:02,120
but with whole foods and no meats, no four-legged animals generally.

931
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:06,860
And the only repeat people that kept coming back were the hippies.

932
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:10,900
And they stopped one day and said, okay, no one else is coming back but you guys.

933
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:12,260
Why do you keep coming back?

934
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:17,100
It's because when we eat the brown rice, we feel high all the time and we don't have to buy drugs.

935
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,520
So what's wrong with that, right?

936
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:21,500
And it's true.

937
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:26,240
Like for example, I suggest people get some Lundberg brown rice.

938
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:28,560
It's the only, okay.

939
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,080
Let me just do a little diversion.

940
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:32,760
You've heard of Goya Foods, right?

941
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:33,500
You're from back east.

942
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,780
It's all over the country now.

943
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:35,100
Of course.

944
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:35,520
Okay.

945
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:40,060
There was an interview a long time ago on NPR, not NPR, KXCI,

946
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,440
which is a private radio station in New York.

947
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:46,200
It's like the super leftist, but anybody will get on there, right?

948
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:46,620
Okay.

949
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:50,620
It's kind of like American Freedom Radio or something, right, back in the 90s.

950
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:55,620
So they had the great grandson of the Goya Food Company, and he gave the history.

951
00:51:55,800 --> 00:52:00,180
He says when the Latins started coming over to the U.S. and they wanted to buy beans and rice,

952
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:02,860
it would be like basically a white people market.

953
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:06,640
So you buy the beans, you bring them home, and some of them are the wrong, you know, mixed sizes.

954
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:07,520
Some are broken.

955
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:12,040
You get the rice, it's kind of like dusty, and some of the grain is broken, right?

956
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:15,260
So they're used to, they're very prideful on their food.

957
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,240
So they started that based on that, you know, so good quality.

958
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:24,760
By the way, when you buy like Nishiki rice or Lundberg rice and you pour it out of the container to prepare it,

959
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:27,380
you won't notice one broken grain of rice.

960
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:31,840
When you buy like a can of Goya beans, whatever beans, and you pour them out,

961
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:36,560
there's not one broken bean where you could go to Trader Joe's or whatever and buy their best black beans.

962
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,440
You pour them out, there's like broken beans, they're different sizes.

963
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:40,320
What is this, right?

964
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,980
There's some loose water that might have used to be a bean, but it's not anymore.

965
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:46,100
Yeah, yeah.

966
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:50,940
So I like the Nishiki because it's good quality, best quality for the price.

967
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:58,040
It looks like when you break open a 20-pound bag of rice, sushi rice, that they actually chose each grain with a tweezer.

968
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:01,520
There's not one broken grain.

969
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:02,880
The same with the Lundberg.

970
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:06,500
That just means they take pride in what they're doing, and it's very high quality.

971
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:11,160
Well, if you know how to make the brown rice, by the way, don't buy food that you don't know how to cook well.

972
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:15,980
If you don't know how to cook something well, why bother?

973
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:18,580
You're going to be wasting the ingredients and not having a good experience.

974
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:23,680
You do need a good pressure cooker to cook any good rice, any good rice.

975
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:31,900
It's gotten to the point where this was very well known, but people didn't know how to use a pressure cooker, right,

976
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,460
even though you need one to make rice, so they would destroy the rice again,

977
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:37,340
so they did converted rice, right, to make it more uniform.

978
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:44,200
By the way, if you know how to make perfect – I've done – back in the days, I always talk about food.

979
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,320
I talk about how to make perfect rice and just about it.

980
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,140
I've got – and potato stovetop cooking.

981
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:52,300
You don't have to fire up an oven for all kinds of things, and people have gotten back to me.

982
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:55,460
So I know I've gotten hundreds of people to making perfect rice.

983
00:53:55,580 --> 00:54:00,380
If you go to like a white Midwestern family and they make rice, it was like, you guys made rice.

984
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:00,900
Where is it?

985
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,100
They won't even look at the rice pot.

986
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:03,620
They'll just point.

987
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:04,240
It's over there.

988
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:05,200
They'll look the opposite way.

989
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,120
They'll point, it's over there, and you go and you open the lid, and it's just like a big ball of starch.

990
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:11,200
You can't tell what it is, right?

991
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:12,760
There's no reason for that.

992
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:14,040
There's no reason for that.

993
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:18,200
But anyway, you don't need a pressure cooker either.

994
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:23,220
If you have a high-quality pot, you just need to be able to put weight on the lid, right,

995
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:25,480
and as much weight as you want to put.

996
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:26,700
I have diver weights.

997
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:30,640
They're made of lead, and so they're like three inches square by one inch thick, and they're four pounds,

998
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,780
because lead is very constant, very heavy.

999
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,540
You could use gold bars too.

1000
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:36,260
It would be a little heavier even, but anyway.

1001
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:39,760
If you have enough gold bars laying around your house, you know.

1002
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:40,280
Yeah.

1003
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,180
You just hide them in the brick.

1004
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,960
You just paint them red and put them in the brick wall, right?

1005
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:44,280
Right.

1006
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:47,100
That won't help you, by the way, the gold and the silver anymore.

1007
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,800
Even scripture talks about that.

1008
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:56,380
So my point here is the easiest way to get some good whole food in your body,

1009
00:54:56,860 --> 00:55:00,900
if you're in this world that you're probably listening to me,

1010
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:04,640
is to get some Lundberg organic brown rice, short grain, not the long grain,

1011
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:10,940
and it's more young, right, and it'll cook better and more consistently.

1012
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,940
Make that and eat that for a week.

1013
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:16,980
Get some umeboshi plums, umeboshi plum vinegar.

1014
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:21,400
Learn how to roast sesame seeds and grind them with some salt.

1015
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:24,340
Get some sea vegetable, seaweed, right?

1016
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:25,660
Eat that.

1017
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,540
Don't switch over.

1018
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,340
This is what I tell people about food.

1019
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,620
Oh, you've got to change your diet, they say.

1020
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:32,200
What do they do?

1021
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,020
They change their diet.

1022
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:33,640
How do they feel?

1023
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:34,340
Like crap.

1024
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:34,880
Right.

1025
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:36,140
You incorporate it.

1026
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:39,180
Look, let's say you're eating McDonald's for breakfast, Burger King for lunch,

1027
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:40,120
and Wendy's for dinner.

1028
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,340
Okay, you need to change your diet.

1029
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:43,840
Everybody would pretty much agree.

1030
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:44,280
Right.

1031
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,640
Don't stop doing that.

1032
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:49,600
Get the McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's for dinner.

1033
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:52,900
Get all that, but don't get as much, and make the brown rice.

1034
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:53,380
Have a pot.

1035
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:57,100
So when you go to McDonald's, instead of getting all this,

1036
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:00,060
just get one little thing and have some brown rice with sea vegetable

1037
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:03,740
and some green tea or something with it.

1038
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:04,900
Do the same, right?

1039
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:08,760
And then what you do is each day you eat less of the McDonald's,

1040
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:10,740
less of the Burger King, less of the Wendy's,

1041
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:12,760
and you eat a little bit more of the brown rice.

1042
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:13,540
You see it?

1043
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:14,260
Right?

1044
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:15,500
That's how you switch your diet.

1045
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:16,860
Don't stop cold turkey.

1046
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:19,200
You know what happens with anything, right, when you do that.

1047
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:23,480
Yeah, you end up on some sort of withdrawal, but, I mean,

1048
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:27,040
it's fairly accurate because your body goes, hey, where the hell is this now?

1049
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:27,800
Yeah.

1050
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:28,440
That I'm used to.

1051
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:33,140
It's like your computer, because it's all electric and information-based.

1052
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:38,100
Your computer, you can go somewhere and get a few cookies and maybe a mild virus.

1053
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:38,800
It still works.

1054
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:44,180
But what if I put 100,000 cookies and five viruses on the computer right away?

1055
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:44,840
What happens?

1056
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:45,840
It stops.

1057
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:46,640
Yeah.

1058
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:49,760
So you just transition very gradually.

1059
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,860
Now, I'm not promoting macrobiotics.

1060
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:54,620
There's two reasons.

1061
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:56,600
One is it's a modified Japanese diet.

1062
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:02,360
It's not fair to push that on anyone if you don't have preference for it.

1063
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:06,520
And the other thing is there's very little information.

1064
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,860
As time goes on, there's less good information online about it, right?

1065
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:16,160
And the really good books that are out there from it before are too Japanese-centric.

1066
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:24,100
But there's a dichotomy and a duality of the yin and yang that's very evolved.

1067
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:30,680
The basic stuff is good to know, but you will not know how to use yin and yang by going on the Internet either.

1068
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:41,940
That requires, again, maybe a Greek sonic solo just to explain a few examples, right, in a Taoist way.

1069
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:45,000
The Taoists tell stories to make a point, right?

1070
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,940
So you don't have to do the macrobiotics.

1071
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:58,140
But if you eat seasonally and cross-lateral, like if it's wintertime, don't eat food that's grown in hot places at the time, right?

1072
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:02,240
And also eat locally and stuff that is extremely fresh.

1073
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:10,300
So let's say you live in Holland, right, or the Netherlands, and you go out and the what they call street vendors,

1074
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:13,880
they have this pickled fish and roasted fish, right?

1075
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:15,380
I forgot what it's called.

1076
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:17,220
It's a herring, a type of herring, I believe.

1077
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:17,760
Right.

1078
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:20,260
And that's local and all that.

1079
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:20,900
It's very fresh.

1080
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:21,420
Eat it.

1081
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,060
That's fine.

1082
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:32,160
Wherever you are, there is some local produce or something that you can acquire that's fresh, that's grown locally, hopefully, right?

1083
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,920
In New York City, believe it or not, you get some of the best produce in the world because of the farmer market.

1084
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:38,760
It's a real farmer's market.

1085
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:45,180
Real farmers come in, where if you go to L.A., the farmer's market, it's just a bunch of guys unloading, like,

1086
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:49,020
Andy Boy tomatoes that they got at the terminal market, you know what I mean?

1087
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:49,480
Right, right.

1088
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:51,160
It's not a real farmer's market in L.A.

1089
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:58,440
So if you can get some real food that's seasonal, right, that's what I'm talking about.

1090
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:03,980
But you will get the boost of energy from the organic brown rice.

1091
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:09,840
Another way to get a boost of energy for the body is something called kombucha, right?

1092
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:14,240
It's kind of one of those illicit things that the scoby could be considered a mushroom.

1093
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:14,760
It is.

1094
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:15,200
It's not.

1095
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:16,540
It's more of a fermented thing.

1096
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:22,060
But I'll tell you personally, if I drink some kombucha, any kombucha, there's some various qualities.

1097
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:28,780
I feel invigorated, like a high almost, almost like eating the organic food, right?

1098
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:32,040
I mentioned the Barrio Bread Bakery here.

1099
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:40,300
We have a bakery where they locally grow the wheat organically, dry it, grind it into flour, and bake bread out of it, right?

1100
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:44,600
I mean, in other words, you go to most bakeries, they're buying from the big distributors, right,

1101
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:47,200
bags of flour that are mixed from various co-ops.

1102
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:48,440
That's where they came from, yeah.

1103
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:50,580
Yeah, it's not going to be the same thing.

1104
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:56,480
So when you read in ancient times, we need bread to eat, when you ate that bread, it was like steak.

1105
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,520
It's not like the bread now.

1106
00:59:58,600 --> 00:59:59,400
I mean, it gave you a lot of energy.

1107
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:07,780
So when you go to Barrio Bread here and you get a loaf of bread or a roll, he'll give you a roll sometimes your first time there,

1108
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:09,740
you bite into it, you feel the sensation of love.

1109
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:11,580
I mentioned this the last time we spoke, I think.

1110
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:11,860
Right.

1111
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:19,480
It's like, you know, when you're a teenager and you see someone and you're infatuated, you get that, wow, you know, that feeling, that invigoration?

1112
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:20,020
That rush.

1113
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:21,760
That's what it feels like, that rush, yeah.

1114
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:23,400
Imagine you're getting a rush when you eat.

1115
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:24,120
Here's the thing.

1116
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:31,860
Imagine that every time you ate something, it gave you a rush of energy and it was euphoric and invigorating.

1117
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:34,620
How many people could say that about their food?

1118
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:36,560
Very few, at all anymore.

1119
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:38,660
This is how it should be.

1120
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:44,220
So you limit your diet to things that are very high quality, but don't limit yourself where you don't have variety.

1121
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:46,740
Here's the other thing with cancer also.

1122
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:52,640
If you don't have variety, you'll end up having a very narrow spectrum, right?

1123
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:56,120
And then you'll overdo it and the body wants to block that, you see?

1124
01:00:56,700 --> 01:01:04,780
I discovered, especially moving to the southwest, because when I was back east in New York, I associated mostly European people, you know?

1125
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:09,940
And also New Yorkers, which if you live in New York, you're going to be influenced by European, you know?

1126
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:10,660
Right.

1127
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,560
The easiest takeout is pizza and Chinese food, right?

1128
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:13,920
Right.

1129
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:15,940
And it's good pizza and good Chinese food.

1130
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:16,460
Well, guess what?

1131
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:17,360
That's not New York.

1132
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:18,420
That's not New York food.

1133
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:19,900
That's European and Asia.

1134
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:28,000
But when I came over to, you know, when I crossed the Midwest and came to the southwest, I noticed some people I ran into,

1135
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:32,080
I said, well, how about you want to come over for some dinner or I'll make something?

1136
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:33,900
They said, no, I only eat hamburgers and drink milk.

1137
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:36,020
And I thought they were joking, right?

1138
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:39,260
And I was like, what do you mean you only eat hamburgers and drink milk?

1139
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:41,100
Yeah, every day I eat hamburgers and drink milk.

1140
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:41,720
That's my diet.

1141
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:43,080
I'm like, what?

1142
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:45,280
Do I need to get my ears cleaned out?

1143
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:46,760
Am I dreaming?

1144
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:49,720
Stuff like that, you see?

1145
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:58,820
So, yeah, so the good food is something that is easy to talk about but difficult to do, but it's so worth it.

1146
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:06,840
If you're not getting a euphoric feeling from the meals that you eat, you should try to get, you know, aspire to it.

1147
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:12,660
And the easiest way to do it, again, is get some Lundberg brown rice, learn how to cook it, and move on from there.

1148
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:16,180
And that's basically the cancer aspect of it.

1149
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:17,340
It's just a blockage.

1150
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:19,980
None of these things are for fear.

1151
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:23,940
They're all inadequacies based on neglect, you know?

1152
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,200
And everyone wants to do whatever they do in their life.

1153
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:31,660
And let's say you're a bus driver or whatever and you want to learn about astrophysics.

1154
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:37,100
Well, you're going to find someone who that's their job, astrophysics, and listen to what they have to say.

1155
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:39,160
But if they're misleading you, what happens?

1156
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:39,960
You see?

1157
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:40,740
Right.

1158
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:41,820
And that's very easy.

1159
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:48,060
So all the specialists and professionals, if you want to take over a country or whatever, you take over the schools,

1160
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:51,700
you take over the professionals where people look up to, and you have them all doing the same stuff.

1161
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:53,400
I think it's called WOKE now, right?

1162
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:54,000
Here.

1163
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:56,640
Which is so easy to see that it's fake.

1164
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:59,740
And the people that go for it are really inadequate.

1165
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:05,640
In other words, you have a tremendous amount of people, well, not tremendous, but enough people you can see in a local whatever,

1166
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:07,460
depending on where you are, that are for it.

1167
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:11,380
You know, that WOKE stuff and the LGBTQ, RSTUV, whatever.

1168
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:17,080
Before this, they were degenerate in any other way, you see.

1169
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:21,680
I mean, how many stories do you see about some man that dresses like a woman?

1170
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:26,160
He's going to a preschool to pick up children, right, that are not his, right?

1171
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:30,600
So this is just another outlet.

1172
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:33,080
But what else?

1173
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:36,740
I think we pretty much covered that in a roundabout way.

1174
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:38,200
What else did we want to maybe get into?

1175
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:39,700
What did we start off with?

1176
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:42,940
We started off with de facto, the cancer, the water.

1177
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:44,960
De facto, the cure, cancer, water.

1178
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:47,420
We covered everything I thought we were going to cover.

1179
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:48,120
Yeah.

1180
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:55,140
The transmutation thing is a really big deal because it's really hard to get people's minds outside of how elements exist.

1181
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:57,680
And real short, I wanted to get into this a little bit.

1182
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,560
Everything is hydrogen, right?

1183
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:01,160
Very easy.

1184
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:02,100
Hydrogen is one.

1185
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:03,100
Helium is two.

1186
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:03,780
Lithium is three.

1187
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:04,340
You go down.

1188
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:12,200
So when you look at something like 16, right, it's just 16 hydrogens coupled together.

1189
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:15,820
But the problem is, you know an element, right?

1190
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:24,220
The problem is if you take the type of hydrogen that you go and get industrially or laboratory grade or whatever,

1191
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:28,260
you can't work 16 hydrogens together and get oxygen.

1192
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:32,460
It doesn't work that way because what people don't know, and it's not talked about,

1193
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:37,900
there's many types of hydrogen just like there's many – it's an isotope, right?

1194
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:44,680
For example, when you get gold right now and have it tested at a lab,

1195
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:50,740
they can tell you where it was mined because when the gold is mined in different parts of the world,

1196
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:52,840
it has a slightly different isotope, right?

1197
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:55,920
196 point whatever, 196 point something, 197.

1198
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:01,860
So when you manufacture gold in your kitchen and you send it to be tested,

1199
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:06,080
they're going to see – they know right away that it's been man-made,

1200
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:08,640
and they're going to tell you that it's not gold, it's iron and copper.

1201
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:12,800
And then you ask for can I have the sample back, and they say we lost the sample.

1202
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:17,320
And once this happens, all of the laboratories are certified.

1203
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:18,500
And how do you get certification?

1204
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,100
You have to fill out government forms, right?

1205
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:21,520
Right.

1206
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:26,700
And once you're a certified lab, all the lab computers are connected, so all their database –

1207
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:31,300
You know, now, by the way, a flip phone went through the wash for the second time.

1208
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:33,660
I couldn't revive it, so I have an Apple phone now.

1209
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:37,300
I just – I don't know how people carry these things around, man.

1210
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:38,760
It's like a brick.

1211
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:43,480
When I have this Apple phone, I'm thinking it's like why am I putting this in my pocket?

1212
01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:46,760
It's like am I going to go into a fight where I need to hit someone over the head with something?

1213
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:48,040
Why am I carrying this thing?

1214
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:49,540
You know?

1215
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:53,600
If you know you're going to go for a fight, you better start carrying –

1216
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:56,640
strap something around your chest, you know, grab something.

1217
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:57,820
We're going to go fight, you know?

1218
01:05:57,900 --> 01:05:59,800
Okay, you know, what am I – this is a weapon.

1219
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,040
What am I doing with this thing?

1220
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:09,920
Anyway, so the way that these – let's go back to the elements.

1221
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:14,300
I don't have a flip phone anymore, and I kind of regret it.

1222
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:18,320
I just wanted to bring that up because I don't know how many people are listening

1223
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:24,280
that still use the old style phone that you put in your pocket, smaller than a wallet and all that.

1224
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:25,040
I really miss it.

1225
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:29,280
So there was a little movement there for a bit of people trying to get those

1226
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:33,340
and find them refurbished and stuff because they wanted to go back to them,

1227
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:34,880
take their SIM cards and stick them in.

1228
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:39,360
Yeah, so I'm going to have to research and get it because the Verizon doesn't want to do it.

1229
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:48,140
But anyway, so once you get the laboratory test that you – that they don't see an isotope,

1230
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:52,280
they're told to tell you that it's not gold, it's iron and copper.

1231
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:54,440
And by the way, before you send it in to get it certified,

1232
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:57,220
you went to all the local pawn shops and they told you it's gold, right?

1233
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:02,480
Because they have the XRF tester and they have the touchstones and the acids and all that, okay?

1234
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:08,180
All right, so once you get in there, you get into a database.

1235
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:13,080
And so we found this one lab in Swastika.

1236
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:15,120
There's a place called Swastika, Canada, right?

1237
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:15,500
Right.

1238
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:18,640
And we sent it to them.

1239
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,720
And this is typically what happens.

1240
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:22,700
And so we send in a sample.

1241
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:24,500
Here's the name.

1242
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:26,900
It says – I don't know.

1243
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:27,580
I'm looking for it.

1244
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:28,240
I don't see the sample.

1245
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:29,320
Let me look on the computer.

1246
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:31,780
Oh, we haven't gotten to that one yet,

1247
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:36,780
but it says here that it's iron and copper and we lost the sample is what he's reading on the computer.

1248
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:38,700
But he said we haven't gotten to that one yet.

1249
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:41,640
So they were totally busted.

1250
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:46,800
I said, so if you haven't gotten it to you yet, how do you know it's iron and copper and you lost the sample?

1251
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:47,480
Yeah, right.

1252
01:07:49,180 --> 01:07:50,320
So there is suppression.

1253
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:53,880
So when people say you're a conspiracy theorist, there's no suppression.

1254
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:54,640
It's total bullshit.

1255
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:56,240
Sometimes it's very obvious.

1256
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,620
And I think when you're doing the JFK research,

1257
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:04,780
you've discovered some of the suppression and the diversion and all that is so obvious it's cartoonish, right?

1258
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,660
Yeah, so this is the world you live in.

1259
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:11,660
But here's the thing with transmutation.

1260
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:15,620
Someone once emailed me, how do you turn copper into gold?

1261
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:16,640
Right?

1262
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:19,100
Well, that's more complicated.

1263
01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:24,600
And the reason why you want to do copper to gold is because it gets closer to the gold that you know

1264
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:29,000
than growing the organic one from the yeast.

1265
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:36,260
What you might want to do is turn lead into gold by removing the hydrogen atom from it.

1266
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:37,880
Well, what do you mean?

1267
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:40,439
If I have pure lead, where's the hydrogen to remove that?

1268
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:44,740
You see, that's where the macrobiotic yin and yang approach, right?

1269
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:49,340
So the hydrogen is the most yang element, the most compact, right?

1270
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:55,240
And as you go down past the radioactive ones, they're the most yin, right?

1271
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:57,540
Most expansive as the numbers get bigger.

1272
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:04,899
So how do you convince pure lead, Chuck, if I have pure elemental lead, 99.49 pure lead,

1273
01:09:04,899 --> 01:09:07,859
how do I remove a hydrogen from it when there's no hydrogen detected?

1274
01:09:09,899 --> 01:09:10,899
I don't know.

1275
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:11,500
Excuse me.

1276
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:12,380
Honestly, I don't know.

1277
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:12,560
See?

1278
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:14,220
So that's where the alchemy comes in.

1279
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:15,479
That's where the spirit and the mind.

1280
01:09:15,939 --> 01:09:20,760
It's the same mind that you use that inventors have, right?

1281
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:27,220
And most inventors, by the way, when you ask them how they invented that,

1282
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:31,840
they said it was by accident or I had a certain need and the idea just came to me out of nowhere, right?

1283
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:32,500
Right.

1284
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:35,020
So that's the technique.

1285
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:41,479
Well, how many inventors actually said, well, how often do these big consortiums

1286
01:09:41,479 --> 01:09:45,620
and corporations fund something to be invented and it never quite works out?

1287
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:47,560
Like the Post-Its, right?

1288
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:50,020
It was supposed to be a super powerful glue and what happened?

1289
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:50,960
It didn't stick to anything.

1290
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:52,680
What do we do with it?

1291
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:56,420
And the secretary said, I love this stuff because I could stick it on anything.

1292
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:57,340
It doesn't leave a residue.

1293
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:58,020
Right.

1294
01:09:58,580 --> 01:10:02,440
So what happens is you have an intent that doesn't work out.

1295
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:05,800
Sometimes it's the opposite, but someone else finds a use for it.

1296
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:06,680
You get it?

1297
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:07,200
Right.

1298
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:09,980
Or it just comes out of nowhere unexpected.

1299
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:13,980
So when you have a deep understanding of the yin and yang,

1300
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:18,880
not only will you understand how to treat and manipulate the body,

1301
01:10:19,580 --> 01:10:22,420
you will also understand how to treat and manipulate the elements

1302
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:26,760
based on how everything in the universe shares these factors.

1303
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:29,360
If something has a front, it must have a back.

1304
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:31,680
If something has an outside, it must have an inside.

1305
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:33,980
If something has a top, it must have a bottom.

1306
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:39,620
If something is hard on the outside, it must be soft on the inside.

1307
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:44,000
If something is soft on the outside, it must be hard on the inside.

1308
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:44,880
You see?

1309
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:45,260
Okay.

1310
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:49,680
Or how about some, when I was, a few days ago I was going over this

1311
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:52,160
and someone said, what about a rock where it gets hard on the outside

1312
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:53,480
and hard on the inside, right?

1313
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:54,180
Good.

1314
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:54,940
Good question.

1315
01:10:54,940 --> 01:10:55,660
It means you're thinking.

1316
01:10:55,820 --> 01:10:56,600
That's more advanced.

1317
01:10:58,620 --> 01:10:59,420
Actually, yes.

1318
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:04,540
Physically it seems the same way, but energetically it's not.

1319
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:10,860
The rock is hard on the outside, but less hard on the inside.

1320
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,620
Think of it, you know how an egg is broken?

1321
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:18,160
You know, egg is very hard on the outside, very soft on the inside, right?

1322
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:19,820
So the yin and yang works well.

1323
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:21,940
You know how an eggshell is broken?

1324
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:23,980
You don't get a big saw to cut through the whole thing.

1325
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:25,280
All you've got to do is break the shell, right?

1326
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:27,340
And it cracks open.

1327
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:27,640
Okay.

1328
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:31,260
If you ever watch a bricklayer cut a brick in half, what does he do?

1329
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:34,440
He holds the brick in his hand, which is hard on the inside, hard on the outside.

1330
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:35,480
It breaks just like an egg.

1331
01:11:35,780 --> 01:11:38,960
They mark where they want to cut it, and they tap, tap, tap with the claw

1332
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:43,380
or the back of a claw or a chisel, just a score line all the way around,

1333
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:45,260
and then they just hit it once, and what happens?

1334
01:11:45,380 --> 01:11:46,100
It snaps off.

1335
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:49,460
This is how rocks, this is how they work in a quarry.

1336
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:50,560
You have a big slab of stone.

1337
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:51,300
How do they cut it?

1338
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:52,300
How do they break it off?

1339
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:53,400
They just tap it.

1340
01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:56,280
They score a line, and then they bump it, and it breaks off.

1341
01:11:56,500 --> 01:12:00,640
You kind of cut a guideline, and then you just kind of give it a little bit of force,

1342
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:01,820
and boom, it comes undone.

1343
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:02,560
Yeah, it's called notch.

1344
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:04,120
It's not notch-resistant.

1345
01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:05,620
Like glass is the same way.

1346
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:09,100
It has very low notch resistance.

1347
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:11,560
Once you make a notch in it, it breaks on that notch.

1348
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,660
Well, I thought it was supposed to be hard on the inside.

1349
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:15,060
Doesn't it act just like an egg?

1350
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:17,100
It behaves just like an egg.

1351
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:19,900
You just score the outside, and the whole thing breaks open, right?

1352
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:20,260
Right.

1353
01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:26,060
So this is where the energetic part overrules what you see physically.

1354
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:30,300
In other words, what you're seeing physically going on matters.

1355
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:31,200
Yes, it does.

1356
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:36,660
But when you start reacting or working with the object, the yin and yang works.

1357
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:40,300
So in other words, you cut the stone just like you break open an egg.

1358
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:44,360
Because to break open an egg, you're like, oh, I just need to break through what?

1359
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:47,160
A half a millimeter of some substance, right?

1360
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:49,900
A half a millimeter, like a sixteenth, not even a sixteenth of an inch.

1361
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:51,540
Same thing with a brick.

1362
01:12:51,620 --> 01:12:53,840
When you want to cut a brick, which you think is hard on the inside,

1363
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:56,300
you just score it a sixteenth of an inch and tap it.

1364
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:57,580
It breaks off just like an egg.

1365
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:58,340
But wait a second.

1366
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:04,780
See, because this is where the energetic principle overrides what you think is the physical principle.

1367
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:05,800
You see?

1368
01:13:06,380 --> 01:13:06,640
Okay.

1369
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:08,940
And this is how you start off with alchemy.

1370
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:13,300
And by the way, just like with many things, there's nothing on alchemy on the Internet.

1371
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:14,480
I've looked and looked and looked.

1372
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:17,740
And there's the closest you're going to get.

1373
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:18,840
I have a book here.

1374
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:21,280
Let's see.

1375
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:23,460
I think I might have mentioned it once before.

1376
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:24,920
It's the Pyrotechnia.

1377
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:26,920
It's from the 1500s.

1378
01:13:26,980 --> 01:13:27,980
It's a reprint.

1379
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:30,300
If I could find it here.

1380
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:31,840
I might have put it in a way.

1381
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,800
But it's the Pyrotechnica.

1382
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:35,980
It's 1500s.

1383
01:13:35,980 --> 01:13:36,840
Let me turn on a light.

1384
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:38,260
This should help on alchemy.

1385
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:39,900
And it's not purely on alchemy.

1386
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:45,280
Basically, this was on the FBI confiscation list for a long time.

1387
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:48,920
You know the FBI has a book confiscation department, right?

1388
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:53,560
Back in the day and still after 9-11 with the dictionaries.

1389
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:59,960
Because on the last chapter of this book, it tells you how to make various types, not just gunpowder.

1390
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:04,220
Various types of cannon gunpowders.

1391
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:08,060
And if you run out of gunpowder, you had to make it on the fly and all this stuff.

1392
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:11,700
They don't want people to know anything about that, right?

1393
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:12,820
The high-speed chemistry.

1394
01:14:13,820 --> 01:14:14,640
So here it is.

1395
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:16,860
I think this is a soft, so you can probably still get it.

1396
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:17,800
It may be where it's called.

1397
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:23,100
The Pyrotechnia of Vannaccio Beringuccio.

1398
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:27,200
The classic 16th century treatise on metals and metallurgy.

1399
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:31,980
It's about 400 pages, 450 pages.

1400
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,700
It's border on alchemy.

1401
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:38,600
This is like a very high-level technical science book of the day.

1402
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:42,920
And today it would be called alchemy, but it's not.

1403
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:46,940
Because the practices in there are still functional and relevant, right?

1404
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:51,820
And especially the part where they're looking for gold and making gold.

1405
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:55,980
Well, refining gold and all these other things.

1406
01:14:56,700 --> 01:15:00,500
Another thing about the transmutation of elements.

1407
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:09,040
Once you start viewing it from the something is hard on the outside, it must be soft on the inside.

1408
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:11,240
That's true for an egg, right?

1409
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:12,880
But not true for a brick.

1410
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:19,440
But the way you interact with the brick to manipulate the brick is just like as it was an egg, right?

1411
01:15:19,660 --> 01:15:20,240
Very similar.

1412
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:27,420
Okay, you understand how the hydrogen is.

1413
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:28,520
What is hydrogen?

1414
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:32,040
Gen means to generate, to bring forward, like Genesis, right?

1415
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:33,600
And hydro means what?

1416
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:34,300
Water.

1417
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:35,760
Right.

1418
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:40,200
So hydrogen generates water and water generates hydrogen.

1419
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:42,860
It's not that water is made of hydrogen.

1420
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:50,780
Just like when you remove hydrogen from the lead, it becomes gold, the portion of it does.

1421
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:55,600
Does that mean that you're cracking the lead?

1422
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:56,180
No.

1423
01:15:56,180 --> 01:16:00,320
So you have to somehow make the part of the lead.

1424
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:04,840
I haven't thought about how to make a presentation on this yet.

1425
01:16:06,860 --> 01:16:11,520
And it's going to be a lot of thinking because when you speak on these things,

1426
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:16,640
there's a lot of parallel things that have to be considered at the same time, right?

1427
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:22,460
And there's really no direct introduction to how to manipulate the physical world, the elements.

1428
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:25,480
There's no direct way.

1429
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:28,680
It's all these indirect ways that you have to contemplate.

1430
01:16:29,660 --> 01:16:36,680
And the way to finish off is if you want to work with transmuting elements or making other elements,

1431
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:42,880
you have to understand the air and the water and electricity and magnetism very, very deeply,

1432
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:44,300
especially the water.

1433
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:49,960
So I think we covered enough and we had enough tangents for today.

1434
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:51,660
Fair enough.
