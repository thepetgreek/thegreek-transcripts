1
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:13,340
The Sonic Event 25, Ocelli in the Greek, there I go announcing it again, here we are.

2
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,880
Greek, how are you doing tonight?

3
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,720
Oh, busy, busy, busy, but rested.

4
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,620
You know, we were going to record another night, and I just walked in from doing labor,

5
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:35,840
like masonry, plumbing, complicated stuff, and I knew you were calling without knowing you were calling.

6
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,520
So, here I am. It's good, it's like a different pattern.

7
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,620
I'm usually prepared for doing a recording.

8
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:49,460
Tonight, it's just I walked in and I'm numb from using a brick hammer and wrenches and torches,

9
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,260
and I was thinking I'd just come home and have some leftover pizza that I made last night,

10
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,480
and hit in the sack, and we're recording. That's great.

11
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,620
So, let's see how I do. Let's see how you do.

12
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,860
Why not? Let's see how this rolls.

13
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,379
Yeah, yeah.

14
00:01:03,459 --> 00:01:06,540
I was scrambling around the house taking care of stuff.

15
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,680
Just so you know, weird things happened just before this.

16
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,360
I was running around the house trying to figure out why I had an internet connectivity problem.

17
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,160
I reset everything. It seems okay now.

18
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:22,480
I also had to get rid of a mouse, so that was my fun.

19
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,760
A mouse apparently found his way into the house.

20
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,740
I do live with a lady, so you can't have that.

21
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,200
Okay, you're going to do limericks? You could rhyme every other sentence.

22
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:32,960
Why not?

23
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,820
I don't think limericks are rhyming every other sentence, but yeah.

24
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:44,080
You mentioned something about more prophecy, and I really got over that in the public forums.

25
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,380
What to expect.

26
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:54,960
The only other specific thing I can say is, look for, this is way down, but this is a sign.

27
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,300
The Palestinians and the Israelis will become united like allies.

28
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:01,900
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

29
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,580
Hand in glove.

30
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,380
United?

31
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,680
Yeah, politically, militarily, economically.

32
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,320
It sounds really crazy.

33
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:15,060
Israel is going to give up a lot of land along what they call the Gaza Strip.

34
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,120
The Palestinians will get Jaffa back, the ancient city of Jaffa.

35
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,400
Now wait a second, let me just say it so it's more pertinent.

36
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,060
This would freak out the people that don't know what I'm talking about, about prophecy.

37
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,000
Jaffa is Tel Aviv.

38
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,420
What's Tel Aviv?

39
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:33,720
It's the capital.

40
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:41,720
It's kind of like the U.S. giving up Washington, D.C. to North Korea or Iran.

41
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,500
Wait a second, they already did that behind the scenes, but you know what I mean.

42
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:45,920
Yeah.

43
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,020
So you'll see.

44
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,400
It flies in the face of all conventional reporting at the moment, right?

45
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:02,600
Well, so do airplane, well, so do steel skyscrapers vaporizing from jet fuel.

46
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:03,700
Of course.

47
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,560
Magic bullets.

48
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,940
Lots of other things like three shooters disappearing into one guy.

49
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,920
Things like this happening all the time, yeah.

50
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,200
Or a dollar bill.

51
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,240
Who's going to pay that bill?

52
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,060
Good question.

53
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,600
It's all bizarre.

54
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,360
But this is not on my own.

55
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,260
A lot of people that are on the fence about it and don't like the Bible because it's religious to them.

56
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,700
Where do you get this?

57
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,940
It doesn't matter where I get it.

58
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,600
Did you hear it and can you file it away?

59
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,060
It's kind of a diversion tactic to let them be open indirectly.

60
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,920
It's kind of like making children eat their vegetables by tricking them.

61
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,320
Well, here's a funny thing, right?

62
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,220
Even people that swear by the Bible in the most pedestrian way.

63
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,740
I mean, somebody in a piece of feedback recently brought up how you were talking about the Bible guru and that guy.

64
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:59,660
People of that ilk who absolutely say, I swear by it.

65
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,280
This is absolutely what I swear by.

66
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,540
And they're really swearing by what their pastor told them or what their pastor has always told them.

67
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,320
Okay, fine.

68
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,260
That's like paying your taxes.

69
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,760
You've got to pay your fair share.

70
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,760
Well, yeah, of course.

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,459
There's no way to pay taxes.

72
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:16,360
They're not taxes.

73
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:22,620
You have to file a return for using private credit.

74
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,740
So all this stuff has gone away and become something else.

75
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:35,880
In other words, all these things you just mentioned have gone away from what they really are in a du jour world and become something else, but they're using the old language.

76
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:36,540
Right.

77
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:45,820
But I've taken note that people that have gone away from what the original is and what the intent is and what the book is, it doesn't matter, right?

78
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,140
The people that claim to cling to their book, they don't even read it.

79
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,000
It's just the way it is.

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,280
It changes.

81
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:54,700
Yeah.

82
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,380
It changes.

83
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,460
The Mandela effect also.

84
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,660
I don't like using it.

85
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,220
Well, come up.

86
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,100
See, I don't think about the Mandela effect enough to come up with another term for it, but yeah, temporal edit.

87
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,300
Temporal edit.

88
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:04,620
Okay.

89
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:12,680
But the thing about it is that if you present to somebody who absolutely staunchly tells you, look, this is the beginning, the ending, the alpha, the omega, everything,

90
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:19,640
you present to them something else, though, that will make sense, and you prove it out.

91
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,840
You say, look, here's what's going to happen, and it happens.

92
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,500
Well, next thing you know is they don't care where you got it from.

93
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,720
They'll hear it.

94
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:27,780
Oh, yeah.

95
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,780
That's how the money system works.

96
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,240
Right.

97
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,840
Well, not money system.

98
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,360
It's called speculation.

99
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,480
Okay.

100
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:34,820
Right?

101
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,320
So a successful speculator is not really speculating because he has some inside knowledge.

102
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,840
Yeah, yeah.

103
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,520
So we'll see.

104
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,020
I've got either good or bad.

105
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,440
I've got a really good track record.

106
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,060
I got that cartoon hand on a stick.

107
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,440
I pat myself on the back, so I'm not looking for approval.

108
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,100
Guys, don't worry about it.

109
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,700
You know, people like to get feedback.

110
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,240
You know, I've talked about this.

111
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,260
Don't send me an email that I've got good stuff because if it wasn't good, I wouldn't be saying it.

112
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:04,940
Don't send me that.

113
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,180
I know it's good, and it sounds really cocky, right?

114
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:15,720
But if you contact me, it's because you've got something to share that moves everything forward, whatever that everything is.

115
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:23,640
Speaking of which, what's been moving forward in the chat is people taking interest in magnets and water.

116
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,820
And I'll tell you a quick story about this magnet and water thing.

117
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:29,620
It's recurring.

118
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,980
It's with the car stuff.

119
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,920
It's with the audio stuff, most of the health stuff.

120
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:41,380
I tell people about something in passing, and I meet them again later, and they have time to come and see me demonstrate it.

121
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:41,840
Okay.

122
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,580
And when I demonstrate it, it's like, this is unbelievable.

123
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,220
I know you told me about it, but, you know, it's unbelievable.

124
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:55,060
You know, I'm like, well, if it wasn't so, why would I tell you it was so, and now you're surprised because it's so?

125
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:59,440
I mean, do you get people telling you things that aren't so, and then you go, and it's not so?

126
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,780
I mean, is this how people operate?

127
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:01,420
Yeah.

128
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:10,200
A lot of people do operate that way because they know that a majority of individuals that they're trying to trick, quite honestly, will not follow up.

129
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,220
They'll just either take their word or not, and that's the end of it.

130
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:17,200
So, yeah, there are people that constantly work on exactly that.

131
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:24,620
I mean, I know that's ethically unsound to you, but, yes, that is what we're confronted with, you know, among the poor.

132
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,400
Or live with, in other words, because this was very natural.

133
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,240
This was not – I've heard this before, not just with myself, but with others.

134
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,560
It's actually been portrayed in film also.

135
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,860
In movies or TV, they use that kind of scenario.

136
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:39,440
Right.

137
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:51,300
So, yeah, so at this point, you know, with the scale or the reduction of minerals in water, conservatively 30% to 40% is very accurate.

138
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,820
It could be 50%, but it's not.

139
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,240
It's just about between 30% for sure, 40% for sure.

140
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,460
That's a good thing.

141
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,720
I keep messaging when I put comments about what's going on with this.

142
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,100
Anyone who's enterprising will recognize this.

143
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:11,500
This is like – if you're into finances, this is like – there's this thing called Bitcoin.

144
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,960
It's 20 cents a Bitcoin.

145
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:17,440
Anybody who's enterprising will know what this means, right?

146
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,180
Okay.

147
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:26,100
So this is similar, but you have to be involved with water and fluid treatment technology, right?

148
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,980
Because this also works with gas, you know, like natural gas, propane.

149
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,280
It works with any fluid, but it'll change things on a different level, fuel.

150
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,600
So without getting into that, we've had – I'm very actually pleased by the feedback,

151
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:47,020
because it actually shows people still know how to operate a screwdriver, hammer, saw, zip tie, other than the popo,

152
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,580
because I know the popos use zip ties now.

153
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,980
And people don't know what the popo is.

154
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,040
It's the fuzz.

155
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,560
That's from the 70s, right?

156
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,720
So what's the fuzz, right?

157
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:07,320
So anyway, yeah, people are – I could see people have proficiency with hand tools, right?

158
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,800
I mean, saying like – I used to ask people, do you know how to operate a screwdriver?

159
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,820
And the response is very wide.

160
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,700
It could be laughing, laughing, laughing, laughing, laughing.

161
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,840
Like maybe I insulted them, and they actually don't laugh.

162
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,080
They're like, no, I don't.

163
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:23,960
Okay.

164
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,140
Right?

165
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,420
So it's like you never know.

166
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:31,560
And also the results, they're posting results in the chat, so that's good.

167
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,060
It's very small.

168
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:36,580
But I have the people here that are on Rated Y that have been building these,

169
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,420
and others that are getting the same results.

170
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,880
I'll put myself out a little bit.

171
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,280
Well, we're going to talk a little bit more about water, but regarding other things.

172
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,840
But put myself out a little bit.

173
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:51,480
I had a short conversation with someone today about what the next step is,

174
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,300
because I've been using this system now for about two years.

175
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:59,060
But I didn't get it for sure aligned until the past six months,

176
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,640
and the past three months decided to speak about it.

177
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,060
Okay.

178
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,860
So anybody playing around with this, getting the water to cross where the magnet is ineffective,

179
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,620
is very important.

180
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:12,240
If you get it down with a micrometer, like exactly measure the center of your water line

181
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,780
and exactly the center of the magnet, it works even better.

182
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,440
Like if you're slightly off, and you use a micrometer,

183
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,500
or you center the water line exactly over the center of the magnet,

184
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,480
you'll have 30%, 40% even better results.

185
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,880
I mean, it's that fine tuning.

186
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,940
Literally like getting the radio station tuned in, right?

187
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:31,420
Okay.

188
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,140
That's how well it works.

189
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,500
But the next step, I'm going to put myself out there,

190
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,600
because someone might ask me about this, and I'll say no.

191
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,480
Or I might say yes.

192
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,300
Or I might say I'm not going to talk about it until I know more.

193
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,820
But this is what the next step is, and I had the conversation with today.

194
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,920
This magnet system, I'm determining the proper runner length,

195
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,760
meaning when the water or the liquid goes through the magnet,

196
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:02,460
how much pipe or tubing should go before the next one goes in, or whatever, runner length.

197
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:09,580
And then another device that will clear up turbidity.

198
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,880
Turbidity means water that's not clear.

199
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:13,560
Okay.

200
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,620
Like the water they have in, what is it, Flint, Michigan?

201
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,400
A lot of places, but Flint's a prime example, yeah.

202
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:19,760
Yeah.

203
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,880
They have a, you know, they show the local news.

204
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,780
They go to someone's house.

205
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,200
They turn on the tap.

206
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:30,640
The water goes into a clear glass, and the water looks like mud or yellow or rust color or whatever.

207
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:36,640
So at this point, we're able to progress it to the next point,

208
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:43,080
which will be producing a device which just looks like a pipe, but a little thicker than a pipe.

209
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,220
Let's say it has a built-on body to it.

210
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,080
And whoever you show it to, they could look right through it.

211
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,200
There's no guts in it.

212
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,200
It's just a straight-through pipe.

213
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:56,700
And what you do on the influent, you run this turbid water,

214
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,180
and on the affluent where it comes out, it's crystal clear,

215
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,720
and that's going to get people scratching their head.

216
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:08,500
This kind of technology could probably get you killed, by the way, if in other times.

217
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,020
You know how years ago they used to shoot and kill whistleblowers?

218
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,060
Now they don't so much.

219
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,900
So it's kind of a little bit more.

220
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:21,140
So that's the next step, and the way that's going to be done is by using a biological vacuum

221
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:26,100
that metal pipe magnet and things like that can afford.

222
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:30,260
And I can go on to how to make this.

223
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,200
Basically, you need several metals,

224
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:38,540
and you need to produce a certain type of water that is encased between the metals, so on and so forth.

225
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,540
But who knows?

226
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:46,140
In the near future, I might find a simple way to do it and have people build these things, you know.

227
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:51,100
Could you imagine having turbid water, non-potable turbid, dirty water,

228
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,940
and you run it through this, and it comes out clean and clear?

229
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,860
And someone's going to ask you, where is this stuff going?

230
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,060
You know, the materialist, right?

231
00:12:59,100 --> 00:12:59,920
Where is it going?

232
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,320
Right.

233
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,320
Where is the filter where you're collecting all this crap?

234
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,240
It's got to be somewhere.

235
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,080
Yeah, yeah.

236
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,220
Today I was in the shower talking to the wife about it.

237
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:13,280
I'm in the shower, she's in the house, and I'm saying, you know, where is this going?

238
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,300
They say, where is it going?

239
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,860
And I say, I'll tell you where I'm going with it, Africa.

240
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:18,460
Right?

241
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,600
You know what I mean?

242
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,720
You don't want to do it here.

243
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,320
No.

244
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:22,780
Right?

245
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,580
You'll be stepping on too many toes.

246
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,880
By the way, I have firsthand knowledge of this.

247
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:34,180
All of your municipalities, city, state, whatever, that buy chemicals and processes for treating water or whatever,

248
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,680
even parts for the power plants and all that,

249
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:42,280
the ones in the county or the city or the municipality that sign off from these contractors and all that,

250
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,940
they get a kickback.

251
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:52,940
So let's say you have whatever town you live in buys a quarter of a million worth of chlorine a year.

252
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,160
Okay.

253
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,800
That's all it looks like on paper.

254
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,800
But behind the scenes, that chlorine company that just got the contract for a quarter of a million

255
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:05,160
kicks back $5,000, $10,000, $20,000, $50,000 to the politicians there, cash or other ways.

256
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:11,420
So when you go there, they'll act like they're listening to you,

257
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,760
but you have to somehow let them know what kind of a kickback they're going to get,

258
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,960
and it better be bigger than the kickback from the other guys.

259
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,960
Otherwise, you're not going to do business with them.

260
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,520
You know what I mean?

261
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:20,520
Well, right.

262
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:25,360
I mean, if you turn around and you give the guy's father a job who doesn't even have to show up for it,

263
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,480
the paycheck better be worth more than what the other guy is offering to pay, you know.

264
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,420
Yeah.

265
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:37,220
Well, real quick, the way they do it here in America is with cars and houses and boats,

266
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,180
but usually houses.

267
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:43,840
If it's more cars, when it's less than the tens of thousands, it's cars.

268
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,460
When it's in the hundreds of thousands, it's houses.

269
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,240
Are you familiar how they bribe politicians here?

270
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:48,880
This is very common.

271
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:52,760
You can actually see the paperwork, but people don't know about it.

272
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:57,100
It's kind of like when I tell people the numbers on the dollar bill come from your birth certificate.

273
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:01,800
You can go to the treasury and put in double e-bonds on the drop-down menu,

274
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:05,160
put in the birth certificate number that you have, and put in the date,

275
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,540
and it shows you an address.

276
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,900
People think it's irrelevant, but that's the address of the hospital that you were born.

277
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,900
If you're younger than 35, it shows up.

278
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,940
But you see, everything is there.

279
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:18,440
Okay, should I get into it for about two minutes, how they bribe politicians?

280
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,280
Why not?

281
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,000
Okay, real easy.

282
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,040
Well, let's do it this way.

283
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:26,020
It used to be with congressmen, they used to go play pool,

284
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,360
and you deliberately lose the pool game, and then you say,

285
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,100
I owe you out in the open, you give them an envelope.

286
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,760
In other countries, it's different things.

287
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,280
It could be livestock in Russia.

288
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,560
It could be in a country, depending, they use livestock.

289
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,840
They pay for someone's wedding.

290
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,820
If they know their daughter, they'll pay for your daughter's wedding.

291
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:52,620
You know how weddings could be expensive, even Libya or whatever.

292
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:58,620
The way the Russians exclusively work with bribes is expensive watches.

293
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,960
You buy like a Patek Philippe, or Philippe Patek.

294
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,120
Patek Philippe.

295
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,200
Patek Philippe.

296
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,100
Patek Philippe, yeah.

297
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,000
Philippe, yeah, that's it.

298
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,080
Sorry, I thought that was more Ukrainian, though.

299
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,740
I thought that was more of a Ukrainian thing with the watches.

300
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,820
Am I mixing that up?

301
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,260
Yeah, that whole part of the world, yeah.

302
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,460
It's got to be a watch.

303
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:26,300
Okay, in America, what they do is, with the judges, attorney generals,

304
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,900
and politicians, the mayor people, whatever, this is what they do.

305
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,840
They have a call.

306
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,980
They have someone call, and they tell them to go buy a house.

307
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,920
They have, quote, unquote, good credit, right?

308
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,260
So they go to the bank, and they buy a house.

309
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,880
They get a loan for the house, whatever, no money down or some money down, whatever,

310
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,780
in a neighborhood where the houses are $200,000 to $250,000, $300,000, right?

311
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,780
So once they buy the house, after closing, they wait two months,

312
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:57,080
and the next party comes in and buys the house for $400,000, worth $350,000.

313
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,240
So they make $100,000, that's it.

314
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,020
So it shows like they made a profit on the house, right?

315
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,319
Yeah, they just flip a house.

316
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,319
They flip a house, or sometimes they flip a commercial building, same way.

317
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:10,540
Or a car, or a car, yeah.

318
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,060
And this is very easy to see if you know who your judge is and all that.

319
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,099
Just go look in the county record what houses have been sold and for how much,

320
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,640
and you'll see it's the only house that sold for twice the amount it was worth

321
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,160
in that neighborhood ever, right?

322
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,040
So it's pretty obvious.

323
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:25,240
But it's all, quote, unquote, legal, and it's just a system.

324
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,520
Cars are also another way.

325
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:31,560
You have them go buy a car, and then you buy the car from them for, you know,

326
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,240
more than what they paid for, a lot more.

327
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:40,460
So houses and cars, boats, properties like that are the mayor's, you know,

328
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:44,280
all these other people that everyone sees on TV, how they do it.

329
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,820
The international figures, like your congressmen and all these, you know,

330
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,300
how are these congresspeople, you know, after serving, whether it's 10 or 20

331
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:57,580
or 30 years, worth $100 million on a salary that's less than $200,000 a year, right?

332
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,420
That's all done internationally with big deals.

333
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:05,040
They become partners and stuff, you know.

334
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,740
You know, there was no car insurance requirement until the insurance companies,

335
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,520
you know, said to the congresspeople, you're not going to be in office very long.

336
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:19,800
Pass this thing where everyone has a mandatory car insurance, and when you get out,

337
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,660
we'll hire you as an insurance consultant or whatever.

338
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,920
So it's all above board legally, right?

339
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,860
But the intention is screwed up, right?

340
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,720
You know what I mean?

341
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,120
Right.

342
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,180
It's all about intent again.

343
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:38,520
So, yeah, so the moral of the story with water is good, cool, clean water.

344
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:44,560
And if you can produce that without buying anything, well, yeah,

345
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,760
you do have to buy the setup, but you could bury it in the ground.

346
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:52,880
You know, there was a water pump found in the Middle East, I think it was in Lebanon,

347
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:57,140
from a hospital that was – from a building that was 400 years old,

348
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:01,840
and it was converted to a hospital 150 years ago, and it was renovated 30 years ago.

349
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,080
And they said, well, how does this place have such good water pressure?

350
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:09,020
It's way up here, and there's no – and they dug down, and there was this water pump

351
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,080
that's been running for 100 years on its own.

352
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,380
It was like a single-piston diesel thing.

353
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:17,100
No one knew where it was getting fuel or anything, right?

354
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,760
And it was pumping water into this hospital.

355
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,820
And they didn't get more information than that, and they obviously shut it down

356
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:26,120
and replaced it with one that costs a lot to run, right?

357
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,280
So all this stuff exists out there.

358
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,540
But water, okay.

359
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:37,040
What I did on private groups, especially right before the pandemic,

360
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:44,040
in case anyone was concerned, even if you read in the Bible, silver is good for your health, right?

361
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,080
And most people have heard of colloidal silver.

362
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:53,000
A lot of the normies even – well, the population out there doesn't know.

363
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:57,660
But if you're enough time around, quote-unquote, alternative stuff,

364
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,820
you'll hear about colloidal silver.

365
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,580
Well, guess what?

366
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,540
Just like the magnet stuff, the colloidal silver stuff is the same.

367
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,380
They are doing it wrong, okay?

368
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,100
Well, you can't – okay, let's go back to the magnets.

369
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,940
If you go to a magnetic water treatment, it's like $150.

370
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,460
They sell you two strong magnets that you put together,

371
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,500
the way they go over the pipe with some zip ties.

372
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,280
And they make some claims that they can't support, right?

373
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,380
Well, why am I saying it's doing it wrong?

374
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,360
Because they're not going to support their claims anyway.

375
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,060
Is that wrong?

376
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,220
Not really.

377
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,940
It's just not doing what this alignment does.

378
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:38,220
Colloidal silver, they're trying to tell you that the more silver in the water,

379
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,440
the better it is for you.

380
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,660
That's where the FDA stuff comes in.

381
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:49,220
Is it a disease or your skin turns green or blue from doing too much of the particulate, right?

382
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,780
So, in essence, there's people that measure silver content in water

383
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,660
to judge how good the silver is, the silver solution.

384
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:58,660
It's toxic.

385
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,700
It's poison there.

386
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:05,860
I have to lean against the mainstream scientists that tell you it's toxic, right?

387
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,640
Yes, it will denature and kill, quote-unquote, bacteria, yeast,

388
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,220
and fungus, and all this other stuff.

389
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,740
But it's metal.

390
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:19,960
You shouldn't be intaking metal in metallic form in any size, whether colloidal, particulate, or whatever.

391
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:26,000
So, in any way, if you're going to take the silver in metallic form,

392
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,640
the body will have to recognize it, right, to get it into the bloodstream

393
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,860
and into the body past the intestines.

394
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,680
It has to be done through induction, right?

395
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,360
So you don't need the actual physical presence of the silver.

396
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:46,740
You just need enough of the water to have enough of a signal to trigger the signal in the body

397
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:50,660
to produce the silver in the body, and that would be optimum, right?

398
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,360
It would be most powerful.

399
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,400
So what is the solution?

400
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,300
The solution was neighbor's dog.

401
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,280
Here, hold on a second.

402
00:21:59,060 --> 00:21:59,440
No problem.

403
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:09,040
Okay, so the solution would be that because we know it works through induction.

404
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,360
So how do we create a system like that?

405
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,260
Well, is it an ion?

406
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:15,820
Yes.

407
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,540
Is it an ion?

408
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,680
No, right?

409
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:26,440
So because typically when you try to infuse metal in water, it's called like ionizing the water.

410
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:33,120
So the quick solution here is always try to get pure silver, silver bezel.

411
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,400
I found out that here in Tucson, Arizona, Star Gems is the company.

412
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,220
It's like one of the few places left in the country,

413
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:43,840
and I know this from being in L.A. years ago and driving around looking for pure silver.

414
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,600
No one has it.

415
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:52,040
And if you call them and order on the phone silver bezel, like a foot of it, it's inexpensive.

416
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,020
It would be like $5, $6, maybe $10.

417
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:59,060
Triple nine or I think it's double nine or triple nine or four nine fine,

418
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:02,800
depending on what they have in stock, as long as it's 99.99 and better.

419
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,340
So 99 would be double fine, 999 would be triple fine, and so on.

420
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,040
Really inexpensive.

421
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,120
They'll say, oh, yeah, you're another one who found out about this from the Greek.

422
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,540
They send a lot.

423
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,840
People have been going there for years.

424
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,960
But it's the only game in town that I know of.

425
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:23,580
But if you can get fine silver, people say, oh, I got the silver and I'm ready to do your thing.

426
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,680
Well, I say, well, where did you get the silver?

427
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,160
He says, oh, I just have some silver coins.

428
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:33,500
No, no, no, because if you look at silver currency, it always weighs more than an ounce.

429
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,120
Why?

430
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,540
Because it's supposed to be an ounce of silver, but still pure silver is impractical in a coin.

431
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:44,020
If you sit on it, right, you'll bend it, so damage it.

432
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,760
So they have to put copper and tin and zinc and other things in it.

433
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,800
That's why when you weigh a one-ounce coin, guess what?

434
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:54,600
It weighs more than an ounce because in fair market, you are getting an ounce of silver,

435
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:59,360
but it has 5%, 10%, 15% more weight of the other metals.

436
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,600
You see, it's not pure silver.

437
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:07,660
So I wouldn't recommend that because copper does some weird things in the body when you do it this way.

438
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:13,920
But if you're in a pinch, if you have silver coinage or whatever, not anything silver-plated.

439
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:19,480
I would stay away from plating because years ago, they gave silverware to couples that got married.

440
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:25,100
Well, not only does the silver keep disease at bay, so to speak.

441
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,600
Remember, it's not bugs.

442
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,060
It's by induction.

443
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:35,120
If the couple's household was under economic stress, they could always hawk the silver and maintain the household.

444
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,120
You see why it was done?

445
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,140
It was a financial security, right, also.

446
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,000
Don't use silverware like that.

447
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:48,920
But if you have coins, since the colonial days, however you want to phrase that time-wise,

448
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:54,480
when barrels of milk were transported or stored, they didn't have refrigeration.

449
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,900
They kept it out of the light in a dark, cold room.

450
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,620
But they threw a silver coin in the barrel.

451
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:02,200
And they noticed when they did that, the milk stayed fresher longer.

452
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:07,140
But it's just a silver coin in the bottom of the barrel or water or whatever.

453
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:11,600
They threw silver or a pewter pitcher that was silver-plated.

454
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,180
It just lasted longer.

455
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:19,420
So you're going to have to get the triple-nine or double-nine fine silver bezel or wire.

456
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,520
And what you do is you have, just like the regular colloidal silver,

457
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,320
if you're not familiar with colloidal silver, there's a ton of stuff on the Internet about it and how to do it.

458
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,660
It's all wrong, just like the magnet stuff.

459
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,560
If you look at magnetized water, it's how you do it.

460
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,660
None of that will work if you do it that way.

461
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:42,380
So the silver stuff, the principle is you have a power source, a battery, a wall wart or something,

462
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,220
some power source, and you have a positive electrode and a negative electrode in the water,

463
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,400
and silver is produced in the water.

464
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,620
Fine, that's the setup.

465
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,060
So the only thing different here is your power source.

466
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:03,380
They tell you, oh, we do ours with 27 volts, or we do high frequency, high voltage, 1,500 volts,

467
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,780
or we do ours, we cook it.

468
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,080
Oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh.

469
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,400
Okay, so ignore all the voltage.

470
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,680
That's where they all go wrong, and the temperature, too.

471
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:17,260
You don't have to raise the temperature to get more metal in the water.

472
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:21,300
All you need is a single cell, which is 1.5 volts.

473
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:28,820
Okay, cells are called batteries, right, because a battery is more than one, really.

474
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:34,960
In the military, a battery would be not just one shell, it's many shells, right?

475
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:35,720
It's a grouping.

476
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,160
A grouping, yeah.

477
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:46,380
So a single battery or a single cell, it doesn't matter if it's triple A, double A, C or D battery or whatever.

478
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:52,340
Double D, now we're talking about women's cup size, but okay, just whatever.

479
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,200
They're all 1.5 volts.

480
00:26:54,420 --> 00:27:00,440
The only difference with the double D, let's see in my mind, the D battery and the triple A is the current.

481
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,680
Okay, so a single cell, it doesn't matter if it's a dollar store battery where you get, like,

482
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:13,020
a pack of eight double As or triple As for $1.25 or whatever, or a Duracell or it doesn't matter.

483
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:23,240
Right, so you could use just ghetto style Scotch tape or whatever across the wires or the silver.

484
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:29,680
Put it in the water and for, let's say, a quart of water, five minutes is fine.

485
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:33,440
A gallon of water, six or seven minutes is fine.

486
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,260
A glass of water, 30 seconds.

487
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,140
What this does, it will give you a silver.

488
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,000
I don't call it colloidal silver because we're not going for a colloid.

489
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,640
So I had to come up with a term.

490
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,980
And so what I did was I used the Latin terms.

491
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,500
Argentum means silver and aqueous means water.

492
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,000
So I call it aqueous argentum, not colloidal silver.

493
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:57,520
Okay.

494
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,920
It's basically silver water.

495
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,700
So however you want to attach the battery, do not use a nine-volt battery.

496
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,780
Do not use a nine-volt battery.

497
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,820
Now, unless you put in neutral cells.

498
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:12,720
If you're going to get six pieces of silver and set up what's called a neutral cell, you can do that.

499
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,100
So each electrode only measures one and a half volts between it.

500
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:22,860
So anyone who's got more than two or three sharpened pencils in their pocket is familiar with electrolysis.

501
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,360
You have these things called neutral cells.

502
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,740
Don't bother with that.

503
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:30,100
Now, I've experimented with people doing this.

504
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:35,580
And some of the people that had a scientific background or lived with people with a scientific background said,

505
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,840
that's not going to do anything.

506
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,320
That's not putting any silver in the water.

507
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,380
That's not enough juice.

508
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,160
And I measured the water, and there's no silver in it.

509
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,120
You know, they took it for a perfect.

510
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,240
Okay.

511
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:52,660
So some of the people that drank this, you know, you have positive intestinal flora and fauna,

512
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:56,600
which means plants and animals in your belly that help digestion, right?

513
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,900
They're symbiotic with us.

514
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,240
Some of them will agree with the silver.

515
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:00,980
Some don't.

516
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:11,600
So when you pass, mostly solids will change radically if you needed, well, if the silver is reacting.

517
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:18,160
I mean, when I was having conversations with people, especially over 35, I said,

518
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,200
how long did you cook it for?

519
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,020
You know, five minutes.

520
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,760
And I said, did you drink it?

521
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:24,900
And he says, yeah.

522
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,600
I said, how did you go to the bathroom the next day?

523
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,740
I said, oh, boy.

524
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:28,780
Right?

525
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,000
Like a laxative.

526
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:33,040
So I said, cook it, instead of five minutes, do one minute.

527
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,820
And how was it going to the bathroom?

528
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,340
A lot better.

529
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:38,280
So all you need is 30 seconds, right, the older you are, the less time.

530
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:38,840
Okay.

531
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,300
Okay, so what does this do?

532
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:47,280
Okay, if you believe that disease is carried by little pathogens, particles, and viruses and bacteria and stuff,

533
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:51,480
this will also work for your mentality, even though it doesn't work that way.

534
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:58,520
You know, for example, the old magnetic tape, whether it was a cassette tape, A-track, VHS,

535
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,820
that was a Mylar tape coated with magnetic particles.

536
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,820
These little bitty brown magnetic black particles, you ran over a tape head,

537
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,740
and it had all this information on it, right?

538
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,100
You had picture, sound, right?

539
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:15,500
Okay, that's basically how disease is done, very much the same way.

540
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:22,300
It's carried by information field, but there is material prerequisite for it to a degree.

541
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,440
But it's the material is not the cause.

542
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,680
It's one of the components.

543
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:31,020
So when you have this water in your body or around your body, that field is messed up,

544
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:39,180
just like putting a magnet near an old VHS tape or a cassette, or mixing metal powder with your cassette, you know?

545
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,460
It won't work.

546
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,400
It'll be, right?

547
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,400
Okay, so you're interrupting that induction, that spoilage and disease.

548
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,060
Okay, so what else do you do with this?

549
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:53,400
If you guys remember the handy spray bottles, instead of using dish soap straight up,

550
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,320
people put a little dab on a sponge and all that, it doesn't work very well.

551
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:04,240
Dilute the dish soap or whatever soap that you're using for washing dishes or general cleaning in a spray bottle, right?

552
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,700
And then spray it on.

553
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,800
And that, by the way, they have household cleaners that work that way, right?

554
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,380
What do you think these household cleaners, Windex, Fantastic, all these other things are?

555
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,800
They're just diluted detergents, right?

556
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:18,420
So why not get the detergent yourself, dilute it yourself instead of buying the water?

557
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:18,880
Correct.

558
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:25,340
And so you have a spray bottle with the sea silver, the aqua sargentum in it that you make.

559
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:31,120
You could cook it a little bit more if you'd like for use in a spray bottle.

560
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,120
And what do you do with it?

561
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,360
Take a shower.

562
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,280
You have it in the bathroom.

563
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:40,340
And before you towel down, you have it in the shower niche or somewhere in the tub, somewhere nearby.

564
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:46,380
So when you turn off the water of your shower and you're just about like, you know, if you shake off like a dog, that's fine, too.

565
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,720
While you're drip drying, reaching for that towel, do me a favor.

566
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:54,300
Right before you grab the towel, spray your whole body with that, all right?

567
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,620
And now you've got a layer of this on the outside, right?

568
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:06,380
Also, with the spray bottle, if you don't cook it too long, you can spray it in your mouth and just gently inhale, right?

569
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,820
And that vapor will go into the lung to a degree.

570
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,320
But remember, there's no silver in this.

571
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,500
This is a silver program water, right?

572
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,720
Okay, here's the part that's really cool.

573
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,120
Remember, we're still dealing with the silver in the bottle.

574
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,360
I just use it in a bottle.

575
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,100
I don't drink it.

576
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:24,020
Now, if I feel I'm coming down with something, I will do a short glass.

577
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:27,220
Remember, you don't want to drink more than three or four ounces of water at a time.

578
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,660
That's all your body can handle.

579
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,560
Well, under any circumstances, you said that, yeah.

580
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,440
Yeah, because the water triggers the liver reaction.

581
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,140
That's why the blood, you know, there's no such thing as blood sugar.

582
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:43,360
I mean, there is, but the tests don't work if you're thirsty or dehydrated or overhydrated.

583
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,780
It's just, you know, it's like the blood pressure and whatever.

584
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,860
So anyway, I would do that on occasion.

585
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:56,460
If you feel a sore throat coming on, right, you do a little shot of that or in the morning

586
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:59,460
or once in the middle of the day or night, and it's gone the next day.

587
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,200
So here, we go back to the spray bottle.

588
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,600
You could spray it in your mouth.

589
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:08,320
What happens with these spray droplets, they become sort of naturally,

590
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,200
they pick up an electric charge from the atmosphere.

591
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:17,080
And they're douly charged, doubly charged and duly charged when it comes out of a fine mist.

592
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:22,300
As a matter of fact, Chuck, don't think those inhalers and vaporizers and all,

593
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:25,800
it's a fine mist for people that have, that look for lung treatment, right?

594
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,180
Yeah.

595
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:29,040
Yeah, it's always in a mist, not a drop or something.

596
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:32,960
So the spray bottle, spray on the body in the shower.

597
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:37,320
By the way, people who've had like itchy parts of their body or breakouts on their body

598
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,380
when they do this right at the shower routine,

599
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,580
after a few days, weeks or a few months, their conditions are gone.

600
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,020
Before I continue with this, by the way, since I mentioned,

601
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:53,260
when I go out, whenever I see someone, I'm kind of nosy.

602
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,040
No, Greek is nosy? No way.

603
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,440
Well, how do you think you pick up what's going on?

604
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:07,900
But when I see someone buying like antifungal cream, like jock itch or athlete's foot itch or whatever,

605
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:09,780
you know, medicine, it's like the same.

606
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,900
I pointed and I said, you know, you put that on your feet, right?

607
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,380
It tells you between your toes and all that.

608
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,980
I said, you know that if you also put it on your ankle,

609
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:23,580
the condition will go away almost immediately, like a day or two.

610
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,219
But if you just put it the way they direct you,

611
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,120
you'll probably be buying that for the rest of your life.

612
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,800
The same thing for hands.

613
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,639
People that are in the military that go to Asia or whatever,

614
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,639
they get fungus under their nails, believe it or not,

615
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:37,120
because of the different bugs and things like that that they pick up,

616
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,120
that those under the nails literally will live there, right?

617
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,320
And it's very typical, especially if you go to Korea,

618
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,460
places with radically different diets and things,

619
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,159
and they have these fungus on their hands.

620
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,300
Several military people have run into this too.

621
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,820
And I said, if you just rub that on your hands,

622
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:56,340
you'll be on that erythromycin or whatever for months and months.

623
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,780
If you rub it on your hands like they tell you,

624
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,800
and put it on your wrist, all around your wrist,

625
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,160
it'll be gone in two or three days.

626
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,040
Do you see the commonality here?

627
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,120
Okay, so why?

628
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,560
Well, because they say it's between the toes and on the fingers.

629
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:15,700
Why would I put it on my ankle and it works better,

630
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,420
and why would I put it on my wrist if it's on the finger?

631
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,220
Well, because it's not physical.

632
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:23,840
The energy, the main energy that directs what's going on

633
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,300
at the end of the foot is at the ankle.

634
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,560
The wrist is what directs what's going on with the fingers.

635
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,440
As a matter of fact, the carpal tunnel syndrome and all that,

636
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,760
that also involves the wrist.

637
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,980
People who use their fingers get sore wrists, right?

638
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,260
The energy part.

639
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,460
So anyway, I just wanted to throw that in because

640
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,960
when I mentioned if you take a shower,

641
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,340
or this is a hygienic, you spray yourself with the silver,

642
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,540
these conditions tend to mitigate.

643
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,860
I'm not saying if you have an itchy spot somewhere,

644
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,980
pay particular attention on your wrists and ankles

645
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:56,460
because remember, you just finished the shower,

646
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,680
and I said do the whole body so you're covered, you see?

647
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:03,300
But I just wanted to talk about the foot cream

648
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,480
between the toes that people use on the bottom of the foot.

649
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,880
But put it on your ankle, it'll go away right away.

650
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,140
It'll stay away, right?

651
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:15,220
For the groin area, it's the butt crack and the lower back,

652
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,800
and up to the navel.

653
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:19,660
You don't have to do your whole abdomen and hip,

654
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,300
but an area the width of your hand from the groin to the navel,

655
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,800
and you could put some in the navel,

656
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,060
and to the top of your gluteus maximus,

657
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:31,140
to the lower spine, at least to L3.

658
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,100
Okay.

659
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:35,600
We have the sacrum, the sacroiliac area,

660
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,760
and so you go one, two, three.

661
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,000
L3 is about two or three inches above the butt crack.

662
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,290
If you put some there, if you have any ointment,

663
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:46,150
and the butt crack doesn't mean all the way around,

664
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:48,250
and up in the front, a little bit on the navel,

665
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:49,190
whatever condition.

666
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:54,910
A lot of women, I noticed, they buy, I call it box cream.

667
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:58,410
Women have a box, and they have problems with that,

668
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:00,530
and I'm like, you're only going to be using that for,

669
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:03,870
it should be like, I don't know, nine years.

670
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:06,370
I'm like, do it up to your navel and put it up here,

671
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,690
it'll be gone in a week.

672
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:09,370
And it is.

673
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:12,370
It's just an energetic thing.

674
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:16,110
So look, the reason I'm saying this

675
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:19,210
is because I just finished saying

676
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:20,890
we're going to spray the whole body

677
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,570
with the Equisargentum in the shower,

678
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,050
so these things are not of concern.

679
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:28,370
But it harkens back, it kind of,

680
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:30,330
it's in line with the same thing,

681
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:33,010
because there are a lot of people using these ointments, you know.

682
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,470
And they use them perennially.

683
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:38,170
I mean, for a long, long time, and they don't have to.

684
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:39,750
It either works or it doesn't.

685
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:41,310
Well, it works if I keep using it.

686
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:43,270
Well, if you keep using it,

687
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:44,810
it means you've got to keep buying it, right?

688
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:47,810
It doesn't mean it really works, then, because you didn't, yeah.

689
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,650
Well, it does work, but yeah,

690
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:50,970
because if they don't use it, it gets worse,

691
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,890
but they have to keep buying it, so, right?

692
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:53,810
It's that last bit.

693
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:56,630
And by the way, the doctors don't know what I just told you,

694
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,630
because everything, you know, remember,

695
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:00,130
I've been saying for a long time,

696
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:02,610
if you find an herb that cures or heals something,

697
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:05,050
you give it to one of these, you know,

698
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,370
modern trained people,

699
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,590
that makes it heal, right?

700
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:10,830
You have to synthesize it,

701
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:14,210
not see the whole plant and what else grows near it, right?

702
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,290
Or how it grows and, right?

703
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:18,090
That's how you would really synthesize it.

704
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:19,290
How does the plant grow?

705
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:20,210
Where does it grow?

706
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:21,270
When does it grow?

707
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,770
And what does it look like through different growth stages,

708
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:26,750
because it may not be medicinal in certain growth stages, right?

709
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:29,190
Not interested, right?

710
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:31,830
Then, if you understand all those things I just mentioned,

711
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,870
then you can properly synthesize it,

712
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:37,010
not just let's burn and fight with chemicals in it, see?

713
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:39,590
So, anyway, I went through all of this

714
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:42,290
because we're talking about the outside of the body,

715
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:44,310
but going back to the inside of the body

716
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,550
and other things,

717
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:48,310
using it in a spray bottle

718
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:50,230
is always going to be better than drinking it,

719
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:52,650
because I used to give an analogy,

720
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:54,010
if you're standing on one end

721
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:56,290
of an Olympic-sized swimming pool, Chuck,

722
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:57,430
and I'm on the other end,

723
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:00,490
and you pour a glass of water on your end of the pool

724
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:02,630
and I take a glass of water out on my end,

725
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:03,930
is it the same glass of water?

726
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:04,950
No, no.

727
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,990
Well, we don't know.

728
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:09,750
Now, somebody funny might say,

729
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,890
well, if he puts blue dye in it

730
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:12,970
and dumps it in,

731
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,450
you'll see where the water is, right?

732
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:16,350
Well, that's not how really water works.

733
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,950
You're going to see the dye, not the water.

734
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:18,370
Right.

735
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:22,250
There's no way to assure that.

736
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:23,370
Yeah, right.

737
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,310
You'll see the dye.

738
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:25,090
That's why people say,

739
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,170
oh, you see the magnetic field

740
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,370
when you put the metal shavings.

741
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:29,550
No, that's not the magnetic field.

742
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:36,910
You kind of think about that for a moment.

743
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:38,070
All right.

744
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:41,330
So, when you have all these tiny little droplets,

745
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:43,850
this is the Greek stretching it,

746
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:45,510
each little droplet could represent

747
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,250
an Olympic-sized swimming pool, right?

748
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:48,470
Okay.

749
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:49,290
Think about it.

750
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:53,230
It's a pretty massive amount of energy in there.

751
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,870
So, the sprayer is really where it's at

752
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,170
for intake also.

753
00:39:58,430 --> 00:39:59,590
But here's the kicker.

754
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:00,210
You ready?

755
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,070
This is the kicker.

756
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,870
This is where you're going to save money.

757
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:04,510
People, right,

758
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:08,110
they say you play at people's fear,

759
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:08,770
their greed,

760
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:11,010
and their ego,

761
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:12,710
and they're always going to buy something, right?

762
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:14,910
So, if you're selling this,

763
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:17,130
I'm just telling how to make it,

764
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:18,390
and I'll recap it.

765
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:21,530
The way you save money with this is food spoilage.

766
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,230
I did many experiments.

767
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:25,970
You get wet cheese.

768
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:26,790
Well, guess what?

769
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:27,810
I like feta cheese.

770
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:28,630
Oh, my goodness.

771
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:34,250
It's a wet pungent cheese,

772
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:34,910
or any cheese.

773
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:36,650
Actually, there's a Mexican soft cheese.

774
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:38,470
Once you open the package,

775
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:39,990
it goes sour in three days.

776
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,430
It just smells bad,

777
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:42,390
and in four days,

778
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:44,090
it actually doesn't look good, right?

779
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:45,810
So, I did an experiment.

780
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,890
I think it was like a Mexican soft cheese.

781
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,770
Drier cheese has high fat content

782
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:52,450
like mozzarella and other things like that.

783
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:53,690
It can last much longer.

784
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:57,150
But basically, a very strong pungent cheese

785
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:57,730
that's wet.

786
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:02,230
It would go bad quickly.

787
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:02,970
Days.

788
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,430
Not even a week.

789
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:04,890
Just days.

790
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,670
It would start turning.

791
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:09,030
Well, what I did was I kept a piece

792
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:11,070
of this Mexican cheese going for like three months.

793
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:12,950
What I would do is every three days,

794
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:13,550
I would open it,

795
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,570
bring it over to the sink,

796
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:15,270
tilt the container,

797
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:17,750
and spray some of this aqua sargentum

798
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:18,830
from the sprayer.

799
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:20,610
Put the lid on, put it away.

800
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:21,490
Three or four days later,

801
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:32,350
it goes away.

802
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:35,290
If you have some kind of a leftover,

803
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:36,910
some kind of,

804
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:38,850
something that,

805
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,330
you don't want to eat spoiled food,

806
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:42,790
but as time goes on,

807
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:44,050
it doesn't taste as fresh,

808
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,110
and the flavor changes.

809
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,390
It actually goes sour.

810
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:49,230
To prevent things from going sour,

811
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:51,230
if you have tomatoes on a windowsill,

812
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:52,970
sometimes you'll notice a mold spot.

813
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:55,570
So, you have vegetables.

814
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:57,210
Let's say they have this thing

815
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:59,010
called the crisper section of the fridge.

816
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:03,690
So, you have the vegetables

817
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:04,590
in a bag or whatever.

818
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:05,430
You bring them home,

819
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:06,590
spray them with this,

820
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:08,750
spray whatever is going to go,

821
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:10,410
vegetables going to go into the fridge.

822
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:13,070
I have a piece of daikon

823
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:14,990
that I've been doing this with

824
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,730
since what they call last November.

825
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:19,010
It's still edible.

826
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:20,670
It's not as fresh as it was in November,

827
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,410
but it's a good piece of daikon still.

828
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:24,970
I think we might have finished that by now,

829
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:26,170
but to give you an idea,

830
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:28,490
three, four months,

831
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:33,350
or will last much longer,

832
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,270
like several weeks instead of a few days.

833
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:36,830
Yeah, I was just about to ask you about that,

834
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:38,850
because one thing I despise is

835
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:42,190
I get lettuce or I get one of these,

836
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:44,070
I get a romaine lettuce or something like that,

837
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:45,930
and within a couple of days,

838
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:47,150
it gets either slimy

839
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:50,150
or it starts to smell and taste fruity.

840
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,130
You know what I'm talking about?

841
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:52,930
Yeah, yeah.

842
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:54,690
Well, here's the thing.

843
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:56,090
If you grew romaine lettuce

844
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:58,170
and cut it and put it in your fridge,

845
00:42:58,170 --> 00:42:59,210
you'd be good for three weeks,

846
00:42:59,290 --> 00:42:59,950
but if you buy it,

847
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:00,970
it's only good for a few days

848
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:02,790
because it takes a few weeks to get to you,

849
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:04,150
a couple of weeks.

850
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:09,050
I learned this by growing my own veg,

851
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:09,630
which I do.

852
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:14,790
Yeah, so the romaine lettuce,

853
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:15,830
the way you would do it

854
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:17,290
is you would hold it sideways

855
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:18,750
and spray right down the middle

856
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:20,350
and then turn it upside down,

857
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:21,230
shake it off a little,

858
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:22,230
and spray it again

859
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:23,350
because that initial shake

860
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:28,710
is what you're using this.

861
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:30,170
If you have a family of two or three people

862
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:31,490
and you all get involved with this program,

863
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,790
you're going to need about a quart

864
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:35,130
to a half a gallon a week.

865
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:37,870
So anything that's going to spoil,

866
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,310
including the outside of your body

867
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:40,510
or the inside of your body,

868
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:41,890
this is what you put on it.

869
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:44,030
If you have animals,

870
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:45,050
it works really well.

871
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:46,950
Animals contact certain areas.

872
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:48,490
You have dogs, they slobber on things.

873
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:49,430
You use it as a cleaner.

874
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:51,090
I mop with it.

875
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:01,850
Or aqueous argentum.

876
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:04,410
So several questions are going to come up.

877
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:05,410
So anyway,

878
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:07,270
I'm praising it

879
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:09,150
because it deserves praise

880
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:10,310
because it's not toxic.

881
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:11,990
Oh, the other thing I haven't said

882
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:13,590
is it works better

883
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:15,230
than the silver that has

884
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:17,450
the high silver metallic content in it.

885
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:19,530
More effective.

886
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:23,270
I know people that buy

887
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:24,330
colloidal silver

888
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:26,990
ready-made in a bottle,

889
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:28,150
like 30, 40 bucks for a bottle

890
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:29,170
or a 16-ounce thing.

891
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:30,910
And they tell them,

892
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:31,690
even put it in a sprayer,

893
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:33,110
your sore throat,

894
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:34,190
go, no, it's not working.

895
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:35,490
Well, they tell them to make this,

896
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:36,790
the next day sore throat's gone.

897
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:41,110
So this is going to work better

898
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:42,210
than any of the metallics.

899
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:43,410
And there's nothing on the internet

900
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:44,310
about it using one.

901
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:45,930
Maybe one day there will be.

902
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:47,350
One and a half volts.

903
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:48,950
You can get creative.

904
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:51,590
I have power supplies

905
00:44:58,170 --> 00:44:58,410
that are three and a half volts.

906
00:44:58,510 --> 00:44:59,330
But if you measure it,

907
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:00,450
it's one and three quarter volts.

908
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:01,330
That'll work also.

909
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:03,210
The old NICAD chargers

910
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:04,390
for anything three and a half volt.

911
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:05,650
Little hand tools

912
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:07,950
that were three and a half volt NICAD,

913
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:10,070
the tools that since it's gone,

914
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:11,230
if you kept the charger,

915
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:12,110
it says three and a half volt.

916
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:13,070
If you have a volt meter,

917
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:14,750
read it, it'll be under two volts.

918
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:15,370
That'll work.

919
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:18,270
If you have just the five volt

920
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:30,130
and you want to research

921
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:31,470
how neutral plates work

922
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:32,650
in a hydrogen cell,

923
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:33,730
it's the same principle.

924
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:35,930
I have something called

925
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:36,850
Silver Made Easy.

926
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:39,470
And it's three or four pieces of silver

927
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:41,090
on a piece of cork with epoxy.

928
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:44,690
And you use a telephone charger.

929
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:47,650
Or you hook it into your telephone.

930
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:49,310
And your telephone will make the silver.

931
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:50,230
Or USB.

932
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:52,350
Your computer will make the silver.

933
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:54,650
But it's three plates

934
00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:55,790
in these three spaces.

935
00:45:57,870 --> 00:45:59,370
Three, you see?

936
00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:00,030
Okay.

937
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:01,710
And that'll work.

938
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:02,930
So if you had 100 volts,

939
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:05,790
you need 75 or 80 plates.

940
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:07,970
But this is getting a little bit beyond.

941
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:09,790
Here's the other question.

942
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:12,190
Well, what kind of water do you use?

943
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:13,470
Because another thing you'll find

944
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:15,410
on the quote unquote colloidal,

945
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:17,170
some people call it colloidal silver.

946
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:19,710
Instead of colloidal, it's colloidal.

947
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:23,010
You have to use distilled water, right?

948
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:23,810
Well, yeah, you could.

949
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:25,830
But you don't have to.

950
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:30,350
If you're a little bit weary

951
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:32,350
about processing water at home

952
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:34,150
with a filtration or the Brita filter

953
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:36,250
like I've given or the pitcher filter.

954
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,910
If you're into bottled water

955
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:40,350
like the stuff that they deliver

956
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:41,510
or you buy, that's fine.

957
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:42,290
That's good enough.

958
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:43,510
It doesn't have to be distilled.

959
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:44,950
In other words, what they sell

960
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:46,890
as drinking water with minerals is fine

961
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:48,110
because you're only going to be

962
00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:50,050
quote unquote cooking it for a minute

963
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:52,850
to five minutes on a quart to a gallon rate.

964
00:46:58,490 --> 00:46:58,970
Right?

965
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:01,410
So you're not cooking it for a long time.

966
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:03,450
If you want to use distilled water,

967
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:05,110
it works just the same.

968
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:08,450
You can just cook it for a short time also.

969
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:10,870
Maybe if you want it to be

970
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:11,850
almost as potent,

971
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:13,870
you can double the time.

972
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:16,670
So 10 minutes for the distilled water

973
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:19,970
for a quart and 15 or 20 minutes

974
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:21,770
for the distilled gallon, right?

975
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:23,570
And down from there.

976
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:25,510
And you could still do a minute for a glass

977
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:26,550
because there are people

978
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:28,430
who claim them.

979
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:30,790
There's a lot of mythology

980
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:32,190
that if you drink distilled water,

981
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:34,510
it leaches the body from minerals.

982
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:35,350
It really doesn't.

983
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:37,270
But what the distilled water

984
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:39,410
is negative about

985
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:40,890
is how they got it distilled.

986
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:42,450
They tortured the water.

987
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:43,650
You know what I mean?

988
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:47,290
Remember Phyllis Diller?

989
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:50,470
She tried to keep herself young

990
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:53,210
with a lot of plastic surgery.

991
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:53,750
But to me,

992
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:54,530
she looked like someone

993
00:47:58,170 --> 00:47:59,390
that had too much plastic surgery

994
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:01,110
to look like torture victims to me.

995
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:02,550
I know maybe it's my perception.

996
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:03,510
Well, it is my perception.

997
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:06,190
But yeah, it's tortured water.

998
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:08,630
So that's why I say the milder processed water.

999
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:09,690
Any water will work.

1000
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:12,050
But if the water is very salty,

1001
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:15,130
very, very high mineral content

1002
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:15,490
and all that,

1003
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:16,870
yeah, get some bottled water.

1004
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:18,070
Any bottled water will work.

1005
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:19,430
Well, the better bottled water

1006
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:20,390
is a little better

1007
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:22,650
and keep it out of the light

1008
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:28,570
than bottled water

1009
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:30,250
that's deliberately loaded with minerals.

1010
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:33,970
So the water and the voltage

1011
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:35,410
has got to be just one cell.

1012
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:36,350
Now, here's the thing.

1013
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:37,830
You could be using that same cell

1014
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:38,950
for years and years and years.

1015
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:39,970
It will not wear down.

1016
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,450
That's the interesting part about it

1017
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:44,270
because it uses very little current.

1018
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:45,790
I shouldn't say never,

1019
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:47,430
but very rarely.

1020
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:48,490
I have one that's been running

1021
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:49,350
for like four years

1022
00:48:58,170 --> 00:48:58,270
and it's still running.

1023
00:48:58,270 --> 00:48:58,870
Now, here's the other thing

1024
00:48:58,870 --> 00:48:59,730
I was going to say.

1025
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:03,110
Oh, this is the other thing

1026
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:04,110
that's very, very important

1027
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:05,570
with the aqueous sergentum,

1028
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:07,070
this method.

1029
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:09,590
Make sure whatever you got,

1030
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:10,870
red tape, nail polish,

1031
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:11,790
I don't know,

1032
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:13,050
whatever you want to use,

1033
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:14,310
you mark,

1034
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:16,490
you dedicate your electrode positive

1035
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:19,910
and you dedicate your electrode negative

1036
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:20,930
forever.

1037
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:28,450
If you have batteries,

1038
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:28,930
they're small.

1039
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:30,690
If you have an adult-sized hand,

1040
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:32,350
you could hold it with two pieces

1041
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:33,830
of tape,

1042
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:35,830
two pieces of silver hanging out of it

1043
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:37,190
over something with water.

1044
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:38,610
Don't drop the battery in the water.

1045
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:40,130
I suggest using wires and things.

1046
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:42,890
You can even buy a colloidal silver kit

1047
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:43,670
that they sell,

1048
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:44,850
whoever does,

1049
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:45,790
if it's really cheap,

1050
00:49:45,870 --> 00:49:47,370
just for the setup

1051
00:49:47,370 --> 00:49:48,890
with the wiring and all that

1052
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:00,830
and you immerse the electrodes.

1053
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:02,950
Whatever is positive

1054
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:04,710
will always be positive

1055
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,110
and whatever is negative

1056
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:07,470
will always be negative.

1057
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:08,810
Do not ever switch them.

1058
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:10,830
If you ever,

1059
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:11,510
let's say,

1060
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:12,710
just do it randomly,

1061
00:50:12,830 --> 00:50:13,930
you have two pieces of silver

1062
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:14,530
in the drawer,

1063
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:15,070
you take them out,

1064
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:16,250
hook them up to alligator clips,

1065
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:16,470
whatever,

1066
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:17,850
and you submerse them in the water

1067
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:29,210
and when you switch the electrodes,

1068
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:30,730
it's going to do nothing

1069
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:31,770
but pollute the water

1070
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:33,270
and there's nothing you could do

1071
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:34,450
to really change the silver.

1072
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:36,950
I've had people try to polish the silver out

1073
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:39,410
because one electrode will get dark,

1074
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:40,510
one will turn white

1075
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:43,050
and they'll switch them

1076
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:45,230
and they'll say,

1077
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:46,270
oh, now they're both dark

1078
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:46,990
and it's polluting.

1079
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:48,570
I see stuff coming off in the water.

1080
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:49,850
I say, it'll always do that.

1081
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:51,490
You have to get new silver.

1082
00:50:58,170 --> 00:50:58,610
You can't just smooth it out

1083
00:50:58,610 --> 00:50:59,430
and clean it that way.

1084
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:01,250
You have to change the memory in the silver

1085
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:02,770
just like you would a tape.

1086
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:04,470
It's really bizarre.

1087
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:06,690
It doesn't hold so much true

1088
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:07,630
with the higher voltage.

1089
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:10,750
With the higher voltage,

1090
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:11,290
you'll pump,

1091
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:12,610
if you switch the electrodes,

1092
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:14,550
it'll get dirty but it'll clean up

1093
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:15,470
but with the lower voltage

1094
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:17,050
it'll always just pollute the water.

1095
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:19,910
The main mistake that people make

1096
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,390
is being random with the silver.

1097
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:30,630
Since we're talking about the electrodes now,

1098
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:34,910
I did this two decades ago

1099
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:35,790
when I first got into it.

1100
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:37,710
I would make so much of the silver water

1101
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:39,050
by hammering it with high volt.

1102
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:41,570
I would put three 9-volt batteries in series.

1103
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:42,470
You know how 9-volt batteries,

1104
00:51:42,550 --> 00:51:43,950
you keep snapping them together, right?

1105
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:46,110
27 volts and all that.

1106
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:48,390
The electrodes would wear out

1107
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:49,550
and I'd get more silver.

1108
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:51,990
Well, with this 1.5-volt system,

1109
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:55,030
the metal doesn't put any metal in the water

1110
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:55,690
so guess what?

1111
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:01,870
If you had 100 years to go,

1112
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:02,750
100 years from now,

1113
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:03,910
the silver would still be there.

1114
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:06,690
You're going to be producing

1115
00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:08,290
aqueous argentum,

1116
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:09,210
not colloidal silver.

1117
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:12,050
There is no measurable silver in the water.

1118
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:13,070
You take it to any lab,

1119
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,810
they won't measure any silver in the water.

1120
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:17,610
Maybe a tiny, like parts per billion

1121
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:19,590
if it has a high mineral content.

1122
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:22,410
And anyone will say

1123
00:52:22,410 --> 00:52:24,670
that's peddling colloidal silver

1124
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:25,990
or colloidal silver therapy

1125
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:27,310
will laugh at you for doing that

1126
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:28,550
but in the meantime,

1127
00:52:29,370 --> 00:52:31,210
this method will work with the body

1128
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:31,770
way better.

1129
00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:33,830
And I knew,

1130
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:36,590
I revisited this a few years ago again

1131
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:38,910
because I knew there were benefits to it

1132
00:52:38,910 --> 00:52:41,430
but I never got the benefits

1133
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:42,570
using what they did.

1134
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:44,370
You know, the higher voltage

1135
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:45,310
and the hot water

1136
00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:47,490
and hammering it,

1137
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:50,170
making sure you get all that gold color

1138
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:51,310
in the water and all that.

1139
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:52,750
I never got the benefits.

1140
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:55,310
So I said we got to go biologically

1141
00:52:58,170 --> 00:52:58,590
because the batteries

1142
00:52:58,590 --> 00:53:00,510
is an alkaline battery, right?

1143
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,310
It's literally a paste

1144
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:03,590
with a cathode and anode,

1145
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:04,710
a carbon, right,

1146
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:06,570
and metal zinc

1147
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:07,930
and it will make electricity

1148
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:11,250
when you connect the two electrodes

1149
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:13,030
but a car, you know,

1150
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:14,790
sulfuric acid with lead, right,

1151
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:16,390
in a car, on and on and on and on.

1152
00:53:16,450 --> 00:53:18,510
These are natural or semi-organic

1153
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:19,510
and organic materials

1154
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:20,470
that make electricity.

1155
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:22,570
Just like in the third grade,

1156
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:28,910
you know, that crunchy sound, right?

1157
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:31,130
Or, you know,

1158
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:32,550
if you put enough lemons together

1159
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:33,950
with pieces of copper wire,

1160
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:34,750
a little light bulb

1161
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:36,910
would come on real dim, right?

1162
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:37,530
Oh, yeah.

1163
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:39,930
Lighting a light bulb

1164
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:41,370
with a potato at one point, yeah.

1165
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:43,590
Yeah, that's all three quarter

1166
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:45,790
to one volt, right?

1167
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:48,550
That's enough but it's slow.

1168
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:51,870
If you don't have any electrical power,

1169
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:54,230
you could do a salt battery, right?

1170
00:53:54,370 --> 00:53:55,150
Salt water

1171
00:53:58,170 --> 00:53:58,490
or vinegar

1172
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:01,430
with two copper wires in it

1173
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:02,690
and then on the other end,

1174
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:04,810
your silver wire will produce one volt.

1175
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:07,230
Chlorine battery or whatever,

1176
00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:08,110
you can make, right?

1177
00:54:08,810 --> 00:54:10,950
There's a very easy to make

1178
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:13,670
a quote-unquote one volt cell.

1179
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:16,210
Even the Baghdad battery, right?

1180
00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:16,570
Remember,

1181
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:18,170
they had the iron and the copper

1182
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:20,390
from 3,000 years ago or 2,000 years ago.

1183
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:23,490
So, yeah, the power has to be low

1184
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:25,530
and what I'm touting about this

1185
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:27,750
is that its efficacy is incredible.

1186
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:29,650
It's very –

1187
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:31,330
and before the –

1188
00:54:31,330 --> 00:54:32,670
when the pandemic first hit,

1189
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:34,510
I just kept doing Skype calls

1190
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:35,570
and telling people how to make it.

1191
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:36,570
So, I got a lot of feedback

1192
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:38,850
from the worldwide web community

1193
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:40,490
on Skype calls and whatever, right?

1194
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:41,970
On various things.

1195
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:43,930
The main thing that I wanted

1196
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:44,710
to just talk about,

1197
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:45,710
so we'll talk about water.

1198
00:54:45,970 --> 00:54:47,430
It wasn't what you were thinking, right?

1199
00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:48,410
No, not at all.

1200
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:51,350
So, the main thing here

1201
00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:52,550
is getting the silver,

1202
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:54,090
no silver coins,

1203
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:55,770
no silver spoons, please.

1204
00:54:56,290 --> 00:54:57,410
Those could be used

1205
00:54:57,410 --> 00:54:58,850
without any ionization,

1206
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:00,070
what they call ionization,

1207
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:02,430
just having the presence in the liquid.

1208
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:04,290
The main thing here

1209
00:55:04,290 --> 00:55:05,550
is getting the silver bezel.

1210
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:07,570
I recommend bezel versus wire

1211
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:08,810
because bezel is like flat.

1212
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:10,030
It's like an eighth inch

1213
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:10,970
or a quarter inch wide

1214
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:17,970
in the surface area,

1215
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:19,310
especially when it's round.

1216
00:55:20,410 --> 00:55:21,610
So, get creative.

1217
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:24,090
I don't get anything for it,

1218
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:25,490
but Star Gems in Tucson,

1219
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:26,110
you call them up,

1220
00:55:26,170 --> 00:55:26,830
they'll send it to you.

1221
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:27,350
It's cheap.

1222
00:55:27,510 --> 00:55:28,470
They have very fair prices

1223
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:29,690
on double, triple, nine,

1224
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:31,770
fine silver, not sterling silver.

1225
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:33,810
Sterling means it has copper,

1226
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:36,010
tin, lead, whatever in it

1227
00:55:36,010 --> 00:55:37,490
to make it stronger.

1228
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:38,990
It's got to be fine.

1229
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:49,690
The Japanese source,

1230
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:52,530
they have the best metallurgy processes.

1231
00:55:54,110 --> 00:55:55,090
In the 80s,

1232
00:55:55,630 --> 00:55:56,850
Americans got pissed off

1233
00:55:56,850 --> 00:55:58,710
when the Japanese were buying

1234
00:55:58,710 --> 00:55:59,410
all the copper.

1235
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:00,510
They're like,

1236
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:01,130
what are you guys buying

1237
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:02,510
all this copper from us for?

1238
00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:03,350
You're not using that much.

1239
00:56:03,350 --> 00:56:03,870
Yeah, we know,

1240
00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:04,870
but you guys leave so much

1241
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:06,010
gold and silver in the copper,

1242
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:06,850
we buy the copper,

1243
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:08,230
re-refine it,

1244
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:09,730
and all the gold and silver we get out of it,

1245
00:56:09,790 --> 00:56:10,970
it's like getting the copper for free,

1246
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:12,150
and then we sell the copper again

1247
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:13,310
and we make 100% profit.

1248
00:56:16,090 --> 00:56:17,370
And they got pissed,

1249
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:18,890
and they couldn't figure out

1250
00:56:18,890 --> 00:56:20,210
how to get more of the gold and silver

1251
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:20,970
out of the copper,

1252
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:21,810
the Americans.

1253
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:24,310
Still, they still can't.

1254
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:26,230
So, anyway,

1255
00:56:26,990 --> 00:56:28,470
I hope what I just said made sense

1256
00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:30,190
from an economic point of view.

1257
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:34,830
So, that's what I wanted to mention.

1258
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:37,050
Number nine,

1259
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:39,450
to get the bezel silver triple nine

1260
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:40,590
or double nine fine,

1261
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:44,330
one and a half volt,

1262
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:46,270
any water that you would drink

1263
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:47,790
that tastes good is fine.

1264
00:56:48,370 --> 00:56:49,850
No more than a couple of minutes

1265
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:50,570
for a quart,

1266
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:52,750
and double that time for a gallon.

1267
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:55,850
Keep it in spray bottles.

1268
00:56:56,310 --> 00:56:57,650
I have one in the bathroom,

1269
00:56:57,810 --> 00:56:58,490
one in the kitchen,

1270
00:56:58,650 --> 00:56:59,990
and another one floating around,

1271
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:00,770
let's say.

1272
00:57:01,550 --> 00:57:03,150
It works well on animals.

1273
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:08,270
Use an old fantastic bottle.

1274
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:08,850
No, no, no.

1275
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:11,370
A clean bottle

1276
00:57:11,370 --> 00:57:13,010
that never had something in it

1277
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:14,210
that sticks to the floor.

1278
00:57:14,210 --> 00:57:15,490
Yeah, dollar stores, Walmart,

1279
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:18,030
you see them everywhere.

1280
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:20,250
The gardening section.

1281
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:23,270
If you got 15 children,

1282
00:57:23,390 --> 00:57:23,970
you might want to get

1283
00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:25,090
one of those pump sprayers

1284
00:57:25,090 --> 00:57:25,610
with the hose.

1285
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:26,550
You have them all lined up,

1286
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:27,290
open your mouth,

1287
00:57:27,370 --> 00:57:28,130
and you walk down

1288
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:38,310
and if you're on some kind of

1289
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:40,250
regimen with the aqua sargentum,

1290
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:41,830
it's going to be the most potent

1291
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:43,150
for three days if it's kept

1292
00:57:43,150 --> 00:57:43,830
in the dark.

1293
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:46,170
A month later, two weeks later,

1294
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:47,150
it's still fine,

1295
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:48,790
but not as potent as for the

1296
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:49,730
first three or four days.

1297
00:57:50,330 --> 00:57:51,170
Here's the other thing.

1298
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:52,430
If you spray it in your mouth,

1299
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:53,650
it's going to have this odd

1300
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:56,130
sweet aftertaste.

1301
00:57:56,410 --> 00:57:57,370
Not directly sweet.

1302
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:58,670
It'll just taste like regular water.

1303
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:08,110
Not sweet with no other flavor.

1304
00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:09,190
It's like a sickly sweet.

1305
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:11,870
It's not like that.

1306
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:13,070
It's not like if you're ever

1307
00:58:13,930 --> 00:58:15,390
changing the coolant in a car

1308
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:16,170
and you touch your mouth

1309
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:17,530
and it's really that sickly sweet.

1310
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:18,330
Not like that.

1311
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:21,110
It's a vague aftertaste,

1312
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:21,630
like you said.

1313
00:58:21,770 --> 00:58:23,610
It's way distant aftertaste

1314
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:25,770
and it's very unique to this.

1315
00:58:25,890 --> 00:58:27,950
If you tasted the other silvers

1316
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:29,130
that they peddle and tell you

1317
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:29,990
how to make or whatever,

1318
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:37,050
it's not like that.

1319
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:39,750
I have tasted the all-American

1320
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:41,870
colloidal silver.

1321
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:43,590
They put it in...

1322
00:58:43,590 --> 00:58:45,510
I've had that before in my mouth.

1323
00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:46,010
Droppers.

1324
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:49,130
There's a nasty kind of metallic,

1325
00:58:49,330 --> 00:58:50,250
very heavy metallic taste.

1326
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:50,870
It's toxic.

1327
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:54,310
This will work.

1328
00:58:54,350 --> 00:58:55,650
There's no silver present.

1329
00:58:56,750 --> 00:58:58,070
Once it gets to the body,

1330
00:58:58,130 --> 00:58:58,670
the body says,

1331
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:00,790
I know exactly what to do with this.

1332
00:59:01,310 --> 00:59:02,930
This is all pure signal.

1333
00:59:07,230 --> 00:59:08,370
The body is like,

1334
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:08,930
oh, great.

1335
00:59:09,390 --> 00:59:10,850
I know exactly what to do with this.

1336
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:11,210
Thanks.

1337
00:59:11,930 --> 00:59:12,790
I got the message.

1338
00:59:15,110 --> 00:59:15,910
It works.

1339
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:19,930
Once you have it in a spray bottle,

1340
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:21,730
where do you apply it?

1341
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:23,170
Again, just to recap,

1342
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:24,850
right after a shower.

1343
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:25,590
You don't have to,

1344
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:28,570
but it'll cover you.

1345
00:59:29,410 --> 00:59:30,190
Then you towel down.

1346
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:31,790
Your laundry will be a lot fresher.

1347
00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:33,350
I use it in the laundry.

1348
00:59:36,850 --> 00:59:37,730
Can you tell?

1349
00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:38,730
Yeah, of course.

1350
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:39,910
Open your mouth spot,

1351
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:41,170
shoot it in his mouth.

1352
00:59:42,550 --> 00:59:43,810
They don't have as much

1353
00:59:43,810 --> 00:59:45,350
intestinal flora and fauna

1354
00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:46,170
as we do,

1355
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:48,230
but you have to be careful

1356
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:49,870
with older dogs and older people.

1357
00:59:50,110 --> 00:59:51,410
It will act as a laxative.

1358
00:59:52,430 --> 00:59:54,530
A lot of people get excited with this.

1359
00:59:54,970 --> 00:59:56,070
Oh, I've never made anything good

1360
00:59:56,070 --> 00:59:56,830
for my health before.

1361
00:59:56,930 --> 00:59:57,850
They make a quart,

1362
00:59:57,910 --> 00:59:59,130
drink a big tall glass,

1363
01:00:07,650 --> 01:00:08,590
that's how you know

1364
01:00:08,590 --> 01:00:10,650
the body is reacting majorly to it.

1365
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:11,830
There's no silver content,

1366
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:14,230
but animals, plants,

1367
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:16,530
spoilage for food,

1368
01:00:16,610 --> 01:00:17,630
whether it's in the fridge,

1369
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:18,950
any part of the fridge,

1370
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:20,070
or out of the fridge,

1371
01:00:24,810 --> 01:00:26,750
feet, underarms,

1372
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:28,150
it works as well as a deodorant.

1373
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:30,370
A woman's box,

1374
01:00:30,590 --> 01:00:31,610
a man's butt,

1375
01:00:32,310 --> 01:00:35,530
anywhere, groin, feet, mouth,

1376
01:00:36,570 --> 01:00:37,030
anywhere.

1377
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:39,310
Anywhere you think

1378
01:00:39,310 --> 01:00:40,550
you might want to curb

1379
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:42,930
where things might take hold

1380
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:43,570
and fester,

1381
01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:46,230
it will impede that

1382
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:47,730
and abate it.

1383
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:48,530
Probably a good idea

1384
01:00:48,530 --> 01:00:49,570
behind the ears too,

1385
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:51,250
because that's another

1386
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:52,610
one of those interesting areas.

1387
01:00:53,090 --> 01:00:53,670
Ears, yeah,

1388
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:54,770
I wouldn't try to spray it

1389
01:00:54,770 --> 01:00:55,170
in the ear,

1390
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:56,290
I would put it on a swab.

1391
01:01:06,090 --> 01:01:06,610
Aphids,

1392
01:01:07,370 --> 01:01:08,290
things like that,

1393
01:01:08,490 --> 01:01:09,530
yeah, the aphids won't,

1394
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:12,090
but it's not something

1395
01:01:12,090 --> 01:01:13,110
like a strong chemical,

1396
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:14,050
it'll be a few days

1397
01:01:14,050 --> 01:01:14,750
and then they come back.

1398
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:17,010
I spray it in the laundry.

1399
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:21,850
Yeah, so wherever you want

1400
01:01:21,850 --> 01:01:23,470
to curb some kind of

1401
01:01:23,470 --> 01:01:25,010
an organic manifestation

1402
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:25,630
and induction

1403
01:01:26,170 --> 01:01:27,590
would be the application.

1404
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:31,090
And no one that I've ever

1405
01:01:31,090 --> 01:01:32,610
recommended this to

1406
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:36,350
but any nose,

1407
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:38,050
stomach stuff,

1408
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:39,010
skin stuff,

1409
01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:40,490
it mitigates that.

1410
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:44,870
And you'll know it's working

1411
01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:45,650
if you get excited

1412
01:01:45,650 --> 01:01:46,450
when you first make you

1413
01:01:46,450 --> 01:01:47,010
drink a glass,

1414
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:48,130
it'll be like a laxative.

1415
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:50,650
That's how you know it works.

1416
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:52,210
What do you mean it's working?

1417
01:01:52,290 --> 01:01:53,010
We had it tested,

1418
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:54,230
there's nothing but water,

1419
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:54,870
there's nothing else

1420
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:55,810
but just water and some

1421
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:05,930
antibiotics,

1422
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:07,250
not from a clinical sense,

1423
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:08,210
no, the clinical sense

1424
01:02:08,210 --> 01:02:09,570
are irrelevant in the real world.

1425
01:02:10,550 --> 01:02:11,410
Generally, yeah,

1426
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:12,830
look, if it works, it works.

1427
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:14,670
That's the thing,

1428
01:02:14,790 --> 01:02:16,110
when you hear about

1429
01:02:16,110 --> 01:02:16,730
well somebody says

1430
01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:18,030
well just put this in this

1431
01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:19,510
and do this and it goes

1432
01:02:19,510 --> 01:02:20,510
well it doesn't make any sense,

1433
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:21,590
how does that change anything?

1434
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:22,850
Well, you know what,

1435
01:02:22,870 --> 01:02:24,370
if it works, it works.

1436
01:02:35,770 --> 01:02:36,170
It doesn't have to be

1437
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:37,490
for all American.

1438
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:40,230
All American colloidal silver.

1439
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:42,090
What you're supposed to do

1440
01:02:42,090 --> 01:02:42,970
with it is take it

1441
01:02:42,970 --> 01:02:44,170
and put it in a vaporizer,

1442
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:45,590
and this is what I did

1443
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:47,650
and it kind of helped a little bit

1444
01:02:47,650 --> 01:02:50,450
but it also made me feel weird.

1445
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:52,670
And like I said,

1446
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:53,670
it tasted terrible.

1447
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:56,230
I don't know about you

1448
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:57,610
but I don't put coins in my mouth,

1449
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:58,950
I don't care how dirty they are

1450
01:02:58,950 --> 01:02:59,630
or clean they are,

1451
01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:06,830
materialist philosophy

1452
01:03:06,830 --> 01:03:08,350
is little is good, more is better

1453
01:03:08,350 --> 01:03:10,290
and a lot should do the trick, right?

1454
01:03:10,610 --> 01:03:11,750
It doesn't work that way.

1455
01:03:11,990 --> 01:03:13,490
That's also how drug addicts think too,

1456
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:14,270
but that's okay.

1457
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:16,750
Yeah, if you do over so much

1458
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:18,350
you wonder why it's not working anymore.

1459
01:03:20,210 --> 01:03:22,530
So this is my rant

1460
01:03:23,450 --> 01:03:24,890
and info supply,

1461
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:25,690
info drop,

1462
01:03:25,790 --> 01:03:27,270
whatever for this one.

1463
01:03:28,570 --> 01:03:29,530
And yeah,

1464
01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:31,350
aqueous argentum,

1465
01:03:31,530 --> 01:03:33,690
and spell it how you want.

1466
01:03:35,530 --> 01:03:36,310
It's important for other names

1467
01:03:36,310 --> 01:03:38,610
because there's no silver cholate in it

1468
01:03:38,610 --> 01:03:39,970
and it works like a charm.

1469
01:03:40,310 --> 01:03:41,650
Well, makes the most sense to me.
