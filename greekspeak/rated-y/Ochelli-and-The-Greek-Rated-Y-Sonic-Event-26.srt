1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:11,680
The Sonic Event 26, rated Y, Ocelli and the Greek.

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:17,000
So trying to break the pattern, put a few things out of order, and who knows what will

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,280
come of this one, because there is no script.

4
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,500
We might talk about things just a little bit ahead of time.

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,380
We just did that before I pressed record.

6
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:25,980
So here we are.

7
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:26,920
Greek, how are you doing tonight?

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,920
Yeah, I keep telling you, man.

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,120
Let's just hit record, because we don't want the best stuff to just go into the ether,

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:33,460
right?

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:34,960
You know, I'm in my 50s.

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,420
I can only go once, you know?

13
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,360
But anyway, so yeah, you were saying – go ahead.

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,020
You start, man.

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,880
You start talking about – you were saying something – you brought up something.

16
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:46,880
So bring it up again.

17
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,440
Well, okay.

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:47,720
All right.

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,380
Well, I didn't give you the whole thing because I wanted to record it and just get your reaction

20
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:51,900
and your thoughts.

21
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,900
Look, I had a strange thing go on this week at my house, right?

22
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,860
And I know you don't like personal stories, but it got me thinking about other things.

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,020
And here's what happened.

24
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,519
We had mice all of a sudden and kind of invaded the house.

25
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,980
And I was getting irritated because, you know, look, the mice, what do they do?

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,380
They poop.

27
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,200
They chew on stuff.

28
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,920
I mean, they cause problems.

29
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,200
Everybody talks about disease and whatnot with them.

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:12,980
I don't know.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,180
I don't have firsthand experience with that, but you don't want mice in the house, okay?

32
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,140
So what did I end up having to do?

33
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,720
This week I killed three mice by hand.

34
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:29,940
Well, by hand, by hammer, and by toolbox, because I encountered them.

35
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,220
And when they were out in the open, I just grabbed what I could and I smashed them.

36
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:37,000
I set traps before that, trying to get them and everything else.

37
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,660
Now, what is the point of this story?

38
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:47,480
Well, it got me thinking, actually, about the hierarchy of creatures on the planet.

39
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,340
Now, why?

40
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:54,040
Okay, look, I go back to the old biblical story as it was related to me, right?

41
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:59,240
And the garden, and here's the animals, why don't you name them, et cetera, et cetera.

42
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,060
And I think about all that, and now you're the steward of all the animals.

43
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,420
There's a lot of things going on here.

44
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,479
First of all, did the Adam see fish?

45
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,039
Did he see bugs?

46
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,400
Did we have to name all the bugs?

47
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:17,760
You know, look, there's a lot of living things here on this rock, whatever shape you think

48
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,100
it's in.

49
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,140
There's definitely a hierarchy.

50
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:27,320
We even talked about pets, right, and how dogs and cats are higher level animals than

51
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,080
maybe some others.

52
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,160
And we talked about the order of things about what you can eat and what you should eat,

53
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,180
what you should not eat, et cetera.

54
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,980
I don't know, it's just that we've always touched upon this, and I've never really asked

55
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:47,200
you about, well, look, I may remember talking about bugs a few times, and we talked about

56
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,500
different entities that might be in charge of them, et cetera, but we're all sharing

57
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,020
this planet, right?

58
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:54,820
So, yeah, go ahead.

59
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,140
Yeah.

60
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:55,740
All right.

61
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,800
Well, no, just real quick.

62
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,480
Do you need to rent a cat?

63
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:03,220
I used to do that back in the day, not here in the Southwest, but when people had a mouse

64
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:03,620
problem.

65
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,920
You know, you've heard of bodega cats, right?

66
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,080
So yeah, you need to rent a cat.

67
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,620
That's anybody listening, you're free to use that.

68
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,660
I don't know about the animal control people, the animal rights people, but yeah, rent a

69
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,800
cat will take care of that.

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,880
If you've got mice that are bold like that, it means they're breeding.

71
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:30,520
When I had, before I had cats, I have a big area outside where I plant things that I call

72
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,160
tree rings.

73
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,640
Everywhere there's a tree, I get these terracotta chimney pipes, and I put them all around and

74
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,300
fill them with soil.

75
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,260
I'd go out in the morning, and it was just like a Disney cartoon.

76
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,260
One mouse is on top of the terracotta pipe, you know, two feet off the ground.

77
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,600
He's telling a joke, and all the other mice are listening, and when he stops talking, they

78
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,280
all start laughing and rolling over, and then they see me, they're like, oh no.

79
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,320
A lot of the Disney stuff was based on people watching animals, you know?

80
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,340
Especially, you know, you've seen a dog run in place, right?

81
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,980
Because he has no traction, you know, you watch the cartoons, what does the dog do?

82
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,160
Run in place, right?

83
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:03,820
Yeah, I love that.

84
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,140
When they go doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, and they start slipping, you know, that's a funny

85
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:07,380
thing.

86
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,060
Or a spike, yeah.

87
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:08,840
I don't have cats.

88
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,320
So you watch Disney?

89
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,840
Yeah, so I don't have cats.

90
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,200
I do have some little dogs, and the little dogs are not good mousers.

91
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:20,019
There's a couple of stray cats wandering around outside my house now a little more often.

92
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,160
Seems as though I'm being invaded from somewhere, so I don't know if they're breeding, or if

93
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,040
I'm just, you know, suffering a general invasion.

94
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,020
My little dogs are only good for, well, the oldest one anyway, is good for finding them.

95
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,660
A few times where she gets obsessed about an area or something, and I discover that, okay,

96
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,460
there was a mouse there.

97
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,120
That's why she was obsessed with the area.

98
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,720
But she doesn't catch them.

99
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:48,020
The pups who are less than a year old, they don't catch them, but I have a couple times.

100
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:53,460
Okay, I don't know if you remember, I don't know if it was with you or others, I brought

101
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,080
up something, and only two people, which I consider very deep thinkers, brought it up

102
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,560
again, and I've never brought it up.

103
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,720
No one else has brought it up, but animals have been coming up a lot lately, and I said,

104
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:09,140
you ever notice, I think I was doing the Solosonics on AFR, humans, a man, has a vertical

105
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:09,580
spine.

106
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:14,140
Animals have a horizontal spine, meaning their spine is parallel to the Earth, ours is perpendicular.

107
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,060
Why is that?

108
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:16,320
Right?

109
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:21,220
And I never really got into it, and the reason is, I could get into, it's a long explanation.

110
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,100
I've tried to make it short.

111
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,780
The shortest I can say is because we perceive things differently.

112
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:37,260
The way we, spatial perception and sound and sight is ether, so the way ether flows, we're

113
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,020
very dependent.

114
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,620
The way we see things, like when we are approaching, let's say we see a wall with a hole in it,

115
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,760
let's say in nature that would be a mountain with a cave opening.

116
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,200
As we walk closer to it, we're perceiving it as, look, we're walking closer, that's

117
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,460
why the opening is getting bigger, right?

118
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,440
Perspective.

119
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,280
As we get closer, it gets bigger.

120
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,960
As you walk further away, it gets smaller.

121
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,840
Animals don't perceive it that way.

122
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:11,520
As I'm walking this way, I'm not really moving, the Earth is moving around me.

123
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,960
My whole life, I'm stationary.

124
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:19,140
So look, the Earth is moving, the mountain is moving towards me, and the hole is moving

125
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,300
towards me, getting bigger.

126
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,260
You see the difference?

127
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,500
It's kind of like on a treadmill.

128
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,760
They spend their whole life thinking that they're stationary, and everything around

129
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,360
them is moving.

130
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,920
Yeah, perspective-wise, it's almost like one of those video games where you've got

131
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,680
a person walking, stays in the center of the screen, but the rest of the world moves around

132
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,000
them.

133
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:36,720
Exactly.

134
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,760
It's more like a video game for them.

135
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,160
Very good.

136
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,060
That's a good analogy.

137
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,900
So their life is more like...

138
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,080
And then we go to the plants, which is dream world, right?

139
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,500
If you're in a dream and your arm gets cut off, eh, fuck it, I'm dreaming, right?

140
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,720
Yeah, it's just a dream, yeah, sure.

141
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,200
Yeah.

142
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:54,020
When you go and cut a branch off a tree, eh, what the fuck, what's going on here?

143
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:54,900
I'm just dreaming.

144
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:01,060
Hey, by the way, these things called natural hallucinogenics, they modify them from plants

145
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:01,400
anyway.

146
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,340
Where do they come from?

147
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,100
Plants.

148
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:04,740
Guess what?

149
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:05,960
Because, right?

150
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:06,420
Right.

151
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,540
They're always hallucinating.

152
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,000
It's just the ones that transfer over to humans.

153
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:11,520
Yeah.

154
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,980
So I wanted to bring up a couple of points, and the chat usually we bring up.

155
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:16,680
Oh, yeah.

156
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:27,300
But we always, lately, the hot topic has been the magnetic water, and yes, that's good.

157
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:34,620
And I've been very active in the chat about it, because if you're excited about it, you

158
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,420
should be, because I keep saying, I keep giving hints.

159
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:44,160
If you're an enterprising individual, whatever that means, wink, wink, you know what this

160
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,720
is, right?

161
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,640
Okay.

162
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:50,800
This is like saying, hey guys, there's this stuff that just came out, Bitcoin, and it's

163
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,700
25 cents.

164
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,200
Are you an enterprising individual?

165
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:54,720
Get it?

166
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,520
I'm not going to say buy it.

167
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,260
You know what I mean, right?

168
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,040
Yeah.

169
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,320
No, look, there's some way to get involved in this, in a way, before the whole world

170
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,000
knows about it.

171
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,380
Do it.

172
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:04,620
Yeah.

173
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,960
So I don't want it to come off right.

174
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:11,140
I really wish, I mean, look, I remember when people were trying to sell me whole Bitcoins

175
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:15,800
literally for $80, and I said, I can't, I couldn't see.

176
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,260
It was 25 cents three years ago.

177
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:17,500
Yeah.

178
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,860
Well, it made no sense to me, because it's like, well, I'd rather have a silver coin,

179
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,520
because I know that.

180
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,540
I've had it in my hand before.

181
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,280
I'm familiar with it, and that wasn't me being enterprising about that.

182
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,560
I didn't think about it the right way.

183
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,600
Right, but this is like that, because, okay, and we're not going to talk about this anymore,

184
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,720
but let me just say this thing.

185
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:38,100
What I've been working on now, and I'm going to share also, most likely in a solo, is the

186
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:43,900
technical aspects of it, and it's so simple that anyone can easily reduce what's in the

187
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,940
water by 30% to 40%, no exaggeration, right?

188
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:53,120
But one thing I'm just going to say, I saw someone in the chat using an RO, and RO requires

189
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,420
a lot of pressure, a lot of time.

190
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,420
I have done, doing, and will do more tests, but if you have a pump, let's say that's running,

191
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,220
and before the water goes into the pump is treated, you're going to use 10% to 30% less

192
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,180
electricity to move the water, right?

193
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:16,100
So if you talk to anyone who has a large commercial business that requires RO water, car wash,

194
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:22,420
soda bottling plant, whatever, whatever, you ask them about their electric bill, they kind

195
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,920
of joke and hem and haw, because they don't want to tell you how much.

196
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,620
It's embarrassing.

197
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,400
You know what I mean?

198
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,320
It's so high, right?

199
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:27,640
Right.

200
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,820
And that's because of the reverse osmosis pumps.

201
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:39,680
Well, what if I said you could shave that by 25%, would you be interested in your electric

202
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:39,940
bill?

203
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,760
That's a lot.

204
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,220
That's a salary.

205
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:48,640
Then you have bigger projects, and so on and so forth.

206
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,200
So that's all I'm going to say about that, but what I'm working on is I know for sure

207
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,820
20 years ago would get you killed.

208
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:00,200
A device that you run dirty water through, and there's no guts to it.

209
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,740
The device, in other words, take the device out of the system and just hold it.

210
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,820
You can look right through it.

211
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,360
There's no guts.

212
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,480
There's nothing in there, right?

213
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,540
It's just straight through.

214
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,120
Yeah.

215
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,160
So it's not a machine.

216
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,780
It's not a filter.

217
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:12,640
It's just a pipe.

218
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,200
Yeah.

219
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,780
Well, let's say it's a box, but you can see right through it, right?

220
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,680
This is like a magic trick almost.

221
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,180
You put dirty water on one side and clean water comes out the other, and that's it.

222
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,100
Story is done.

223
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,980
I think we talked about this already, right?

224
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:26,960
Case closed.

225
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,140
I've been working on that.

226
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:36,180
I ran some turbid water through, and it went from 590 parts per million to 340, and it

227
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:40,000
did get a little clearer, and this was just putting stuff together with hot melt, right?

228
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,140
So yeah, now I heard we've discussed this or whatever.

229
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,500
I think we brought it up the last time.

230
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,320
I think that if you did the 100-mile-per-gallon carburetor, there's no carburetors in cars

231
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,740
anymore, or this device or free energy or whatever, I don't think they kill you anymore,

232
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,100
do they?

233
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:04,840
I haven't heard about that in a while, to be honest with you, so yeah.

234
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:09,740
I don't think the suppression is that much because they're going after food and water

235
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,540
and energy, right?

236
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,440
Okay, so that's all I'm going to say about that.

237
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,720
The other thing I was – there's more on that, people.

238
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,980
There's more on that, and it will be shared, and whoever's listening now will know how

239
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,620
to get it in the near future when I talk about it some more.

240
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,120
The thing is, by the way, it's all open-sourced.

241
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:35,460
Once these devices come out or I have success and it's reproducible, if you want to know

242
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,080
how to make it, I'll tell you how to make it.

243
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:37,780
It's no big deal.

244
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:47,800
Someone posted – Harry, I think it was Vandy posted Harry, who's a guy that called me

245
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,240
for a while about weather devices.

246
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,780
He's very active on YouTube, and he says he wants to tell the whole world about it.

247
00:11:54,840 --> 00:12:02,460
I said, well, I can't really talk about how to do the newer stuff because Trevor was

248
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:02,860
still alive.

249
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,440
I didn't say that.

250
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,720
I just – I know how to make stuff that – whatever.

251
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,740
When Trevor passed away – Harry, you got in touch with me again a few months later.

252
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,540
I said, well, Trevor passed, so guess what?

253
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,440
Get yourself some silk.

254
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:20,000
Get some double mirrors and do this, and he's been very, very, very public.

255
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,280
I was very, very happy that someone asked him, so you got this from someone who worked

256
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:24,640
with Trevor?

257
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,800
He says, yes, someone worked with Trevor.

258
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,480
I said, who is it?

259
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:32,160
But he doesn't want his name known because I said, look, you plan on going public.

260
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,920
His whole thing is to be on CNN, right?

261
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,720
I don't want him to say, you learned it from me, because what does that do?

262
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,960
That makes me an accomplice, right?

263
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,480
Well, somebody got his YouTube video.

264
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:46,980
Yeah.

265
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:52,320
So I don't – this is – I never wanted – like if CNN – I know one of the people

266
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,100
here in Arizona.

267
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:58,360
You remember the Iran-Contra affair, the main thing?

268
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:04,700
The Army Air Force always sells old planes, okay?

269
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,760
And they put in the clause that once you buy the old plane, it's salvaged.

270
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,720
You can't resell it.

271
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,460
It has to be torn apart, right?

272
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:15,700
Well, in this particular contract for Iran-Contra, they left that part out so he could resell

273
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,800
the plane, right?

274
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,000
I know – his first name is David.

275
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:19,900
He lives here in Tucson.

276
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,940
I've known him for a long time.

277
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,020
I haven't seen him in a while, but – and when the Iran-Contra thing went down, they

278
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,720
exposed enough that they found where they got the planes from.

279
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:36,560
So he lives here in Tucson, and they – this is in the probably early 90s, late 80s when

280
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,860
the thing went down with the Oliver North stuff, right?

281
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,680
Late 80s, yeah.

282
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:40,900
Late 80s.

283
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,780
Well, they knocked on his door early in the morning, and he opens the door, and he sees

284
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,440
all these spotlights on him, and he's like, what the hell, you know?

285
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,800
I'm not being arrested.

286
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,600
This is the news.

287
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,220
This is nothing.

288
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,020
So he kept talking to the news, right?

289
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,480
You don't want to do that, right?

290
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,180
You don't want to talk to the news people.

291
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,720
And I learned that from there.

292
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,920
Everybody was like, yeah, you don't talk to the news if they come to your house, right?

293
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,200
Never.

294
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,340
Never talk to the news.

295
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,320
It's usually not a good thing if they find you and they come knocking on your door, yeah.

296
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,840
Yeah, because they can edit it and make it say like you said anything, right?

297
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,060
It's how they piece it together.

298
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,160
And they did that famously to Jim Garrison, too, by the way, which was a really funny

299
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:17,460
thing.

300
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,300
You know, JFK stuff, of course.

301
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,300
I was just thinking about it because I was working on something this week, but they did

302
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,140
that to him where he had an interview with an interview guy who was like totally friendly

303
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:27,500
to him.

304
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,440
He got out a bunch of stuff, this and that, and then they turned around, re-edited it

305
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,820
and made him sound like a lunatic.

306
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:33,940
Right, right.

307
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,400
Exactly.

308
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,200
Yeah.

309
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,700
Because plausibly, you know, we're putting this on front, you know.

310
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,780
So when you hear about this guy again, you can see, obviously, he's a nutcase.

311
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,640
That's what they do.

312
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,120
Yeah.

313
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,140
So, yeah.

314
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,240
So when Harry told me he wants to bring this to the world in every way he can, I'm like,

315
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,680
oh, no, you just leave me out of it then.

316
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,140
Yeah, that's up to you, but leave you out of it.

317
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:54,440
Yeah.

318
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,920
Yeah, he did, which was good.

319
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:56,440
Fair enough.

320
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,420
And I'm just saying this because it's funny because he's, it's nice to see people, well,

321
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:07,420
let's just say when you do something and someone gets really, really, really excited and makes

322
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,140
it sort of a lifelong thing, it's kind of good.

323
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,360
You feel kind of, you know, hey, good, you know, where would this guy be if he didn't

324
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,340
have this, right?

325
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,120
Right.

326
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:14,680
It'd be boring, right?

327
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,200
At least he's getting some excitement.

328
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:21,120
I got a couple of guys started with, like, podcasting, believe it or not, that had no

329
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,940
design on doing it and then decided they wanted to and came to me, asked me how to do stuff,

330
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:25,420
this and that.

331
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,900
And the third thing, and it's kind of fascinating to look in on them a couple of years later

332
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:32,880
and it's like, that's their, their whole thing now and they're, you know, completely into

333
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:32,980
it.

334
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,680
That's what they do.

335
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,200
You know?

336
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,100
Yeah.

337
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,840
The only thing about Harry is, is my advice to people, if you get into the weather work,

338
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,020
just make bad weather.

339
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,320
Forget about sunshine.

340
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,000
I mean, yeah, look, whatever.

341
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:49,140
Make bad weather, help out the Aggies, help out the farmers, you know, but other than that,

342
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:52,000
make bad weather, you know, because that's what people want.

343
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,900
They want disasters.

344
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,860
Speaking of disasters, what I was also saying earlier, this changes, let's get into it a

345
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,260
little bit.

346
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:06,140
You go down to a Jewish community in Florida and there's a restaurant, I know there's at

347
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,980
least one now left, it's called number 26.

348
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,300
This is episode 26, right?

349
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:11,740
Yeah.

350
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:12,600
Yeah.

351
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,800
Masonic 26.

352
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:20,260
And if you ask them why do you call it 26, because they say it's the name of God, right?

353
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,040
That's what they say usually, or, right?

354
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,340
Because the numerology, the mantra on Yahweh is 26.

355
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,220
I just wanted to bring that up as trivia.

356
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:35,320
The Asians do 88 a lot, like Pho 88, you know, Pho 88, this is the Vietnamese soup, or Chinese,

357
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,260
they like the number eight.

358
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,420
But anyway.

359
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:42,260
Which is odd, too, because, you know, 88 for a while, at least early internet, as I understood

360
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:48,180
it, was supposed to represent Adolf Hitler in some way, and I forget why, but there was

361
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,280
some reason for it.

362
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,420
You know what I'm talking about?

363
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,540
Talk about getting the shit end of the stick in history.

364
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,160
Yikes.

365
00:16:53,960 --> 00:17:00,120
But, I mean, just saying, yeah, well, ask Gaddafi about that, but, you know, I'm done.

366
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:07,359
I'm just saying, it's like, it's very weird when people attach things to numbers, because

367
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:12,400
on the one hand, it's a valid thing, numerology, and on the other hand, I don't know, sometimes

368
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:18,020
I just, I listen to people run around in circles with it, and I go, you have tortured yourself

369
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,260
with these numbers, you know?

370
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,920
Yeah, well, don't overdo it.

371
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,680
Just like with words, you know, they say, like, history is his story, television is

372
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:29,460
telling lies on your vision, and the son of God is the sun in the sky, right, only works

373
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,860
in English, you know, you hear this all the time, the George Maxwell, Jordan Maxwell's

374
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:37,260
and, oh wow, sorry about that, and the Bonacci's or whatever, they try to play these things

375
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,300
on people that don't know.

376
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,060
Look, if you're going to try to play people that are ignorant, you're going to have a

377
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,480
lot of followers, you know why?

378
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,140
Because, anyway, I don't want to get into it, right?

379
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:54,120
Stuck on stupid, so, anyway, where was I with this, the play on words?

380
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,780
I put in the chat, I was in a response, if you're good at math, you're going to be good

381
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:02,240
at language, because they're both forms of communication.

382
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,160
Math is just communication.

383
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,960
Now, there's a lot of people, I think I went over the psychological aspects, when you say

384
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,920
you're not good at math, it's simply because when you were young, you heard someone that

385
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:16,940
was sort of respected for saying that, so you said, oh, I could be lazy, right, I don't

386
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,380
have to learn math, and I could just go around in life and say I'm not good at math, and

387
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,020
everybody pats me on the back, that's okay, right, you see how it works?

388
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:26,380
You can learn good and bad things by example, right, because, I mean, look, the example

389
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:30,680
given there is that somebody gets themselves out of having to do some sort of little bit

390
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:36,040
of work, or having to think their way through something, which is a form of communication,

391
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:41,500
don't think of it as math, is the point, right, so you're cutting yourself off from a form

392
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,660
of communication, right?

393
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:43,420
True.

394
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,220
That's all it is, people say, oh, I need to do the math on that, I said, why, you just

395
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:51,220
told me about it, and they're like, huh, I said, well, math is just another form of communication,

396
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:55,880
you ever hear that a lot, oh, this is how this works, but I haven't done the math on it,

397
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:00,660
yes, you did, you just told me, that's why I like the five percenters, you know, in New

398
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:06,260
York, you know, word is bond and all that, because they say, that doesn't add up, right,

399
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:10,620
whenever something, instead of saying, that's untrue, or that's whatever they say, it doesn't

400
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:16,780
add up, do the math, they're correct about that aspect of it, you know, so math is just

401
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:21,220
another language, and it's a universal language, Jack Fresco mentioned this before, like, if

402
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:26,600
you talk about sodium as an element, why do you have to call it different things in

403
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,180
different languages, just give it a number or a symbol that represents sodium, and everyone

404
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:39,940
will see it as being sodium, right, that's what numbers do, and yeah, so you learn a

405
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:47,040
lot about people by them telling you, that's why I say, listen, be a good listener, they're

406
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:53,720
telling you what shortcomings they've decided to adapt, you know what I mean, I'm not good

407
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:58,360
at math, all right, that means that you just, right, get it, so, doesn't mean you have

408
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:04,320
to be good at math, but typically, whoa, that sounds like a cherry bomb, you know, it's

409
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:13,360
a straight pipe, yeah, so, I'm near the street right now, actually, so, but the whole thing

410
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:19,720
with math is, it's not universal enough, but the idea is there, and a universal language,

411
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:23,600
there are people trying to do universal languages like Esperanto, I don't know if you remember

412
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:29,900
that, it started in the 50s, Interlingue is another one, it's a mixture of Latin, Spanish,

413
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:34,620
the whole world's gonna speak one tongue, it didn't really work for them, the UN wrote

414
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:40,200
a thing about it, anyway, math is not as good as that, you know, how do you say I love you

415
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:47,380
with numbers, right, you see, it's not very, quote, unquote, romantic, but the reason I

416
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:53,140
brought all that up is because it's number 26, and I wanna talk a little bit about the

417
00:20:53,140 --> 00:21:01,080
spiritual side of stuff, you know, but in a technical way, should we say, where you

418
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:06,040
can actually use it, if that makes any sense, you know, because people, you know, say, oh,

419
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,780
this guy's really spiritual, I said, spiritual just means non-physical, is it good or bad

420
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:15,400
spiritual, right, they're like, well, it's spiritual, of course it's good, right, you

421
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,020
know, I never understood that at all, either, where it's like, oh, they're very spiritual,

422
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:23,940
it's like, well, what does that mean, exactly, that doesn't, well, yeah, spiritual just means

423
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:27,560
non-physical, so are they in the dark or are they light, and by the way, there's no problem

424
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:34,000
with the dark or the light, you have to have them in balance, right, in this structure

425
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
and construct that we have, you know, like I keep saying, the Star Wars, the whole thing

426
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,660
about Star Wars is not the Jedi defeating the self, no, no, no, no, it's putting it

427
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:49,880
back in balance, because the Jedi got caught out there with being eliminated, and now the

428
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:55,280
self are over overcoming, right, and it's just to put them in balance, it's not that

429
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,800
either one, one tried to get rid of the other created an imbalance, even here, it's an imbalance

430
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:08,020
in the force, you know, so having the balance both ways, you know, like I said, some of

431
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:15,340
the best quote-unquote religious or God-type conversations I've ever had are with atheists

432
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:22,500
and Satanists, right, because one is abstracted from the whole thing, and the other one is

433
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:29,620
anti, right, and I'm showing them that, you know, he's just a revolutionary, you know,

434
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,020
this Satan, that's, right, the adversary, he's a revolutionary, he's not this thing that

435
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,220
Hollywood shows you, right?

436
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,240
Well that's when you get into that type of Satanist, and then there's the other types

437
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:44,120
who effectively have decided that they are God, they are their own God.

438
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:51,100
Oh, yeah, yeah, well they are, actually, this is his world, by the way, and the thing is

439
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:55,140
calling it a construct or a simulation, I don't like doing that unless you really, really

440
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,700
see what's going on, and then you'll see that it is, right?

441
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,360
Well, see, now, that's strange too, because to call something a simulation, it means that

442
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,160
it would be mimicking something else that is known.

443
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:07,700
Right.

444
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,540
So what is the simulation mimicking?

445
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:15,620
There is the open question I have for anybody who brings up the simulation theory.

446
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,120
Yeah, go ahead, I'm sorry, yeah.

447
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,840
But it is a simulation because it's a physical counterpart of something that's non-physical,

448
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:22,320
right?

449
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,860
Well, okay, that's fine, but still...

450
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,000
That's where it's a simulation.

451
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:31,040
Okay, but isn't that a serious missing aspect of that when somebody says, oh, this is all

452
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,600
a simulation?

453
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,580
I go, yeah, but a simulation of what?

454
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:39,400
Because anything that is a simulation has to represent something else, right?

455
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:39,760
Yes.

456
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,440
So what is the else, you see?

457
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:47,960
Have you seen or heard, back in the 50s, it was more popular in the 60s or 70s, when Westerners

458
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:54,080
with tech in the 60s that went to indigenous peoples and they didn't want to be videotaped

459
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,980
because they believed that it captured their...

460
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,340
It would steal their soul, and yeah, right.

461
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,560
Yeah, yeah, right, right.

462
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:04,200
So when you saw a videotape of yourself, doesn't it look, for a moment, aren't you captivated

463
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,340
and that's me, right?

464
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:09,840
Then there's a part of you that says, oh, this is technology, right?

465
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:17,100
That's literally a simulation of yourself watching a movie, and the better, the more

466
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,280
it's done, the more, right?

467
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,400
If the movie's not good, people...

468
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:20,860
If you start...

469
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,700
You know how you find out if people are enjoying the movie, you start making a distraction.

470
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:28,220
If no one tells you to shut up and sit down, the movie sucks, right?

471
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,860
So anyway, it's actually good etiquette.

472
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,380
So to not do that in a movie theater, I don't know if anyone...

473
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,580
I can't go to the movies, by the way, because the sound and the picture that I have here

474
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:44,120
is way better than any movie theater I've been to, even the IMAX, believe it or not.

475
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:53,620
So the simulation, just like the indigenous, let's say, non-technological people do not

476
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,540
want their...

477
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,120
They don't want to be videotaped.

478
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,720
Really it was photographs, especially a land camera, a Polaroid or whatever.

479
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,840
Why did their mind go to that point, so extreme, right?

480
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,860
They don't want to be copied, they don't want to be captured, right?

481
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,580
It's called a capture anyway, when you do a screen capture on the computer.

482
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,720
Right, right.

483
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:23,580
So you have the real thing, which is existing in one domain, and then you have the capture,

484
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,860
which is in another domain.

485
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,740
We are in the physical capture domain, okay?

486
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:33,760
So that's where the simulation tests out, you see?

487
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,480
Yeah, but I'm still failing to recognize where the original is.

488
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:47,020
Oh, if you have a concept of what they call time and space, which neither one has any

489
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:47,700
attributes, right?

490
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:52,080
Space has no attributes, that's why it's called space, and time is just the recordation of

491
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,920
events, so it doesn't exist really, unless you make it.

492
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,360
It's a record.

493
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:05,020
That's where it exists, and the way you see that is from life and death.

494
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:08,340
I keep saying, don't worry about doing anything here.

495
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,260
It's all pre-scripted, right?

496
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,320
People say they want to be successful.

497
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,740
The presidents are pre-scripted.

498
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,640
You know, in America, you grow up and be president, right?

499
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:23,740
Or these Jeff Bozo and Elon Musk or whatever, those guys were put in those Bill Gates before

500
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:27,380
they were born, or those things were structured for them, and they fit it.

501
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,900
They had no choice in the matter, to a certain degree.

502
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:36,400
The only choice they had was dancing between the raindrops at some points, you know?

503
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:41,240
Wherever you are is where you are, and you have a certain thing, like being on the cruise

504
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:41,440
ship.

505
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:46,040
It's all predestined, but while you're on the cruise ship, you can go into your cabin,

506
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:49,260
you can go up to the deck, you can go to the movie, you know, but a cruise ship is like

507
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,120
a small city, right?

508
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,060
You've got a little choice.

509
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:54,440
That's the freedom, but everyone's going to a certain place, but if you're in uniform,

510
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,840
you don't have that kind of, quote unquote, liberty, no pun intended, because liberty

511
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:03,400
is a naval term, so you don't have those freedoms, right?

512
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:08,760
So the people that people see that are successful and noteworthy are in uniformed in some way

513
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,440
to be there, and they have no choice.

514
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:17,980
So I've also said and imparted that it takes 50 to 100 years to master something, a skill.

515
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:25,300
You don't have that much time to grow up formative years, adolescent, start a skill, and 100

516
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,420
years later start producing what that skill is.

517
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,320
It means you have to live to several hundred years, right?

518
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:38,400
So imagine you're walking at a flea market or an open air market, and you're negotiating

519
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:44,740
a rug, you know, and the guy says, it's this much, and you're like, oh, I want to give

520
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,220
you that much, and he says, come on, I've been making this for 50 years.

521
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:48,640
Imagine that?

522
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,580
We don't have that now, right?

523
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:59,600
So this is out of our concept, so that's what I mean about these concepts of once you start

524
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,020
going outside, where is it, what is it?

525
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:05,580
We can only relate to it based on what we know.

526
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,200
That's why I use that long metaphor.

527
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:12,760
It takes 50 years, and things are scripted, so where is the other one?

528
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,960
The other one is not limited by things like that.

529
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,800
It is more open.

530
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,900
Look, you don't like this place, go to another world.

531
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:25,440
In other words, you hear people, I don't like this country, I don't like this neighborhood,

532
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:29,320
I've got to go somewhere else, but it's difficult, I can't afford it.

533
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,620
Or whatever, whatever, political situations.

534
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,580
In the other world, you don't have that.

535
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:38,680
You want to go somewhere else, you're there, and it could be anywhere.

536
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:47,220
I wanted to give several examples, and you started off with your personal thing with the

537
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,160
mice and whatnot, right?

538
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:53,380
I'm going to give a personal example, because also, it's going to be interesting, hopefully,

539
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,680
and let me just recap.

540
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:00,180
We had a whole thing that, remember the call-ins in Ocelli in the Greek?

541
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:00,900
Oh, yeah.

542
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:06,340
I was like, if you call in, we don't want to hear personal stories unless it has an attribute

543
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:09,440
that we could get something out of it that everyone can use, right?

544
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:13,900
I think we're the only ones that ever said that.

545
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:18,520
I don't want to hear what you think about your opinion or your personal stuff.

546
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,380
Give us something that everyone can use.

547
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,120
Make it useful.

548
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:23,580
Right.

549
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,140
Make it useful.

550
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,460
It's got to be applied to everyone.

551
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:32,140
The only way I could, let's say, move this forward is by giving a useful story.

552
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:40,620
Years ago, this is like 15 years ago, man, when you tell someone 2003 on the Pope's work

553
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,460
schedule doesn't seem like a long time ago, you know how you get, you're old, right?

554
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,040
You tell this to a 20-year-old, they don't...

555
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,400
20 years ago is almost their whole life.

556
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,120
I mean, what are you going to do?

557
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,580
Yeah, right.

558
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,000
Exactly.

559
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,140
So for me, 2003, I could tell you 2003, 2000, or 5, 6, 7, seems like a couple of years ago.

560
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:06,140
So some guys that I knew, enterprising young men, they said, you know, someone got a property

561
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:11,340
in Safford, which is like 100 miles out of Tucson, and they got some people, they got

562
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,720
to dig a well.

563
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:17,540
Safford, by the way, Arizona, the grass doesn't grow more than a half inch tall because that's

564
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,120
how windy it is, right?

565
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:26,000
And they want to dig a well, but we know that you can use those dowsing rods and find water

566
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,420
in the ground.

567
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,160
So let's go out there.

568
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:27,780
I'm like, all right.

569
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:34,280
So we go out there, and I walk around the property, it's like basically a mesa, and I'm walking

570
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:37,740
around for half an hour or so, and I said, give me a piece of paper, I'm going to mark

571
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,360
where I'm at.

572
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:43,800
And a couple of times I went back to the same spot, and I called the guy over, and I said,

573
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:46,740
this is where you're going to dig, it's going to be around 3,000 feet.

574
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:52,100
And he makes this really strange looking face, like he's almost upset or mad at me.

575
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,740
He says, hold on a second.

576
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:59,720
And he backs his pickup truck, drops the bed, opens the box, takes out this roll of paper

577
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:04,580
or whatever that he got from the welding company, and he says, give me that sheet you got.

578
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,440
I'm like, okay.

579
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,600
You know, where I drew the thing, and he says, this is the property, pretty close.

580
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,680
He puts it over, he says, this is where they told me to dig.

581
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:14,920
This is where the well's going to go, exactly right here is where they figured out with

582
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,340
their radar and all that stuff.

583
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:19,080
Because he was skeptical, right?

584
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,860
So I was like, okay, cool.

585
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,860
So my office says, no, you're right on.

586
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:28,480
I'm like, okay, all right, well, why the attitude, right?

587
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,420
Why the tood, right?

588
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,980
I remember that very strongly, this was a long time ago too, let's say.

589
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:38,640
So we're driving back to Tucson, and they pull over into this, between Safford and Tucson

590
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:44,980
into this place, little street, you know, one store, one light, what are you doing here?

591
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:48,740
He says, oh, they have good Mexican food here at the gas station kind of thing, right?

592
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,200
And I'm like, but this is, I said, I'm not hungry.

593
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:54,580
He said, well, we really didn't come here for this, we came here for this.

594
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,840
So they call someone up, and he meets us there, and he says, is this the guy?

595
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,280
And I'm like, well, are you guys going to let me in on this?

596
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,060
What do you mean, is this the guy?

597
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:07,580
So we drive about 10, 15 minutes in north-south direction.

598
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:12,120
They take me to this abandoned house, and they said, this house here, everybody says

599
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:12,680
it's haunted.

600
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:19,780
A little girl died in a fire, or the family, it was a fire or something, or whatever, and

601
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:24,540
the little girl died years ago.

602
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:28,840
You could see it was scorched and some other things broken, partially broken down.

603
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:32,280
People that are in the neighborhood hear the little girl screaming, and they see the little

604
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,840
girl on the top floor sometimes, right?

605
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,780
So go ahead and do your thing.

606
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:39,600
I'm like, oh, what do you mean?

607
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,420
Because I'm talking about how these spirits don't work the ways.

608
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,280
Yeah, go ahead and do it.

609
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,060
I said, I can't do it.

610
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:44,340
What do you mean?

611
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:45,860
No preface?

612
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:46,220
Nothing?

613
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,820
You just drive, give me like five, not even two-minute introduction?

614
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,880
Drag me in here, and here's a beat-up house, somebody died here, do your thing.

615
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:56,000
Yeah, and they drive away, I said, all right, give me some time.

616
00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:03,200
Right away, without even thinking, I said, okay, this is nothing special, let's see if

617
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,960
I could walk the talk and talk the walk, right?

618
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:13,760
So, I faced the house, and I basically, I'm going to preface here, paraphrase, basically

619
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,320
talking to the house, and I'm saying, why are you taking advantage of these ignorant

620
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,060
people that think it's a young girl?

621
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,700
Why are you doing this imagery and this show?

622
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,720
Go somewhere else and do a show, don't do a show here.

623
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:32,220
See, because the little girl is dead, she's done, it's just, you know, right?

624
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:38,480
So, a spirit, quote-unquote, one of these intangibles, that deals with humans, this

625
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,360
is the type of spirit which I'll get into, that also brings dreams and thoughts and inner

626
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:48,380
voices, a different part of the group, but one of them, decides to play a joke on humans,

627
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:49,520
right?

628
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,560
Like they all meet at a bar, and they say, oh yeah, I'm going to go haunt this house,

629
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:56,220
and watch, and everyone's going to think it's this person that died, and they all high-five

630
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:00,140
them, and one guy says, oh, I'll bet you they're not going to believe it, and how much are you

631
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:00,660
going to bet me?

632
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:04,540
I'll bet you like a beer, you know, and they leave the bar, you know, the spirits, right?

633
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,640
And the guy's playing the thing.

634
00:34:07,239 --> 00:34:11,100
So anyway, I'm basically saying, these people are ignorant, you're taking advantage of them,

635
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,800
and you know it, stop taking advantage of the people.

636
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:20,900
Okay, so basically, that was my exorcism and my unhaunting, and it worked, from what I

637
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:24,780
found out, and I kept, I was like, I need feedback, I need feedback, I need feedback,

638
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:28,760
and I need feedback for a couple of years later, yeah, there's nothing been seen, and

639
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,580
it was frequent, you know?

640
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:36,020
So what I just said was very simple, and it seemed very uneventful, it wouldn't make

641
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:40,360
a good ghostbuster, what is it, house haunters, or whatever, TV show, where it would, yeah,

642
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:44,040
they got a few, they got a few of those, the ghost hunters, and the, yeah, yeah, that

643
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:50,600
would be very uneventful, right, it wouldn't be, yeah, you know, now, right, so, but here's

644
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:54,179
the other thing, for me, it didn't look like anything was going on, but for the people

645
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:57,180
that were, I needed to be left alone, they were saying there was some interesting stuff

646
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:00,180
going on while I was talking to the house, interesting like what?

647
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,160
Well, it looked like the house shook a little bit, they heard a noise, this and that, right?

648
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:10,620
I didn't hear anything, but what I just went through, you notice, I just paraphrased, but

649
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:16,520
it was like, eh, meh, doesn't sound like much, that's an unhaunting, or an exorcism, quote

650
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:21,820
unquote, thing, very uneventful, doesn't make for good TV at all, but it works, because

651
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:25,080
you, if you, what are the, what did you call them, ghost hunters, whatever?

652
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,940
That's one of the big ones, yeah.

653
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:30,600
Yeah, oh, what do they do, if you call them, what are they going to do?

654
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,360
They're going to address the little girl.

655
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,960
Yeah, they go in at night, and, okay, we're going to find this spirit, they show you a

656
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,980
picture, and they go, okay, this person died here, so we're going to find, if it was the

657
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,580
little girl, yeah.

658
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,160
Yeah, so they're going after the person who died, which is a waste of time.

659
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:48,920
Right, no, absolutely true, you and I talked about this many years ago, actually, like

660
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:55,060
during the first run, I think, of O and J, and yeah, exactly, this is, you're

661
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:59,360
exactly right, this is the way it actually works, all that crap they put on TV is a bunch

662
00:35:59,360 --> 00:35:59,700
of, yeah.

663
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:04,480
Here's the thing, yeah, but no one knows it, because the TV is messing them up, you

664
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:10,040
know, you know how I've talked about, as seen on TV, people, when you talk about, you

665
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:14,840
know, you listen to people, it's like 99% of what they, well, most of what they say

666
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,840
is they got from watching the tube.

667
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:21,720
Oh, yeah, I mean, and there's a whole thing now on the Travel Channel, by the way, which

668
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:26,180
is hugely popular, and I don't remember the name of it, but several people have been

669
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:29,960
like, you got to see this, because this is amazing, and the one guy goes in like a

670
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,980
regular detective, and he does like a history on the place, and who owned it, and who

671
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:38,640
died there, who lived there, etc., all that stuff, and he does it separate from the

672
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,380
psychic, right, so then the psychic goes in at night, and they film the psychic going

673
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:48,780
through, and she goes, oh, I'm feeling this, I see this, I hear this, and you're

674
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:52,840
watching her, you're not seeing any of this stuff, you understand, all this stuff that

675
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,500
she says she sees that's happening, and whatever else, you're just watching her

676
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:01,980
describe it, and then they get together, supposedly with no communication, maybe

677
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,880
you've heard of this thing, have you heard of this?

678
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,780
Yeah, but is it good TV or not, that's the point.

679
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,120
It's kind of interesting as a TV show.

680
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:13,520
Yeah, that's right, but in reality, they're not addressing anything, you know, but the

681
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:18,040
thing is, eventually, it will, you know what that will do, if they don't address it

682
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:22,200
the way, let's say, I did, I'm not saying my way is the only way, that's going to

683
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,260
invite more haunting.

684
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,640
Well, see, that's the thing, is that somebody else who wants to go put on a show

685
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,460
is going to go, hey, I can go put on a show, and I can get on TV with it, too.

686
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,580
Yeah, exactly, just like I hear some of these sci-fi, they're real alien, they put

687
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:37,620
a real alien there just to hear what people, if they could pick them out.

688
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,880
Yeah, right.

689
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,320
So, you know.

690
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,460
Why not?

691
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:47,160
That makes perfect sense, actually, and it's exactly that, so now that meeting at

692
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,700
the bar where somebody goes, hey, I bet I can get a show going over here, now they

693
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,800
can go for an even bigger game, you know what, not just freak the people out in the

694
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,500
neighborhood, how about we'll get the whole country looking at this, it'll be a

695
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:01,740
famous one, you know, like what was the biggest one you and I would know about,

696
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,760
Amityville, right, Amityville's the biggest thing ever, remember the Lutz family and

697
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,020
all that?

698
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:11,460
That was boosted, yeah, big time, that was a huge franchise in the 80s for a while.

699
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:16,260
Right, right, huge franchise, now, as for what really happened there, I mean, there

700
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:21,180
was a legitimate thing that historically happened there, but honestly, what are your

701
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,020
thoughts about that, though?

702
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,180
I mean, you know about that, right?

703
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:28,800
Yeah, I do, but I never, that would be people who are in the investigative capacity on

704
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,140
that subject, and I'm not.

705
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:34,380
I look at it from an overall general, just going like the magnets, you know, for

706
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:38,340
everyone's, keep it strange, but everyone says put the water where the magnet is

707
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:41,060
effective, I say put it where it's not, and watch what happens, right?

708
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:46,100
Well, let's go step by step on the bullet points of that real fast, and just let me

709
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,580
get your input on it, okay?

710
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:53,940
Because you have the whole situation that goes on in the 70s, right, which is this

711
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:58,940
kid, you know, takes a shotgun and murders his family, I mean, that happened, okay, so

712
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,440
that was a thing that occurred.

713
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:08,140
And he claims, or there were claims that he is possessed, and this and that, now, what

714
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:10,960
are your thoughts on that, a guy who just, you know, wakes up one night, he's got his

715
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,020
problems, whatever, he was, you know, smoking too much weed, drinking too much?

716
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,820
Well, okay, real short.

717
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:20,720
It was an Amityville horror because it was done, supposedly, by the undead, right?

718
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:25,440
Well, the undead influencing the younger guy who kills the family, first start.

719
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,460
Oh, that's, okay, that's when it ends, right?

720
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,260
That's when it ends.

721
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:35,100
That's, yeah, that's legit, and then when it continues, it's still, it's not the,

722
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:40,580
anyone who died, it's another spirit coming and doing it, you see how I anthropomorphized

723
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,120
it by saying the spirits meet at a bar?

724
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:45,640
Right, now, here's the thing about this, right, now, that's the first stage of the

725
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,920
story, and that's the backstory to the franchise.

726
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:53,440
The franchise comes about because of the Lutz family who supposedly moves in afterwards.

727
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:59,220
And now, they're being, they're, they got poltergeist, they got the room from hell

728
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:03,240
in the basement, they got the whole, all kinds of crazy stuff we're seeing up ahead.

729
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:07,020
Yeah, that's legit, that's legit, but I'm sure it was boosted big time, exaggerated,

730
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:13,320
that's legit, but it's not what they think or have been told it is, it's just opportunists

731
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:21,100
on the other side using it, just like they have a network, the spirit beings, they can

732
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:26,260
be like a hive, right, and they can actually, if you watch a lot of that and believe it,

733
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,120
you could actually invite them into your own house.

734
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:34,540
Like, for example, when, this is kind of a diversion a little bit, but let's say one

735
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:40,040
of these spirits runs across someone on the planet, and all he has to do is be, anybody

736
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,300
got anything on this guy?

737
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,520
And they all, all the ones that are tuning in, no matter where they are, let's say,

738
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:51,840
they'll, yeah, I know he had a grandpa that told him this, and he's the only one that

739
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,460
him and his grandma's grandpa's dead, so if you tell him this, he'll believe you.

740
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,120
Okay, thanks.

741
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,360
Almost like, you know, like the cop on the radio, right?

742
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,300
Okay, gotcha.

743
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,860
Yeah, yeah, they have a hive mind, so they could exchange energy, communications from

744
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:08,300
anywhere, in the physical realm, you know, like, right?

745
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:13,240
So they, it's not that particular spirit, but they're very good at that, and they don't

746
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,060
want themselves known.

747
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:18,060
Yeah, but what's useful to the listener, though, is to understand that if you start to steep

748
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,020
yourself in this stuff too much, okay?

749
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,120
Yeah, they'll use the hive thing on you.

750
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,140
You got anything on this guy?

751
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:24,440
Yeah, well, he believes.

752
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,800
This guy watches Amityville Horror, and a spirit comes around, and he says, hey, this

753
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,760
guy watches Amityville Horror, he bought that, so you got anything on this guy?

754
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:32,620
You see?

755
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:37,440
So, preconditions, here you go, you're a waiting audience, waiting to be served,

756
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:38,780
pretty much, right?

757
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,600
It's not, yeah, it's not like the Amity, you invited the Amityville thing, specifically,

758
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:47,840
over, a lot of the Christian, whatever, say, oh, yeah, you watch this stuff, you'll invite

759
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:52,000
that in your house, no, yes, yeah, you'll invite a similar thing, but it's not them,

760
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:55,100
it's someone else, oh, they go, they do an APB, right?

761
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:55,640
Mm-hmm.

762
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:56,660
Right?

763
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,140
Okay.

764
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,560
What is it, All Patrol Bullets, or whatever?

765
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,260
Yeah, points, points, I mean.

766
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:03,420
Across the whole radio, yeah, I got something on this guy, even though he's working on

767
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,060
somebody else.

768
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:09,720
They come from a group that also gives you dreams, and also gives you the inner voice,

769
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,340
a different group, a different category.

770
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,720
What I mean by this is like, okay, let's say you go to a municipality, right, the city,

771
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:20,900
they got the water guy, the electrical, they got the garbage man, they got the cop, they

772
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,520
got the one that's in the meter maid, right?

773
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:24,460
Mm-hmm.

774
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:29,020
All those things that I just mentioned are very distinct from each other, but they all

775
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:29,700
work for the city.

776
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:30,420
Okay.

777
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:31,980
That's how these spirits are.

778
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:34,780
So one does dreams, one does inner voices.

779
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:40,340
The inner voices one is probably the biggest group, right, because they keep changing those

780
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:46,480
inner voices as you change, as you change in age, and as you change in what level your

781
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,460
spiritual and mental capacity is.

782
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,000
Right.

783
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,780
And if you get too advanced, you know, people say, I just woke up, I found out about this

784
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:54,000
and that.

785
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,440
Well, you got to get another one, because his inner voice is different.

786
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,000
Now, we can't give him the inner voice, right?

787
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:03,440
Fortunately for them, the majority of people on the planet, they're still using the same

788
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,500
inner voice that they got when they were nine or 10 or 12.

789
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:11,340
That's why how many times you heard me say, most people do not mature beyond nine years

790
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:18,460
old or maximum 12 years old, like you're, like, who would you consider a pillar of society?

791
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,320
I don't know, a politician, most people that they like, or professor or doctor.

792
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:26,420
I'm telling you, I could show you that that person has a 12-year-old, nine to 12-year-old

793
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,820
mentality, maximum third grade, right?

794
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:29,280
Okay.

795
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:33,340
They don't go beyond, they're not, how do I say this for sure?

796
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:38,760
It's because if they wouldn't be known publicly if they were, you know, actually advanced.

797
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,080
So they have to change.

798
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:43,540
So let's say someone's, oh, I woke up in 2003, right?

799
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,160
Sometimes you heard that.

800
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,300
I woke up, I found out about the Illuminati, blah, blah, blah.

801
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,780
Oh, they got a, you need a new one, you got to change his inner voice.

802
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:53,280
And you have a period there where they transition.

803
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,520
It could be a few seconds or a few weeks where they bring in another one to give you

804
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,360
a new inner voice.

805
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:02,480
And that's where you actually, some people feel really, really different when they transition

806
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,280
from one thought to another.

807
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:10,220
If you get really advanced, I'm talking about the humans, they have to bring in a super

808
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,460
big one and they're more limited.

809
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:16,880
Even in scripture, there's a metaphor where the Christ says, once you get rid of one demon,

810
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,280
then he'll come back with seven worse ones, right?

811
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:21,940
You see?

812
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:27,460
So if you get really, really advanced, then they try to anticipate your actions before

813
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,960
you do them and mess you up.

814
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:34,120
That's why, quote, unquote, a lot of people that are, quote, unquote, geniuses seem crazy

815
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,520
or irrational.

816
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,820
Oh, by the way, you know what the difference between genius and stupidity is?

817
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:40,820
Go ahead.

818
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:46,140
Genius has limitations, right?

819
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,900
No limitations on stupidity.

820
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:48,620
That's the punchline.

821
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:49,080
No limit on stupid.

822
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:49,600
Wow.

823
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:50,700
Yes.

824
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:52,880
Right.

825
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:53,920
Yeah.

826
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:55,860
So anyway.

827
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,960
By the way, that's a t-shirt right there, by the way.

828
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:01,260
Speaking of enterprising individuals, I got to tell you, that's a t-shirt.

829
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:06,300
The difference between genius and stupidity is that genius has limits.

830
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:08,700
And I just end it right there.

831
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:09,900
And that's it, hopefully.

832
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:10,220
Yeah.

833
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:10,760
Yeah.

834
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,820
So this is the other realm that here, there's many ways.

835
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:24,720
Well, Greek, if you start asking me questions more about the context and fabric and structure,

836
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:25,780
I don't know.

837
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:31,400
I can only know it's like if I said, what is a bear?

838
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,900
You'll say, do you know what a bear is?

839
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:33,460
Yeah.

840
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,780
Well, this is how you want me to tell you how you know what a bear is by watching what

841
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:42,120
they look like and their behavior, what they might sound like.

842
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:42,880
That's it.

843
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:47,780
Has anyone ever sat down and did an eight-hour examination conversation with the bear for

844
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:50,920
the bear to tell you who, what it's like to be a bear?

845
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:51,320
No.

846
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:52,460
Right.

847
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,740
Yeah, you might have the bear whisper, but even then it's limited.

848
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:02,440
So we know about things by watching, perceiving, observing, and then communicating that body

849
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,140
of knowledge.

850
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,500
That's what I'm doing here.

851
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:09,200
So observation, recording, and then, you know, you.

852
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,340
Collecting the data.

853
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:12,340
And you distribute that.

854
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,420
Searching it.

855
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:18,300
I don't believe in research because research is to research.

856
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:22,480
But if you search something out well enough, you don't have to go back and do it again.

857
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:24,780
Go to another thing, go search another thing.

858
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,240
See, I do search, I search, and I search.

859
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:33,500
I rarely do research, go back, because I try to be methodical and complete.

860
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:38,380
Yeah, well, see, unfortunately, bodies of data can change.

861
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,160
In that case, you have to do research.

862
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,800
You have to go back and re-search it.

863
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,620
Right. For instance, I mean, look, again, you like to point to the JFK stuff.

864
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:50,960
I have to do research there because they add to the documentation.

865
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,780
Sure, but that's a good example that you brought up.

866
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,840
What do all assassinations have in common?

867
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,520
It's not a joke, is what you also find.

868
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:04,140
All big public assassinations, because there are private ones that you hear about later.

869
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,860
But the public assassinations, meaning it's almost in real time or same day.

870
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,800
What do they have in common with JFK?

871
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,300
It's not a punchline, it's a lot.

872
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,140
The security is pulled, right?

873
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:20,600
It's hinted at, blah, blah, blah, Patsy.

874
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:25,580
Look, I point out all the time, if you go anywhere from the JFK assassination to

875
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:30,000
an attempted assassination or a successful one in North Korea, it's the same crap.

876
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:33,440
Anyway, it doesn't matter, the culture, the language, all of it, it's the same thing.

877
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,860
Yeah, so we go back to the animal kingdom.

878
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:40,260
People are trained, detectives, forensic people, parks, rangers.

879
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:45,520
They find a body, they know what animal ate the human body, depending on where it was.

880
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:49,000
If it's the face that's eaten off, it's most likely a lion.

881
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:53,100
If it's the groin, it's most likely dogs.

882
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,300
If it's the center area, it's a bear.

883
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:58,580
If it's the toes and the fingers, it's another animal, right?

884
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,560
So you can judge, right?

885
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:05,560
There's someone called the maggot man, and he knew, he could tell how long a body's been dead

886
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:08,740
by counting the maggots, because maggots produce very linearly.

887
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:15,060
So if you count all the maggots, you'll know how long the body's been infested upon, right?

888
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,180
These are just measurements.

889
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:19,120
Well, a couple of things go into that, too.

890
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:22,100
They got to know what temperature was going on and things like that,

891
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:24,300
because that varies a bit.

892
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:24,860
Yeah, they do.

893
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:27,180
That's easy to find out, I mean, to a certain degree.

894
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:30,440
By the way, since I've been doing weather work, which is two decades now,

895
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:33,940
they lie about the temperatures and the rains and all that, too.

896
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:35,580
You can't trust the records.

897
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:39,100
But I guess for them, they might have their own little weather station.

898
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,120
So here's the thing.

899
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,740
I don't like taking too many questions on the spiritual world, because I don't know.

900
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:51,040
Just like I don't like taking questions on what a bear is.

901
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:51,840
I don't know.

902
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,700
I don't know any more than the next human.

903
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:58,080
You know who knows what a bear is?

904
00:48:58,520 --> 00:48:59,060
A bear.

905
00:48:59,140 --> 00:48:59,460
A bear.

906
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,720
Unless he's got a really low self-esteem, right?

907
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:09,140
You have to check their self-esteem, by the way, before you interrogate them, let's say.

908
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,680
Yeah, you might want to be something else.

909
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:15,200
I don't know.

910
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:20,320
There could be weird bears, you know, just like we have guys that want to be girls.

911
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,900
I mean, it could be a bear wants to be a wolf.

912
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:23,920
I don't know, you know.

913
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:25,700
Well, here's the thing about human perception.

914
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:28,180
We can rely on the perception, and it's repeatable.

915
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:30,900
Just like if you took a circus bear and put him in the woods, you know,

916
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,480
all the other bears say, what a dummy.

917
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:33,800
What a dummy.

918
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:38,840
We think the bear is really smart, but they would look at him as an idiot.

919
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:40,300
So what the hell are you doing that for?

920
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:41,300
Right.

921
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:42,440
You see the difference?

922
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,120
I'm not, you know, I'm just you're hungry.

923
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,940
You'll catch a fish over there.

924
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:46,980
Don't you know where the fish are?

925
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

926
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:52,480
He would be a total idiot compared to the, but the humans view the one that's in the

927
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,440
smart, right?

928
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:58,460
So you have to leave all that stuff aside and to go further.

929
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:03,780
So to go further on this spiritual thing, there is a collective.

930
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:05,600
And here's the thing.

931
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:07,320
I'm surmising that they were here.

932
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,560
We're in their territory.

933
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:13,200
The earth before the earth was put here, moved and parked here.

934
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:14,980
Think about a parking spot.

935
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:19,020
You know, you ever go to a corporate office parking lot, it says reserved, you know,

936
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:21,780
for the employees or whatever kind of thing.

937
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,360
Well, they were there like that.

938
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:27,940
They were here, meaning in the Greek would be topos, or it was where you get the word

939
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:33,160
topography in the topos or horos, which is field.

940
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:37,680
Let's say also means dance would would be.

941
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:42,960
In a nonphysical world, so you could park the earth here, whether it's flat around,

942
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:43,920
it doesn't matter.

943
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:49,560
And we're inside their world or they're they're walking through us, you know, where

944
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:52,760
they do show this in Hollywood, where, you know, ghost comes through the wall and walks

945
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:53,960
through someone that's standing there.

946
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:54,300
Right.

947
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:58,460
I think I saw something like preview something recently, recently, a few years ago, where

948
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:00,260
the ghost just walks through the person.

949
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,320
They don't present, right.

950
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:03,020
Very like one who could see the ghost.

951
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:03,640
Common from.

952
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:04,920
Yeah, common.

953
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:06,740
Yeah, yeah.

954
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:07,520
Just like that.

955
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:14,780
But so they struggle to affect this world, but they don't have to struggle.

956
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:20,380
They know they could tune into the perception and the mental aspect of of ourselves, you

957
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:22,280
know, through thoughts, inner voice.

958
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:27,720
The apparitions, I'm sure I don't know how they do it, how they transfer over to this

959
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:30,620
world and start moving physical things.

960
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:31,120
Exactly.

961
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:37,280
It would be just like us doing PK and us doing telepathy, you know, in their world.

962
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:37,720
Right.

963
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,820
We have humans that could cross over.

964
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,220
I've had PK events happen.

965
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,260
I just can't control them.

966
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:43,420
They just happen.

967
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:50,140
So I think I've shared them on Sonics so we can look at all these things, the hows and

968
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:50,900
whys and the mechanics.

969
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:51,580
I don't know.

970
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:56,280
I mean, even again with the magnet, I've been looking at this for a long time.

971
00:51:56,340 --> 00:52:00,480
So I'm going to finally do a deductive result and put the water where everyone else is not

972
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:01,840
because it makes the most sense.

973
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:02,460
And guess what?

974
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:03,480
Right.

975
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:09,220
So this is I've been adjusting the way I look at things now because I say the stranger,

976
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:14,820
the better, you know, at this point, because if you start saying things that are not, let's

977
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:17,860
say, comporting to what the academics are saying, that's strange.

978
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:18,260
Right.

979
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:19,120
Isn't that strange?

980
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:22,600
Well, look, very much like talking to water, you know, and they go, well, what the hell

981
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:22,920
is that?

982
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:23,740
You're not doing anything.

983
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:26,680
Well, Veda Austin would be the one for that.

984
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:27,160
She does.

985
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:32,620
She'll put the water on the photograph and then partially freeze the water and you get

986
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:34,240
many of the elements of the photograph.

987
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:35,380
And it's not coincidental.

988
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:36,820
You know, it's direct.

989
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:37,660
You can see it.

990
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:43,620
Well, so on the spirit side, that's why I have been bringing up the inner voice.

991
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:49,720
And I brought this example tonight and also how these things are a community or a collective

992
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:50,280
on their own.

993
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,860
It's an entire other world.

994
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:57,900
When you the next thing I know some people might be thinking is, does this have anything

995
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,500
to do when you die?

996
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:01,720
Well, death is the reverse of being born.

997
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,340
So just think of being born in reverse.

998
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:11,720
And that's what your effect would be there to a degree, but without the experience here.

999
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:12,680
Right.

1000
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,580
So that's another subject.

1001
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:21,220
But the subject I wanted to just work on a little bit more is the spiritual side where

1002
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,520
we, like I said earlier, oh, he's spiritual.

1003
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:26,080
You know, it's always a good or bad.

1004
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:26,420
What do you mean?

1005
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:27,040
He's a good or bad.

1006
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:27,780
It's spiritual.

1007
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:30,560
It's like, that's not telling me anything at all.

1008
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,680
So is there good and bad in this?

1009
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:36,580
Well, yes and no.

1010
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:37,340
Right.

1011
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:44,120
You know how I say, you know, people say, well, I give different, I try to explain good

1012
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:44,560
and evil.

1013
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,200
It's not good and evil.

1014
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:49,040
It's good and bad.

1015
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:53,960
Evil is brought upon someone who doesn't do good, does the opposite of good.

1016
00:53:54,360 --> 00:54:01,760
So when you have people that are doing bad things and things are going out of balance

1017
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:05,540
because of it, and they could be doing these bad things for a really long time, but eventually

1018
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:06,340
it's going to, right?

1019
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:08,060
Eventually it catches up to them, they say.

1020
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:11,640
The way it catches up to them is by putting evil on them.

1021
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:12,300
Right.

1022
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:17,740
So when you say someone is good and this guy's evil, I'm like, well, to me, they're both

1023
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:23,660
good because the one that's evil is out to get back at some, to put something in balance,

1024
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:24,020
you see?

1025
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:27,420
So that word's not being used the way, right?

1026
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:33,160
So, you know, it's like the cops and robbers, for example.

1027
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:37,920
When the robbers get caught by the cops, guess what?

1028
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:40,760
The cops are evil, aren't they?

1029
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:42,140
To the robbers.

1030
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:42,960
To the robber, yeah.

1031
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:44,880
Yeah, yeah.

1032
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,300
But you see what I mean?

1033
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:48,780
And vice versa.

1034
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,860
So it's not just a matter of perspective.

1035
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:57,500
It's not even cause and effect because you'll have a group of people on the planet been

1036
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:00,580
doing bad shit for hundreds and hundreds of years.

1037
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:01,520
It's like, when is it going to end?

1038
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,120
We've talked about that, too.

1039
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:06,940
Mop-up crew is going to take care of that, but it's also going to take their followers.

1040
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:13,860
The interesting thing about the spiritual thing, it's intent and it's also what you

1041
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:16,240
subscribe to, right?

1042
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:24,500
So let's say, okay, when you have a mentality that's part of the collective, you just

1043
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:29,960
screwed yourself when the mop-up crew and these retributions on this world take place.

1044
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:34,620
Doesn't matter if you think you're good or bad, or you may have never sinned in your

1045
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:36,360
life, quote unquote, right?

1046
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,320
You're not a smoker, not a drinker.

1047
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:39,440
You got a church, blah, blah, blah.

1048
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:40,440
You vote, blah, blah, blah.

1049
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:45,120
You just screwed yourself, dude, because when they come back to take out that system, you're

1050
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,220
part of that system, you see?

1051
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:48,760
That's how they view it.

1052
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:54,240
It's kind of like, let's say the CCP blows up Beijing and says that the U.S. did it and

1053
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:58,560
they send the Chinese troops to attack the U.S. and the Chinese troops come to your

1054
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,860
neighborhood, and it's an obvious false flag.

1055
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:05,400
You're going to go to the Chinese troops and say, hey, man, it was a false flag.

1056
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:06,880
You know, leave us alone.

1057
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:08,960
They're going to shoot you in the head.

1058
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,360
They don't care.

1059
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:12,420
It's already done, right?

1060
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:18,880
So when the system is here, the conventional system that everyone goes by, that will be

1061
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:22,280
taken out because it's with evil, because it's bad.

1062
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:27,120
And if you're part of it, even though you just subscribe to it, you see, does that make

1063
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:27,960
any sense so far?

1064
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:29,200
You see what I mean?

1065
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:33,800
So if you're part of the collective, you just screwed yourself because you've subscribed

1066
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:38,460
to a system that has to be eliminated, and that system is not just the ideology.

1067
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:44,900
It's the people that follow that ideology, just like the analogy I gave with the troops

1068
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:48,220
coming over here thinking that the Americans blew up Beijing.

1069
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:52,420
Look, they were telling, look how dumb they are also.

1070
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,280
This is a military town.

1071
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:58,680
There's an Air Force base here, and the largest army intelligence is less than 50 miles

1072
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,020
southwest, southeast.

1073
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:05,100
I've seen military people out, and I'm like, you guys in military, how's your military

1074
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:05,360
history?

1075
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:06,140
Oh, I know a lot.

1076
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:07,820
So when was the last time the U.S. declared war?

1077
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:08,520
Oh, 9-11.

1078
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:10,220
Like what?

1079
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:11,160
No.

1080
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:17,260
And do you know that the president is not commander in chief unless the Congress declares

1081
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:17,800
war, right?

1082
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:18,220
Right.

1083
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:21,380
He's not commander in chief of the military, and they still say that.

1084
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,080
I'm like, what are you talking about?

1085
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:29,300
You know, so that's where it says, just leave things be, right?

1086
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,040
Leave them be, because it's too far gone.

1087
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:39,800
So on the spiritual end, I don't know exactly enough about these beings, but I see enough,

1088
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:44,560
I've heard enough, and whatever, that we can speak on it this way.

1089
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:48,300
And you'll notice like half the things I've said is to correct things that are just way

1090
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:49,480
off, like good versus evil.

1091
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:50,660
Why?

1092
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:51,340
Why?

1093
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:53,560
If evil is coming, it's because someone was doing bad.

1094
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:55,920
It has to, you know, it has to follow through.

1095
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,540
You mean good versus bad, right?

1096
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:02,620
But if everything's bad and you call it good, wait a second, that's in Scripture too.

1097
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:03,800
Whatever is bad, they call good.

1098
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:07,980
You know, so whoa, it's like the word nice.

1099
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:12,300
You think you'll ever stop having the people use, like, have a nice day?

1100
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:14,820
That'll never stop until it's redone.

1101
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:15,120
Yeah.

1102
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:19,360
So you got to leave it alone, but doesn't mean just because you know you got to do something

1103
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:20,300
about it for them.

1104
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:21,700
Right?

1105
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:24,140
It's like the money system is another one.

1106
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:32,280
You know, the money system is the easiest one to deal with, and still no one's doing

1107
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:33,020
anything about it.
