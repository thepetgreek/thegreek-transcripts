1
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,720
The Sonic Event 27, Ocelli in the Greek, rated Y.

2
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,780
And, you know, we were starting to have a conversation and Greek says to me, look, hit

3
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,220
record.

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,760
So, so here we are.

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,660
I'll begin this time, actually, but Greek, before I begin, how are you doing tonight?

6
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,220
I'm doing OK.

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:33,040
I mean, I said hit record because this Internet stuff, the people, these kids, right, they

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:39,740
call it content, content, content, content, those kids, those kids, they got, they got

9
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,680
this newfangled Internet stuff and, yeah, they call it content.

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,640
I mean, contents may settle, right?

11
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,880
That's where I come more, I'm more from contents may settle, right?

12
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:49,220
Right.

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,860
Cereal box generation.

14
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,040
I used to say that.

15
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,680
As a matter of fact, I used to put that on chip bags, too, I used to say that a lot.

16
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:54,880
Right.

17
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,200
Contents may settle in shipment or whatever, because I'd always ask the question, why the

18
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,480
hell is the bag half empty, right?

19
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:05,180
So all the lawsuits in the 80s, so remember the quarter pounder wasn't a quarter pounder

20
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,660
and then the Stella who dropped the hot coffee and McDonald's, and that was the legal community

21
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,100
telling you we're taking over.

22
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,120
Yeah.

23
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,320
So we're, you know, we're talking about.

24
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,600
So yeah, what we were talking about off air.

25
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,620
You want me to set up or you want to set up?

26
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,700
Real quick.

27
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:20,100
Sure.

28
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,780
You hear a lot of times people talking about, let's say, controversial stuff and the lines

29
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,420
get cut off Skype phone or whatever.

30
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,160
Oh, they don't want us to say that, you know, and then go ahead.

31
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:29,580
Yeah.

32
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,220
No, the call drops or, you know, you get some weird kind of thing happens.

33
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,860
You and I have had this happen a couple of weird times where I had a thing happen the

34
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,400
other day with you where I said it sounds like a European fire alarm.

35
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,380
And I don't know if anybody who's listening to us has heard some of these fire alarms

36
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:45,740
that used to.

37
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,340
I mean, I haven't been to Europe since the 80s, but they used to have different sounding

38
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:56,360
fire alarms and we have on, off, on, off, on, off, on, off, almost like the ambulances

39
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,800
that sounded that way.

40
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,020
Right.

41
00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:59,300
Okay.

42
00:01:59,560 --> 00:01:59,760
Yeah.

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,360
Yeah.

44
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,460
So like, like, you know, Harley Davidson's potato, potato, potato, potato, potato.

45
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:04,860
Right.

46
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:05,160
Right.

47
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,080
Anyway, there you go.

48
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:06,600
Exactly.

49
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,979
So but anyway, the screeching weird noise came across.

50
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,960
I'm like, what the hell is that?

51
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:11,600
And he's like, what?

52
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,660
I said, there's this.

53
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,080
I hear like a fire alarm.

54
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,500
No, I didn't know how to describe it.

55
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,020
So we had that.

56
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:21,480
We've had other times where like the call seems to drop on one end, but it's still connected

57
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,020
or it does disconnect.

58
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:23,880
Weird stuff.

59
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,360
You know, Greeks going, why are you echoing?

60
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,120
I'm like, echoing.

61
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,620
I'm set up specifically not to echo.

62
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,560
Everything is intentionally done with my machine.

63
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:37,980
Well, look, the most hardcore, by the way, is when we're on this certain matters, you

64
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,440
and I and recorded just like this.

65
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,120
And the screen goes trying to reconnect.

66
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,580
And I hear the Skype calling really loud in the headphones.

67
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,320
And I'm like, Chuck, can you hear me?

68
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,660
And then I hang up or whatever.

69
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,660
You're like, I heard you just fine.

70
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,100
Yeah.

71
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,680
Well, that's the other thing is he's sitting there going, I don't know what's going on

72
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:54,860
here.

73
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,640
There's something going on.

74
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,020
It's disconnect.

75
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,120
I don't hear none of this.

76
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,080
He's talking to me.

77
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,080
To me, Skype is indicating me.

78
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,720
It dropped the call.

79
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,680
It's calling you back.

80
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,480
That's all I see.

81
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:02,760
Right.

82
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,400
And it's happened several times.

83
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,540
So anyway, the default thing is when anything goes wrong with with connections, right.

84
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,380
Anybody in media especially has always been like, oh, the CIA is listening.

85
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,320
The NSA is listening.

86
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,860
Now, sometimes they are.

87
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,360
But I mean, generally speaking, and of course, everything is a database and recorded and

88
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:21,840
blah, blah, blah.

89
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:26,420
And that's something that they do use the so-called A.I. to do is to quickly do this,

90
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,180
that kind of work so that it is database and stored.

91
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,220
That's true.

92
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,160
And we've known about that for, what, 30 years.

93
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,800
You know, I didn't need Edward Snowden to tell me about it.

94
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,020
We knew about the but what did they used to call that?

95
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,860
The yeah, the echelon system and all that.

96
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,520
You know, these names are known now.

97
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,920
But anyway, whatever.

98
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:45,540
Who cares?

99
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,020
All right.

100
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,920
So during certain topics with the Greek, when he brings up certain technological issues,

101
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,960
these things tend to happen more often.

102
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,500
I've had it happen.

103
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,580
And I say, look, on occasion that happens because, yeah, you struck the wrong nerve.

104
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:04,760
And it may indeed be something that is being listened to by an intelligence agency or whatever.

105
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,280
And I've had that happen.

106
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:12,060
And a good, for instance, is all of a sudden weird crap started to happen when a couple

107
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,620
of months back I found out and a few other people found out that the CIA had went and

108
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:22,700
briefed media assets ahead of the files coming out, the JFK files that they've they've hushed

109
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,240
up a lot.

110
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:29,260
And they went to the news media people and started telling them, look, we're going to

111
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:33,480
tell you what's coming out in these files ahead of time, even though the world is allegedly

112
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,140
not seeing these except the restricted group and blah, blah, blah.

113
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,820
You know, but we're going to tell you what's in them because you guys are so young, you

114
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,760
don't understand any of this stuff and you're not researchers.

115
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,180
Only researchers who have had their heads buried in this for the past 20 years even understand

116
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:48,900
what the hell this is.

117
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,940
So we're going to help you.

118
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,420
And but the researchers saw it as being a nothing burger anyway, right?

119
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,220
Well, not entirely.

120
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,360
Not entirely, because we did learn they did preserve some things accidentally, I think.

121
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,820
As a matter of fact, it took us a while to dig it up.

122
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:08,040
But now we have absolute proof that they destroyed a bunch of evidence which has not been in

123
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,040
the public's hands before.

124
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,080
And we can prove that.

125
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,880
But it's a long winding road to get to somebody.

126
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,640
So it takes.

127
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:14,420
Right.

128
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,320
But hold on.

129
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,920
You know, I have no sympathy about JFK getting, you know, whacked, right?

130
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,240
Yeah.

131
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:19,740
You know why?

132
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:24,560
If I was alive back then and even not into Greeks, because first of all, what are we doing

133
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,700
with a Catholic president?

134
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:31,060
Because if you pledge to be Catholic, your allegiance is to the pope, not the laws of

135
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:31,700
the U.S.

136
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,480
Right.

137
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:32,960
Yeah.

138
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,000
But I'm a drug.

139
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,380
Well, whatever runner, not drug, whatever runner family.

140
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,600
Right.

141
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:43,920
Well, it's very well known that the election was rigged, by the way.

142
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,360
Right.

143
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,060
So there are many questions, many questions about it.

144
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,920
I'm not going to say that you're absolutely correct.

145
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,160
I'm going to say that there are many legitimate questions regarding all those things.

146
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,900
And I'm not one of these guys who like worships Kennedy either.

147
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:01,180
But but realistically, I do feel as though there was a wrong thing that happened there.

148
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:05,320
And it needs to be understood by a lot of people did not like them.

149
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:10,560
And those that liked them had a picture in their house in an altar kind of setting.

150
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:11,740
Yeah.

151
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:12,220
No.

152
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:12,980
Well, he was alive.

153
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,640
This idea about he was Catholic to the other thing is how Catholic was he?

154
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:16,940
Right.

155
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,360
You know, he wasn't entirely devoted to that.

156
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,840
But anyway, forget all that.

157
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,580
Sometimes it's just just just saying if you don't renounce it, you're it.

158
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:31,020
That's why I tell people, you know, you know, the like not to divert, but you have some

159
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:36,620
being an alternative media and he talks, he's 10 year in this and this and he hasn't renounced

160
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,060
that shit.

161
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,800
He's coming on with credentials as academic and these morons that are listening to this

162
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,660
alternative media actually think he's got anything valid to say.

163
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,320
Yeah.

164
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,500
Well, you notice there's not too many professors come on my show.

165
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:53,300
And I often point out, look, I got a high school education and that's fine for me learning

166
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:53,920
too much.

167
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:54,540
Yeah.

168
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,280
You already got fucked up.

169
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:56,880
I know.

170
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,800
Eighth grade is the point where if you go past eighth grade, they got you.

171
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,940
But I always point out, you know what I know?

172
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,380
I know.

173
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,920
But I point out that, look, regardless, that's as far as I went because I was dumb enough

174
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,420
to go there.

175
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,020
But the thing is, it was what it was.

176
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,260
And it's really my street knowledge that has ever been useful.

177
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,740
So that's all there is to it.

178
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,020
And that's stuff I learned by doing.

179
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:19,780
Very simple.

180
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:20,900
Mm hmm.

181
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,420
Mm hmm.

182
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,860
Yeah, it was.

183
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,200
It was.

184
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:23,840
I understand.

185
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,180
Yeah, but street knowledge, you don't need to go right to the books.

186
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:26,760
You go right.

187
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,720
You go right to the library.

188
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:29,920
Not the textbooks.

189
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,520
Not what the idiot professor is teaching.

190
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:37,240
You go right to the library, right to the library and you learn from there.

191
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:42,700
And not not the library that they're telling you to go to or the part of the library where

192
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,760
they have to use textbooks.

193
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,760
Textbooks are garbage.

194
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,100
Right.

195
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,180
Right.

196
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,560
So let's go back to the.

197
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,540
Well, you don't object.

198
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,720
Hey, listen, you don't object to apprenticeships, though, because basically because of my visual

199
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,360
problem, I couldn't read a lot of those books because the print was small.

200
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,660
So quite frankly, I went and learned from people who were doing it already.

201
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,540
OK, how do I do this?

202
00:07:59,640 --> 00:07:59,840
Show me.

203
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,040
All right.

204
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:01,780
Instead of reading.

205
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,500
Yeah, well, that's that's that's the way to do it.

206
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,380
But we look here.

207
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,580
The show me thing today.

208
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,500
If they're not doing it, you have to know that if they're doing it right or not.

209
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,340
That's why we're doing it.

210
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,480
We're one of the things we're going to talk about.

211
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:11,940
Mm hmm.

212
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,240
So we'll get there.

213
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:13,860
But let's OK.

214
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,120
Yeah.

215
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,760
Let's finish with the censorship issue, because this is important.

216
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,560
The thing is that as soon as we knew about that and we knew about activities we weren't

217
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,640
supposed to know about, all of a sudden people had troubles with their communications.

218
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,800
You know, it's like somebody's waiting for a call.

219
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,560
You're calling them.

220
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,900
You swear you're calling them and the phone's not ringing.

221
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,360
Things like that go on all the time.

222
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,620
And then you're all done.

223
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:33,940
Yeah.

224
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,100
I see it as if they're detecting your voice to prompt the device.

225
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:40,900
That already is read.

226
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:45,740
That already gets flagged, just like, you know, if you if you have an email with certain

227
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,980
words, it gets stored, put aside for later, they say.

228
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,300
Right.

229
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,040
Oh, yeah.

230
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:51,840
So, yeah.

231
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:52,940
So, no, here's the thing.

232
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,440
I don't mind.

233
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,600
Recently, I was in a conversation with someone in a certain business and I was talking about

234
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,540
certain technology that could that's way ahead of what the industry has.

235
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,140
Phone gets cut off.

236
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,420
And I'm thinking their battery died because I tried calling them back and went right

237
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,120
to voicemail.

238
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,100
Turns out they were doing the same with me.

239
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,120
They thought my battery died.

240
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,480
So we could not communicate for a good 20 minutes and then we went back and it happened

241
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:15,820
again.

242
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,600
Mm hmm.

243
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,060
Right.

244
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,120
So I said, this is fine.

245
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,380
And neither one of us really brought up what we're bringing up right now because we're

246
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,420
beyond that.

247
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:30,660
But I think bringing it up in a more cogent way where instead of people on the you know,

248
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,660
you hear an interview and they get cut off.

249
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,960
They don't like what we're talking about.

250
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,800
Usually ends there.

251
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,920
They don't really talk about it like we are right now.

252
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,140
Right.

253
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,640
So but that's the thing.

254
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,440
Now, on the other hand, I do see that occasionally there are valid disruptions that are put in

255
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,260
place and indeed it spooks some people and all that.

256
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:52,200
But on the other hand, I think on occasion you can also get sort of censored, you know,

257
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:56,460
in electromagnetic frequency, which is one of these things that is essential in almost

258
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,820
any communication at this point in the, quote, modern world.

259
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,080
Right.

260
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,360
Can be disrupted on another level.

261
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,960
And I think sometimes it comes from the spiritual side of things.

262
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,320
Right.

263
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,800
And that's, you know, so and I try and explain this and they go, no, no, it's the CIA, it's

264
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,120
the NSA.

265
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,100
And I'm like, but the NSA doesn't care.

266
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:15,860
Hold on.

267
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,860
Let me just interject.

268
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:21,300
You know, I brought up biogeometry, biosignatures, Ibrahim, Karim, right, right.

269
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:26,420
I discovered him because I was doing research on the Internet for a while about what entities

270
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,800
were in charge of electricity in the ancient world.

271
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,800
And when he first came out on the Internet more than 10 years ago, he was talking about

272
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,300
and he had written a little article that the ancient Egyptians knew about electricity,

273
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,000
but they didn't want to bring it out because it would evoke this particular demon.

274
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,500
And he gave the name of it.

275
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,320
And you'll find this in various literature.

276
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,520
Steiner talks about it.

277
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,900
I like Steiner's stuff, but he's too fruitcake-y for me.

278
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,160
You know, I don't know if you're familiar with Rudolf Steiner, so is Walter Russell.

279
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:57,660
They have valid stuff, but I think some of the people that are out right now talking

280
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,080
about similar things are far ahead of those guys, even Tesla, believe it or not.

281
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:08,980
So I was, it was part of the research of how everything that we have now was known.

282
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,100
You've heard me say electricity was always known, always.

283
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,520
Don't believe in the people thought that if they sail to the edge of the Earth, they

284
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,340
fall off, right?

285
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,060
That's what they thought.

286
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:17,620
Yeah, all that nonsense.

287
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:18,500
Never.

288
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,100
Yeah, they knew that the Earth was both flat and round, and you got lost.

289
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:27,380
Like, in other words, if you're going to travel on the planet or the Earth or the world to

290
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:32,280
see its limits, it's going to take advantage of how you perceive it and make it a nightmare

291
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:32,800
for you.

292
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,900
So if you think it's round, it'll make it a round nightmare.

293
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:40,760
If you think it's flat, it'll make it a flat nightmare because you're poking the bear, right?

294
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,200
Right.

295
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,640
You're not supposed to do these kinds of things here.

296
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,280
Same with any subject, right?

297
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,400
Researchers know that.

298
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,180
How many researchers have ended up in a fiery mess, right?

299
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,240
A fire, car accident.

300
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,020
Right.

301
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,280
What?

302
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:57,380
Fire, car accident, you know, suicide, shoots himself in the head twice, you know, this

303
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:57,600
kind of thing.

304
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,040
Right, right.

305
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:58,660
Of course.

306
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,940
No, but sometimes it is purely a spiritual thing, and sometimes, you know, through a

307
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,000
spiritual entity, what do they do?

308
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,940
Well, sometimes they might use somebody who is already in their system, right?

309
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,480
Why not?

310
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,160
You've already got somebody on the table.

311
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,240
By the way, the intelligence agencies, you know, it's an oxymoron, right?

312
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:18,660
Of course.

313
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,560
They're panty sniffers now, and people may not know.

314
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:29,120
Panty sniffer is like back in the day, you got, you're a young man, you're living on

315
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,640
your own, you live with your girlfriend, and you know this guy, and he doesn't have a girlfriend,

316
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,520
and he always, you know, he's like hard up for, you know, whatever.

317
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,420
Can I use your bathroom?

318
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,140
And the door is slightly open, and you see him going through your girlfriend's laundry

319
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:46,580
sniffing her panties, just because he never, you know, he can't get any, right?

320
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,340
He's never been there, and so he just wants to get a whiff.

321
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,280
Yeah, yeah.

322
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:55,760
So, I mean, it sounds kind of disgusting and lascivious, but it's like a low brand type

323
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:02,320
individual, and yeah, and you'll see this common mentality through all of them, yeah.

324
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,820
And they're very, very heavily manipulated, and the ones that you hear speaking in public

325
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:12,380
are allowed to do so because they sound like they have their shit together, right?

326
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,120
But none of them do.

327
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,860
But, okay, so let's go ahead.

328
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,920
No, exactly.

329
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,100
None of them have their shit together.

330
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,420
Yeah, but sometimes those guys are real useful, not only to the people in charge, but maybe

331
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,840
to the entities in charge, right?

332
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:25,900
Right.

333
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,180
Well, the entities look around.

334
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:31,160
They're not, the entities are not dumb, although, albeit, believe it or not, I've gone through

335
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,600
many, many years of discussing peripheral and depth.

336
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,860
Well, somewhere in the hierarchy, there's probably some idiots.

337
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,720
Most of them are dummies.

338
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,000
Yeah, no, that's what I was going to say is that somewhere in the hierarchy, there's got

339
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,540
to be a class of idiots, right?

340
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,000
Well, it's like humans.

341
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:50,340
Like, today, I put in a phone order with an industrial supply, and the woman was so well

342
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,520
spoken, I thought it was a robot.

343
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,100
I said, are you human or are you a computer?

344
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,300
She goes, I'm human.

345
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,060
I'm like, wow, you're so well spoken, and the timing between your words was spaced almost

346
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,120
mathematically.

347
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,300
It sounded like you were, right?

348
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:02,840
Right.

349
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,920
So, and she says, oh, okay.

350
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,020
I said, do you get that a lot?

351
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:06,380
She goes, no.

352
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,560
I said, well, I'm just visiting here.

353
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,380
Have you been on Earth for more than 15 minutes?

354
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,440
She goes, yeah.

355
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,880
I said, so you know what's going on here, right?

356
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,640
I didn't get into the whole morons thing.

357
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,000
Right.

358
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:16,360
Right.

359
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:22,480
But I let people know right off the bat what I'm thinking in a very short period of time,

360
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,720
like 15 minutes, right?

361
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,300
Just, I mean, not 15 minutes, but just asking if you've been here for more than 15 minutes.

362
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,100
But no, what I, my point here is that, you know, I'm not saying that you should be here

363
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:47,920
for more than 15 minutes, but I'm not saying that you should be here for more than 15 minutes.

364
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,220
So, you know, these entities are dumb.

365
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:56,260
Most of them are idiotic, just like people are, the great majority.

366
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:06,040
And there are a certain, that's why when you are an advanced human, in other words, the blood that flows through your veins is generally the same quality as other people.

367
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,960
Well, not really, and I can get into that too.

368
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:15,960
But your actions, the way you behave, what you express and manifest, if it's superior, you're going to get attention.

369
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,080
And the dummies are going to be, what do we do with this one?

370
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,500
I don't know.

371
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,600
Let's ask the Sarge.

372
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,520
Well, Sarge says, I don't know what to do with that.

373
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,620
You know, the next guy up, right?

374
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,800
And the Sarge says, oh, let's ask the Colonel.

375
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:26,340
I don't know.

376
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:33,760
So they get really, so the problem with being an advanced human in your ways is you're going to start attracting higher up and higher up.

377
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:34,520
Attention.

378
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,560
Demonic entities' attention, yeah.

379
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,020
Yeah, so it works.

380
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,680
You know, people think of it on the positive side of things, right?

381
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,400
You're going to get the attention of the good ones, but that's not really the way it works.

382
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,200
And you know what?

383
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,520
Here's the thing.

384
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:55,240
That's an interesting thing, because if you actually look at what's been memorialized as some of the worst shit that's ever happened to people

385
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,440
and who actually put it on them, it was the good guys.

386
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:05,000
When you read, let's say, Book of Revelation, Apocalypse, who's doing all the wrecking?

387
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,560
The good guys, right?

388
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,280
So, yeah, so it's, again, it's backwards.

389
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:19,540
That's why, you know, people listen to me, and they say, oh, yeah, I shared it with someone.

390
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,420
They think you're angry or upset or whatever.

391
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,940
I say, no, because they don't know how to listen.

392
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,420
They're not hearing what I'm saying.

393
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:31,060
I'm actually, I'll put it in air quotes, I probably have the most hopeful message that exists out there.

394
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,600
The reason why is because it's so efficient.

395
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,820
What I'm saying is operating at such a high efficiency level is just don't even bother fixing it.

396
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,440
It needs to be blown up and started over.

397
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,940
There's no way you could fix this.

398
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,440
I'm telling you, right?

399
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,380
And that's it.

400
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:51,440
That's very hopeful, a hell of a lot more hopeful than, oh, we'll just fix this and we'll be happy.

401
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,700
I just said, no, that's not going to work, and I could show you a thousand ways why it won't.

402
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,480
And no, you can't show me any ways how it will.

403
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,700
So leave it alone, blow it up, and start over.

404
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,940
You see, I don't look at you as either optimistic or pessimistic.

405
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:07,079
I think just fairly pragmatic most of the time.

406
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,359
Yeah, you can't fix it.

407
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:15,640
And, you know, this can't fix it stuff started a long time ago, which shows it's a testament for the human durability.

408
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,599
Humans could take a lot of punishment.

409
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,579
And still, you know, look at the medical industry.

410
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:28,060
There's like nothing I've seen the medical industry do, and I've said trauma, right?

411
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,720
You need them for trauma.

412
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,440
Not even that.

413
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,840
They have you sitting there for an hour unless your guts are falling out and they need a bucket.

414
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,240
Even then they don't really know what to do.

415
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:42,840
They just put you together just good enough, and they, yeah, they're very.

416
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:43,480
Here's the thing.

417
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,960
If you're a good medical technician, a.k.a. doctor or whatever, you're not going to last long.

418
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,260
Because you're going to look at everyone around you and say, what the hell is going on here?

419
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,120
I'm going nuts.

420
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,240
You're not going to last, right?

421
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:59,960
And this is with anything, even the intelligence agencies, quote, unquote, same thing.

422
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,320
And you're also made fun of if you go by the book, which is one of the things I want to talk about.

423
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:09,860
But the censorship thing is it has a spiritual component, but what doesn't?

424
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:14,140
But to bring up the spiritual component is something that no one does.

425
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:18,520
They think it's all a bunch of panty sniffers pushing buttons, you know, or AI.

426
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:22,880
Because that is present, but it doesn't mean that's the whole thing.

427
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:28,240
And the panty sniffers get their inspiration from the spirits.

428
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,300
Also, they don't know it, you know.

429
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:31,780
What's that?

430
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:32,460
There was a film.

431
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:36,380
The first thing the devil was to make people believe he doesn't exist, right?

432
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,200
Oh, yeah.

433
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,340
What was it?

434
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,860
The greatest trick in the world was ever pulled off is that the devil got people to believe he didn't exist.

435
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:43,640
Right.

436
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,280
Something like that.

437
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:44,840
Yeah, very good.

438
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,560
Okay, yeah.

439
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,680
That's how most people operate anyway.

440
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:54,700
But I think the censorship is real, and it happens along, I believe,

441
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:59,420
and from my, let's say, reason and logic, along the lines of voice recognition.

442
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:06,120
Because if you're talking to the device and it recognizes context and syntax and all that to do what you're telling it,

443
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,320
it could sort out anything and everything else backdoor style, you know what I mean?

444
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:10,740
Right.

445
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,760
It could sort it all out immediately.

446
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,980
I put out a challenge on Twitter, and I haven't checked to see if anybody is answering it,

447
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,900
but something strange happened to me when it comes to recognition.

448
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:20,980
It's not just the voice.

449
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,380
It recognizes all kinds of things.

450
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,080
Sure.

451
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:29,500
I realized that I shook a bottle of something that is like an over-the-counter kind of, you know,

452
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,360
just thing that you might buy in a grocery store or a pharmacy.

453
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,240
With a ball bearing in it?

454
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,080
Tick, tick, tick thing?

455
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:40,340
Well, not a ball bearing in it, but it had some alleged medication in it, right?

456
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:44,760
So I do take something for headaches, all right?

457
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,880
I don't know what you think of that, but it does work.

458
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,680
I do, too.

459
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:54,740
Look, when I'm doing what I'm doing, especially lately, you know, I could do a fistful of ibuprofen.

460
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:55,980
Okay.

461
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,640
Fair enough.

462
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:02,380
So if I rattle a bottle of something like that anywhere near one of these connected devices,

463
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:08,400
even if I'm not using it for anything, but it's just turned on, if I go and surf the Internet later,

464
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,760
I'll find that they're advertising a bottle of something similar.

465
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:12,840
Yeah.

466
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,960
Yeah, they're reading.

467
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,080
They could read this.

468
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:22,940
They're using radionics, which is, you know, sympathetic vibration, which is vibration, not frequencies, yes.

469
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:23,300
Okay.

470
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:28,020
In other words, you can have vibrations that are not a function of time, right?

471
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,420
And that means they can detect anything anywhere in the universe at any time in the universe,

472
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,560
because they're not a function of time, right?

473
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,920
So that's why you focus more on vibration than frequency,

474
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:46,820
because there are elements of things like thought and will and things, emotions, the emo, that we've talked about,

475
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,560
how to imply and manifest.

476
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,660
That is independent of time and location, right?

477
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:58,300
But it has a function, meaning because it's a vibration, we always, when you go to the academic side,

478
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,180
it has to have a function in time, you know, how many per second or for how long,

479
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:09,880
and I'm telling you it doesn't, because your thought, your consciousness is beyond time if you allow it to be, right?

480
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,280
So don't be conscious of time.

481
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,500
A perfect example is when you're falling or in an accident, you notice how time slows down.

482
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:19,760
It seems like it took forever for that other car to finally crunch the front of the car you're in.

483
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,020
Right.

484
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:20,500
Right?

485
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,220
But if you saw a videotape of it, it's almost instant, right?

486
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:24,720
Right.

487
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,240
It's a good example.

488
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,300
It happens so fast, you have no idea exactly, you know, the order in which things happen.

489
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,920
People ask you later, well, did this happen first or that happen first?

490
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:35,320
In reality, if you're in the midst of it, you know.

491
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:35,740
It's slow.

492
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,360
It's slow.

493
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:42,540
It's slow, but you can't do it, you're disabled because you're not, that's what the martial artists and the Qigong do,

494
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,260
is how to move within the frames, within the, you know, like in a film, how many frames per second?

495
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:54,700
It's not the frames per second, it's how many non-frames in between the non-seconds, what you do there, right?

496
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,660
That's what that's about.

497
00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:01,500
Yeah, that's kind of what, believe it or not, Richard Allen Miller was trying to explain that on my show once.

498
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,340
Oh, my gosh.

499
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,080
Yeah.

500
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,920
I want to listen to him.

501
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,940
This is not a negative criticism.

502
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:13,020
I want him to provide stuff that is good.

503
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,820
He just doesn't.

504
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,760
I mean, I don't know.

505
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,480
I could tell you why and there's no reason for it, but yeah.

506
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:26,420
So, yeah, the whole thing is, you know, the old saying, it's the space between the notes that makes the music, right?

507
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,540
Or the space between the bars that keeps the tiger in the cage.

508
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:33,860
The notes you don't play are the ones that are most important for World War II, yeah.

509
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,540
Right, yeah.

510
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,740
Those are non-time functions that are very evident in our existence, meaning,

511
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:44,120
and that's where you want to jump, dancing between the raindrops, right?

512
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:44,660
Right.

513
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,240
So, it's called scalar function.

514
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,740
It means it's everywhere all the time and it doesn't have a time function.

515
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,980
Oh, yeah, that's why they say scalar waves.

516
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:53,920
What are scalar waves?

517
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,860
That doesn't make any sense.

518
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,060
So, learning to operate in those places, but yeah.

519
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,300
So, what do you think about the censorship stuff?

520
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,340
It exists, yes or no?

521
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:12,300
Oh, absolutely it does, but I think it's misunderstood by the people that, you know,

522
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,280
they think of it on one level.

523
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:20,020
But it does seem to have changed in recent times to me.

524
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:24,300
I don't know how to explain the change, but it does seem to be changing.

525
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,340
Of course, it's reality changes.

526
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,020
But here, could we call the spiritual side cosmic censorship?

527
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,040
Could we call it that?

528
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,640
Also cosmic censorship.

529
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,140
Have you heard that term before?

530
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,120
I have, indeed.

531
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,920
Yeah, it's come around a few times.

532
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:41,400
Yeah.

533
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:47,140
You notice I haven't been talking about dummy loads, cosmic censorship, space heaters,

534
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,220
and all the stuff that I used to back in the day, so to speak,

535
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:56,680
because it's move ahead and get more casual about things in a more functional way.

536
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:57,940
But, yeah.

537
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,540
No, and I appreciate that.

538
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,500
And we have looked in the chat recently.

539
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:05,480
You know, people are obviously hearing part of what you're saying about the water.

540
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,140
Yeah, that's by the way.

541
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:14,360
I like to put – there's more stuff I could put out regarding other things.

542
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,480
But what's interesting is a couple of people have caught on,

543
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,340
but no one has caught on who's enterprising who says,

544
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,980
do you know, Greek, this is like telling people that you got bitcoin for 20 cents

545
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,000
and they should get it, right?

546
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,400
So no one's really picked up on it like that yet, which is fine, because it should –

547
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,700
and I'm not saying it's a commercial thing either, you know, whatever.

548
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,680
But if you're an – put it this way.

549
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:39,620
If you're an enterprising individual, you see this, you're going to be, oh, my gosh, okay?

550
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,900
It's kind of like when you meet a cold-blooded killer in a crowd.

551
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,620
When you present something to a group of people and someone asks questions like –

552
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:54,300
let's say you present weather work to people that you can make rain or stop rain or stop hurricanes.

553
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,380
And, oh, wow, can you do this?

554
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,820
But if someone comes up to you and says, okay, you said you could stop hurricanes,

555
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,180
but can you make them, right?

556
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,760
That's a cold-blooded killer type.

557
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,440
You know what I mean?

558
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:10,500
That's like the kind of people that are – that other groups want behind the scenes,

559
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,360
to see that kind of – ask those questions right away, right?

560
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,480
So anyway.

561
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,580
But, yeah, the chat.

562
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,380
Let's go back to – nothing much in there.

563
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:24,600
There's – someone put in some interesting stuff about origins of Greece and things like that.

564
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,280
Actually, he did an informal but serious invitation.

565
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,860
If he wants to drop stuff like that, said, let us know, tell us more, come on to Sonic.

566
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,400
It will be a first time.

567
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:38,020
I think once we had the little Buddhist girl that you brought on that was kind of ridiculous.

568
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:38,640
Yeah.

569
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,640
But we could bring on – I don't mind.

570
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:49,440
By the way, if you've got something to say and you have to say something that's, you know,

571
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:55,060
very pertinent and can move things along, whatever those things might be, yeah, we'll bring you on.

572
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,720
I've had some people send emails that said, hey, look, I love reading your messages

573
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,380
and maybe come on with Chuck or whatever.

574
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,580
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

575
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,200
Obviously, we haven't had anyone on yet.

576
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,380
But that's an open invitation.

577
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,220
This is Skype, by the way, right?

578
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,400
I don't do the Zoom.

579
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,940
You know why I don't do the Zoom?

580
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,080
Just for the – I haven't even looked into it.

581
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:19,400
For the very premise that it became the Hockney thing, that's why I don't want to do it.

582
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,320
Just for that reason alone is good enough.

583
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:21,920
And you know what?

584
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,880
That's a pretty good reason.

585
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,580
You know, that's one of those weird things you and I have in common.

586
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,320
Like the moment that something becomes popular, I automatically reject it.

587
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,400
Yep, automatically, yeah.

588
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,760
You know, even if it's a movie.

589
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,040
Somebody goes, this is a great movie.

590
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,000
Everybody loves this movie.

591
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,740
I go, yeah, that's why I'm not going to see it.

592
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,380
Like right away.

593
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,460
That's always my reaction.

594
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,360
Yeah, I learned that when Foreplay became popular anyway.

595
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,600
Oh, okay.

596
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,540
Yeah, oh, okay.

597
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:54,700
So, yeah, so this is an indirect but serious open invite.

598
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,000
Well, not really an invite, but an open, yeah, come on.

599
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,680
If you got something, I want to hear it.

600
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,980
And everyone else should too.

601
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,740
Yeah, by all means, we can arrange that.

602
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,920
Easy, yeah, that's why I said Skype.

603
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,880
Just get Skype, you're ready to go.

604
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:09,580
Exactly.

605
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,500
Look, I give out my Skype all the time.

606
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,200
I'm Charles.Ocelli on Skype.

607
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,480
If you want to reach out to me, send me a message, you want to come on, just, you know,

608
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,280
do that thing where you try and friend me on Skype.

609
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,660
And for me, it's the same as the e-mail,

610
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,420
UncommonSenseRadio1 at gmail.com, and it's numeric one.

611
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,160
There you go.

612
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,320
So you can reach us real easy there.

613
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,860
Do I give the password out too?

614
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,480
No, I'm sorry, I'm just joking.

615
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,200
I wouldn't do that.

616
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:41,500
I had guys on my show one time just sitting there giving out their social security numbers.

617
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,340
I thought that was funny.

618
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:42,900
That's fine.

619
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,000
It's not your number anyway.

620
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,400
That's what they were saying.

621
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,660
By the way, here's the thing.

622
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:52,300
If anybody asks you or any institution asks you for a social security number, they're not government.

623
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,080
No.

624
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:59,400
Proof of that is if you deal with the State Department, passports and all that, it's optional.

625
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:03,080
But anything else to ask for a social security number, it's not government.

626
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,440
It's sort of optional with doctors and things like that.

627
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,540
By the way, I've kind of brought this in passing.

628
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,940
The social security number back in the days was called the exemption.

629
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,260
That's it.

630
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,140
It was the exemption.

631
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:16,600
What?

632
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,600
Exemption from what?

633
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,440
The bankruptcy.

634
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:23,040
In other words, what you call parts of the government, especially the Congress,

635
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,940
if you talk to the IRS and say, well, don't complain to us.

636
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,880
It's your Congress that enacted us.

637
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,200
That's the same with the Federal Reserve.

638
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,260
Don't tell us what we're doing is wrong.

639
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,620
It's your Congress, right?

640
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,240
So they rub the Congress in your face.

641
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:39,640
Okay, what they did was they did some dealings with some private bankers,

642
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:46,460
and the bankers set it up and the government became a corporation,

643
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,720
and that corporation went bankrupt, right?

644
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,280
And it's insolvent, and it cannot get out of that bankruptcy.

645
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:57,060
But you didn't know about it, meaning the general public, and you didn't cause it.

646
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,080
So you get an exemption number, meaning when it comes to money,

647
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:05,220
you use that number and you get what you want, and it's generated from your signature, right?

648
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,540
So that's why some people say, I'm so thankful I got a federal grant.

649
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,160
I said, what do you mean?

650
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,060
The government's got no money to give you a grant?

651
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,120
They took your signature and ran it through the Fed window, right?

652
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,300
So they're talking about all this stuff.

653
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,540
So it's called an exemption, by the way, but they don't use that anymore because it's –

654
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,860
let's just put it this way.

655
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,280
The rational, quote, unquote, real academic side

656
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:32,520
and the real lawful side of what this is was washed away a long time ago.

657
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,720
Even judges don't even know if you – I even brought this up to a judge once.

658
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,720
I said, what about the – you guys are using the exemption.

659
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,180
You see, you mean you're trying to say that they're exceptional?

660
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,680
I said, no, the exemption.

661
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,040
And he was – I thought he was playing dumb, but he really is dumb.

662
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,240
Anyway, that's all that is, social security.

663
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,060
It's not your number.

664
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,320
It can't be used as ID and all that.

665
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:59,680
And, by the way, there are codes that if they demand –

666
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,440
someone demands that number to do business with you, like a job application.

667
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,880
You know what that – that goes under RICO statutes.

668
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,460
And if you could get them – usually if you ask them,

669
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,160
you want the social security number or you won't give me this or do that,

670
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,340
give me that in writing.

671
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,440
They say never.

672
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:19,040
But if they do, that's 30 grand for you right away.

673
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:23,540
Probably if you're applying for a job, you could sue them for treble damages

674
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:26,380
so you don't go by the hour and say what your yearly salary was,

675
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,740
three times your yearly salary.

676
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,760
Yeah, you could make a living doing that, just applying.

677
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:33,720
But it will take a while to – and they usually settle out of court.

678
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,500
There's no judge that will take this, by the way.

679
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,880
Closed case, sealed case are open, right?

680
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,220
And how do I know this?

681
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:43,160
But anyway, yeah, so where were we?

682
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:46,120
We talked about social security number, passwords being put up.

683
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,640
Yeah, well, you got my head spinning there for a second.

684
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,340
So, okay.

685
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:53,340
Yeah, well, you also mentioned by the book

686
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:56,600
and how people don't go by the book or do they go by the book

687
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,420
and how they get treated if they're by the book.

688
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,120
I mean, you know, there's an interesting phrase.

689
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:04,420
That's a term that you'll see that certain authorities use.

690
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,520
Oh, he goes by the book, right, or whatever, right?

691
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:09,840
Because remember, this isn't as seen on TV society, right?

692
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,680
Before that, it would be as heard in church society, right?

693
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,960
Or as you heard it on the radio.

694
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,400
I was watching a film once.

695
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:22,420
It was done in the 70s.

696
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:27,020
I don't know if it was Sean Cassidy and Sundance Kid or something like that.

697
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,620
It was filmed in the 70s.

698
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,840
It was supposed to be about the 30s,

699
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,380
and some guy's whistling a jingle that was on the radio.

700
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,160
You see, that's pretty common, right?

701
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:40,940
Like someone uses jingles that they see on commercials now, right, on TV or whatever,

702
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,600
or the Internet.

703
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,800
And I pointed it out to someone.

704
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,120
I said, look, you see how it affects the culture?

705
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,340
This movie's supposed to be in the 30s.

706
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,580
They're whistling a jingle.

707
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:48,980
Perfect.

708
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,740
You see how this isn't as seen on TV.

709
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,620
What I mean by the book, let's say you go, there's a book called the Bible.

710
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,640
They say, swear on it.

711
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,920
And you say, well, look, the contents of the Bible,

712
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,220
you mean what's written on the Bible is what makes it the Bible?

713
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,660
And they'll say yes.

714
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,080
They'll say, well, I have all those words downloaded on my phone.

715
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,200
Can I swear on my phone?

716
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,060
No, no, no.

717
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,580
You see what's going on?

718
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:13,460
It's all direction to make things that are not important important, right?

719
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:18,620
Because the book known as the Bible has no value at all in its mass form.

720
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:19,720
You know what I mean?

721
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,760
It's mass, whether it's a big Bible, small Bible, whatever.

722
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,380
It's what's being communicated.

723
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,420
And now it doesn't have to be a book.

724
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,320
It can be digital.

725
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,660
It could be audio, right?

726
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:36,580
So that's where when I've used to do some Skype calls years ago

727
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,760
and where comrades go and say, oh, I don't know about the Greek.

728
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,420
He relies on information from books.

729
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,720
And I was like, oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh.

730
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,720
It doesn't have to be a book, right?

731
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,220
As a matter of fact, Homer's Iliad and Odyssey,

732
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:57,360
most of it was written to be done in iambic pentameter to be oral,

733
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:01,400
to be remembered oral around a campfire story, right?

734
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:01,780
Right.

735
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:05,660
So it's just information that's been memorialized and undistorted,

736
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:08,420
uncorrupted on any subject.

737
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,700
And that was the thought.

738
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,640
So let's use an example again about the Bible.

739
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:16,340
People think I'm religious or some people think I'm Jewish.

740
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:22,100
No one thinks I'm Christian, thankfully, thankfully, whatever.

741
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:25,340
Look, I don't believe in any of it, right?

742
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,640
I'm not religious as most people that are connected to things

743
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,240
that say they're part of the Bible.

744
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,480
What I've done with the Bible,

745
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,960
and this is a little personal too over anything else,

746
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,480
I see that it's thrust by the –

747
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,880
it's allowed by most of the powers that be

748
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,600
to be a reference about morality and all these other things.

749
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,720
So, all right, so that means the Bible is important.

750
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,060
The Bible is important, not what people say about it.

751
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:55,360
So go read the Bible and you'll find out what people think is in there

752
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,980
is not in there at all, right?

753
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,640
And the religions or the institutions built around it

754
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,860
aren't doing anything at all that's in there.

755
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,460
So now you have a choice.

756
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:08,080
Well, the first thing is if you have two dissimilar stories

757
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,580
and they're both telling you it's the truth but they're dissimilar,

758
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,300
well, only two things can be true.

759
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:17,739
Either they're both wrong or one is right.

760
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,199
They both can't be right, you see.

761
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:22,719
So that's what you do with all the information.

762
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:23,380
That's what I do.

763
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:26,500
So when I look at the Bible, I'm like,

764
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:31,020
hmm, is this something I want to incorporate in my behavior,

765
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:34,940
my ideology, my ideas, the way I think about the way I want to live?

766
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,980
And I thought about it for a while and I said, sure.

767
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:39,100
So that's where I'm at, right?

768
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:43,920
No more than, for example, I have a manual for Chrysler cars

769
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,880
and you have to use certain fluids, right?

770
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,440
And I mean they're Chrysler fluids, right?

771
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:54,380
And so, yeah, so do I just go get what transmission fluid, right?

772
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,460
Because no, no.

773
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,540
You've got to put a certain kind of coolant into an engine

774
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:02,080
because if you put the wrong stuff in there.

775
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,200
The manufacturer, the alloys, right?

776
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,760
They're going to be the metal alloys against that chemical, right?

777
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,340
So it's just a basic aspect of that.

778
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,480
So the same with quote-unquote science.

779
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,960
Recently with the pandemic, trust the science, but it's all hearsay.

780
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,600
I didn't hear any science at all whatsoever

781
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:22,620
because you go look at the science, if you can find it online anymore, which you can't.

782
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,040
Well, that was the funny thing is that they memorialize some things scientifically

783
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:30,520
and then that's not what is being put out as, well, look, we've got the papers here.

784
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,260
We're going to tell you what's in it.

785
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,040
And they tell you things like, you know, I went over this with you.

786
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,180
You know, oh, this is going to stop the spread.

787
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,320
That's not what it says.

788
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,940
You know, even the people that made it didn't say that about it.

789
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,020
You know, well, a little.

790
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,880
So that's where you make the decision.

791
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:52,600
You're going to go along with the collective believing what they're being told, even though it's right.

792
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,120
It's actually a mockery.

793
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,580
I kept saying for many years that you're being mocked.

794
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,620
Like by who?

795
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,060
I'm like, oh, my gosh.

796
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,320
I get a lot of questions like that.

797
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:02,820
By who?

798
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:03,800
Who's they?

799
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:04,680
I'm like, oh, my gosh.

800
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,080
You know what happens when you show up to class without doing your homework?

801
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,140
You look stupid, right?

802
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:08,900
Oh, wait a second.

803
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,940
But even if you did your homework, you'd be stupid.

804
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,600
Anyway, that's another whole other thing.

805
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,080
So it gets, I mean, it's that bad.

806
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:19,980
Well, look at it this way.

807
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,980
If you're a five-year-old and you go to school and, you know, there isn't much homework still,

808
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:30,240
but, you know, everybody else believes in Santa Claus and you don't, you look stupid, right?

809
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,220
But if you believe in Santa Claus, you're stupid, right?

810
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:33,980
Right.

811
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:38,460
That's why I have no problem with them doing History Channel documentaries on, you know,

812
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,280
Where was I somewhere recently?

813
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:47,600
There was some History Channel about a Paleolithic man, like, you know, and the dinosaurs millions of years ago.

814
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:52,860
I said, yeah, this was done by the same people that are going to show you Santa Claus' toy factory in North Pole.

815
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,600
It's the same, you know, category of truth there, right?

816
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,520
And by the way, here's the thing.

817
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:04,260
There might really be a Santa Claus with a toy factory in North Pole for reals.

818
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:06,240
There might be, right?

819
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:11,880
But I'm just saying that is, when you use that as a metaphor, it's categorized as fiction.

820
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,060
Well, I know this.

821
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,980
No fat man in a suit was showing up to drop off toys when I was a kid.

822
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,160
I mean, that didn't happen.

823
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:19,740
Oh, that aspect, yes.

824
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,500
If we lump it together, it's all stupid, yeah.

825
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:22,760
Yeah.

826
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,200
So, but this is what they do.

827
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,100
And they've been bred this way and groomed this way.

828
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:33,960
Now, the breeding is through chemicals and dumb people should have, are encouraged to have babies

829
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:41,260
and people, not necessarily smart, but people that are, quote, unquote, more better in their ways are disencouraged to have,

830
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:45,000
and that disencouragement is self-disencouragement.

831
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,300
It's like, why would you bring a child into this world, right?

832
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,240
And I'm saying this even 100 years ago.

833
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,920
Why would you bring a child into this world?

834
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:55,660
By the way, because the 1920s and the 20s that we have now are very, very similar, right?

835
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:03,800
If you look at what was offered in the 1920s in society, technologically, it was way ahead what it was in the 1890s,

836
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:08,540
even though everything that could have been known was already known by the 1890s, right?

837
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,420
Well, there's all kinds of weird stuff that people don't seem to realize.

838
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:16,740
I'll bring up one of the odd technological things since we were talking about Skype earlier.

839
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:21,080
It's something I was looking at is, you know, on the Jetsons, right?

840
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:24,020
You remember the cartoon, the Jetsons, and it was a big deal.

841
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,260
Oh, look, you know, they have these telephones.

842
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,180
They could put it on their TV, so you got a TV screen to watch people and this and that.

843
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,520
Oh, well, that's something we're going to have in the future.

844
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,020
1920s.

845
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,820
Futurists in the 1920s had that.

846
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:40,980
Well, see, I found it in the 30s, but either way, I found it in the 30s in Germany.

847
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,880
It was actually something that the public even had access to,

848
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:48,880
where you could make these video phone calls, basically, in real time.

849
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,220
It's just too much infrastructure.

850
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,200
It's all about infrastructure.

851
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,200
But they did have it.

852
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,900
They actually had it, though, for a bit.

853
00:38:56,540 --> 00:39:01,080
Well, look, this is a broad brush coverage of the subject.

854
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:01,500
Sure.

855
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,880
Anti-gravity technology exists.

856
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,340
There's 1,000 different ways to do it, what you call anti-levitation.

857
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:07,980
Easy.

858
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,220
It could be put out to the public.

859
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,640
What's it going to do to the infrastructure?

860
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,120
Which lane are you driving in?

861
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,420
Yeah, right.

862
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:18,080
It'll make it very difficult because now you're going to have to have air traffic control, basically.

863
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,840
Completely different concept.

864
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:25,420
Yeah, and even if you made the things so they can't collide would be chaotic even then, right?

865
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,680
So it's all infrastructure.

866
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,540
Yes, most of it is infrastructure to be built.

867
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,020
Not necessarily that, but what kind of infrastructure,

868
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:40,540
how will the infrastructure behave once it's put in place with the mindset of the people that are here now?

869
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:41,920
It won't work.

870
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:46,160
I would think that you could automate it so that, you know, look,

871
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,740
certain people at a certain height would only go here, here, here.

872
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,400
You know what I mean?

873
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:56,280
Like you could control things by height and basically the vehicles, much like the self-driving,

874
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,620
you could probably set it up so that they can't collide with each other, like you were saying.

875
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:05,020
I mean, obviously, things will go wrong now and then, but I mean, I think it could be done.

876
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,140
It's just that it would require, again,

877
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:11,440
It's the mindset of the people won't work, right, with the people that are here now.

878
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,240
You see, that's the ultimate problem, is at the end of the day,

879
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,800
even though it could be made sense of, you know,

880
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,720
very much like when people talk about competing for resources on the planet,

881
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,340
they go, oh, there's not enough resources on the planet, and I go, that's not true.

882
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:29,340
The problem is the distribution of it, and if somebody very pragmatically distributed this stuff

883
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:32,480
and there was no cause for withholding it from anybody else,

884
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:36,100
everybody would have everything they needed, and it would not be a problem.

885
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:40,000
Well, yeah, but the people in charge, who are not really people of the planet,

886
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:43,820
hate the people, not for their behavior.

887
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,580
I'll be honest, I hate most people, not because they're people or human,

888
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,560
but because of the way they behave, and they won't change.

889
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:56,520
Here's the thing, they're amoral, they're apathetic, and they're beyond immoral.

890
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:59,100
Amoral means, you know, not only...

891
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,860
Amoral means you know the difference between right and wrong, you don't give a shit,

892
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:06,860
but the reason why I say they're amoral is because they have access.

893
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:11,500
Perhaps I'm misinforming, because when I hear amoral, I think to myself,

894
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:14,980
there is a lack of moral direction.

895
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:18,240
That as well, right, but they do have access to gain the knowledge,

896
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,780
but they don't want to, and they're apathetic and all this.

897
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,480
See, I would make that more akin to apathy,

898
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:26,280
where you just don't care what direction it goes in at all,

899
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,080
because to be amoral, a lot of people confuse it with, to me,

900
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,960
to be just very nasty and negative morally,

901
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,060
and I'm thinking to myself, no, that's not true,

902
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,460
because if you're amoral, it's, you know, when you A something,

903
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,420
it's absent, basically, right?

904
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:43,940
In essence, it's kind of like that old Christian maxim,

905
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:46,600
it says, I hate the sin, not the sinner, right?

906
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:50,360
Because ultimately, it's the behavior of the person.

907
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,380
You know, someone, however they look, or even smell,

908
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:59,240
it doesn't really, it's not going to affect the overall group

909
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:02,500
as much as how they behave, and that it means speech, action,

910
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,400
and all that, right?

911
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,220
That's enough to actually have people condemned.

912
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,000
It's your behavior.

913
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,640
I mean, why is a guy on death row, and someone is sitting at a desk job?

914
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,760
Well, because the death row difference is behavior.

915
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,880
You see, so, and by the way, humanity is on death row.

916
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,160
They don't know it, though, I mean, but not naturally.

917
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,560
I mean, it's going to be like mop-up crew type stuff, death row, right?

918
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:28,200
And it won't show well in history because it'll look like,

919
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,500
well, it'll be more honest, hopefully, in the future.

920
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:34,260
It won't show like, oh, all these innocent people got wiped out.

921
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:38,340
No, and you'll have to redefine what makes one guilty, right?

922
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,340
Because your model citizen and model human, right,

923
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,560
that was pretty bad.

924
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,440
You know, what they're showing you as a model is not good at all

925
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,780
because of what they support, what they're doing, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

926
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,180
It's a long story, and I've gone over this many, many times.

927
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:02,020
You know, that's where I bring up the subject or the phrase,

928
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,280
have you been on this planet for more than 15 minutes?

929
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,660
Oh, yeah, so you know what's going on here, right?

930
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:10,420
Yeah, but it did take me several years, to be honest with you,

931
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:16,120
to make peace with the idea that quite often the people that are on the surface,

932
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:21,280
you know, like what is the weirdest thing, right, is the Dennis Raiders,

933
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,220
you know, the BTK killer type guys, the this, the that, the third thing,

934
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:31,040
are often conducting themselves perfectly fine throughout a lot of other society.

935
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:31,780
You know what I'm saying?

936
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:36,500
It's not like they're sticking out as a sore thumb constantly

937
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,240
and calling attention to themselves.

938
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,220
They actually are, you know what, they're your church leader.

939
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,520
They're your, you know.

940
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:46,240
Oh, yeah, but all that stuff is so twisted and backwards, right?

941
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:46,780
Yeah.

942
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,020
It's all backwards.

943
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:49,740
I think, where was we?

944
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:52,980
We were speaking, I said, what do you mean about just look at it 180 degrees?

945
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,200
Well, it doesn't mean you get everything if you flip what they're telling you

946
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,320
regarding anything, really, 180 degrees.

947
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,420
It's true because how are you going to get the information reversed, right?

948
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:04,680
Right.

949
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,880
What if they tell you a building and 180 degrees is no building?

950
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:09,260
No, no.

951
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:13,520
What I mean is if the overall subject matter, if they tell you it's terrorism,

952
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:14,980
that means it's not terrorism.

953
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:21,320
But if they tell you it's a exercise, it was probably terrorism, you know, most likely.

954
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:25,020
And I use that as an example, and I can't really talk about it,

955
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,920
but how many times have you heard of the reporting,

956
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:32,860
downtown L.A. there are Black Hawk helicopters flying low for the past three hours

957
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:35,280
and no one's telling us why, and the next day the Pentagon says,

958
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:37,720
it was an exercise, right?

959
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,000
Bullshit, right?

960
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,840
That goes back to what's the, you know,

961
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:43,980
what the difference between genius and stupidity is, right?

962
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:46,000
So these people have no limits.

963
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,480
I mean, in other words, genius has limits and stupidity doesn't.

964
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:54,800
So there's plenty of people like that internationally and nationally

965
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,860
that try to do dumb things that are found out,

966
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:01,760
and then it's like we don't really care what they do, you know, to the public,

967
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,660
but it'll make us look bad, so let's try to stop it.

968
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:05,560
And they usually do.

969
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:09,180
The only weird exception to that over the past, like, say, 20 years that I've seen

970
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:13,760
is the Boston bombing situation where that was wild.

971
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:17,520
Yeah, the smoke bomb that they blew off and the guy with the legs already.

972
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:21,120
Yeah, that was about Kennedy Library getting a fire, wasn't it?

973
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,480
Well, that was part of what went on, but then the strangest thing was,

974
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,520
you know, they're going, okay, this is terrorism,

975
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:29,740
and they basically locked down not just the city of Boston,

976
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:33,320
but, I mean, the whole, like, half of the state they locked down.

977
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:34,080
Yeah.

978
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,380
And then every time they encountered these guys,

979
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:39,060
it turned into, like, you know, this crazy shootout.

980
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,560
And allegedly they had done this with pressure cooker.

981
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,720
I mean, the whole thing.

982
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:44,460
Oh, yeah.

983
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:45,660
I saw it.

984
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:49,540
I was in a Vietnamese restaurant when it happened, and there were some military people.

985
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:50,860
I said, look, that's a smoke bomb.

986
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,880
It's just a pressure, not a pressure cooker,

987
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:55,680
but one of these concussion bombs that they use in training.

988
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:56,120
Yeah.

989
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,580
It doesn't hurt anyone.

990
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,480
And they were like, yeah, it is.

991
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,860
And then I said, well, they're talking about,

992
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:06,580
they're pulling something else is going on, something else is going on.

993
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:12,040
The 9-11 is an interesting one because even the Boston bombing and all these things,

994
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:18,340
they usually have Muppets go and do the job because anyone that's in the intelligence agency

995
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:21,400
or they hire, they're going to say, oh, man, this is going to be on TV,

996
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,380
and it's going to be used, so I don't want to do it, send whatever.

997
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:26,100
So they usually end up having a bunch of Muppets,

998
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,760
like the worst people in their groups, like they did 9-11,

999
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:35,000
what you saw on TV, even the airplanes and all that, the Boston bombing,

1000
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:38,900
even the Kennedy thing, the way they botched that evidence and all that.

1001
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:41,860
They didn't send, I think, their best guys to run that operation,

1002
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:44,320
but the best guys were on standby, you know what I mean?

1003
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:44,900
Of course.

1004
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:46,140
Yeah.

1005
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:48,500
Well, that's the unique thing about that.

1006
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,840
A lot of people think that they send in the elite team first.

1007
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:55,980
No, they send in a functional team, and the elite team is the one that backs up the functional team.

1008
00:46:56,660 --> 00:47:01,560
They're just good enough to 90% get the job done.

1009
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:05,660
It won't look pretty, but it's enough for the public to buy it.

1010
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:10,040
Right, and it's messy enough that it doesn't look like a well-oiled machine,

1011
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,580
and it's purposely that way,

1012
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,480
but you've got guys who can actually get things done really efficiently behind them

1013
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,900
so that in case anything goes that hand wrong, that's who cleans it up.

1014
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:27,080
I brought up 9-11 because that was a real screw-up, and it's hard to discuss this unless you know.

1015
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,920
They blew the North Tower out first.

1016
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:34,260
They said, well, there's no plane or missiles or anything,

1017
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,400
but they blew the side of the building out first.

1018
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:42,320
That was a big screw-up because then you can't, if they were to pull that building,

1019
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:46,000
well, if it was supposedly due to fire, it's a function of time,

1020
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,900
so the one that burned longer should come down first, right?

1021
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:49,400
Yeah.

1022
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,960
So they should have blown the South Tower first, right,

1023
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,980
because that's the one that came down first, the one that got hit with the plane second.

1024
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:00,840
They could not bring down the North Tower first because it got hit first

1025
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:04,980
because then it could damage the delivery tunnel for the nuke in the second building

1026
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:10,240
because these are, you know, and also they're a drive-by-wire that's not radio-controlled.

1027
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:12,560
It's a 2959 zero time.

1028
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:15,700
The device, I said nuke, it's called a zero box,

1029
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:24,480
and the time for civil, these devices that are made for civilian use and demolitions,

1030
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:31,160
it's a zero time, it's 2959, 29 minutes, 59 seconds, zero time, which is exactly 30,

1031
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:36,720
and the area where they go off and they detonate is called ground zero,

1032
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:42,160
so the zeros in the name, so they really, really mucked that one up really bad,

1033
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:43,640
but guess what?

1034
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:46,440
They still pulled it off big time.

1035
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:48,500
You'll never hear what I just said.

1036
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,460
Dmitry Kaluzov will say it.

1037
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:57,380
One thing Dmitry has never really brought up that I've mentioned to him more than one occasion is the smell.

1038
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:58,640
Is he still doing stuff?

1039
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:00,720
Yeah, he is, but in Russian.

1040
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:07,220
He's, I think, riding the Ukraine-Russian wave and commenting on that,

1041
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:12,160
but I think the 9-11 thing, it's very limited.

1042
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,640
It's a limited thing, and I don't think he could expand on more than that.

1043
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:16,240
You can.

1044
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,400
You can.

1045
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:22,220
You can actually do a lot more with the 9-11, but it doesn't matter at this point.

1046
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:25,020
You know what I say?

1047
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:29,100
The main purpose of 9-11, yeah, they absconded with gold.

1048
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:29,800
Yes, they did.

1049
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:36,960
They wanted to bring in the Homeland Security, which was drafted in 1992 by Hugo Ballestieri, right, in Italy,

1050
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:39,360
and then after he drafted that, they arrested him.

1051
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:39,600
Right.

1052
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:40,220
Anyway.

1053
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:44,160
You're talking about the basics for the Patriot Act is what you're talking about, right?

1054
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,020
Right, yeah.

1055
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:49,020
It was done by the Italian, the guys like the, what was the Italian underground there?

1056
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,860
They were blowing up buildings all the time in Italy.

1057
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,460
There was a group in Italy.

1058
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,100
Oh, yeah.

1059
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:59,600
You're talking about, it was a stay-behind thing for the UN.

1060
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,660
What is the name of that organization?

1061
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:04,280
Yeah, it was an organization.

1062
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:05,560
Yeah.

1063
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:07,600
Yeah, that group.

1064
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:10,660
So, anyway, so they brought all this stuff.

1065
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:11,880
That's not why they did it.

1066
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:17,060
What they did was to give you a very clear message, you, the American people and the world,

1067
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:23,660
that the U.S. military will do absolutely nothing to protect the territory known as the United States of America.

1068
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:24,580
That's it.

1069
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:28,240
That's the main message, right, internally.

1070
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:30,520
You know, in other words, do you get it?

1071
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:35,060
It's like a joke might be about a certain guy who walks into a bar and says,

1072
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:37,460
has nothing to do with being in a bar.

1073
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,960
The punchline is usually a punchline on its own, right?

1074
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:43,560
You know, a monkey walks into a bar and says, I want whatever.

1075
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:45,320
It has nothing to do about being in a bar.

1076
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,180
The bar is just the setup.

1077
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,920
The setup was what they showed people.

1078
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:55,400
But the main point, the underlying point is that the U.S. military is not here to protect the U.S., let's say, of America at all.

1079
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,720
And I made this point earlier on.

1080
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:02,380
I said, if the people had any modicum of reason after 9-11,

1081
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:05,640
they'd say, okay, what we have to do is completely disband the military,

1082
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:09,760
and if we have allies, and since we have allies, quote-unquote, narrow quotes,

1083
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:15,500
bring them in as an interim military temporarily, right, to protect the country,

1084
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:20,500
because obviously the one we have can't do shit, right, and then redo the military.

1085
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,100
Was that done?

1086
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:23,060
No.

1087
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,240
It went the opposite way.

1088
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:26,560
It, you know, venerated the military.

1089
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,320
It was like, oh, my gosh, these people are going the wrong way.

1090
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,240
Oh, wait a second.

1091
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:34,360
You know, that's what you figure out when you've been on this planet for 16 minutes, not 15 minutes, right?

1092
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:36,140
You need an extra minute for that?

1093
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:38,320
An extra minute to figure that one out.

1094
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,060
Oh, my gosh.

1095
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,800
It's so ridiculous at this point.

1096
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:46,440
Wait, didn't I, you've heard me discuss time ended in 1998, right, so we're in the credits, right?

1097
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:46,780
Yeah.

1098
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:48,720
Credits don't have to make sense.

1099
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:49,680
No, not at all.

1100
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:51,240
They just have to note what.

1101
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:51,940
In alphabetical order.

1102
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:52,400
Right.

1103
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:55,200
And Gladio is the name you were thinking of before.

1104
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,180
Gladio, yes.

1105
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:58,220
It's the Gladio group.

1106
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:06,200
Yeah, which is part of another big group that comes out of Belgium and Sweden and Switzerland, and they're all.

1107
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,220
It's like the Masons.

1108
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:11,340
Yeah, but Gladio was directly tied to Bologna, Italy, the train station and all that.

1109
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:12,460
That's why you brought it up.

1110
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:13,000
In 1980.

1111
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:18,200
Gladio is the group, yeah, that was the notorious Italian group.

1112
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:18,900
Gladio, yeah.

1113
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:22,020
But that was the thing going on since post-World War II.

1114
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:30,680
Yeah, and they were supposedly rebelling because it was illegal to have secret societies, and even though they're all part, you know.

1115
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:34,400
Right, and they were allegedly the communist terrorists, right?

1116
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:35,100
Yeah.

1117
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:35,740
So, yeah.

1118
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:36,400
Oh, my gosh.

1119
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:36,820
But that was.

1120
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:37,360
Such a mess.

1121
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:38,400
B.S., but yeah.

1122
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,440
Such a big mess, a very big mess.

1123
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:50,980
So the whole point of Greek speak essentially is when you come across something, whatever that something might be, ask yourself, when did this something come into being?

1124
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:52,280
Is there anything about it?

1125
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:54,360
Is there anything more about it that I can learn?

1126
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:57,760
And you'll have all the people, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1127
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,020
Hold on, stop your yap.

1128
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:04,640
Can I find what you just told me in the reference books about what's been written and held in Time Memorial?

1129
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,440
Will I find what you just said in there and where?

1130
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:09,860
Right?

1131
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,520
Then you can listen to their blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, right?

1132
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,260
You see what I mean?

1133
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:16,180
No, I always.

1134
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:20,160
Yeah, whenever somebody starts talking about these things, even when they talk about Gladio, right?

1135
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:25,940
Gladio has turned into now people have applied it to other things and stuff like that.

1136
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:28,660
And they say, oh, it's actually Gladio II, Gladio III, Gladio.

1137
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:29,780
I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1138
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,360
You know, you're putting numbers on this.

1139
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,800
What are we talking about here?

1140
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,060
Give me a reference, a point at which.

1141
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,840
Or let's go back to the religions, right?

1142
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:39,440
Yeah.

1143
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:44,400
You know, I talked to a very religious Orthodox Jewish guy.

1144
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:45,880
He goes to the temple every morning.

1145
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:48,720
And I try to have a talk about prophecy.

1146
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:53,960
And he says, oh, yeah, well, Elijah is going to come down from heaven with the temple.

1147
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,700
You know, and I said the stone temple made of stone.

1148
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:56,960
And heaven is going to descend.

1149
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:57,580
Yeah, yeah.

1150
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:59,500
And then I was like, where do you get that?

1151
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,700
Where do you get that from?

1152
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,820
Where does it say?

1153
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:05,360
In your book.

1154
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,940
Where do you get that?

1155
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:12,280
Because literally you're talking about a guy showing up with a giant building, right?

1156
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:15,500
I'm like, okay, okay, that's fine.

1157
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,780
I mean, look, it's possible, right?

1158
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:18,540
Anything's possible.

1159
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:19,740
But where do you get that?

1160
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:20,900
Right.

1161
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:24,700
Well, where is this idea that is fairly elaborate?

1162
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:25,700
Yeah.

1163
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:27,640
He says, yeah, I'll show you on Yahoo.

1164
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:28,820
And I say, I'm like, not really.

1165
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,500
There's some reference to some things coming down, but not like that.

1166
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:32,520
Oh, my gosh.

1167
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:34,100
Or the virus thing, you know.

1168
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:38,680
There's a guy that did a hit piece on Ken Wheeler with magnetism.

1169
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,960
I researched Ken Wheeler, see what he was up to recently.

1170
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:46,180
Some academic did a hit piece, and he had magnetism.

1171
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:48,560
He says, well, here's some magnetism, and he showed multiple poles.

1172
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,200
This is a nano thing, and it's very expensive to get this picture.

1173
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:54,900
I'm like, oh, it's just as expensive as the cartoons of viruses, I guess, right?

1174
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,120
I mean, these people are so ridiculous.

1175
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,820
Well, you do have to pay an artist to render something, don't you?

1176
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:00,720
Yeah, yeah.

1177
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:02,740
Creative bullshit.

1178
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:06,080
So the whole thing is it's very, very, very simple.

1179
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:11,100
It doesn't mean you have to be, what do you call it, when you really get into a subject, not a researcher.

1180
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:12,620
A fictionato.

1181
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,720
You know, when you really get into something.

1182
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:17,980
Anyways, a couple of terms for it, I guess.

1183
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,260
Well, you have expertise.

1184
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:22,500
You're someone who is a...

1185
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:27,120
Yeah, you delve into it in a more than normal, right?

1186
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:31,360
I could make a lascivious comment about that, too, but I won't.

1187
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:37,620
So the idea here is that people will criticize that because, remember, you live in a society,

1188
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:42,700
whoever you is, that hates intelligent people.

1189
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:47,940
And proof of that is Hollywood and your government are the same thing.

1190
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:52,620
How are, quote-unquote, people that are well-studied portrayed in Hollywood?

1191
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:57,540
Nerds, bookworms, the guy you kick in the groin, right?

1192
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,440
The jock is the good guy, right?

1193
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:02,500
Unless you want to make a comedy, and then you make revenge of the nerds, right?

1194
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:03,140
Yeah.

1195
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:09,920
So you're always being shown, portrayed as being negative, but they tell you to get a college degree.

1196
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:17,820
I recently, even an academic, I usually set them up because their whole life is about being set up, right?

1197
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:20,300
So I set them up.

1198
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,160
I said, you know, the education system is faltering.

1199
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:23,780
They're like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1200
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,800
So as a matter of fact, it's more than faltering.

1201
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:26,860
I think it's a disaster.

1202
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:27,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1203
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:33,640
And it's such a bad disaster that I think it actually does irreparable damage beyond the eighth grade.

1204
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:34,340
Yes, it does.

1205
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:38,620
So I said, all right, so you're a doctorate, and you're going to be teaching at the university.

1206
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:44,860
So when you showed up at university, they put some kind of pixie dust on you to remedy that damage that you get after the eighth grade?

1207
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:47,620
How dare you talk to an academic that way?

1208
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:51,000
So it's like, oh, my gosh.

1209
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,740
So you know what you're doing at the university, right?

1210
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:55,000
It's psychological terrorism on the public, right?

1211
00:56:56,860 --> 00:57:00,020
Well, you can't tell a tenured person that, right?

1212
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:04,240
That's a protection when you can't be fired now because you've been tenured.

1213
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:08,060
I never understood that.

1214
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:11,500
If you actually read a degree diploma, have you ever read it?

1215
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,260
It's all presumptive.

1216
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:19,660
It says the trustees of the university believe that this person has enough credits to earn this degree.

1217
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:20,420
It's like, what?

1218
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:22,920
It's all presumption.

1219
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:24,080
There's nothing there, dude.

1220
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:24,860
Credit.

1221
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:26,180
Oh, my gosh.

1222
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,280
You're granted a title.

1223
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:32,120
Well, it's even they believe the trustees of the university believe.

1224
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:35,040
In the word, it changes somewhat.

1225
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:37,060
But it's all presumptive.

1226
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:48,460
Oh, the other thing is how many PhDs, professors, doctors, or whatever, when the Soviet Union came down, came to the U.S.,

1227
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:53,020
could not use their PhD and they worked at the baggage checkout at Safeway or something.

1228
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:54,040
A lot.

1229
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:56,320
I ran into some of them, by the way.

1230
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:59,560
This Polish guy says he was a doctor back there in Poland.

1231
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:03,360
I don't believe him because he's the baggage checkout at the supermarket.

1232
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:08,740
I said, yeah, he is because when the government goes down, your degree goes down means nothing because it's attached to the state.

1233
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:09,860
Oh, yeah.

1234
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:15,800
I had a couple of guys from Pakistan that were working with me, right, in the 90s.

1235
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:20,460
Just before 9-11, they had gotten out and all that.

1236
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:24,360
Yeah, I gave them jobs as guest attendants.

1237
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:29,520
Yeah, because people don't understand that your degree is a function of the state.

1238
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:32,620
When the state goes down, so does your degree.

1239
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,220
It means nothing.

1240
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:37,400
It's almost like the same thing happened to the military in the Soviet Union.

1241
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:42,680
If you were a ranking officer or whatever and it goes away, you no longer exist.

1242
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:45,980
You mean those benefits and all those things don't exist.

1243
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:46,800
They go with it.

1244
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:48,200
It's amazing.

1245
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:52,360
A lot of people thought that was like Cold War prejudice with the Soviets.

1246
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:55,900
That's why I bring up the Pakistanis because it was interesting.

1247
00:58:56,020 --> 00:59:00,360
At the time, I'm talking about, if you remember, there was the military overthrow of the government.

1248
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:04,440
Well, Pakistan is one of those weird places in between.

1249
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:07,140
It's an artificial, like where they all are, but anyway.

1250
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:11,540
Yeah, but the thing is, if you remember, Musharraf there, he had taken over the government.

1251
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:16,180
As soon as that happened, all of these people that had these degrees and whatever,

1252
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:22,640
if they weren't recertified by him because he took over the government, you had nothing.

1253
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:24,600
Right, you got annulled.

1254
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:27,140
It's known that internationally as well.

1255
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:31,420
Automatically, it's just like when a country loses a war, its currency goes to zero.

1256
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:36,160
One of the guys, actually, who was pumping gas for me noticed my daughter was sick.

1257
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:37,360
She was with me at the time.

1258
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:40,600
My then wife comes to pick me up at work.

1259
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:42,660
There you go.

1260
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:44,860
I'm like, well, yeah, baby's a little sick.

1261
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:45,460
I don't know.

1262
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:46,460
I haven't looked at her yet.

1263
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:48,280
He's like, well, can I?

1264
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:48,900
I said, well, wait.

1265
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,040
I know you were a doctor, but he's like, yeah, I was a pediatrician, actually.

1266
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:54,000
Okay, go ahead and take a look at her.

1267
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:56,920
He probably could, probably better than the ones over here.

1268
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:58,460
Actually, yeah, exactly.

1269
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:03,500
He was better than the person I had already taken her to, and she was still sick.

1270
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:07,020
He goes, look, all you got to do is this and this, and it'll clear up.

1271
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:07,780
Two days.

1272
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:10,380
I said, okay, and I followed his directions.

1273
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:12,060
Yeah, my daughter was fine.

1274
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:14,880
But I bet he didn't know about the biological vacuum, though.

1275
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:16,240
I don't know.

1276
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:17,240
I didn't get that far.

1277
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:18,240
I know.

1278
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:19,160
I'm just being facetious.

1279
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,380
Of course, he didn't know.

1280
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:23,240
Well, no, but the other doctors are telling me about, well, she needs antibiotics.

1281
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:25,040
She's got ear infection, all this other crap.

1282
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:26,900
I'm like, yeah, they're not doctors.

1283
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:27,980
They suck.

1284
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:31,560
They see redness in the ear because they look in with the little light.

1285
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:35,820
I don't know if you've ever seen a baby when they go to a doctor because they can't talk.

1286
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:38,220
So the doctor's got to actually, you know, look at things.

1287
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:41,220
They're idiots, though, the medical people here.

1288
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:45,180
I mean, you really have to know what you're doing on your own.

1289
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:48,300
And the reason you go to them is because it's something that you can't do.

1290
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:53,680
But if you ask them for, like, if you know nothing about what's going on, you're at their mercy.

1291
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:56,640
And it's, yeah, you might be good at that.

1292
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:00,300
If you're good at Vegas, like rolling dice and stuff, it might work well for you.

1293
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:03,660
Yeah, but see, in 1999, okay, my daughter couldn't speak yet.

1294
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,560
And I'm just like, okay, I don't know what to do with her because clearly she's ill.

1295
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:11,700
You know, so I take her to a doctor, and the doctor's, like, giving me stuff to give to her.

1296
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:12,560
And I'm like, ah, crap.

1297
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:18,060
And then meanwhile, the guy who was pumping gas for me gave me exactly what to do, and he took care of it.

1298
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:19,800
Yeah, there's a lot of remedies.

1299
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,200
But here, you don't mind going a little bit more.

1300
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:23,600
Was she breastfed?

1301
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:25,460
No, she wasn't.

1302
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:26,880
Okay, all right, that makes sense.

1303
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:28,360
Was it the left ear or the right ear?

1304
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:32,240
It would be both most of the time.

1305
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:35,020
But mostly, it would be the right ear, mostly.

1306
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:36,220
Oh, really?

1307
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:36,580
Okay.

1308
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:42,340
So it was a blockage from the energy going up into the body.

1309
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:43,560
Yeah, interesting.

1310
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:46,240
By the way, one day I'll get into it more.

1311
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:48,460
The left side of the body, the energy goes down.

1312
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:51,300
The right side of the body, the energy goes up, both men and women.

1313
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:53,980
The only difference is the way it spirals.

1314
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:58,160
On the man, viewed from the top down, the energy spirals clockwise.

1315
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:02,140
And on the woman, it would be counterclockwise, viewing from the crown of the head.

1316
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:05,280
If you're standing on a balcony looking down at someone, that way.

1317
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:06,900
It's the only energetic difference.

1318
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:11,900
And there's more energetic difference below the waist, the way it goes down once it leaves the body.

1319
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:17,860
But generally, the left side of the body in any manifestation is energies moving downward.

1320
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:23,240
The right side of the body is energies moving upward, either deficiencies or too much.

1321
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:28,080
And they're either deficiencies, the manifestations, you know, the sicknesses or whatever.

1322
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,780
When I say manifestations, isn't that part of the body?

1323
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:34,220
Or the body's creating a block because there's too much.

1324
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:39,620
Let's say you have too much energy going up that it could harm the body if it discharges it.

1325
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:40,860
It will put a block there.

1326
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:41,680
So it's stopping.

1327
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:42,800
That block could be a sore.

1328
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:43,480
It could be internal.

1329
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:44,200
It could be a tumor.

1330
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:45,100
It could be external.

1331
01:02:45,820 --> 01:02:46,180
Right?

1332
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:48,900
Or it could be a deficiency, so you have to know how to read both.

1333
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:54,780
The interesting thing about this is you learn about this by watching everything around you.

1334
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:59,340
You know how the trees and the things were plants and stuff were made before man, right?

1335
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:00,740
Right.

1336
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:02,500
And then the animals and all this, right?

1337
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:05,280
Well, according to every story, that's the way it was, yeah.

1338
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:06,220
Yeah, yeah.

1339
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:09,920
So that actually can be taken as an archetype.

1340
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:18,060
In other words, the same – it's kind of like – in other words, the same, not blueprint, but the archetypes.

1341
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:25,160
The way things move, grow, die, maintain strength or weakness can be seen in the plant and animal world.

1342
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:28,680
Those same energies are in the human body, right?

1343
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:30,560
Give an example real quick.

1344
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:35,940
You have a tree that comes out of the ground, a plant that comes out of the ground, right?

1345
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:40,620
Certain times of year, not counting perennials and evergreens and things like that.

1346
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:41,840
Those have a different energy.

1347
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:45,920
They come out of the ground at a certain time of year, and they pump all this material.

1348
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,260
They form all this material up into the sky, right?

1349
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:50,340
And they rely on energy from the sky also.

1350
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:56,420
So let's take a fruit tree real quick, and this will tie it all together about energies going up and down in blockages.

1351
01:03:57,060 --> 01:04:02,920
So that's energy coming out of the earth manifesting into a physical form known as a fruit, an apple tree, let's say, right?

1352
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:10,100
But what's interesting, the food that we use from the tree, the apple, it's all manifestation.

1353
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:16,300
It manifests physically from all these manifestations driving from the earth, you know, up, upward energy.

1354
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:22,540
But what's interesting, when the fruit grows, right after the blossom forms, it's going on its way where?

1355
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:24,560
Down, right?

1356
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:28,820
You notice as the blossom falls off and the fruit forms, it's going down.

1357
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:30,020
It forms downward.

1358
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:34,720
As the apple gets larger, it keeps forming in the downward direction, right?

1359
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:37,860
As a matter of fact, too many apples on the tree, the tree kind of sags down, right?

1360
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:38,180
Right.

1361
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:41,220
And then eventually when the fruit ripens, what happens?

1362
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:41,960
Where does the apple go?

1363
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:42,740
Does it go up or down?

1364
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:44,620
It's Newton on the head, doesn't it?

1365
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:45,700
It goes down, yeah.

1366
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:45,960
Right.

1367
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:53,120
Well, you know, an interesting, look, a little punch line on that story with my daughter and the Pakistani guy is this.

1368
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:58,200
You know, come to think of it, that's the first guy I remember saying, basically, eat seasonally,

1369
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:05,480
because that's part of what he told me to do, which was to feed her something that was seasonally available.

1370
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,460
Oh, that's a big deal.

1371
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:08,280
But that's common.

1372
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:13,800
That's a common big deal, just like keeping lawful time was a common big deal.

1373
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:16,680
Yeah, but no American doctor would ever bother to say that.

1374
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:19,200
Well, that's because the Americans don't bother.

1375
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:19,640
Right.

1376
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:23,740
The doctors, remember, are accommodating the people, right?

1377
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:24,000
Right.

1378
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:26,940
Give me an example.

1379
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:30,200
If you've got a witch doctor, let's use a cartoon, Bugs Bunny cartoon,

1380
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:38,360
witch doctor with the bone in their nose and their faces painted with a spear and monkey skulls hanging from his waist,

1381
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,980
and you brought him, you know, the American goes to the doctor.

1382
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:45,620
The doctor will see you now, and the American goes in there, or the Canadian or a Westerner or whatever,

1383
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:48,100
and he sees a doctor like that, they're going to freak out and run.

1384
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:49,580
They're not going to listen to anything he has to say.

1385
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:49,840
Right.

1386
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:53,520
Because the way he looks does not accommodate the American mindset.

1387
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:54,700
It accommodates wherever.

1388
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:58,780
Another culture, you see, I'm using that as an extreme example, right?

1389
01:05:58,820 --> 01:05:59,280
Right, right.

1390
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:03,120
So what they do is no matter what these, quote-unquote, medical technicians,

1391
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:07,220
they're calling them doctors way over-gratiating them.

1392
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:09,700
Okay, let's just say doctors.

1393
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:11,280
They're simply accommodating.

1394
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:13,200
The people are totally happy.

1395
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:14,340
The guy doesn't know anything.

1396
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:16,460
He's just, I'm going to give you what they call script, right?

1397
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:18,260
Here you go, a script prescription.

1398
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:21,600
And the people are so, oh, we're so glad we saw the doctor who gave us this prescription.

1399
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:22,800
They're so happy.

1400
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:23,600
Everybody's happy.

1401
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:25,240
Everybody's happy.

1402
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:27,300
The doctor's happy for not having to do anything.

1403
01:06:27,740 --> 01:06:30,520
He's lazy, but they make him work a lot anyway if you're in a hospital.

1404
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:34,640
And the people are lazy, but everybody's happy, right?

1405
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:36,520
But they're happily in misery.

1406
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:39,260
Their quality of life goes down and down and down,

1407
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:41,520
and they blame it on something else, something else, right?

1408
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:42,180
Right.

1409
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:44,900
But it was just interesting to me that that was one of the solutions

1410
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:48,480
that was presented to me from a guy who just had some knowledge,

1411
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:51,460
took a look at the situation, and said, well, here's what's going wrong.

1412
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:54,000
And that's what he told me to do.

1413
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:54,820
Yeah.

1414
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:57,860
There was something else, too, to it, but it was about, you know,

1415
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:00,080
like allowing a certain amount of air or whatever.

1416
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:01,380
I mean, you know, stuff like this.

1417
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:06,280
But it was all this really, again, stuff that I would have never heard from, you know,

1418
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:08,440
an Americanized medical person.

1419
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:12,100
Because, yeah, it's, you know, the U.S.

1420
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:15,020
Here's the thing about the American Revolution,

1421
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:17,680
which is the revolution that really wasn't, but it was.

1422
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:22,420
It's kind of like saying the Iraq War was not really a war, but it was, right?

1423
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:26,500
Or this Ukraine War with Russia is not really a war, but it is, you see?

1424
01:07:26,620 --> 01:07:27,960
So you've got to look at it that way.

1425
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:30,740
It was to set up things a certain way,

1426
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:34,360
so because the people who were involved behind that idea,

1427
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:37,480
they had long-term visions, you know?

1428
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:40,240
Academics like to say that a lot, by the way.

1429
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:41,200
They have their catchphrases.

1430
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:45,320
Oh, this program has a long-term vision.

1431
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:47,300
By the way, if you know any academic idiots,

1432
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:50,020
they use that word a lot, vision and all that.

1433
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:50,900
So, yeah.

1434
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:55,980
So, yeah, this is a big, big, big stage play,

1435
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,440
and the thing is, fortunately, here's the fortunate part,

1436
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:04,520
that your life is too short to enjoy enough misery to see it clearly.

1437
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:09,160
Enjoy it, because it's designed and made to be miserable.

1438
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,500
I actually put in the chat,

1439
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:15,880
if you know you're here because you stepped in some cosmic shit

1440
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:17,840
or stepped in shit, that's why you're here,

1441
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:20,660
well, Greek-speak has a lot to offer to you, right?

1442
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:21,520
There you go.

1443
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,899
Basically, cosmically, if you're here on Earth,

1444
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:27,279
you stepped in shit, cosmically, like big deal.

1445
01:08:27,399 --> 01:08:28,120
It's a big deal.

1446
01:08:28,279 --> 01:08:30,859
Later on, if you get out there, wherever there is,

1447
01:08:30,899 --> 01:08:33,399
and you say you were born and lived and died on Earth,

1448
01:08:33,479 --> 01:08:34,720
they're going to be like, oh, my gosh.

1449
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,840
Half the people in the bar or wherever you are

1450
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:38,200
are going to laugh their ass off,

1451
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:39,160
and amongst the group say,

1452
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:41,000
what the hell did you do to screw up so bad?

1453
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:42,580
They sent you there, or you went there,

1454
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:45,640
and the other half of the group will be like, tell us about it.

1455
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:48,240
That place is notorious in a very subtle way, right?

1456
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:50,220
It's like death by a thousand cuts.

1457
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:53,220
It's not like a deliberate hell planet

1458
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:56,460
where you're standing in molten rock and not dying,

1459
01:08:56,779 --> 01:08:58,100
molten lava and torture.

1460
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,859
But it is, actually, in small ways.

1461
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:05,939
So the whole thing is also brought up while there's no free will.

1462
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:10,120
And I say that just to get a very well-grounded point

1463
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:14,819
on how they tell you you have rights and you're in a free country

1464
01:09:14,819 --> 01:09:15,260
and all this.

1465
01:09:15,399 --> 01:09:16,100
None of that is true.

1466
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:17,779
None of that is even actual,

1467
01:09:17,939 --> 01:09:19,040
because it's all programming.

1468
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:22,660
The worst slave is the one that's told that he's not a slave, right?

1469
01:09:22,819 --> 01:09:26,080
But there is free will when you learn to dance between the raindrops.

1470
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:29,760
There is free will when you see that it's all about programming.

1471
01:09:29,979 --> 01:09:32,000
And once you know it's all about programming,

1472
01:09:32,260 --> 01:09:33,500
well, then what do you look for?

1473
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:36,300
The part where you can exercise whatever free will you have.

1474
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:36,920
You see?
