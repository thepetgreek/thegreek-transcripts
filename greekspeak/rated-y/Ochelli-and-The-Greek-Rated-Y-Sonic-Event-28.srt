1
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,410
Sonic Event 28, Ocelli in the Greek, rated Y.

2
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,230
Yeah, I still keep announcing that at the beginning, whatever.

3
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:32,470
Here we are once again, and I appreciate you guys for tuning in and doing so and all that.

4
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:41,690
I did get a note about the Chatango, and I will go through your comments and suggestion, I guess, that's included in that note.

5
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:49,810
Just to let you guys know, I do read the emails when you send them, and you can do that by clicking on the email logo or whatever it is,

6
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:56,890
the icon on my website if you want, and email me directly, or send to blindjfkresearcher at gmail.com.

7
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:03,670
That's my personal email, and if there are questions, comments, or concerns, I do read them all.

8
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,210
Anyways, getting to what else is happening.

9
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:11,550
There's things going on in the chat, and I've got to start where I've got to start.

10
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:12,590
Greek, how are you doing tonight?

11
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,070
I'm doing all right.

12
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,490
I just want to mention I'm staring at the monitor.

13
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:24,690
I just got the date up, just the home page, and we're going on the first day of the fourth month, and I see 6-3-23.

14
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:30,450
So for the Pope's work schedule, it's the third or the fourth or the third, right?

15
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,330
And you can see the time drift.

16
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,470
It's not that much, three, four days?

17
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,330
Yeah, it's still pretty tight.

18
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:38,190
It's close.

19
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,270
It's still pretty tight.

20
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,830
I mean, at one point, we were kind of close to lawful time.

21
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:42,970
They did cross over.

22
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,090
They kind of converged, right?

23
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:51,330
Yeah, well, two months, most three months out of the year, they get really close, and they drift again.

24
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,430
But that's not the point.

25
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:57,370
The point is, you know, why, you know?

26
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,710
Well, here's the other thing.

27
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:06,030
The months always tend to lean towards starting around a full moon anyway, so there's your hint, right?

28
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:06,690
There you go.

29
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,470
So, yeah.

30
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:14,530
Yeah, you mentioned in the chat not a lot of stuff about other things other than water.

31
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:15,970
I try to be active in there.

32
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:25,370
I've been going to the laptop or the computer often lately for reference materials, like looking at just reference stuff, you know,

33
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,790
different schedules in terms of, like, industrial stuff, you know, materials,

34
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:35,130
and I'll check the chat while I'm sitting down looking at –

35
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,810
I don't know if anybody's familiar with McMaster Car.

36
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,430
It's an industrial supply warehouse, and they sell to anyone.

37
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,450
They have everything there.

38
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:50,690
So let's say you imagine some kind of material like, you know, foam, you know, like the foam in a mattress or, you know, foam, whatever.

39
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,630
Let's say you wanted to get some foam.

40
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,430
Instead of made out of urethane stuff, you wanted it made out of aluminum.

41
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,590
Take aluminum foam.

42
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,610
You go to McMaster Car, aluminum foam.

43
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,050
Holy shit.

44
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,930
They got four different sizes.

45
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,050
You're like, which one do you want?

46
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,350
I'm like, oh, my gosh, you know.

47
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:07,150
You know what I mean?

48
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:07,750
Right.

49
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,150
They've got everything.

50
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:13,710
So just when I say references, you know, I just put – give you an example of what I mean.

51
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:14,050
Right.

52
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:18,750
I mean, unless you're going to forge metal and things for yourself, I mean, you're going to have to go for supplies somewhere.

53
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:29,770
I mean, you were talking about that place with the wire, what, a couple of weeks ago, I guess it was, where you had to go to get the silver, right?

54
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,090
Oh, yeah.

55
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,650
Well, that's the funny thing.

56
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,550
You'd think it would be something common.

57
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,190
It's hard to find.

58
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,810
I think there's maybe – well, there's a dozen places that talk about it, but you can't get it from them.

59
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:42,310
Right.

60
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,350
Well, and isn't that the way it goes?

61
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,930
You know, people talk about a lot of things, but you can't actually get the good information from them

62
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,790
or the good whatever material from them.

63
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,070
It's just the way of the world, it seems like.

64
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,750
Even if they're talking about it, they don't have it, right?

65
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:56,870
Sure, yeah.

66
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:00,490
But it's back to the – well, yeah, do you know the Sears catalog?

67
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:01,230
You ever heard of that?

68
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,010
Oh, yeah, of course.

69
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:02,570
Yeah.

70
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,950
You could even buy a house, right?

71
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:05,950
You could at one point, yeah.

72
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:06,910
On the Sears catalog, right, through the Craftsman.

73
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,370
They're quite popular.

74
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,570
Oh, yeah, well, that was the whole tools and everything.

75
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:11,590
Everything was great with that.

76
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,230
I like the Craftsman tools, actually.

77
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,110
Yeah, but just anything.

78
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:18,450
If you look at a Sears catalog, you buy anything and everything there, right?

79
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:19,550
And it was mail order.

80
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:23,190
Well, we kind of went back to it with the internet, right, buying stuff online.

81
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:30,950
Because prior to the – well, prior to the Sears catalog, it was walk-in places.

82
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:35,050
And then the Sears catalog comes along, and you could buy a house from a catalog,

83
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,390
and they'd ship it to you in truckloads.

84
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:43,230
And then it went to walk-in places again, and as the Sears catalog lost popularity, right?

85
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:48,850
And the Sears catalog gained popularity through the Midwest and not so much in the cities

86
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:55,350
or the expanding, the westward expansion that was continuing until the early 1900s.

87
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,970
You know, you hear about the westward expansion in the U.S.

88
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:04,010
What did L.A. look like in, like, 1902, 1910, 1915?

89
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:04,970
Like, nothing, right?

90
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:08,690
What was the movie, Chinatown with Jack Nicholson?

91
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:09,350
Yeah.

92
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,230
About the water company in the – what was that, 30s or 40s?

93
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,130
Well, there's that, and there's also the famous films.

94
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,630
I mean, look, San Francisco is a well-developed place now,

95
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,630
but if you look at that earthquake from the early part of the 20th century

96
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,570
and you take a look at the development of what is considered to be a fairly major city,

97
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,350
it's still dirt roads and stuff, you know?

98
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,050
Oh, yeah.

99
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:27,570
It's the beginning of the century.

100
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:34,010
Yeah, so there was a westward – yeah, I like, again, I don't endorse him,

101
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,770
but Archaics gets to a lot of the stuff.

102
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:41,310
His narrative starts to fall apart if you try to study a lot of the things that he does,

103
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,850
but he's done a really good service by putting out the repeating disasters.

104
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:50,570
Also, there's a sense of, you know, when you look at the world's fairs,

105
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,110
this has been going on for a long time,

106
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:56,290
but even as a child when I was made aware of world fairs

107
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,570
and how elaborate they were, right, in the 1800s,

108
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:01,550
and it's like what the hell happened, you know?

109
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,150
Why did everything get so plain?

110
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:08,310
And I guess in Forest Hills, Queens, the last world's fair I think they did,

111
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,650
you know, with the big, huge stainless steel globes and all that.

112
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,150
Right, right.

113
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:14,950
That was probably the last time they made some kind of elaborate presentation.

114
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:18,710
But, yeah, I posted some things in the chat,

115
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:22,470
and mostly it's been about the water stuff.

116
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,210
I'm coming up with a term.

117
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,010
By the way, if you're listening to me, you're a sub most likely,

118
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:32,510
and you are being made loosely a party or privy to what I'm working on.

119
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:37,610
And it's very, very – by the way, it's – what would you call it?

120
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:41,010
It's very rarefied, disruptive, and proprietary, okay,

121
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,090
because this is very, very unique.

122
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:45,870
But here's the thing.

123
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,330
I have firsthand experience with this.

124
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,790
Let's say you're working on something that is very unique.

125
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:54,550
Let's say – okay, let's just make it a little more to the point.

126
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:58,130
Let's say you're working on anti-gravity and you build a small flying saucer, right?

127
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:58,550
Okay.

128
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,430
And let's say you're in a place where they won't shut you down.

129
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,150
So you call up Raytheon or all these other companies,

130
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,310
and they send someone over.

131
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:07,850
You tell them you've got anti-gravity or whatever.

132
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:12,010
And they're going to send someone over that's just not somebody.

133
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,810
It's like in the police they have detectives, right?

134
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,130
And detectives are like the best liars.

135
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:20,470
If you're in the law enforcement and you're a really good liar,

136
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:24,490
they make you a detective, right, because you have to show a certain side.

137
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,190
Like what do you want them – what are we going to do?

138
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:26,890
What are we going to show?

139
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:30,630
So anyways, let's say you've got this flying saucer and you call Raytheon or whatever,

140
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,730
and they send people over to look at it.

141
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:38,270
They're going to act like they don't know anything, right, even though they have it.

142
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,610
They have this technology.

143
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:43,430
Yeah, they know it backwards and forwards, but they're going to act like, oh, gee, that's interesting.

144
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,110
Sure, explain it to me.

145
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:45,950
How did you come up with that?

146
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,750
I've never seen this before.

147
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:52,470
So when I say there's disruption and proprietary and really next-level stuff,

148
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,530
all of it already exists.

149
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,430
It's just not for us poor saps, right?

150
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:57,870
Right.

151
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,010
So, yeah.

152
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:07,210
By the way, for those interested, I noticed in the chat many people are getting into the magnetic stuff.

153
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:12,610
It's actually a lot of people are getting a lot of correspondence about magnetic water,

154
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,850
and occasionally I kind of sound like a prick, but I don't mean to,

155
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,930
and say, you know, it's not really magnetic water.

156
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:23,870
It's actually anti-magnetic because we're running the water where there is no magnetism in common parlance, right?

157
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:32,110
It's where if you give a magnet to anyone and say, show me where the magnetism is, all right, you sure about that?

158
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:32,630
Okay, great.

159
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:37,870
It's not that they're wrong, but we run the water where you sense no magnetism.

160
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:38,990
That's where it goes, right?

161
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:39,770
Backwards, right?

162
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:43,550
I mean, there's a lot of social moral statements about that, right?

163
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:47,550
If you do what everybody else is not doing, you're probably better off, right?

164
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:48,010
Of course.

165
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,730
So it's very much like that.

166
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,090
So just a public announcement.

167
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,710
Right now it's getting to the point where I'm starting to name it,

168
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:59,890
and one thing I'm thinking of is a biased magnetic distillation.

169
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:08,110
Biasing means to push forward in a certain direction or lay down an undercurrent magnetic,

170
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:13,170
which it's not biasing, it's not magnetic, and it's not distillation, which is little droplets falling.

171
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,130
But that's how things work.

172
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,790
Kind of like Federal Reserve is not federal and has no reserves,

173
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:23,670
but biased magnetic distiller or distillation sounds, ooh, wow.

174
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,650
It sounds like you might get invited to a really good party one day, you know?

175
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:27,490
Absolutely.

176
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:27,850
But anyway.

177
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:33,970
So, yeah, you mentioned something about an e-mail about mind, Silva, and all this stuff.

178
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:34,510
Oh, yeah.

179
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:41,890
Well, you know, because a few sonic events back you had talked about taking the concept of mind control

180
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,230
and applying it to yourself.

181
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:43,890
Right.

182
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:49,790
And this is, of course, common theme, you know, uncommon in general,

183
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,510
but a common theme among people that try to speak about uncommon things.

184
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,530
And, you know, they talk about mind control.

185
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,410
A lot of people do that.

186
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,390
Now, that's way common.

187
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:01,490
And they talk about, you know, the CIA and your MK ultras and stuff like that.

188
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,050
Negative effects.

189
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:03,670
Right.

190
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:08,570
There's also an industry out there, though, where it's sort of like the self-driven mind control,

191
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,970
like, you know, oh, get into the secret, right?

192
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,570
Like the secret was a huge thing for a while.

193
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,290
Oh, just, you know, positive.

194
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:17,930
What was that positive?

195
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:23,490
If you envision something in a positive way, you know, then therefore it will happen, this kind of thing.

196
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:24,210
All right.

197
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:31,010
Well, somebody sent me a bit of a message about this Silva method, this guy Jose Silva,

198
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:36,750
who I'm only vaguely familiar with, and I'm not familiar with the particulars on it,

199
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:41,590
but I know that this is one of those methodologies that, you know, sometimes people end up grabbing

200
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:45,730
and, you know, turning it into a guru cottage business kind of thing.

201
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:50,210
And I know that that's got to be what it is, but I've heard about this enough

202
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,410
that I'm thinking there might be something to it.

203
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,170
And I was just wondering if you had any familiarity.

204
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,690
I'll give a few analogies on that.

205
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:00,610
Mind control, how it's done and by who is just like agriculture.

206
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:03,050
It differs in different parts of the world, right?

207
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:08,550
Study agriculture in different parts of the world, and they have certain things in common,

208
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,590
like planting and rows usually and things like that, but it's very different, right?

209
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,390
So, you know, cultivate the mind, no pun intended.

210
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,630
So it's kind of like agriculture.

211
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,470
Who's doing it right?

212
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:19,430
Who's doing it wrong?

213
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:21,950
Nobody or everybody.

214
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:24,110
You know, in other words, it depends on the terrain.

215
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,190
It depends on what you're growing, right?

216
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:30,630
So if you look at agriculture in Vietnam or China,

217
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:34,190
it's very different than agriculture in Kentucky or in Ukraine.

218
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:37,150
Well, much like I've said, when it comes to mind stuff,

219
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,810
I've said this about, like, say, Alcoholics Anonymous, right,

220
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,690
where I find it to be completely stupid.

221
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,110
That's a cult.

222
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,330
And it is a cult.

223
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:45,350
And it's self-admitted, yeah.

224
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,850
It is a cult, but here's the thing.

225
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:51,450
If somebody takes that and applies it and it improves their life,

226
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:52,330
I have no argument.

227
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:53,830
You know what I'm saying?

228
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,490
Well, okay, this gets into relationships also.

229
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:02,590
They keep making you admit that you're an alcoholic and you're a piece of shit, right?

230
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:07,770
So they're telling you, you join us and this is how you're going to do business with your life.

231
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:12,170
So whenever you get into a situation, like here,

232
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:15,290
I had some neighbors arguing a while back.

233
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,410
She goes, if you don't like it, leave.

234
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:21,070
And I'm like, oh, she's telling them how she likes to do business.

235
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:25,830
So in other words, what I mean by that is, like, if two people are trying to work something out,

236
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,790
well, you meet in the middle, you compromise.

237
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,610
One might have to compromise.

238
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,130
One might have to learn a little more.

239
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,310
And you make adjustments, you know?

240
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,110
But when somebody says, if you don't like it, leave,

241
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:39,650
what they're telling you is, this is how I do business.

242
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,070
Fuck you, right?

243
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:41,510
Right.

244
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:42,170
You get it?

245
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:46,370
So whenever I hear somebody say, well, if you don't like it, leave or whatever,

246
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:49,510
it's like, oh, look, she's telling them how she does business, right?

247
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:55,410
And what I mean, how you do business, that means that you're planning on sticking with that model, right?

248
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,270
You know what I mean?

249
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,730
You're not going to change.

250
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:04,890
So I like to take common things the way people use them and don't think about how they're using them.

251
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,130
They're usually emotionally based.

252
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:09,490
And I like to translate them into English to be easier to understand.

253
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:10,470
You know what I mean?

254
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,910
So it helps.

255
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,650
It helps those that are especially watching.

256
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,690
When you're in the middle of it, it's kind of hard to get it.

257
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:21,030
So next time someone says, if you don't like it, leave, that means that's how I do business.

258
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,070
Screw you, right?

259
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:27,450
So it's not a matter that they can't change or won't change.

260
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:29,850
That's how they do business.

261
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,570
In other words, this is what they're happy with.

262
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:32,110
Right.

263
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,650
So this goes on and on.

264
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,150
The same with all of this stuff.

265
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:42,990
Going back to, I don't know if I went off on a tangent, but we're still on the mind control aspect of it.

266
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,710
Silva, okay, here's the thing.

267
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:50,930
I don't know if I should give the analog or the analogy or talk about Silva first.

268
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,350
I'll do them at the same time.

269
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:53,710
I'll talk about Silva first.

270
00:13:54,150 --> 00:14:00,670
He discovered that there is a state in between being conscious and unconscious where you're able to do things you normally can't do.

271
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:08,370
So what he did was he slept on an easy boy, easy chair with a big steel ball bearing in his hand with a metal bucket right under the armrest.

272
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:13,610
So when he fell asleep, the ball fell out of his hand, hit the bucket, and woke him up abruptly.

273
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:26,330
And for that first few seconds when that noise startled him, he was able to see things in the room and do things that normally wouldn't be considered being able to do with normal consciousness.

274
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,250
So he was getting into a different state.

275
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:35,670
The analogy there is there's a family, and the mom always makes a roast a certain way.

276
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,090
They love the way she makes the roast.

277
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:42,370
She buys a big roast, and she cuts the ends off and tosses them to the side and makes the roast.

278
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,450
And it always comes out well.

279
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,450
And she says she got the recipe for grandma.

280
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:54,630
So one day they go over to grandma's house, and they ask her, you know, grandma, mom makes the best roast.

281
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,950
And she makes it this way, like you said, you know, cut the ends off.

282
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,970
Why do you cut the ends off?

283
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:05,050
She goes, oh, when we had the small oven and the small tray, it was too small for the roast.

284
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,890
It wouldn't fit, so I had to cut the ends off.

285
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:13,130
So there was a practical reason for it, but then it just became, yeah, okay, gotcha.

286
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:17,450
And then it became something elaborate that was mystified and, you know, a secret recipe.

287
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,270
You see how that applies to this whole thing?

288
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:19,690
Right.

289
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:25,350
So something's going on here with these people by getting yourself like these remote viewers.

290
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:28,550
Oh, I like to listen to theta waves and get in a state or whatever.

291
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:29,550
I'm like, oh, my gosh.

292
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,750
But here, perfect for the public.

293
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:40,750
If you plan on having an audience of more than, like, five people, let's just say mass audience.

294
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,150
I say five.

295
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:46,410
I mean, for rarefied information, it should only go to a handful of people anyway.

296
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:52,410
When I say when you plan, like, this is all mass stuff, you know, even though it's alternative, it's mass.

297
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,890
I mean, like look at alternative media.

298
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:59,330
Some people have millions of followers, right, or millions of observers, spectators, whatever you want to call it.

299
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,270
Sure, whatever you want to call it.

300
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,050
Yeah, it's not small.

301
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:07,930
So if you're an alternative media guy or alternative thinking or alternative whatever and you want to put it out to the world,

302
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:13,550
you can almost acquire an audience that would be considered, like they say,

303
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:18,810
there are more people watching alternative media than watching CNN, according to their Gallup polls and things, right?

304
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:19,010
Right.

305
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:23,990
So when you get to that point, guess what, folks?

306
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,550
You're still going to the masses.

307
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,250
So what do you give to the masses?

308
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:31,650
You know, I've been hammering this on Greek speak for years and years.

309
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:36,090
You don't give them much and you give them stuff that, you know, accommodates them, right?

310
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,750
So it has to have that mystique, you know.

311
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:44,650
It generally ends up being BS for most people, just like they say, well, it didn't work for me, but I had fun.

312
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:45,750
It was entertaining, right?

313
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:46,130
Why?

314
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,070
You know, okay.

315
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,850
So I'm not knocking Silva, but I'll tell you this.

316
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:55,890
If he does have stuff that's valid, he's not sharing it publicly, I'll tell you that.

317
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:03,849
Or if he is sharing it publicly, you're going to have to sift through a lot of, you know what, to get some edible corn.

318
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:04,869
Okay.

319
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:06,710
For it to work, you know.

320
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:07,829
Do I need to?

321
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:11,170
Well, let me just say, I don't know if you guys remember, I used to use a lot, you know,

322
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:15,530
that's like eating, going through poop to get some edible corn, undigested corn.

323
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:20,950
Yeah, it is indeed in there, but it doesn't mean that you want to go through all that to get to it, but okay.

324
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,230
Yeah, we don't want to waste.

325
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:23,010
That's good corn.

326
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:23,790
Look, it's good.

327
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:24,770
Yeah, really?

328
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:25,210
Yeah.

329
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:25,910
Right?

330
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:27,329
Instead of fresh corn, you know.

331
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:32,570
Speaking of which, I wanted to get more into what I was thinking about.

332
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:38,910
You know, food, clothing, shelter were the three things that I keep telling people if you're a surface dwelling earth inhabitant.

333
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:39,350
Right.

334
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,010
That's what it's about being here.

335
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:44,010
By the way, your mic is, you're falling off and sounding a little distorted there.

336
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:44,810
Oh, sorry about that.

337
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,150
I probably leaned back.

338
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:46,350
Sorry.

339
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:46,850
Go ahead.

340
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:47,530
Oh, is it?

341
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:52,370
No, it could sound a little crinkly there, crackly too, or maybe the cable's coming off or something.

342
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:52,670
Okay.

343
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:54,350
Food, clothing, shelter.

344
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:57,470
One thing I got a response is, Greg, that sounds so base and simple.

345
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,070
You know, I don't even mean food, clothing, shelter.

346
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:04,490
I said, but listen, if you're pursuing, this is the qualitative, not the quantitative part.

347
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:12,070
If you're trying to pursue the highest quality of food, clothing, and shelter that you want to afford or can afford, it's going to be quite a trip.

348
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:13,090
Right?

349
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:19,230
And while you're pursuing a higher level of quality in all of those things, you will start learning a lot more about everything else.

350
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:20,130
Right?

351
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:25,250
So you're basically using that as a focal or an axial pivoting point.

352
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:25,950
Right?

353
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:33,890
And basically, if you look at someone who's barely getting by or someone who's a billionaire, when you become a billionaire, what do they always up?

354
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,330
They up their food quality.

355
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:38,290
They up their clothing quality, don't they?

356
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,030
And their housing.

357
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,390
And their housing.

358
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:41,150
Don't they do that?

359
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:41,630
Absolutely.

360
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,270
So you see that.

361
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:48,830
Okay, so when we continue, food, clothing, shelter, then it'll be water, energy, and silver.

362
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:53,050
I never got into this, I think, publicly before.

363
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:54,330
No, I don't think so.

364
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:54,510
Right?

365
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:59,430
Okay, so food, clothing, shelter, water, energy, silver.

366
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:00,990
Let's go backwards.

367
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:05,950
Silver, yes, the metal silver, but silver also implies currency and common use.

368
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:14,890
And also, silver implies the master metal, which has properties that actually no other element does second to water.

369
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:15,970
All right?

370
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:21,410
Energy would be the ability to handle a workload.

371
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:22,770
Okay?

372
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,970
It's not what, and I'll get into that.

373
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:34,510
And water, water would be that substance in either using it for, water substance being cool and clear and clean.

374
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:38,830
For all purposes, even for sewage, in other words, right?

375
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:46,050
So cool and clean and clear water access to, and moving water.

376
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:49,250
So those are the things after food, clothing, and shelter.

377
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,210
So we can go down.

378
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:54,590
I want to just insert a few things on that.

379
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,430
Which one do you think we should, should I start inserting things?

380
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,970
Water, energy, or silver, Chuck?

381
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:00,870
You pick.

382
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:01,570
Well, let's see.

383
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,330
Okay, you picked energy.

384
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:03,730
Yeah.

385
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:04,850
I'm just joking.

386
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:05,230
Go ahead.

387
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:05,790
That's fine.

388
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:13,050
No, that's where I was going to go, actually, because look, the other things can be assisted by energy, right?

389
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,410
Especially given the definition that you just laid out.

390
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,750
So why not?

391
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:21,250
You should get your energy together first.

392
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,830
This will assist you with the other two.

393
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,250
Sort of, yeah, but they all kind of work together in a way.

394
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,650
So energy, basically, give an analogy.

395
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:33,970
You know, you heard about all the Europeans or a good majority of people from all over the world coming to the U.S., right?

396
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:34,810
Migration, right?

397
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:35,090
Right.

398
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:38,250
It started a long, long time before they even told you.

399
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:43,930
You were just made aware of the influx of immigrants at the turn of the 20th century and on, right?

400
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:47,170
But, you know, the colonists and all that.

401
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,550
The reason, the main reason why they came, there's two reasons.

402
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:52,110
One is because you had cheap energy here.

403
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:56,330
Okay, and the other one was to escape justice because it was killing them.

404
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:57,930
Justice meaning the goddess religion.

405
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:58,390
Right.

406
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,970
And their laws in Europe, okay?

407
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:05,670
Which has, by the way, people have been quote unquote brainwashed to believe justice is a good thing.

408
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,270
It's just the name of a system.

409
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:07,990
Right.

410
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:08,350
Okay?

411
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:20,650
So, okay, what I mean, they came here, okay, so you're living in, if you look up statistics, you know, you don't have to lean on them, but at least it gives you a broad brush general thing.

412
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,610
Europe was deforested 500 years ago.

413
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:27,430
In other words, what I mean by that, if you look at country statistics,

414
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:33,850
like pick a country like Greece and it gives you the minerals, you know, what they have in population and all the stats on a country, right?

415
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:34,270
Okay.

416
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:37,430
When you get to forests, it says 95% deforested.

417
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:39,930
Okay.

418
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:45,670
You get to another company, company, I always say company with countries, which is actually more accurate.

419
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:46,570
Actually more accurate, yeah.

420
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:49,030
Yeah, even my Freudian slips are accurate.

421
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:49,550
I hate that.

422
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:53,730
Okay, so, you know, other, you know, you look at this stuff.

423
00:21:53,730 --> 00:22:03,050
So, what they were using for energy was hydropower and they were using solar, but solar passive, you know, like, hey, you got to dry your clothes, put them in the sun, right?

424
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:03,810
You might, okay.

425
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:05,190
Or drying food, right?

426
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:07,290
These sun-dried tomatoes, hey, right?

427
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,290
Okay, on and on and on.

428
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:21,910
So, solar and also for passive waste and also wood burning, all the way from, you know, a simple stove to a fireplace to a steam motor, right?

429
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:30,470
And so then you would use wood burning or coal burning, bitumen of some kind, bituminous lignites and humites, right?

430
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:31,710
All those things are burnable.

431
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,170
Those are like softer coals, right?

432
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:35,410
Anthracite coal is the most, it gets the hottest.

433
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:36,430
Okay, yeah.

434
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:40,590
Anyway, give examples and you basically dig and try to, well, they used it all up, right?

435
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:49,450
So, you know, you got to, you know, you're going to be cold in the winter and, you know, when you want to cook food, you all kind of get together and do it cooperatively.

436
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:57,090
Not always, but energy was, even now, for example, the euro and the dollar are very close together.

437
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,490
So, if I say one euro, one dollar, I'm pretty close, right?

438
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,970
It's like 104, 102 euro to the dollar or something.

439
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:06,990
So, if I say a dollar, when the euro first came out, it was $1.50 to the, right?

440
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:07,510
Right.

441
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,070
To the dollar.

442
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,710
And the pound was almost double.

443
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:10,690
I don't know what it is now.

444
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,750
But, okay, so let's say this.

445
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:17,530
So, typically in gas here, it's $4 a gallon, which would be four and a half liters or something, right?

446
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:19,530
Well, if you go to Europe.

447
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:27,790
Eight dollars, well, eight in the Great British Pound goes to about 11 and change, like 11.20 right now.

448
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:29,510
I know that is on top of my head.

449
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:30,950
It's not double.

450
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,390
In the 80s, it was double, pretty much.

451
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:35,830
If you saw, you know, a pound, it was like $1.85, right?

452
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:36,810
Yeah, something like that.

453
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:37,670
Yeah.

454
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,130
Yeah, but it's double.

455
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:39,510
I don't know.

456
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,130
Yeah, okay.

457
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,170
So, it's one and a third.

458
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:42,370
All right.

459
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:45,930
So, anyway, you get gas at four bucks or, let's say, even five bucks, right?

460
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:47,050
A gallon now, right?

461
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,090
You know how they have the price at the pump, right?

462
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:53,290
You know, four, whatever, five, whatever.

463
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:53,630
Yeah.

464
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:55,870
Well, you go to Europe, you see a similar number.

465
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,210
Three something, four something.

466
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:58,990
But you know what?

467
00:23:59,350 --> 00:23:59,730
It's a liter.

468
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:00,390
It's not for a gallon.

469
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:01,450
It's for a liter.

470
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:02,150
Yeah.

471
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:03,990
You get it?

472
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:04,770
Oh, yeah.

473
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,450
Yeah, it looks like the same price, right?

474
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:09,290
It takes approximately two liters to make a gallon, though.

475
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:11,330
More than four, yeah.

476
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:11,710
More than four.

477
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:12,550
Is it more than four?

478
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:13,310
I thought it was two.

479
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,270
Yeah, well, a liter is less than a quart.

480
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:16,590
Oh, wow.

481
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:16,950
Okay.

482
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,150
I'm sorry.

483
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:20,490
I thought two liters made about a gallon.

484
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:21,230
My mistake.

485
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:23,350
Well, you could do it this way.

486
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:26,110
It's eight pounds for a gallon of water.

487
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:32,930
Anyway, a pound is 454 grams, right?

488
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:36,650
A liter is part of a tenth of a kilo.

489
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,470
You know how you could do the conversion pretty quickly?

490
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:41,130
But four liters, you're still short on a gallon.

491
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,550
But I use that pretty close because a liter is close to a quart.

492
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,050
You've worked with beverage.

493
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:46,770
Yeah, yeah.

494
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:47,090
Right?

495
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:49,230
So you can see the quart and the liter very close.

496
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:54,270
If you have a quart and a liter next to each other, the quart looks kind of fat compared to the liter.

497
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:54,770
Sure.

498
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:55,690
They look very similar.

499
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,990
Anyway, so you see, even today, it's kind of going on.

500
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:05,350
If you go to, like, remember in England in the wintertime, they have a heater in each room.

501
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:08,430
So when you leave one room, you turn off the heater in that room,

502
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:11,250
and you go to the next room, you turn the heater on in that room to conserve.

503
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:11,790
You know what I mean?

504
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:13,250
Okay.

505
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,230
They don't do that here yet.

506
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:18,610
So cheap energy.

507
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,330
That's what I mean by energy availability.

508
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:25,710
People came over to this part of the world for that because, hey, it was everywhere.

509
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:26,350
There was coal.

510
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:27,430
There was surface minerals.

511
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:28,370
Right?

512
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:28,830
Right.

513
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:29,830
Trees everywhere.

514
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:30,530
Right?

515
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,890
This has gone on for a very long time.

516
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:40,930
Like a water heater in the Netherlands that you heat with gas or electric to make hot water for the house is super efficient.

517
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:44,330
I mean, you can almost use a plastic flue pipe to vent it out.

518
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:50,290
Where in the U.S., when you have a forced air heater gas burning or a water heater gas burning,

519
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:55,230
90% of the gas you're burning is going out the flue, and only 10% is to heat the water.

520
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,430
That's how wasteful they are.

521
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:57,390
Wow.

522
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:01,210
Where in Europe, when they design them, they design them so it's the other way around.

523
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,310
You're only wasting 10%, right?

524
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,530
They actually have some new ones now where, you know,

525
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:09,430
when you have a flue or a chimney exhaust for a gas burner or whatever,

526
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,110
it's got to be made of pretty good metal.

527
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,970
You don't want to start a fire on your roof or something.

528
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:16,990
Some of the newer devices are so efficient, you could actually use a plastic pipe.

529
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:17,910
Wow.

530
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:19,670
You know, that's how little heat they lose.

531
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,210
And I think those went away.

532
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:25,190
They came out for a little while, and I said, no, no, we don't want to let people know there's a really good way to do this.

533
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:29,050
So that's what I mean by energy from the living perspective.

534
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:34,110
People came, let's say, to the U.S. and the Americas because it was cheap energy, right?

535
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:34,390
Okay.

536
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,150
So that's – okay.

537
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:40,910
Now, from the older Greek speak, I talk about how the Western world is going to be brought down,

538
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,270
and the Middle East is going to be up.

539
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:46,430
And one of the ways that's going to happen is you know how you have these things –

540
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:49,870
a certain lifestyle in Europe, people come to the U.S. and are like, wow, I love it here.

541
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:50,750
You've got so much stuff.

542
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:54,170
Well, they're going to make the U.S. more like Europe, right?

543
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:59,230
And then once the U.S. gets more like Europe, then they bring the whole thing down even further, right?

544
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:04,410
Because in order for the U.S. economically, energy-wise, availability, commercial-wise, to be like Europe,

545
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:11,130
they have to bring it down, tamp it down, create more scarcity, higher price,

546
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:14,130
even though the value is the same of the item.

547
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:15,530
You see?

548
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:16,510
So this is happening.

549
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:19,630
I've talked about this a lot, what you see going on right now in crazy inflation.

550
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:24,610
Even when we were talking about the ONG eight years ago or six years ago, seven years ago,

551
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:28,090
I was saying, look, you guys are going to get hit with some crazy inflation

552
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:30,850
where stuff is going to, like, double in price in a year and a half and all that

553
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:33,010
because they're holding it down, right?

554
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:33,890
Here's fiat currency.

555
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:38,050
Every time someone uses a credit card, you should have inflation because they're creating new currency.

556
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:43,110
Every time someone gets a loan, the money to pay back that alleged loan does not exist.

557
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:44,230
It has to be created.

558
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:44,990
Right.

559
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:45,430
You see?

560
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:50,110
And every time new currency is created, it takes value from the existing currency supply,

561
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:53,870
so therefore it devalues it and creates inflation automatically.

562
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:57,890
It means you need more of that currency to get the same thing, which is inflation.

563
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:59,670
So people say, Greek, you don't pay taxes.

564
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:00,630
They pay taxes all the time.

565
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:01,390
It's called inflation.

566
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:06,390
What I mean by that is, let's say you have a time machine in the 1950s

567
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:09,510
and you sock $2,000 to get a new car.

568
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:10,190
You put it away.

569
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:11,270
I got it.

570
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,410
It's 1953.

571
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:13,590
All right?

572
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:14,550
I got a time machine.

573
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:19,030
So I'm going to go to 2023 with my time machine tomorrow.

574
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:22,590
But when I get there, I can't get around in my time machine.

575
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:23,550
I need a new car.

576
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:26,870
So I'm going to put $2,500 in a box.

577
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:32,730
So when I show up in 2023, I could walk into a new car dealer with my $2,500 and get a new car.

578
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:34,570
Right?

579
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,870
What happens when you do that?

580
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:38,810
You show up in 2023 with $2,500 to get a new car.

581
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:39,150
What?

582
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:41,110
Right?

583
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,230
You're lucky you get a moped.

584
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:44,250
But not even, right?

585
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:47,150
I mean, they charge you $500 just to leave the dealership.

586
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:49,770
So you got to have nitrogen in the tires, right?

587
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:54,970
So anyway, yeah, you're going to be in for a rude awakening

588
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:58,350
if you don't know how the currency system means.

589
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:00,570
So that's how you're paying a tax, right?

590
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,630
See, that's where the tax really is.

591
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,830
What people file returns on is not really a tax.

592
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:10,590
It's you're filing a return just like let's say you want to make a hole in a sidewalk

593
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:13,690
and the tools you have aren't strong enough to do that or powerful enough.

594
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:16,310
You go to the tool rental place and you get a jackhammer, right?

595
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:17,710
And you use it.

596
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:22,090
You make the hole in the sidewalk and you bring the jackhammer back to the tool rental place

597
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,630
and you wave goodbye and that's it.

598
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:24,210
You're done, right?

599
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:24,730
Right.

600
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:25,510
Nope.

601
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,890
You have to pay a fee for that.

602
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:28,990
Okay.

603
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:31,170
When you return, right?

604
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:32,210
No, I know.

605
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:38,070
Look, just by renting something, you're paying a fee when you show up to get it.

606
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:39,510
Yeah, so you go, right.

607
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:43,810
So in other words, when you get the jackhammer, you can't just say,

608
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:44,870
hey, I brought it back.

609
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:45,310
What's wrong?

610
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:47,030
Why do I have to pay a fee?

611
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:49,250
You get in trouble, right, for stealing.

612
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:50,490
So that's what the IRS is.

613
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:52,010
You're using private currency.

614
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:57,430
Here's, you know, early on commercial laws, even still, but they don't teach this.

615
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:02,610
The currency that's being used, whether it's electronic or paper, is called commercial paper,

616
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:08,170
commercial transactions, NFTs, NFCs, all this other stuff, right?

617
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:14,290
There's a presumption that anyone using it is an expert in that system.

618
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:15,870
That's the presumption.

619
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:18,070
Yeah, well, it's not a very good presumption.

620
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,430
The presumption is, here's another way to look at it.

621
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:27,470
If you sit down at a poker game, the moment you take the chair and get your hand dealt to you,

622
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:30,610
there's a presumption of everyone on the table that you know how to play the game.

623
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:31,110
Right.

624
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:32,110
Right?

625
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:36,350
So what if you don't know how to play the game, and you sit down at a poker,

626
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:39,790
you get dealt a hand, and everyone's presuming you know the rule,

627
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,170
but you don't know what the hell's going on.

628
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:41,730
What happens?

629
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:42,910
Well, a lot of things could happen.

630
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:46,290
Not only do you lose, but it's going to upset everyone else, right?

631
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:47,310
Of course.

632
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:54,450
So if you're endorsing credit, private credit, you'd better file for returns with all the authorities

633
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:59,330
or you will get in trouble, right, if you're unconditionally endorsing it, right?

634
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:02,430
That's why people say, you know, oh, they're unfair.

635
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:05,610
No, what's unfair is your education is unfair.

636
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:08,270
So I keep leaning on this.

637
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,950
They take it very seriously.

638
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:11,650
It's serious as a heart attack.

639
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,930
They'll even kill presidents over it.

640
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:19,170
So I know you're not a big proponent of Kennedy being killed over it,

641
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:22,510
but I'll tell you what, Jackson sure was, and so was Lincoln.

642
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:25,250
Oh, well, there I won't object.

643
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:26,070
Sure.

644
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:26,630
Yeah.

645
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:29,130
They made several attempts on Jackson over this.

646
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:31,650
Oh, yeah, and you know what?

647
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:33,150
It was very open both ways.

648
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,730
It was very open.

649
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:38,570
He says, you know, you can see here whether the statements are true or not,

650
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,910
they're very open statements against the bankers, right?

651
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:41,450
Yes.

652
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:45,090
And the bankers made a lot of the open statements against him, open, you know, so.

653
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:45,970
Oh, yeah.

654
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:53,330
And the most open thing that I've seen with Kennedy was the 10001 to make currency again,

655
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,830
but he didn't have to do that because it was already in effect.

656
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,410
It just wasn't being printed, right?

657
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:01,750
So he didn't abolish the Federal Reserve, and the president cannot abolish the Federal Reserve.

658
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:04,330
That's an act of Congress, right?

659
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:04,910
That's true.

660
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:05,590
It's an act of Congress.

661
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,250
Yeah, an act of Congress.

662
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,710
So people look at presidents.

663
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:09,910
I love the distraction.

664
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:13,510
It's the Congress that's screwing you, not the president.

665
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:19,850
There is nothing any president can do that could screw you one-tenth as bad as anything Congress does.

666
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:21,830
Absolutely true, yeah.

667
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:24,710
And that's why you're focusing on the president.

668
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:30,270
And even though the Congress is illegitimate, it hasn't been legitimately in session,

669
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,790
lawfully in session since the start of what they call the Civil War.

670
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:35,070
You can look that up.

671
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:37,470
There's a Latin term for it.

672
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:40,570
It means a dead day or dark day or a done day.

673
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:41,830
D.M. something.

674
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:45,570
Congress went into that state where they cannot reassemble.

675
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:49,250
Anyway, it's all crap.

676
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,630
So, okay, the energy part.

677
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:59,170
Energy is the ability to do a load, to work a load.

678
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,330
What does that mean?

679
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:05,230
Okay, so the floor needs to be cleaned in a house, right?

680
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:05,830
It's dry.

681
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:06,810
Dry, clean.

682
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:07,830
You don't want to sweep, right?

683
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:12,050
So you can grab a broom and sweep it, dustpan, et cetera.

684
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,030
All right.

685
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:14,470
That's physical energy.

686
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:18,330
So you would actually manually do that or have someone manually do it.

687
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:19,770
Then we go to the next level.

688
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:22,490
You make machines that would do that, right?

689
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:25,350
It even gets to the point where they have robots now that sweep the floor, right?

690
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,930
The little disc thing that runs around.

691
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:27,870
Yeah, the little roombas, yeah.

692
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:28,950
Yeah, okay.

693
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:29,370
Right, right.

694
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:33,690
So those things need some kind of power to run them, right?

695
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:34,110
Okay.

696
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,410
So that's where the energy is, and it's a load.

697
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:39,090
But what do you call it, a Roomba?

698
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:41,610
Yeah, that's the little robot that moves around.

699
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:42,170
Yeah, okay.

700
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:44,570
Or let's say an old Hoover or Kirby vacuum.

701
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:47,250
You plug in the wall, that draws a lot more current or whatever.

702
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:51,350
Now, let's say that's electric and it has a motor.

703
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:54,710
When you go over to, let's say, something like an electric car,

704
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:57,610
that requires a tremendous amount more current, right?

705
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:58,030
Right.

706
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:00,490
So here's the electric car thing, by the way.

707
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:04,030
If I were to be interested in that, there are some adapters,

708
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:06,710
like if you were living off the grid or if there was a blackout,

709
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:10,790
the battery bank in an electric car with a proper inverter and converter,

710
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:13,170
you could plug it into the mains in your house

711
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:15,750
and power your house with it for a day or two, right?

712
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:16,270
Right.

713
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:19,790
Because if you look at the average house using less than 10 kilowatts

714
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:24,429
and the average electric car being twice that, right, do the math, right?

715
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:27,449
So kilowatts, 1,000 watts.

716
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:32,270
So the energy factor here starts to increase.

717
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:37,650
So if you were to manually sweep with a broom and a dustpan,

718
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,550
and let's leave the Roomba out of this,

719
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:42,650
and you were to plug in a Hoover 110 volt

720
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,850
or whatever line voltage vacuum cleaner,

721
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:48,090
if you were to step off to the side,

722
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:51,070
because of efficiency and the designs we're getting,

723
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:53,489
you had to manually run on a treadmill

724
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:58,090
or turn a generator to make electricity to power that vacuum cleaner,

725
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:02,070
you'd say, oh, it's a lot less work to just sweep with a dustpan, right?

726
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:02,530
Right.

727
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:05,890
So if you had a generator to provide for that,

728
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,610
but while someone else is vacuuming,

729
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:10,530
you're running on a treadmill powering, right?

730
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:11,930
You'd be like, screw that.

731
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,050
I would have been much better if I had a broom

732
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,790
and you had a broom, it would be less work, okay?

733
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:15,950
Right.

734
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:20,230
So that's the, when I say energy, it's quantity and quality.

735
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:24,190
And I gave the example with you producing energy for the vacuum

736
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:27,770
or using the vacuum or the broom is a quantitative and qualitative point,

737
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:31,310
because it comes to the point sometimes when you're using energy,

738
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:35,210
whether it's while you're performing the load,

739
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:37,970
in other words, executing whatever load you have,

740
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:42,450
before, during, and after, you're like, oh, that took too much what?

741
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,710
Too much energy to do.

742
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:44,930
How many times do you hear that, right?

743
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:45,190
Right.

744
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:47,430
That was just too much energy to do that.

745
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:50,490
So you're always thinking about a more efficient way to do things.

746
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:56,010
So ultimately, even if you go back to all of the sacred texts, right,

747
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:58,750
if they give you any direction in life,

748
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:04,590
it's basically to grow crops, eat meat once in a while,

749
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:08,530
have a roof over your head, stay cool when it's hot,

750
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:11,330
stay warm when it's cold, and then you die.

751
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:13,410
That's it.

752
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:13,690
Okay.

753
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:14,690
That's the purpose of life.

754
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:15,930
And grow crops.

755
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:16,610
Right.

756
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:17,090
Right?

757
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,310
I just gave you the whole purpose.

758
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:21,510
So if you look at all the ancient texts,

759
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:23,750
it basically says you're agriculturally based,

760
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:26,110
have a good time while you're doing it, have a few festivals,

761
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:29,190
have sex when you want to, have children, blah, blah, blah, blah,

762
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,090
and then you die.

763
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:30,710
That's it.

764
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:32,230
That's the meaning of life.

765
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,310
You're like, oh, I need more than that.

766
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:36,370
Well, you've got more than that even if you're not trying.

767
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,030
It's called Netflix.

768
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:39,230
No, I'm just joking.

769
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:40,110
Okay.

770
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:40,570
Okay.

771
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:43,250
I'm just joking.

772
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:44,250
That's a horrible idea.

773
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:44,970
It's all right.

774
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:45,970
Scratch that.

775
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:47,810
That doesn't even have a pun.

776
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:49,410
It's not even a worthy punchline.

777
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:50,730
Okay.

778
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:52,290
You see, you know what I'm saying?

779
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:53,370
Yeah.

780
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:53,970
You get it, right?

781
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:54,970
What's the purpose of life?

782
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:55,170
All right.

783
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:56,570
Let's go look at, let's say, the Bible.

784
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:57,210
Let's go look at it.

785
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,290
What are we doing here?

786
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:01,950
Well, you know, we're supposed to wipe our bum and have babies

787
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:06,010
and make some shelters and grow some crops, and then we die.

788
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,110
Oh, my gosh.

789
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:12,190
It's really easy to be more interesting

790
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:14,330
than what all of the holy books tell you to do, right?

791
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:15,010
Oh, sure.

792
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:15,570
Very easy.

793
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:20,770
So this is, when I say food, clothing, shelter,

794
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:24,070
and then water, energy, and silver,

795
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:27,770
it's along the lines where it's still anchored in the ancient texts,

796
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:30,950
but it's also anchored in the way that what we can do,

797
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:35,530
because most of the ancient texts actually, here's a way to say it.

798
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:42,310
If you subscribe to a set of laws of antiquity and there are prohibitions,

799
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,330
consider the prohibitions as such,

800
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:49,470
but if something is not prohibited, you're open to do.

801
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:53,510
It's almost some of them are indirectly encouraged, right?

802
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:54,850
You see?

803
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:58,390
So when people look at laws of antiquity, it's so limiting,

804
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:02,510
but it's such a limited amount of limiting,

805
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:07,930
and while you study what to do as being the prohibitions or the limits,

806
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:10,630
it actually makes you aware of more things, you see?

807
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:12,570
It's like the subject matter.

808
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:18,530
So we're at the point now where you're still very open.

809
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:22,030
You know, if you get engrossed in what's going on in the world,

810
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:24,530
you could see it's been happening all the time.

811
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:28,650
What's going on right now is a repeat of the 70s.

812
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:31,630
Gas prices, terrible presidents, let's say, right?

813
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:34,950
A little bit of war here, a little bit of war there.

814
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:38,790
You had the Vietnam War ended, and then you had the Turks attack Cyprus.

815
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:40,150
You had skirmishes in Africa.

816
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:44,510
In the 70s, the big thing was give money to Ethiopia because they're starving.

817
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:45,130
Remember that?

818
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:45,650
Oh, yeah.

819
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,190
Yeah, not anymore.

820
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:50,730
You don't hear that anymore, but it's Ukraine now or whatever.

821
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:57,430
So anyway, the whole thing kind of repeats, and it pushes through again,

822
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:00,550
and when it pushes through again, it's like, what's going on?

823
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:01,710
The world's coming to an end.

824
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:02,170
What do you mean?

825
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,930
It's almost a replay, right?

826
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:07,690
It's coming back around again to the same thing it was at before.

827
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:15,630
So food, clothing, shelter, water, energy, and silver is a replay over and over and over,

828
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:20,930
and it gets really interesting when you start pursuing these things in your mind

829
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:23,750
and as a mindful pursuit, let's just say.

830
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:34,610
So the energy part, maybe not to sum it up, but just to give more of a way that I'd like to see it,

831
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:41,270
is you have a load, a task, a work that needs to be performed,

832
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:44,030
and what does it take to get it done, right?

833
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:45,970
That's why I gave the analogy of sweeping.

834
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:46,990
You have a dirty floor.

835
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:47,850
How do we get it done?

836
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:50,450
Well, we could sweep it, dustpan, or we get a vacuum cleaner,

837
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:52,570
but which one is the least amount of energy?

838
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:55,130
By the way, which one is it, Greek?

839
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:57,010
Well, I shouldn't say, obviously.

840
00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:02,010
The dustpan and the broom is the least amount of energy, right?

841
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:03,710
Completely.

842
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:05,250
Now, here's the other thing.

843
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:11,550
If you can source the Roomba or a DC-powered, or if you're running on solar power all the way,

844
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:16,590
that would be the most available energy as long as the sun is shining,

845
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:19,230
but you still have to get the equipment, which is much more elaborate.

846
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:23,930
As far as I can tell, I can go price any broom and any dustpan,

847
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:26,930
and it will always be less than any vacuum cleaner.

848
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:27,690
Oh, of course.

849
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:30,410
So cost-wise, yeah.

850
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:31,850
That's the silver part.

851
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:36,490
But the difference in cost here is your personal use of energy, right?

852
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:39,890
Because to utilize the Roomba is no energy just about.

853
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:40,930
You set it up, it goes.

854
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:47,830
By the way, I didn't know those freaking things were like 300 bucks or 200 bucks for a knockoff.

855
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:48,630
Yeah, they are.

856
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:48,830
Right?

857
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:49,670
Yeah.

858
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:50,430
I was like, what?

859
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:53,890
That thing, you know, you could step on it, it's made out of thin plastic.

860
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,870
I saw, what, 50 bucks, get another one.

861
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:56,470
I said, 50 bucks?

862
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,090
What are you talking about?

863
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:58,770
No, they're not 50 bucks.

864
00:40:58,910 --> 00:40:59,770
They're kind of expensive.

865
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:01,090
Yeah, yeah.

866
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:02,130
But still.

867
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:10,270
But what's interesting here is that there's a difference because the distribution of the different elements here is different, right?

868
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:14,190
Because it's more personal energy you have to expend for the broom.

869
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:16,430
But you're expending less silver.

870
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:24,210
You're expending less energy in general if you're just objectifying the energy if you just sweep it yourself, right?

871
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:29,190
But personally, you expend a lot less energy if you put the little robot in charge of it.

872
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:37,550
And it's a lot less energy to use the vacuum as opposed to manually stroking the broom back and forth and using and picking up and putting down the dustpan, right?

873
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:40,450
And you've got to know how to sweep, by the way.

874
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:42,550
It sounds a lot of what they call labor.

875
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:43,670
Right?

876
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:49,910
It's not that just because it's called labor, like let's say you're a laborer on a construction site, doesn't mean that anybody can do it.

877
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:52,650
It requires a lot of skill to be a good laborer, by the way.

878
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:57,150
Look, I can tell you just very simply how many people I had to teach how to properly mop a floor.

879
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:58,590
Oh, of course.

880
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:00,050
Because they don't know.

881
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:01,990
That's another level of sweeping.

882
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:02,550
Yeah.

883
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:04,190
That's another level of sweeping.

884
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:04,490
Exactly.

885
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:07,390
It's not like walking where you put one leg in front of the other.

886
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:08,210
It's called walking.

887
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:09,210
Right.

888
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:11,470
And, you know, I get it, yeah.

889
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:17,290
But here, okay, so at some point you have to decide what works better.

890
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:26,750
I personally like vacuuming, but, you know, it has to be the right proper vacuum and all that for many reasons.

891
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:35,730
But ultimately the bottom line is the least energy consumption now, later, and much later is going to be the dustpan and the broom.

892
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:41,170
So, like I don't get around much, and we have two cars here.

893
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:48,770
And the only reason I use the car really is to go get cigarettes and do some minor shopping once in a while, which I could actually just walk.

894
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,150
I don't even have to use that.

895
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:53,990
So it's being very, very wasteful, right?

896
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:58,790
You see, so actually I'm exaggerating there.

897
00:42:58,930 --> 00:42:59,490
I do need it.

898
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:08,070
I do go on trips and things like that, but personally I could get away with just the bicycle most of the time and being on foot.

899
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:08,870
Your day-to-day needs.

900
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:09,910
So that's another consideration.

901
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:14,070
Yeah, your day-to-day needs you could generally address with a bicycle or on foot is what you're saying.

902
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:14,770
Oh, yeah, yeah.

903
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:18,990
And it would actually make it more interesting because you're not inside of this human terrarium, right?

904
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:19,530
Right.

905
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:27,250
You might meet – the chances of having more conversation and whatever and interaction is much greater walking.

906
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:27,950
Oh, yeah.

907
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:29,030
Yeah.

908
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:31,230
So there's that aspect also.

909
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:37,050
So the energy part, again, you notice I keep saying it's a load, right?

910
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:39,570
It's a load that you put on yourself.

911
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:46,530
In other words, if you're really, really tired and ready to go to bed and someone gives you a broom and a dustpan to sweep the floor, it's going to be like,

912
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:49,930
wow, what a task because you're ready to go to sleep.

913
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:55,710
So you sense how much work it takes to do a job like that when you're not ready to do it.

914
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:56,810
Right, right.

915
00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:00,450
So when I say energy, it's that aspect.

916
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:02,410
And then there's also the chemical energy.

917
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:07,970
We've discussed some of the – chemical energy would be purely when we say we have to heat or cool something.

918
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:15,210
We don't do it usually naturally unless – like in the cartoons, the grandma makes the pie and she puts it on the windowsill to cool down

919
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:18,230
and someone always comes and takes the pie, you know, the old meal.

920
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:18,970
Right, right.

921
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:20,690
You steal the pie because it's cooling off.

922
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:24,290
When I say heating and cooling, we do chemical heating and cooling.

923
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:28,110
And when I was in a discussion with someone regarding ether energy and stuff like that,

924
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:31,510
I was talking about some inductive processes.

925
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:34,610
As soon as you feel the chemical heat come on, you have to remove it.

926
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:37,610
And most people wouldn't know what that means.

927
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:44,670
If you have an electronics or if you have anything plugged in anywhere or running on anything and you feel it getting warm, that's a chemical heat.

928
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:46,690
It's not a natural heat, right?

929
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:50,570
So let's say you walk over to your computer, right, and you say it's running.

930
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:51,530
How's it running, Chuck?

931
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:52,110
Put your hand on it.

932
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:53,010
It feels like it's running hot.

933
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:54,130
That's a chemical heat.

934
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:54,510
Right.

935
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:55,790
That's not a natural heat, right?

936
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:56,010
Okay.

937
00:44:56,770 --> 00:44:58,810
So that's what I mean by heat.

938
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:05,290
We usually – energy, you're going to pursue the chemical aspect of energy, heating or cooling and all that.

939
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:06,930
So all these things should be considered.

940
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:13,690
If you go camping, which, by the way, this is a modern phenomenon, by the way, camping.

941
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:17,950
It's more a part of the Western white culture, I call it.

942
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:21,450
By the way, when I say white people and white, it's not the color of your skin.

943
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:22,570
Yeah.

944
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:25,850
In ancient – I remember – I can't remember exactly.

945
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:32,430
I was reading a translation of an ancient Egyptian text, and if you have no flavor, no culture, no personality, you're like blah,

946
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:34,790
in ancient Egypt they called you white.

947
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:39,130
White is not being used as a color.

948
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:42,190
It's used as a qualitative term, like blah.

949
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:43,730
Okay.

950
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:45,030
But anyway, back to camping.

951
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:48,510
This whole thing about camping is a very modern thing.

952
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:49,290
People get excited.

953
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:49,930
I'm going to go camping.

954
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:50,410
I'm going to go camping.

955
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:51,590
Oh, my gosh.

956
00:45:51,610 --> 00:46:01,790
For thousands of years, people lived in cities, and they pointed as the mountains and countryside as places not to go because it's dangerous.

957
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:05,350
And you've got stuff coming out of the – why would you suscept yourself – right?

958
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:07,050
I never understood it.

959
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:13,130
It's kind of like – I've gone camping, by the way, and from the minute we got there, I was thinking, when are we getting back?

960
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:14,430
Right?

961
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:14,910
Yeah.

962
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:15,750
It's foolish.

963
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:17,390
It's just part of a cultural training.

964
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:21,810
It's not quite like an adrenaline junkie, like the bungee cord.

965
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:27,570
You know, the guys that jump off the bridges, the bungee cord jumping, adrenaline junkies, skydivers and whatever.

966
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:31,830
Humans are the only animals that pursue dangerous things.

967
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:38,470
And all the other creatures, when they find out doing a particular activity is dangerous, they avoid it.

968
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:39,270
But humans don't.

969
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:50,030
And to show how stupid they are, they keep pursuing these dangerous things that could bring death or injury to them by making devices to protect themselves while they're pursuing those dangerous things.

970
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:50,270
Right?

971
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:52,090
Think about it.

972
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:52,550
Anyway.

973
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:54,230
Yeah.

974
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:58,030
So, yeah, let's make an airplane so we could jump out of it.

975
00:46:58,870 --> 00:46:59,310
Whatever.

976
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:09,790
So the camping thing, when you have a reasonably – a culture that's based on a reasonably ancient mindset, they would never do that, ever.

977
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:12,430
Well, they did go out into the woods.

978
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:17,370
You read stories about that when they had to leave the city because someone was going to kill them.

979
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:17,590
Right?

980
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:18,890
To hide out in the woods.

981
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:21,270
Well, but that's choosing a level of danger.

982
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:24,410
It's more dangerous to remain in the city, so we're going to leave the city.

983
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:26,790
Yeah, it's more dangerous to stay in the city.

984
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:30,890
That's why we're going out in the country, not because we're going to REI and buying camping equipment.

985
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:31,630
Oh, my goodness.

986
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:35,930
And, look, I'm not – if you enjoy that kind of thing, I'm not knocking it.

987
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:36,410
All right?

988
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:41,090
No, and I wouldn't say it's a bad skill set to have to know how to survive out there and stuff like that.

989
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:43,630
I think it's not a bad thing to know how to do, for sure.

990
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:51,250
Yeah, but they're not really – they go and buy all their gimmicks and all their gadgets and all the things that the little, you know, one thing does this and it does that.

991
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:53,050
The camping stove and all that.

992
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:54,070
You know, all that's depleted.

993
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:58,310
Most of the stuff that people buy to go camping is depletable.

994
00:47:59,090 --> 00:47:59,450
Right?

995
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:05,270
Like they open the little packet, the freeze-dried thing, add water, heat it up, and you've got a meal or the little pellets or this and that.

996
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:06,530
The flashlight, right?

997
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:10,130
All that shit is going to run out after a few days or weeks, depending on how much crap you buy.

998
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:11,190
And then what do you do then?

999
00:48:11,870 --> 00:48:12,490
No, I got you.

1000
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:20,390
I'm talking about the kind of guys who like – I had a guy on a show many years ago that won that series on History Channel called Alone

1001
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:27,470
where you just go out into the wild with a knife, basically, and you survive.

1002
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:30,750
And if you need rope, you make it out of the trees.

1003
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:31,330
You know what I mean?

1004
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:31,590
Yep.

1005
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:34,130
Well, I like the knife that has the compass on the back.

1006
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:35,130
You don't really need the compass.

1007
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:37,710
It has the little fire starter inside the handle.

1008
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:38,450
Oh, yeah.

1009
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:39,490
No, I understand all that.

1010
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:44,950
But, no, these guys generally go out there with a knife that, like, you know, they could carve things up with, but they could also chop down a tree with it.

1011
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:45,450
You know what I mean?

1012
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:46,250
A knife knife.

1013
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:49,110
You know, like Crocodile Dundee, that's not a knife.

1014
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:52,950
The thing about knives are really – it's just a slight tangent.

1015
00:48:53,930 --> 00:49:00,150
If I had to rely on a knife, like I would have to make it, I'd forge it on my own instead of going out.

1016
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:06,390
You can get a – by the way, a really good knife should be in the several hundreds, not a couple of hundreds, several hundreds.

1017
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:07,870
I'm talking the one you put in your pocket.

1018
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:14,370
There are – it is possible to have a steel good enough where you could chop down a small tree with it and also slice a tomato.

1019
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:14,910
Right.

1020
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:15,950
Right?

1021
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:16,990
It won't dull out, yeah.

1022
00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:19,950
So, I know they're out there.

1023
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:20,870
I just don't trust them.

1024
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:25,810
Like, I don't want to go out and spend $300 on a knife and find out it's not the one that I thought it was, you know.

1025
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:26,270
Of course.

1026
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:28,810
So I'd rather take my time and make one.

1027
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:32,670
By the way, making forges now is easy with inductive.

1028
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:39,190
You just get a piece of copper coil and an old whatever transformer, put the metal in the coil, it turns red hot almost instantly.

1029
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:44,450
You forge it that way instead of a fire like in the – they show you in the movies.

1030
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:48,030
So, yeah, I understand.

1031
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:56,170
But the survivalist – the food, clothing, shelter, water, energy, and silver is basically a survivalist mentality, not taking anything for granted, by the way.

1032
00:49:56,290 --> 00:49:56,390
Right?

1033
00:49:57,170 --> 00:49:59,530
I mean, when do you ever hear – look, go on YouTube right now.

1034
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:06,250
And I'm talking – when I say food, clothing, and shelter and now water, energy, and silver, it's about being in the society.

1035
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:16,190
If you go on YouTube or Internet or whatever and you see about what you should be concerned about living in society, no one is going to say food, clothing, shelter.

1036
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:25,730
They're going to tell you, oh, how to be a millionaire, how to make $50,000 in a month, how to do this, how to be vegan, how to live off the grid, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1037
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:27,470
Nothing about the basic reality.

1038
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:28,090
You know what I mean?

1039
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:30,070
Right.

1040
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:33,230
Tell me more about – tell us more about the survivalist.

1041
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:36,490
What was the takeaway from the survivalist guy that you had?

1042
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:38,630
What was the ultimate takeaway from him?

1043
00:50:38,850 --> 00:50:48,230
Well, it was simply that if you are in the woods, if you're in nature, you can find the means by which to create just about anything that is useful.

1044
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:49,990
And you can feed yourself.

1045
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:50,990
You can clothe yourself.

1046
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:56,730
And you can shelter yourself from the things that are just there if you know how.

1047
00:50:57,470 --> 00:50:58,590
That's what he did.

1048
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:00,750
I'll give a personal example.

1049
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:02,570
I don't – here's the thing.

1050
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:03,490
Tell me yes or no.

1051
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:11,110
I don't give – I'm not the – if you listen to all the sonics that we do or I've done, very rarely do I give personal accounts, right?

1052
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:14,850
Just tell me, you know, either back me up on this or say no.

1053
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:17,870
I mean, I don't want to – I like to avoid that.

1054
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:26,170
And if I say something personal, it has to be more applicable to everyone than telling people my story, right?

1055
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:26,530
Right.

1056
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:29,750
No, generally you'll give an anecdote, and it's usually not about you at all.

1057
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:31,370
It's about something that you observed.

1058
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:32,450
Right.

1059
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:37,110
Like I – you know, like if a guy goes to a drugstore and he says, what do you got for crabs?

1060
00:51:37,110 --> 00:51:38,670
I have a friend who's got crabs, right?

1061
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:39,050
Remember that?

1062
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:41,570
I have a friend who has hemorrhoids.

1063
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:42,330
What do you got for that?

1064
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:43,050
Yeah, sure you do.

1065
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:43,650
You should have a friend.

1066
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:44,150
You know what I mean?

1067
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:46,030
It's kind of like – it's another anecdote, right?

1068
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:47,170
True, true.

1069
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:51,770
But no, generally, though, you'll just tell a story like I was out, I saw this, I heard this.

1070
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:54,730
You don't really tell your story, so to speak.

1071
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:54,910
Yeah.

1072
00:51:54,910 --> 00:52:02,990
I like to avoid – again, when you go online and podcast, it's all about me, me, me, me, and this is not about me.

1073
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:03,730
It's about you.

1074
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:07,150
By the way, if you – this is not a joke.

1075
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:08,410
Maybe you could take it as such.

1076
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:11,090
You hear a lot of me, me, me, me in the world, right?

1077
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:12,110
Always, wherever you go.

1078
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:13,510
Mine, right?

1079
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:16,170
Yours, mine, you know, me, me, me.

1080
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:22,850
If you go to a bar in Vietnam and just open the door and yell out, me!

1081
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:24,790
You know, like half the – maybe not half.

1082
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:27,210
If there's 50 guys in there, like 10 will look at you.

1083
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:32,190
Like you called them with their name because me is an actual name in Vietnam.

1084
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:32,670
Right.

1085
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:35,510
Like John or Steve or Tom.

1086
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:35,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1087
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:38,490
You went into a bar that was busy and you said, Steve or Tom.

1088
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:38,730
You know what I mean?

1089
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:42,490
How many people are going to look up like you're – handful, most likely.

1090
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:42,790
Yeah, yeah.

1091
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:43,270
Very common.

1092
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:44,670
Yeah, me, Ho Chi Minh.

1093
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:45,690
Anyway, stuff like that.

1094
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:46,470
Yeah, right.

1095
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:48,390
Ho Chi Minh.

1096
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:48,530
Survival.

1097
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:54,310
Well, I found myself, okay, years ago, more, about 30 years ago, in cycling, mountain biking

1098
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:57,130
or whatever, Jersey area, right?

1099
00:52:57,230 --> 00:53:02,990
Like off of Bear Mountain and more, let's say, west or east that area.

1100
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:05,050
You know, Hudson River Valley, New York, you know?

1101
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:05,490
Okay.

1102
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:10,090
Yeah, you get the metro, you know, you get the train going north, you get off, you know,

1103
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:12,350
this one, and you go riding in the – right?

1104
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:12,950
Okay.

1105
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:17,970
Anyway, when the forest gets deep enough, you get disoriented and suddenly it's dark

1106
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:24,730
and you're like, oh, shit, and we think we got to go this way to get to a road and you

1107
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:27,430
keep going and you're getting deeper into the woods.

1108
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:29,290
It's like, how can you be so disoriented, right?

1109
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:34,530
And it gets to the point where you try to find a shelter and it's starting to rain

1110
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:35,850
and you're not prepared for it.

1111
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:41,030
You just got one layer of clothing on and you start to make a fire and you don't have

1112
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:45,210
any kindling so everybody has to contribute whatever paper money they have so we can start

1113
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:45,730
the fire.

1114
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:49,490
I don't know if that sounds – I don't know if the story is getting interesting here.

1115
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:54,010
I've never heard of people contributing money to a fire in that situation.

1116
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:58,290
Yeah, you couldn't get anything to start and say, oh, let's use a dollar.

1117
00:53:58,990 --> 00:53:59,330
Okay.

1118
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:00,670
Let's use two dollars, right?

1119
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:02,150
Okay, I guess so.

1120
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:02,530
Why not?

1121
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:04,150
Yeah, it works, by the way.

1122
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:04,490
Yeah.

1123
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:05,830
Because, you know, they call it paper money.

1124
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:07,190
It's mostly cotton, by the way.

1125
00:54:08,030 --> 00:54:09,230
Money is mostly cotton.

1126
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:12,210
Like in other countries now, it's plastic, right?

1127
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:13,710
In Australia, they have plastic money.

1128
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:16,630
It's some kind of like a tie-back, right?

1129
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:21,290
Anyway, so you get to these points here and then you got to find a place to sleep.

1130
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:25,430
And you're like, holy shit, this is some serious survival of shit.

1131
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:27,010
There's a big difference.

1132
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:31,330
Okay, not serious because we got out of there when daybreak came but it wasn't easy.

1133
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:36,230
Unfortunately, it was early spring, late – it was like just after winter but, you know,

1134
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:38,690
in the springtime at night, it gets pretty cold.

1135
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:42,990
I mean, not like winter where you'll threaten your life but you're not going to be comfortable at all.

1136
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:46,810
See, I've known people that have done this in like the Pinelands area which is the south part of Jersey.

1137
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:51,230
It's a little different but similar concept, I assure you.

1138
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:56,770
Yeah, but the whole plan was to go out and get back to the city, right?

1139
00:54:56,950 --> 00:54:58,350
Not to get lost, right?

1140
00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:02,490
And when we started getting lost, we didn't take it seriously enough.

1141
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:03,270
We'll find our way out.

1142
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:04,710
We actually were doing worse and worse.

1143
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:08,150
So, anyway, this is a common thing.

1144
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:08,610
No, no.

1145
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:09,810
Then it starts to get dark.

1146
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:11,810
Yeah, no, but like I said, in the Pinelands, same thing.

1147
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,230
It starts to get dark and you go, wait a minute.

1148
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:15,430
We're going to wind up wandering through these woods in the dark.

1149
00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:15,910
Forget it.

1150
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:16,510
No, it's that way.

1151
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:17,750
Yeah, so maybe we should –

1152
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:22,030
The worst is – well, the worst part is when everyone agrees that we should go in that direction

1153
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:25,170
and then the worst part is when you find out you're going in the wrong direction.

1154
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:29,490
Then it gets worse when every one person thinks we should go this way and the other person thinks we should go that way.

1155
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:32,050
Then it starts to get worse and worse and worse, right?

1156
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:34,850
So, that's when you know everything is going south.

1157
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:36,150
But here's the thing.

1158
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:42,110
When I say survival situation, it's more taking you back this way, the way I just mentioned.

1159
00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:44,510
You weren't expecting to be in a survival situation.

1160
00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:49,210
It's very different from saying I'm going to be put into a survival situation.

1161
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:49,990
Yeah, of course.

1162
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:51,350
Very different.

1163
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:57,210
So, when people say survival situation, I mean intentional or unintentional, right?

1164
00:55:57,430 --> 00:56:02,890
It's like the difference between being in a car accident or being a stuntman in a car accident.

1165
00:56:03,370 --> 00:56:04,170
Big difference.

1166
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:04,950
Big difference.

1167
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:05,350
Yes, you're right.

1168
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:08,210
They smash up the car in both cases, but guess what?

1169
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:09,070
Very different.

1170
00:56:09,710 --> 00:56:15,830
And by the way, just because it's a stuntman and he hit a plane doesn't mean he's not going to get hurt, right?

1171
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:16,310
True.

1172
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:19,690
There's plenty of stuntmen that get, you know, really hurt.

1173
00:56:20,190 --> 00:56:21,130
Seriously, yeah.

1174
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:22,790
But you don't hear about that.

1175
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:27,450
I think, by the way, when they make a film and the stuntman has been hurt, they should do a little tribute.

1176
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:28,950
It doesn't mean – I'm not saying killed.

1177
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:30,730
I'm just saying hurt.

1178
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:35,470
The most popular one was when they were shooting The Twilight Zone in the 80s

1179
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:38,230
and they dropped the helicopter and killed a whole bunch of people from that, right?

1180
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:39,030
Oh, yeah, right.

1181
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:43,830
That was Vic Morrow and a Vietnamese kid.

1182
00:56:44,290 --> 00:56:45,610
I forget the rest, but yeah.

1183
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:47,210
Yeah, I mean it went down.

1184
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:51,290
I mean it really went down, almost as like a real life battle scene would have.

1185
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:51,810
Right.

1186
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:56,910
So, when we say survival, I always bifurcate.

1187
00:56:56,910 --> 00:57:01,330
And I'm like, you're caught in a bad situation and you've got to make do is very different.

1188
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:05,170
So, one thing I've mentioned, I don't know, on the survival.

1189
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:10,590
Real quick, if you need a plant to eat, do you remember the protocols on that?

1190
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:15,430
Chuck, I've gone over it maybe with you at least once or twice on the O and G.

1191
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:18,730
Maybe I'll go over it really quick before we depart from the energy.

1192
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:21,290
Yeah, because I don't remember you going over this actually.

1193
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:22,310
I don't recall it.

1194
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:22,630
Okay.

1195
00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:28,370
So, just like we didn't expect to get lost in the pylons or whatever,

1196
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:31,710
you may not expect that you're going to need to find a plant to eat, but you might, right?

1197
00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:32,550
So, what do you do?

1198
00:57:33,330 --> 00:57:42,210
Well, the way is before you ingest it, you take the plant and you rub it in your fingers and your hand, right?

1199
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:46,010
So, before I get into this, it's not like the method that I'm giving you now,

1200
00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:48,790
it's not like you're going to see a plant do a few things and eat it right away.

1201
00:57:48,890 --> 00:57:50,950
This takes a few hours, right?

1202
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:53,170
But you'll want to eat a plant.

1203
00:57:53,810 --> 00:57:58,450
In other words, it's not life or death because if there's plants around, greenery,

1204
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:00,590
you're going to want to eat it.

1205
00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:02,430
You've got plenty of time.

1206
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:04,510
It's not like you're going to die in four hours if you don't, right?

1207
00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:05,450
You have days and days.

1208
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:09,270
So, even though it's a several-hour process, at least it gets you started.

1209
00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:15,550
If you're not familiar with the botany, rub it in your hands and you let it go and you wait a few minutes.

1210
00:58:16,370 --> 00:58:18,010
No reaction, right?

1211
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:22,830
Then you take it and you rub it on the soft parts, the susceptible parts of your body,

1212
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:24,390
which is the inner part of your wrist.

1213
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:27,190
You ever see how women put perfume on the inner part of their wrist?

1214
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:32,830
Believe it or not, the palm is one of the toughest parts of the hands or the upper body,

1215
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:38,890
but just a few inches down at your wrist is one of the most sensitive and receptive parts of the upper body,

1216
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:41,650
which is the wrist, right, the inner part of the wrist.

1217
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:44,550
The other part is the inside of the elbow and the armpit.

1218
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:46,930
The armpit might be even more susceptible.

1219
00:58:46,930 --> 00:58:48,290
In other words, sensitive.

1220
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:51,790
In other words, if you're going to have a reaction with something,

1221
00:58:52,370 --> 00:58:56,830
if you rub it on the inside part of your wrist or the inside part of your elbow or your armpit,

1222
00:58:57,130 --> 00:59:01,670
you'll know if it's going to react with you if you touch those areas.

1223
00:59:01,850 --> 00:59:04,430
Very different from the outer forearm or shoulder, right?

1224
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:04,890
Right.

1225
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:07,130
Okay, it's the under-soft parts.

1226
00:59:07,270 --> 00:59:12,970
Okay, so what you do is you rub the plant on the wrist, elbow, armpit, and you wait.

1227
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:15,650
No reaction, right?

1228
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:16,590
Okay, great.

1229
00:59:17,230 --> 00:59:21,970
So the other thing you do after that no reaction, you smell it, obviously, through all this.

1230
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:24,110
You will get the smell of it, like it or not.

1231
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:28,750
The other thing there is you rub it on your lower lip, upper lip.

1232
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:32,670
Not in your mouth, not on your teeth, just on the upper, lower lip.

1233
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:33,930
Now we're getting more sensitive.

1234
00:59:34,850 --> 00:59:35,690
And you wait.

1235
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:36,690
How long?

1236
00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:39,550
Five minutes, ten minutes, an hour would be really safe.

1237
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:40,930
No reaction.

1238
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:42,910
Now here's the thing.

1239
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:45,030
You can rub it on your palm, no reaction.

1240
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:47,070
Wrist, elbow, armpit, no reaction.

1241
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:49,430
Rub it on your lips, you get a big reaction, right?

1242
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:50,230
It's possible.

1243
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:50,690
Could be.

1244
00:59:51,370 --> 00:59:51,990
Yeah, right?

1245
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:55,130
Well, that's a stopping point, isn't it?

1246
00:59:55,390 --> 00:59:55,710
Oh, yeah.

1247
00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:57,470
Even though it passed the other two tests.

1248
00:59:58,190 --> 00:59:59,650
Third test would be the upper lip load.

1249
00:59:59,710 --> 01:00:00,390
No reaction.

1250
01:00:00,610 --> 01:00:02,830
Now we take a bite of it.

1251
01:00:03,450 --> 01:00:05,290
One, two, three, chew, spit it out.

1252
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:11,170
You may not have had a reaction on your lip and the other two processes, right?

1253
01:00:11,170 --> 01:00:13,930
On the wrist, elbow, armpit, no reaction.

1254
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:14,530
No reaction on the lip.

1255
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:16,150
You take a bite, chew, spit it out.

1256
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:17,150
Now you get a reaction.

1257
01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:18,370
That's your stopping point.

1258
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:19,210
Right.

1259
01:00:19,270 --> 01:00:21,610
Reaction could be several things, right?

1260
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:22,330
You know.

1261
01:00:22,390 --> 01:00:23,250
Your body will know.

1262
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:27,890
It will communicate to you without sound, without voice, right?

1263
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:30,350
That's where the inner mind gets really quiet.

1264
01:00:30,470 --> 01:00:30,930
You'll know.

1265
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:33,070
And then you'll have to make up words to describe it.

1266
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:36,690
No reaction at this point still, right?

1267
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:38,430
If you have a reaction, well, that's your stopping point.

1268
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:39,310
No reaction, okay.

1269
01:00:39,310 --> 01:00:44,850
The next thing is you put it in your mouth and chew it again, but this time a little bit longer,

1270
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:50,910
until the contents of it in your mouth reaches the same temperature as your mouth.

1271
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:54,510
You notice that you could take a bite of a cold sandwich.

1272
01:00:54,930 --> 01:00:57,610
When you start chewing it, describe what it is.

1273
01:00:57,630 --> 01:00:58,190
It's a cold.

1274
01:00:58,310 --> 01:00:59,150
It's still cold, right?

1275
01:00:59,210 --> 01:01:00,270
You chew, chew, chew, chew.

1276
01:01:00,350 --> 01:01:00,830
Now what happens?

1277
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:01,470
It starts to what?

1278
01:01:01,810 --> 01:01:03,490
Warm up in your mouth, doesn't it?

1279
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:05,410
You no longer sense that it's cold.

1280
01:01:05,410 --> 01:01:09,150
We're not talking about eating, dousing yourself with ice cream where you get brain freeze.

1281
01:01:09,270 --> 01:01:10,790
That stays cold all the time, you know?

1282
01:01:11,070 --> 01:01:11,170
Right, right.

1283
01:01:11,390 --> 01:01:14,490
But you just chew on it until it reaches temperature.

1284
01:01:14,650 --> 01:01:15,210
Throw it out.

1285
01:01:15,350 --> 01:01:15,910
Spit it out.

1286
01:01:17,190 --> 01:01:17,910
No reaction.

1287
01:01:18,090 --> 01:01:20,290
Well, now is the time to take a little bit and swallow it.

1288
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:22,190
Oh, reaction.

1289
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:22,870
Bad reaction.

1290
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:23,390
Well, stop.

1291
01:01:23,490 --> 01:01:24,370
You just took a little bit.

1292
01:01:24,450 --> 01:01:24,890
Yeah, of course.

1293
01:01:25,610 --> 01:01:25,770
Right?

1294
01:01:25,930 --> 01:01:32,790
But by the way, if it passes the wrist, elbow, armpit, lower lip, single bite and chew,

1295
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:36,930
the chances of you swallowing it at that point, the body works so well.

1296
01:01:37,090 --> 01:01:41,690
We're put together well enough that if it passes all those preliminary tests,

1297
01:01:42,050 --> 01:01:44,710
you probably won't get a reaction when you chew it and sweep it.

1298
01:01:44,990 --> 01:01:49,570
Now, you might want to wait because it might taste good and not have a reaction,

1299
01:01:49,950 --> 01:01:50,770
but it might be what?

1300
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:51,930
A super laxative.

1301
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:53,930
So, right?

1302
01:01:54,530 --> 01:01:55,990
So that might take another go.

1303
01:01:56,010 --> 01:01:57,750
And that becomes an inconvenience right there.

1304
01:01:57,890 --> 01:01:58,290
Yeah, right.

1305
01:01:58,290 --> 01:01:59,090
Yeah, right.

1306
01:01:59,150 --> 01:01:59,950
And it may not be good.

1307
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:04,610
For example, a super laxative, if you were on a deserted island and you just had coconuts,

1308
01:02:04,670 --> 01:02:05,870
you would be dead to eat.

1309
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:07,050
And coconut, right?

1310
01:02:07,110 --> 01:02:08,690
Just coconuts, you'd die in two weeks.

1311
01:02:08,790 --> 01:02:12,030
Yeah, because you'll just dehydrate yourself to death.

1312
01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:12,270
You'll die.

1313
01:02:12,530 --> 01:02:12,690
Right.

1314
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:13,230
Yeah.

1315
01:02:13,350 --> 01:02:14,610
You think it's because it's so on.

1316
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:20,090
It's such a gun into the plant's so tall and the coconut wants to go down.

1317
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:24,430
So, it's going to be a very radical trip up and a very radical trip down.

1318
01:02:25,010 --> 01:02:25,410
Extreme.

1319
01:02:25,730 --> 01:02:29,670
