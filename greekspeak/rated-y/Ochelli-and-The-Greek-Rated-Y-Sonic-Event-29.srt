1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:17,000
The sonic event 29, I think, one of them apparently disappeared off my website already, and I'm

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,600
not sure exactly why it did that.

3
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:24,960
But I think that's the one where I call the intelligence agencies panty sniffers.

4
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,580
That's all I said like 15 times in the past three minutes.

5
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,680
Yes, I think I'm and I watch them wrong.

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,740
Watch. It's 26.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,820
No, no, you're about right.

8
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,220
Fifteen is about right.

9
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,660
As to how many times you've just repeated that to me when I keep saying different things about it.

10
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,120
Yeah, I said that's the one where I call.

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,780
Remember, these people have nothing.

12
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:49,680
Doctors, lawyers, intelligence agencies, politicians, the it's all of it is social rank.

13
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,100
They like to come over to you and say, I'm a doctor.

14
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,600
And, oh, yes, sir.

15
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:58,280
You know, or the FBI comes to your door and you start talking about is what do you mean government?

16
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,440
I am the government, you know, all this stuff.

17
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,200
These people have nothing, zero.

18
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,220
And the only thing they have is social rank.

19
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,720
Right. Actually, there is a code in the military disrespecting someone's rank.

20
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,780
Right. Well, it's very broad.

21
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:18,080
There must be an illusion of authority must be projected by a title.

22
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,700
That's something, whether it's military or it's the hierarchy, it's all this stuff, though,

23
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:30,380
because if you don't call a king or queen by their proper name, they might have your head beaten.

24
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,580
Right. I mean, same thing, you know, used to be that would take your head off.

25
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,800
But nowadays, you know, probably just somebody beats you up in a funny hat.

26
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,740
Right. I mean, isn't that about the way that works or they still do it?

27
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:47,560
What they do is they'll clone you and take your consciousness when you're sleeping and then take your head off over and over and over.

28
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,460
Wonderful. Yeah.

29
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:55,580
So, you know, they made a Black Mirror episode about that, this guy that kept executing his consciousness in this weird thing.

30
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:05,060
So you could go into this, you know, like one of those amusement parks and you could virtually like keep executing the guy and his consciousness coming.

31
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,320
Did you ever see that? No, no.

32
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,940
It's all. No, but it's all telling you the same.

33
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:14,080
You know, cosmically, it doesn't matter if you label it fact or fiction.

34
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,060
Well, Black Mirror did a lot of that stuff, by the way.

35
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,840
Black Mirror did a lot of weird stuff like that.

36
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,720
You'd be amazed at consciousness.

37
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,540
So in other words, are you saying Black Mirror put that out there?

38
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:36,720
Yeah, they did a bunch of stuff, weird things about the implants and your memory being messed with and you recording your memory and being able to play it back and having it held against you.

39
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:40,380
The social credit system trapping people's consciousness.

40
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,960
Like there's this one where this guy, his wife dies and he wants to retain his wife's consciousness.

41
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,680
So they put it in his head and then he carries her around for a while.

42
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,160
And then after a while, you can't stand it anymore.

43
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:57,480
Yeah, well, dude, I don't want I don't want any woman I've ever been with in my head.

44
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:02,900
Are you kidding me? But the thing is, he keeps her around for a little while and then he's worried his daughter will miss her.

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,200
So he sticks her in a teddy bear.

46
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,960
It's messed up.

47
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:12,720
If you ever want to entertain yourself with the darker end of like how this could torture human beings, that's Black Mirror.

48
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,420
And of course, the Black Mirror is the stupid rectangle, the black screen, right?

49
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,340
Because it reflects back at you.

50
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,340
And that's the point of it.

51
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,060
Well, they give you all these little toys.

52
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:21,840
Yeah, go ahead. Sorry.

53
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:29,640
No, no. The tablet, the screen, the stupid rectangle, regardless if it's a tube, you know, the cathode ray tube or flat, it does the same purpose.

54
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:39,120
And the people that got behind manifesting that in earnest, in other words, to really make it buildable, practically buildable were occultists.

55
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:46,680
And they if you ask them why they were developing these things, they said to get into other worlds, to bring other worlds here.

56
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:54,540
So and the weird thing is that that's actually changed over time because you had the different alpha waves that were being attacked by the television and the flicker rates.

57
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,260
Now there's no flicker rate because of the different replacement that comes in.

58
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,060
This creates a different wave in the mind, right?

59
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,720
Or a different sort of mindset is set now by the screen.

60
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,140
Nobody talks about it.

61
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,160
But you remember the flicker rate thing with TV and all that.

62
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,300
It's still it's still there.

63
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:20,620
If you ever see a car, a video of a car with the headlights on, the headlights are blinking or a video, a lot of videos that I was watching a video of electronics show and they had LED lights on.

64
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,400
I saw the flicker rate with the new camera.

65
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,980
So I don't know. It goes back and forth.

66
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,280
I think a progressive scanning, right?

67
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,500
Progressive scanning. Yes.

68
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,820
You know, that's a little different, though.

69
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,440
It creates a different sort of a subtle thing that your mind gets set to.

70
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:46,040
That's a weird reactive like I don't understand all of that, but I do understand that just like with the tones and music and things that they can be constructed in such a way to encourage certain things, right?

71
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,640
The different semitones and stuff.

72
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,280
I don't know if you remember all the lawsuits and everything over the heavy metal and the rock music and stuff.

73
00:04:53,400 --> 00:05:00,420
And there were some people tried to bring in scientific evidence about the the semitones and like Ozzy Osbourne's music and things like that.

74
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,160
You remember that stuff?

75
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,900
Yeah. Well, yeah, that was the whole age.

76
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,940
Talk about the 90s.

77
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,500
Yeah, well, the 80s and 90s.

78
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,060
But yeah, yeah, yeah.

79
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:08,640
Yeah. Yeah.

80
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,880
I think the music is really benign.

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:20,360
It's really that they get you more in the in the stuff that you use, like, you know, the logos on packages, I think are far more powerful because not everyone's going to buy.

82
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,820
I never heard a rock and roll musician selling seven billion albums.

83
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:29,760
Right. But, you know, you see the structure is nefarious.

84
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,180
But it's very, very subtle.

85
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,280
All right. Yeah.

86
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:38,580
Like the oddity of the X's and the different geometric signals that are sent through these.

87
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,900
What did you call them again?

88
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,860
That the different symbols.

89
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,140
I mean, they're they're geometric in nature.

90
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,620
Scalar antennas, I call scalar antennas.

91
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:52,560
That's it. And they definitely do receive and and they send and receive.

92
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:59,620
Right. It seems like it's a broadcast through changing kind of like when you put Spice on

93
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,120
something, it does.

94
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,920
It's just giving off what it has.

95
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:10,760
What I mean by scalar, it doesn't matter if it's out in the open or you put it away in a cupboard, whether you see it or not or know where it is.

96
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,380
It's still pumping. That's what scalar is.

97
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:16,760
That's why these new age people talk about scalar waves that there's no scalar.

98
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,960
It doesn't make waves. Scalar is the part that doesn't have a waveform.

99
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:26,380
Right. So anyway, why does that work, though, when you block it out with a marker than in that case?

100
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:30,380
Because otherwise, I mean, if I put it behind a wall, I can't see it, but it's still broadcasting.

101
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,780
Right. There's a that's where the research comes in.

102
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:40,380
There's a depth. If you look at that photograph or of the logo, the printing, it looks 2D flat.

103
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,500
But if you put it under a microscope, the ink looks like little mountain, mountain ranges on the paper.

104
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:54,080
Right. So, you know, it's 3D, you know, if you look at a bright, shiny ball bearing chrome metal under a microscope, it looks like the Grand Canyon.

105
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,800
Right. Well, it's not that smooth.

106
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:03,920
Yeah. Actually, depending on the scale, again, because even with photographs, right, because I used to study black and white photographs a lot.

107
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:15,380
You know why? It was really interesting to me that, you know, in the digital age, you don't have these gradients where, you know, there's the different levels of, you know, of the print in there.

108
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:18,980
And there's a lot of information, actually, in black and white photograph.

109
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:25,160
Like why people are so struck by them is because they're very they're very third dimension.

110
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,200
Basically, you have a third dimension in a black and white photograph.

111
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:36,360
It's very subtle. It's that's where just to get back to how it's scalar and what it does, if you don't see it and block it out, it's it's both 2D and 3D.

112
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:44,600
And then it also goes in the 1D, which is the spiritual realm, let's say 1D, 2D, 3D is just measurement systems.

113
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:49,180
Right. But which is say on on the subtlety of perceive of a perception.

114
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,860
It's the intent.

115
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,600
And the panty snippers, the panty snippers don't know this stuff.

116
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,640
They're just using it, though.

117
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,480
Right. Yeah.

118
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,960
Yeah. No, they're just killer.

119
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,780
Oh, by the way, the reason why you there are so many, quote unquote, government employees.

120
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:03,360
Yes.

121
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:13,140
You don't rebel against someone or an organization that you rely to get your pay for, let's say, a roof over your head and feed your children.

122
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,200
It's no one ever rebels against anyone that gets a paycheck from.

123
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,960
Well, nobody's going to set fire to the food stamp office is what you're telling me.

124
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:29,160
Yeah, that's right. That's why I mean, when you look at the rebellion, when let's say the French Revolution, she said, let them eat their children.

125
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:35,240
They changed it to let them eat cake because I was too much of an expose.

126
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:41,720
The reason that people rebelled is because the king was taking and the people couldn't take.

127
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,260
Right. But excuse me.

128
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,660
The irony of it is there is no money.

129
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:54,680
All substances and things that are being produced and created are done by credit to people's ignorance on how it works.

130
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,520
You know how you open a bank. It's real easy.

131
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,480
The Federal Reserve tells you it takes a couple of years.

132
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:07,360
But if you have contacts, you get a number, which is a privileged number to the Fed window.

133
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,620
You get a little office space.

134
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:14,600
You put a sign outside and a desk and a computer and you put out that you give loans.

135
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:24,520
So people walk in, you put them through a little rigmarole like it, you know, and the moment they sign the promissory note, you go to the terminal, you put a transaction number, which goes to the Federal Reserve, whatever.

136
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,060
And it shows the amount that they signed for.

137
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:31,080
And then you switch that amount to an account to get access or write them a check.

138
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,820
You have no money. There's no it works.

139
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,200
You see. So this is how the system works and the people don't care and they want it.

140
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,320
Well, there you go. So it sounds like you cut off there for a second.

141
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,320
I don't know what happened. Oh, look at that.

142
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,920
OK, so a little loss in Internet there on your end.

143
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,620
So go ahead.

144
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:02,740
By the way, the last thing people would have heard there is you said the people want it and then boom, you were gone.

145
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:07,600
Well, then the screen went black and says no Internet connection and just checked up on it.

146
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,520
So I'm on the stupid rectangle, which has data.

147
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,120
Nice. Yeah.

148
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,360
So we're on. That's how the people want it.

149
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,860
Wicked and whatever.

150
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,820
But, yeah, the the logos, I think, is on the packaging and the scalar aspect intent.

151
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,080
It goes very deep and it goes all around.

152
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,580
It's good to keep it light.

153
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:31,560
And I've always said, look, if you're on Earth, you somehow cosmically you stepped in shit.

154
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,040
It's the same thing. Right.

155
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,920
So, you know, when you go to a place and you stepped in shit, you know, and everybody else knows it.

156
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,160
So go clean that off. Right.

157
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,200
Oh, yeah. So if you've said you've come to Earth, they're like, did you clean up?

158
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,340
You know, what do you mean you're on Earth?

159
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,480
That's pretty screwy.

160
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,540
So, yeah.

161
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:53,700
By the way, even if you let's go back to scripture, there is nothing, absolutely nothing, zero.

162
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:57,560
The Christ said there was any anything positive about being here.

163
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,640
Not a one thing.

164
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,240
Ever. It's in scripture.

165
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,320
So but that's OK.

166
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,960
You don't have that much time anyway.

167
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,040
70, 80, 90, 100 years, whatever.

168
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,440
That's like minimal.

169
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:14,560
In terms of even you forget about years, you want to look at it in terms of heartbeats, you know.

170
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,500
So. Right.

171
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,160
Let's let's go back to it.

172
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,820
I want what I want to get into some light stuff.

173
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,700
I like to give a lot of practical stuff just to bounce around.

174
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,780
I want to get into the emo.

175
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,540
Two things I haven't gotten into.

176
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,540
Well, I have gotten into the practical stuff.

177
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:34,620
Yes. Like, for example, if someone asked me in a household way, most practical thing is all of your

178
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:39,460
soaps, not not laundry detergents, but dilute them and put them in a sprayed bottle.

179
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,400
All right. Like you're cleaning soaps and also have some hydrogen peroxide in a spray bottle, which is easy.

180
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,280
They already come in a dark hydrogen peroxide should be kept out of the light, by the way.

181
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,480
It's funny how that that is a requirement.

182
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,820
Hydrogen peroxide, but they don't transfer over to regular water.

183
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,440
Right. It will lose its efficacy.

184
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,400
It's acidic. But, you know, using hydrogen peroxide as a strong cleaner, it's an oxidizer.

185
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:08,120
You know, if you have pets and you clean up after a pet on the floor, wipe it with hydrogen peroxide.

186
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,060
Give you a quick story about cleaners.

187
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,660
And, you know, I mentioned supermarkets early earlier.

188
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,260
I went to an Albertsons, which is a regular supermarket.

189
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,820
I went to the back to the hot counter.

190
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,980
I didn't feel like cooking. Got some fried chicken.

191
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,380
I didn't need it. I fed it to the cats.

192
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,100
Wasn't up to par because I can taste the feed.

193
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:31,780
If the meat is not good, it doesn't matter if it's beef or lamb or usually a lamb is pretty good.

194
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,800
But beef or chicken, I can smell what they were feeding the animal.

195
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,540
If they were giving them vegetarian feed or animal, you know, science say, oh, our animals need more protein.

196
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:45,300
So they buy protein, which is derived from animals to give to animals that shouldn't be eating that.

197
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,120
Right. Right. So I brought the fried chicken home.

198
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,320
And I said, this really smells like the feed they were feeding the chicken, you know.

199
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,480
And here's an example.

200
00:12:53,480 --> 00:13:00,240
If you've ever had grass fed beef, it tastes like grass fed beef where corn fed beef tastes like corn fed beef.

201
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,060
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

202
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,720
So let me ask you something about chicken, actually.

203
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:15,360
Really quick is that I've noted in the past, say, three, four years especially, that a lot of times I'll cook chicken and now parts of the chicken turn black.

204
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,820
This is blood. That's blood.

205
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,920
Yeah, but this is hasn't been drained.

206
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,320
Well, but but I haven't.

207
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,860
I didn't used to see that a lot.

208
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,500
You know, yeah. Most of my life has been drained.

209
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,240
Well, OK. I was just curious.

210
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,500
In other words, you're cutting short.

211
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,280
Yeah. Well, here's the thing.

212
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,960
You live in a this is a capitalist world now.

213
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:38,700
One of the rules about capitalism is if you're done using something or you can't use it, you ruin it.

214
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,760
So no one else can.

215
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,440
Right. So that's a rule of capitalism.

216
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,440
So that's why if you look at the US, every time they go into a country, they ruin it.

217
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,300
Right. Except for Japan, because they didn't win the war.

218
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,360
They lost the war in Japan.

219
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,320
Right. But the winner writes the history.

220
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,260
So the Japanese said, no, no, you're going to say you won because two reasons.

221
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:04,940
One, if you say you lost all the money we have in Swiss bank accounts and dollars will be will be devalued to zero because that's international law, by the way.

222
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,580
Right. When a country loses a war, they their currency is devalued.

223
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,200
And so we're going to lose the wealth that we've got.

224
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,380
The other thing is we want to boost ourselves industrially.

225
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,280
We're going to take over your industry, which they did.

226
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:24,140
So cars, electronics industry, World Trade Center, all the steel was not good enough from the US.

227
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,280
It had to come from Japan.

228
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,840
Right. All of it.

229
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,780
All the main skyscrapers, the steel comes from Japan.

230
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:35,500
You can look this up. So where was I back to the chicken, the chicken?

231
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:41,600
Yes. So they have these deli cases now where you pick up the front glass to clean the inside and the backside.

232
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:46,680
So this little snotball manager, you could tell he was like a 25 year old guy.

233
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,240
You know, they get like a hundred grand manager in a supermarket, right?

234
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,520
Because the supermarket does a million dollars a day on a weekend.

235
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:56,220
Right. It's a little slimy, you know, white boy, whatever.

236
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,640
And I say white boy, it's not racial.

237
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:05,720
It's just like if you got to know him, everything that comes out of his mouth and you learned on television or college, not much in college.

238
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,460
College was about drinking, getting laid.

239
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:14,460
So, I mean, one of these people that are just like, well, think about the Spanish word for for white, you know, blanco.

240
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:21,760
And that's about how it translates, you know, basically just exuded that, you know, like you just want to punch him and you don't know why.

241
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,740
Right. But anyway, and he had his Polo Oxford shirt on or whatever.

242
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:31,720
And he's given the guys in the back behind the deli counter who were really busy, a hard time about the deli case glass being dirty.

243
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,640
So he goes and grabs a thing, a Windex glass cleaner, the blue stuff.

244
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,700
And he lifts up the glass and he's ready to spray.

245
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,380
And I'm 20 feet over to the right.

246
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,960
And I look over, I said, don't spray that.

247
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,960
Don't spray that.

248
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,540
Spray it on the paper first.

249
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,060
And he heard me. He stopped, but he never looked over to me.

250
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,820
He always just looked forward and down like he didn't acknowledge me.

251
00:15:52,820 --> 00:16:00,240
But then he stopped pulling the trigger and he did spray it on the paper and said, you should be using distilled water or hydrogen peroxide for that.

252
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:05,040
Not on the food. And he's looking forward and he's starting to turn pink and red.

253
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:09,220
Right. And, you know, and that's that's how I do it.

254
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,860
That's how people look. Most people would think that know what I'm telling you would think that.

255
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,320
But I always say, if you want to know what I'm thinking, listen to what I'm saying.

256
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,840
I have no inner monologue.

257
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,420
I project everything that I'm thinking through my mouth.

258
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,700
Right. Because the stuff that I use internally has no voice.

259
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,120
It's totally silent. It's based on feeling.

260
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,020
Right. But not the feeling that most people think.

261
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:40,340
So anyway, I didn't get kicked out of the store and that little white boy should have got a little white boy.

262
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:47,220
He was like six foot five, 200 pound, muscular, clear, strong jaw line, very clean cut.

263
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,160
You know what I mean?

264
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,000
Right. Whatever is not this, you know, whatever.

265
00:16:51,180 --> 00:17:03,440
So I sense these I sense people like, for example, I give the thing you got a junkyard dog or a dog that's supposed to protect the industrial building behind a fence.

266
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,460
Two people approach the fence.

267
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,339
Both don't say anything or gesture anything.

268
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,300
One of those two people are afraid of dogs.

269
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,520
The other one is a dog lover.

270
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:16,280
Who do you think immediately the dog is going to start barking at?

271
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,880
The guy who is afraid of dogs.

272
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,460
Do you see how this this correlates?

273
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:27,200
Right. So most people would look at the manager doing that.

274
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:31,320
Really. First of all, most people wouldn't even realize he's about to toxify the entire deli case.

275
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,760
And he's really stupid.

276
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,280
Most people wouldn't even think that.

277
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,420
And the small percentage that would see that wouldn't say anything.

278
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,440
Right. Well, is it really that bad, the Windex?

279
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:47,520
Because Windex is only like a little bit of blue coloring, really, and a touch of ammonia and water, supposedly.

280
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,960
I mean, that's the total contents of it.

281
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,800
That's the chemical.

282
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,100
But the energy is different.

283
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,500
Remember, it's an energy thing.

284
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,240
So I want to get into the practicality.

285
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,620
Outdoor lights.

286
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,240
I think I posted this in the chat.

287
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,840
I got back patio, front patio.

288
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,000
You got a nightlight, right?

289
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,860
It could be a globe fixture.

290
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,940
Usually it's a sconce mounted on the wall.

291
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,680
I have track lights mounted under the deck, but you don't see them unless you're really under them.

292
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,040
Bugs.

293
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:14,900
Summertime.

294
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:15,860
Little moths.

295
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,840
Little can't see them.

296
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,580
All kinds of stuff likes to gravitate towards the light.

297
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,260
And they fly around the light, blah, blah, blah, blah.

298
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:21,980
Right. Okay.

299
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,540
And then they stick on the light.

300
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,420
Right. They get dirty.

301
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,320
Makes the lights dirty.

302
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,080
Or they come inside when you open the door.

303
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,300
Or they fly around you.

304
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,380
It's a, you know, right.

305
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,440
Bugs. Moth goes to the flame.

306
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,460
Right. The bugs go to the light.

307
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,180
I'm like, you know, I've been wanting to do this for a long time.

308
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:35,580
And I have.

309
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,040
I said, I got to do this here.

310
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,380
This is the Taoist perspective.

311
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,880
Now, how would people treat that?

312
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,600
Oh, we got to get a bug zapper.

313
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,860
Oh, we got to get this.

314
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:46,700
Oh, turn on.

315
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,920
Or blah, blah, blah.

316
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,860
They make a special bulb, right?

317
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:50,600
Whatever.

318
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:55,260
Okay. Well, the Taoist perspective is the bug is really small and hard.

319
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,200
It makes him young.

320
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,860
He's a young creature, relatively.

321
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:58,280
Right.

322
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,440
And he also goes upward very easily compared to other animals, which makes him young.

323
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,240
Upward is young.

324
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:03,900
Downward is yin.

325
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:08,560
So from almost every measure, the bug is classified as a young creature.

326
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:13,580
From every measure, the light that's coming out of this, whether it's an LED bulb or mercury

327
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:16,300
or incandescent fluorescent, is very yin.

328
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,140
Starts off from one spot and it spreads out, right?

329
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:25,920
Not only is the light by nature yin, but it's actually flickering, which makes it even more yin.

330
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,280
And all these other yin qualities.

331
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,400
It gets warm, which is the yang quality.

332
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,980
But generally, the light is yin.

333
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,140
So you have very young going to very yin.

334
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,480
Oh, of course, right?

335
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:38,700
Yin and yang.

336
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,020
That's because they're opposites.

337
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:45,320
When I say yin and yang, a lot of people say, oh, opposites attract.

338
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,380
No, opposites do not attract.

339
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,500
This is not opposites.

340
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,860
It's easy to categorize them as such.

341
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:57,300
So what I need to do is to make, if that light were yangified, they would want to not go to it.

342
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,260
So let's pick blue.

343
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,840
Let's just put a little bit of blue within the vicinity of the light,

344
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:08,480
like an eighth-inch paintbrush, eighth-inch stripe of blue around the base of the bulb.

345
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:14,080
Or a piece of blue tape, if you have one of those globes, take the globe off,

346
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,060
put a rim of blue either on top of the globe, just a little bit, and some behind the bulb.

347
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,820
Put it all back together.

348
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,560
You say, oh, honey, do the lights look blue to me?

349
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,180
Blue to you?

350
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,080
She's like, no, they look just like they did before.

351
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,520
Okay, guess what?

352
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:27,920
No bugs.

353
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,260
Bugs stay away from the light.

354
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:32,710
Right?

355
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:33,590
That's interesting.

356
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:34,950
Where'd you read that?

357
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,170
No, it's all yin and yang.

358
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,990
You see the Taoist perspective, right?

359
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:48,590
So if you start going up in Taoism, it attaches itself to man know thyself, right?

360
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:52,750
And how can you know yourself if you know nothing about your environment?

361
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:57,370
Or how about if you know a lot about your environment, how can you not know about yourself?

362
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,210
You see the Taoist perspective?

363
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:03,590
Right, because you're just something within that environment anyway, so you should.

364
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:04,150
Yeah, okay.

365
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:05,870
Yeah, you're a part of that environment.

366
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,210
Like, you don't believe it?

367
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,330
Suck the air out of the environment.

368
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:08,990
How do you feel?

369
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:09,710
There you go.

370
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:13,130
Right, so again, back to feeling.

371
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,910
So I just wanted to give that as practicality.

372
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:19,110
And I just mentioned earlier, I never gave any driving tips, you know?

373
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,530
I don't like the word driving.

374
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,490
Driving is a commercial term, but let's just say.

375
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:23,710
I understand, right.

376
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,230
Okay, and you know, I used to give a joke.

377
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:31,670
Stevie Wonder, give them, Stevie, why don't you take the wheel, you know?

378
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,130
And this is not a bad joke.

379
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,810
Chuck, why don't you take the wheel while I'm talking about this, right?

380
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:36,290
Kind of thing.

381
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,650
So driving really depends on your sight, you know?

382
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:39,130
Absolutely.

383
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:40,310
You know what, though?

384
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,790
I give credit to Eddie Murphy on that one.

385
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:42,950
That's where I first heard it, you know?

386
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:43,750
Yeah, that's right.

387
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:44,430
That was Eddie Murphy.

388
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,270
Yeah, so it is a visual thing.

389
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:47,750
But you also have to be very careful.

390
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,830
Some of the things that I'm going to say, you have to be very keen on that.

391
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:53,690
Keen on what you perceive with your sight.

392
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:55,570
Two things I want to talk about.

393
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:56,230
Driving.

394
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:58,510
I used to give driving lessons over Skype.

395
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:01,610
It was about an hour long, and everyone on there came back and said,

396
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:02,950
I'm a better driver because of that.

397
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,530
It's like, what the hell, honey?

398
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:08,130
Because, you know, driving, you got to be, you know, you got to see pictures.

399
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:10,910
You got to be behind the wheel while you're learning all that bullshit.

400
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:14,230
It's all between the ears, right?

401
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,770
And you start with the ears to go in between the ears.

402
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:23,130
So for those of you that do operate an engine-driven wagon and not an automobile,

403
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:26,510
if it was an automobile, we would never think about gas prices

404
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,830
because you wouldn't need gas because it's automobile, right?

405
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:33,090
So anyway, all right, two things on the driving.

406
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:35,190
One is parking, the damn thing.

407
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:40,190
And the other one is when you're going on curvy roads, right?

408
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:43,010
That's, those are two things where most people get the most hiccups

409
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:46,270
and the most comments if they have, quote unquote, passengers, right?

410
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:48,730
Passengers is a commercial term, by the way.

411
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:52,850
I never had passengers because no one ever paid me to drive them around.

412
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,730
And I was never driving.

413
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:57,950
And if that ever happened, it would be a private contract.

414
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:59,250
So it's out of the commercial thing.

415
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,770
You see, this is one way to think about it.

416
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:06,490
But if you keep that, the intent in there, it's better than falling into the collective language.

417
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,890
So those are two key things that are problems.

418
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:11,210
Look, I don't have a lot of experience driving.

419
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:14,710
Parking and curvy roads are where you're going to get the most comments, yeah.

420
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:15,750
Okay, okay.

421
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:16,810
Right? You with me on that?

422
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:17,830
Sure, I got you. All right.

423
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,850
Okay, so most parking, you have parallel parking.

424
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:27,210
And we're not going to get into that because most parking that you see in most parts of the country

425
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:31,550
is where you just drive, you go down a parking lane and you make a left or a right into a spot.

426
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:32,470
Right?

427
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,330
And then you pull out.

428
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:34,630
Right?

429
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,730
And we're talking about driving here, nothing else.

430
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:37,170
Right, guys?

431
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:37,710
Pulling out.

432
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:38,010
Anyway.

433
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:38,750
Yeah, I got you.

434
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:49,470
So when we do that, very often, that's like a one, it should be, okay, let's do the parking.

435
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:55,070
So you go into one of these supermarket places like I was yesterday and you got a big parking lot

436
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:59,950
and you have an arrow painted, you know, this way down this lane and the parking spots are slightly

437
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:03,350
angled towards the direction that you're going down, right, to just go right in.

438
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:07,250
And sometimes if you go where the arrow is pointing against you, you're like, oh, it's really,

439
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:10,010
I can't get in here because all the angle is against my steering, right?

440
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:13,290
Okay, so you got to go down the lane where, how it's marked.

441
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:17,430
So let's say you see a spot on the right and spot on the left, pick a side.

442
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:19,270
Okay, so you pick the left.

443
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:25,790
So what you do is you spot up ahead, let's see, a few car links or a few spots.

444
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:28,010
You're going to turn a left into this spot, right?

445
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:28,550
Okay.

446
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,910
And you're going to turn in there.

447
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,970
It should be a one-shot maneuver and it usually is, but sometimes it's not.

448
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,430
People are not centered or whatever.

449
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:39,030
They have to pull back and center too close to one side or whatever.

450
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:43,770
So what you do is you start approaching, you're going to go into the left spot.

451
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:48,030
You try to right yourself as much as possible to increase your radius.

452
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:52,830
So when you go in there, your radius is larger, so you're not going on a sharp angle.

453
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:58,890
And as you're going into the spot, as you start getting, let's say, the front quarter part of the

454
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:08,770
car within the spot, start aiming towards the right, which would be the left driver's side

455
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:11,650
wheel of the car parked to the right.

456
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:12,910
Oh, my gosh.

457
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,250
Was that confusing?

458
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:17,550
So instead of going into the spot.

459
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,470
I didn't quite follow that.

460
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:20,050
Yeah, go ahead.

461
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:24,990
Okay, so as you're making a left into that spot, most people look at the center of the

462
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:29,350
spot that they're going into and they're going to end up too close to the left side.

463
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:29,650
Okay.

464
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:34,310
Too close to, in other words, they try to open the door to get out on the left-hand driver.

465
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:37,250
Not going to have enough space between them and the car next to them.

466
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:37,450
Right.

467
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:37,690
Okay.

468
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:39,750
Or you're going to have too much of an angle.

469
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:45,330
So the best thing to do here is you aim at the car at the right, the car that's on the right

470
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:47,150
side, your passenger's side.

471
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:49,670
Remember, I'm presuming everyone here is left-hand drive.

472
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:50,310
Right.

473
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:58,370
You're aiming at the front of the other car, like the front driver's side wheel, as if you're

474
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:01,410
going to almost on an angle hit that car, right?

475
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:01,810
Okay.

476
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:02,790
But don't hit it.

477
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:07,550
And just at the last moment, if you know the distance of your car, when you're less than a

478
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:10,950
foot away or about a foot away, abruptly steer towards the left.

479
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:15,790
And what'll happen there is you will see yourself perfectly centered and balanced in the center

480
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,110
of that spot in one maneuver.

481
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:22,070
And the joy of this is when you have these really tight spots.

482
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:28,830
Like California, like in Arizona, everything's 10 feet, the distances between the white lines

483
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:29,290
and lanes.

484
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:29,830
Okay.

485
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:32,850
And in California, everything's just a little bit over eight.

486
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:36,910
By the way, if you want to give the perception that someone is going faster, you make the

487
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:38,230
lanes narrower, right?

488
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,770
So that's how you get people to slow down.

489
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:45,690
You make the lanes narrower, but that's another discussion on highway and road design.

490
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:49,290
Because perceptually, it feels like you're going faster.

491
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:56,150
So basically, if you're going to make a right-hand turn into a spot, as you're turning the arc,

492
00:26:56,390 --> 00:27:02,490
as you start getting into the zone where the spot is, aim towards the left-hand side, the

493
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:06,710
passenger side of the car on the left wheel, as if you're going to hit the car.

494
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:07,350
Right?

495
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,950
Don't cut the wheel so much to the right.

496
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:13,090
And then right the wheel at the last second, and you'll see the car is totally straight.

497
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,530
It kind of doesn't make sense.

498
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:19,590
Because you think that once you're getting into the spot within the radius that you started,

499
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,430
you're going to just smoothly get in there.

500
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:25,350
But you know, you end up continuing that radius, and you're usually cockeyed.

501
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:32,190
But as you start getting into the spot, and you aim opposite in the direction that you

502
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:34,410
want to go, the car will straighten itself out.

503
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:36,570
It's a form of counter-steering at speed.

504
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:40,230
But this is counter-steering at low parking position.

505
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:44,690
And the last second, turn the wheel to the right, and the car rights itself and ends

506
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:45,670
up straight every time.

507
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,510
I do this at speed.

508
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:52,510
Very often, I have people in a car, and it's, let's get that parking spot right there.

509
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:53,930
And I barely slow down.

510
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:57,510
I mean, I don't go in like a saturated turn or something.

511
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:01,790
But I go in really fast compared to, and I do that technique.

512
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:06,150
And they're like, oh, you know, I thought you were going to hit the other car.

513
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:06,950
I was like, no, no, watch.

514
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,270
This is a technique that I always use.

515
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:11,210
And they get out, and they're like, it's perfect.

516
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,810
It's the same, just, you know, every time.

517
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:15,790
So there's the idea.

518
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:18,190
This is the employment, the slow counter.

519
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,570
Do you know what counter-steering is?

520
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:20,150
Have you heard that?

521
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:21,670
I've heard it.

522
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,770
I'm not quite certain what that means exactly.

523
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:28,890
Okay, it's the principle of counter-steering, which is very much applied to anyone that's

524
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:31,270
in performance driving, two-wheel, four-wheel, whatever.

525
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,690
It doesn't work that well when you have a trailer.

526
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:35,750
Actually, it's the opposite with a trailer.

527
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:42,810
But counter-steering is when you're going to turn to the right, it creates a, the car

528
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:48,330
wants to go to the left because it sees turning to the right as a braking action, just like

529
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:49,030
a rowboat, right?

530
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:55,510
So what you do is before you turn to the right, you quickly turn the steering mechanism to

531
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:57,390
the left, and you snap it back to the right.

532
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:01,270
And it fools the car to lean towards the right, where the direction you want to go.

533
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,210
That's what I see people do.

534
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:08,090
And again, I don't steer much, but the idea that they kind of lean left a little bit before

535
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:12,710
they turn right, or the other way, I just thought it was just give yourself a little

536
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,850
more clearance, a little more of a radius.

537
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:19,830
It's to relieve that braking force that happens in the direction that you're turning.

538
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:20,670
Oh, okay.

539
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:21,090
Okay.

540
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:21,530
Right?

541
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:26,150
So you can get, if you're going to turn to the left, the car wants to go to the right

542
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:30,190
because it sees going to the left as a braking mechanism, friction, it wants to go where

543
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:30,830
there's less friction.

544
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,210
So you quickly snap it to the right.

545
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:36,530
So the car now relieves that, right?

546
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:37,810
So that's called counter-steering.

547
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:39,970
So this is like a parking counter-steering method.

548
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:46,570
And it's funny when I do this with people I don't know me, and they're into driving,

549
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:47,850
they're like, oh, you're a really good driver.

550
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:50,730
You came with, I mean, it's like, how the hell did you get into this spot so perfectly?

551
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:54,510
It's easier when it's a very tight spot.

552
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:55,410
Okay, right.

553
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,590
So counter-steering perspective.

554
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:03,010
If you're interested, maybe the first time I brought up how to do it in parking was the

555
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,490
best, and it didn't sound the best, but it is.

556
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,050
So you could go back to that.

557
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:07,810
Okay.

558
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:08,690
We didn't time-mark it.

559
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:11,450
But the next thing I want to get into is a curvy road.

560
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:17,930
You go uphill or across, you know, where you can't see around the bend, and here comes

561
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,910
another bend, and everyone's going, oh, to the left.

562
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:20,930
You're swinging to the right.

563
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:24,990
And the cars, you feel the car rocking back and forth, left and right, as you're going

564
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,430
around these short bends, right?

565
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,050
At speed.

566
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:32,570
Well, especially, it gets really more nervous when it's downhill, right?

567
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:39,030
Uphill, this holds true uphill as well, but you have, you know, a negative force keeping

568
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,810
you, like, an inertia holding you back.

569
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,030
Climbing is not that much.

570
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:48,650
But when you're descending on a curvy road or flat at speed, a curvy road, you kind of

571
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:52,030
feel the car, you know, oh, to the left, oh, to the right, you know.

572
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:54,150
So when you're turning to the left, the car wants to go to the right.

573
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:55,930
And everybody's rocking back and forth.

574
00:30:56,610 --> 00:31:00,010
Everybody starts looking up, paying attention, and wants something to hold on to, right?

575
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:04,570
Well, I see that when, during that, or I see it during when, you know, when people come

576
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:08,010
off exit ramps, and it's kind of a corkscrew, where you're coming down, you're descending,

577
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:11,950
and you go in one direction for a while, but it really, you know, turns you around.

578
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:12,930
Sure.

579
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:17,470
This works well also on a long cloverleaf type exit like that, yeah, like one of those

580
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:20,270
almost 360 or 270 turns.

581
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:20,650
Right.

582
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:20,930
Okay.

583
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:21,190
Okay.

584
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:24,030
So what you do here, this combines EMO.

585
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:27,030
This shows you how you are variable X.

586
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:30,030
In other words, the driver, you don't have to see the drivers, any road feel, you become

587
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,290
part of the machine and all that.

588
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:33,050
This is where the machine becomes part of you.

589
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:36,410
This has to do with stabilizing the car.

590
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:39,750
And the way you do that is also by having a proper seating position.

591
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:46,290
A proper seating position is have the backrest as upright as possible, right?

592
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:49,830
Believe it or not, if you look at race cars, they don't, the backrests don't lean back

593
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:50,170
at all.

594
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:51,490
It's like straight up and down, right?

595
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:55,870
Yeah, that is a weird phenomenon I've noticed in the past few years too, is that there are

596
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:58,710
people that I swear to God, it's like they want to lay back in the car.

597
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:02,670
Well, yeah, that started with the gangster stuff in the 70s, you know, with the Conair

598
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:05,470
hairbrushes and the Cadillac Eldorado and all that, right?

599
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:06,550
I mean, really ridiculous.

600
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:07,250
Yeah.

601
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,510
I don't understand that at all.

602
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:14,730
So the way you sit down is basically you want a slight bend in the legs for the pedals on

603
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:19,950
the floor and you want a slight bend in the elbow to the steering wheel.

604
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:23,970
Now, if you're taller than 5'6", it's kind of hard to do that unless you're in a big

605
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:24,370
car.

606
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:27,250
In other words, you're going to find you're moving the seat back.

607
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:32,730
It's really easy for a small person, believe it or not, even though the cars look big or

608
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:36,610
whatever, they're really designed for people between 5'6 and 5'8".

609
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:40,330
Once you're above 5'8", it's really hard to get into this position, you know, the seat

610
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:41,970
all the way back, depending on the car again.

611
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:46,770
I got into a Volkswagen once, I think a Passat, where I set it up and I was like, whoa, you

612
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:49,710
could be seven foot tall and fit and set it up right, you know?

613
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:54,390
So there's some exceptions, but you want a slight bend in your elbow.

614
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:58,850
So when you're sitting in the position, the back is as upright as possible, being comfortable.

615
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:02,730
Now, for some people, an upright back feels like you're leaning forward, like you're going

616
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:03,950
to get dumped forward, right?

617
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:06,630
So don't do that. Maybe five, ten degrees back is fine.

618
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:09,850
Also, headrests are useless.

619
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:11,590
You're trying to lean your head back on a headrest.

620
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:15,330
You're staring at the ceiling of the car, you know, the headliner, you know.

621
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:19,170
But anyway, and you want a slight bend in your elbow.

622
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:24,730
In other words, your arms, lock out your arms and then put about a five or ten degree bend,

623
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:26,510
which would be two or three inches in.

624
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:30,450
And your legs should be mostly extended with a slight bend.

625
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:34,610
Not, you know, you shouldn't lock your knees out if you're touching the pedals, the brake

626
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:36,290
pedal all the way down or accelerator all the way down.

627
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,550
Should have a slight bend.

628
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,170
Don't be bunched up.

629
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:45,550
OK, so once you have that position and you reset yourself, or if you already have it

630
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:50,630
good on you, what you're doing is when you start getting into the curved road situation,

631
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:56,110
whether it's flat or uphill at speed, what I want you to do is slightly pull on the

632
00:33:56,110 --> 00:34:00,950
steering wheel with both hands evenly towards you as if you want to pull the steering

633
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:04,990
wheel out of the rack, out of the off of its axle where it's attached from the car,

634
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,390
right? Just pull on it.

635
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:11,110
The reason I'm saying this, because most people will either grip the steering wheel or

636
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:17,290
rest their hands on it or be conscious of the force moving up and down, you know, to

637
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:23,929
turn the wheel. What I'd like for you to do is be conscious of pulling on the steering

638
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:29,690
wheel slightly, right, as if you want to pull it off of the slot or the bearing that it's

639
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,290
mounted it off of its mount.

640
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:35,550
Well, this occurs to me, does the pitch, you know, because a lot of steering wheels are

641
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:37,969
adjustable, does the pitch of the wheel matter?

642
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:41,429
OK, it is parallel to your chest as possible.

643
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:44,130
But if you do that, sometimes it feels like it's pointing towards your navel.

644
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:48,710
OK, so whatever is comfortable, but it should be vertical as possible.

645
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:55,469
OK. All right. Well, 12, I found 12 to 15 degrees up, you know, is good, you know, so.

646
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:58,510
But the tilt with the upper part slightly away at 12 degrees.

647
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:03,670
Yeah. You want to make it look if you really want to see race cars are high performance.

648
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:06,310
You always want to be high performance when you're in a car, right?

649
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:10,430
Unless you're, you know, driving around in a boat or, you know, a lot of people like these

650
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:12,630
cars you mentioned sit back. That's how boats are set up.

651
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,290
Right. Yeah. Very relaxed.

652
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:15,830
You know, look at a speedboat.

653
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,350
Everything's upright. Right.

654
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:19,210
Race cars. Everything is upright.

655
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:24,510
So what I'm saying here is when you put a slight tug on the steering wheel, not much.

656
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:31,410
We're talking about a light force while you're turning left and right and negotiating the

657
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:35,730
bends, you're going to notice, hey, the car isn't swaying anymore.

658
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:38,570
It's really stable and actually have better traction.

659
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:44,510
Now, wait a second. What the hell does slightly pulling on the steering wheel in a good

660
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:50,210
seating posture have to do with the wheels increasing traction and the suspension

661
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:52,850
tightening up? How is that physically possible?

662
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:55,350
It's not physically.

663
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:59,590
If you start thinking about how someone say, well, you're stabilizing the wheel.

664
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:03,790
No, what happens is the car feels like a completely different car.

665
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:09,770
It feels like you just went and upgraded your suspension to the best Kony suspension

666
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:14,710
available. But all you've done is change your orientation, which gives you a better feel

667
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,170
for what's going on. Right.

668
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:20,110
Right. It feels like you have a new car and it feels like you just got put on, you know,

669
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:22,710
Michelin tires or something that grip the road really well.

670
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:26,470
That's the thing, by the way, Michelin, I'm not endorsed by them, but I do endorse them

671
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:33,290
for this. When you get Michelin tires for whatever, not the truck LTX, but if you have a

672
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:35,890
car, I've tried this with several cars.

673
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:38,030
There's no difference if it's wet out or dry.

674
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:41,150
I've in the middle of a thunderstorm going on a curvy road.

675
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:44,490
Now, like, let me just try to, like, you know, grab the brakes and see if the car

676
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:46,850
slides up. And it behaved just like as if it was dry.

677
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,990
It's the only car tires I've ever seen do that.

678
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:52,270
So like the commercial says, a lot's riding on your tires.

679
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:55,310
Even the wife who got a car and had new tires, brand new tires, you know, with the

680
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,990
little things that stick out right from the casting.

681
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:01,110
Oh, yeah. The next day I said we got to get Michelin's and she's she's the kind of

682
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,570
person that needs to test drive cars.

683
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:05,790
So, you know, test drive, just roll it 10 feet in the parking lot.

684
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:08,730
I could tell you everything the car is doing there, except for, you know, shifting into

685
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:11,910
the high gear. So anyway, she gets the new tires to get in.

686
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:14,130
She's in the bay. They let her get in and pull the car out.

687
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:15,690
She looks at me as I could feel the difference.

688
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:16,950
And I just pulled out 10 feet.

689
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:20,010
Right. That's how radical Michelin's are.

690
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:26,510
So anyway, if I approach Michelin for a spot endorsement, they wouldn't they would see

691
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:29,390
what I'm talking about and wouldn't want anything to do with me anyway.

692
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:33,550
But I'm thinking that there is that there is definitely some engineering that goes into

693
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:35,990
exactly how they cut the grooves in the tire.

694
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:37,850
Well, it's it's the casing, believe it or not.

695
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:40,990
What makes the tire is the casing, the stuff the rubber is cast on.

696
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:47,910
It's I from dealing with high end bikes like a few for bicycles, a decent tire is 50 to

697
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:48,810
75 bucks.

698
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:52,650
And if you get something like a Continental Olympic, it's 300 bucks for a bicycle tire.

699
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:58,190
The difference is the casing TPI threads per inch, how it's woven and what type of weave.

700
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:00,550
And then, of course, the rubber, because that's the contact patch.

701
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:04,010
Right. But mainly it's the casing that gives you the feel.

702
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:06,850
Because think about if you take the casing away from the tire, just a balloon.

703
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:11,570
I mean, like a party balloon, a really thick party balloon doesn't you can't ride on that.

704
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:14,890
It's really all about the casing and you can't ride on the casing because it has no

705
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:15,890
traction. Well, right.

706
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:20,230
I remember in the early 80s, the guys that started using the red tires and the BMX,

707
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:23,910
because for some reason they were making them red and the compound.

708
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,510
No carbon is gripped better against metal surfaces.

709
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:27,490
That's what it was. Yeah.

710
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,890
So. All right.

711
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:35,190
So pulling slightly on the steering wheel, but you notice I stress the body position

712
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:39,390
first, because if you've got the wheel pointing this way and your seat's going that

713
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:42,330
away and this is going like did that, this is going like did that.

714
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,890
You're not going to get the right force.

715
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:49,790
You have to be in a position that yields or leans

716
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:53,370
towards what is considered performance, quote unquote, posture.

717
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:57,790
Right. And this is all about you feeling things as you're steering.

718
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:59,410
So I don't know what it's about.

719
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:00,770
It's actually, you know, it is nothing.

720
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:05,490
All you're feeling is your intent is to negotiate the road as you normally would, you

721
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:06,970
know, around the bends.

722
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:11,170
All you're really feeling and focusing on is a slight pull on the steering wheel,

723
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:14,090
slightly pulling on the steering wheel just slightly.

724
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:18,810
I have so many. Actually, if I've told this to a thousand people, a thousand people

725
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:21,910
came back to me. They made sure they wanted to get in contact me to thank them for

726
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:23,930
this little thing just for this.

727
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:27,630
I can't believe how it works. Even people that are into cars, people that build race

728
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:31,830
engines and all this stuff like, dude, I kind of did it.

729
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:35,650
I think I did it intuitively, but I never thought of doing it.

730
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,630
And it's like it's just there.

731
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,610
These are people who build race engines.

732
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:43,410
They know about all the mechanics and what different suspensions.

733
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:45,310
It was like putting in a new suspension.

734
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:50,190
It was right. It's like it's like putting in high end tires.

735
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:55,550
Right. So this I was I wanted to talk about the Emo

736
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:58,350
tonight, but I wanted to give these two practical examples.

737
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:02,970
And we did a little bit before on how certain things

738
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:07,130
that right away when you discuss like this little trick or this practical thing

739
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:10,730
must have a mechanical counterpart to explain it.

740
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:12,170
And I'm telling you, it doesn't.

741
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:16,650
How the hell can slightly pulling on the steering wheel in a good

742
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:19,030
posture stop the car from rocking?

743
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:20,930
You're going down the same road at the same speed.

744
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:25,450
Well, the only practical explanation I have for that is that you as the driver

745
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:29,550
are part of the situation and what you're doing by doing that is adjusting yourself.

746
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:33,410
Right. But how does that affect the suspension and the tire traction?

747
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:35,990
Doesn't make any sense, but it doesn't actually affect it.

748
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:38,350
It just affects your ability to utilize it, maybe.

749
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:40,450
Yeah, but it actually is a measurable effect.

750
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:45,410
In other words, if you it would be like someone having a mediocre stock car

751
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:49,430
and then hopping it up with a twenty thousand dollar suspension with the best

752
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:51,410
Michelin tires, drive it the same way.

753
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:52,810
Oh, yeah. Drive totally different.

754
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:56,570
This does almost the same thing by just slightly pulling on the steering wheel.

755
00:40:57,370 --> 00:41:01,530
Well, you know, much like gripping a baseball bat when you swing it, different

756
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:03,210
grips will create different results.

757
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:04,650
Okay. The bat didn't change.

758
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:05,790
The ball didn't change.

759
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:07,390
But you did. And the bat didn't change.

760
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:08,750
Right. But you did. But how does it.

761
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:10,210
But the bat is very direct.

762
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:14,570
Yeah. Here it's you're sitting in a car and a steering wheel, which has a shaft that

763
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:18,510
goes to a rack and pinion or electric whatever moves the steering wheel, which

764
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:22,650
goes to the body struts on the wheels, which has a suspension system.

765
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:25,890
Then you have independent traction ratios.

766
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,610
And you know how much friction the tire rolling resistance.

767
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:32,390
How does all that change by slightly pulling on the steering wheel again?

768
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:36,050
I'm thinking that the adjustment of you because you are.

769
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:38,630
But there's no physical explanation.

770
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,390
And I've had people look at this for many years.

771
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:42,870
I've been saying this for decades.

772
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:44,930
But you don't think I mean, again, I'm not trying to argue.

773
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:46,970
I'm just trying to say it just seems to me as though.

774
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:48,930
And again, not with a lot of experience.

775
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:52,630
If you change you in that equation, then you react a little bit different.

776
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:55,130
Sure. And therefore slight movements.

777
00:41:55,630 --> 00:42:00,050
Yeah. But don't look for a mechanical explanation because the change in the

778
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,570
mechanics is so radical.

779
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:06,170
In other words, that only one would expect such a radical change by actually

780
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:08,430
replacing or upgrading the mechanical parts.

781
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:10,670
That's amazing how that works.

782
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:15,270
Right. It's kind of like, you know, you got an old Ford Pinto, you know, zero zero

783
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:20,130
60 and 35 seconds, you know, you can't even get out of its own way.

784
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:24,050
You know, sure. And you think you think about something and then you go race a

785
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:25,390
Ferrari and keep up with it.

786
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:29,150
Right. Same car, same car, same car.

787
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:31,470
Nothing changed now that you can do that.

788
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:35,390
Now, mechanically, someone would say, well, you could race Ferrari and a Pinto will

789
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:37,330
pull the engine out, put another engine in.

790
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:38,410
We have to do the suspension.

791
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:42,170
We put some nitro burner in there, a couple of turbos, maybe a supercharger also.

792
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:45,090
No, no, no. I'm talking about exactly the same stuff.

793
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:46,590
And you have such a radical.

794
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:49,310
Now, I'm not saying that could be done, but I'm saying.

795
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:55,810
From the hand, Lisa, when high performance cars, the three things that matter, most

796
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:58,910
people that don't know about high performance cars, I think, how fast can it go?

797
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:01,950
No, that means you don't know high performance cars.

798
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:07,410
The first thing that high performance cars think about, yes, how fast can it go?

799
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:10,870
That is such a minimal side note that's only considered for one point five

800
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:16,490
seconds. Where the hours of thought goes into is how does the suspension react and

801
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:18,230
how well does the brakes react?

802
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:20,190
And that's where the hours, days and weeks go into.

803
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:25,310
Right. You could put a rocket, you can go down to the Air Force base if you have a

804
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:29,590
cousin that works at the Air Force base and get some surplus C-130 hydrogen peroxide

805
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:31,650
rockets, 30, 33 percent ones.

806
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:33,570
They look like three inch tubes, five feet long.

807
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:37,770
Strap it underneath the car, fire it off and you'll go from zero to one hundred and

808
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:39,950
two seconds. Right.

809
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:42,390
So that doesn't mean anything.

810
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:43,990
Right. I mean, how do you stop?

811
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:46,070
Right. How do you go around the turn?

812
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:52,210
Yeah, that's why the that's why I say the best value for a car dollar for dollar money

813
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:55,970
is a Bugatti Veyron, which is two and a half million dollars.

814
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:57,630
I said value, not price.

815
00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:03,230
Why? Because it's the only car that could go from zero to 60 back to zero in less than

816
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:06,390
five seconds. People, people don't hear what I just said.

817
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:07,850
They'll say zero to sixty and five.

818
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:08,850
So that's kind of fast.

819
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:12,790
But no, no, it actually goes zero to 60 in less than two seconds.

820
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:17,070
It goes from zero to 60 back to zero in less than five seconds.

821
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:19,710
Think about it. Can't do it, right?

822
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:23,210
Imagine. No. So I've never seen a car personally do that.

823
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:25,250
No. There's a couple of YouTube's on that.

824
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:28,130
You put in zero to 60 back to zero in five seconds.

825
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:32,370
There's a bunch of people that did the testing of the machine and it does it safely.

826
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:36,450
And you feel like when it does it, you could have, you know, basically a Starbucks with a

827
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:37,930
lid next to you and it wouldn't spill.

828
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:41,130
Right. Now, I didn't say no lid.

829
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:43,250
That would be stupid. Right.

830
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:45,730
Not much will come out of that little sippy hole.

831
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:47,230
That's what they call it, a sippy hole.

832
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:48,810
I have some children. Yeah.

833
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:53,330
Okay. So what I wanted to bring up tonight again, essentially, is just pulling on the

834
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:55,150
steering wheel on a curvy situation.

835
00:44:55,250 --> 00:45:00,250
Not much. Not when I said pull it as if you want to pull the steering wheel out of the

836
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:01,270
shaft, off the shaft.

837
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:06,150
Not that hard, but in that direction, in line with the shaft, the pole, both hands even

838
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:10,870
as you're turning. And what I assure you, and I have had people that are car people

839
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:15,770
look into this and they come back, say it doesn't make any sense because the amount of

840
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:21,130
change that happens, mechanical difference only happens when you start replacing

841
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:22,790
components. Right.

842
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:26,610
It's amazing. So I just want to bring that up for those of you that are interested.

843
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:30,210
And for those who are not interested, we just burned up about 20 minutes on some Greek

844
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:31,530
speak. Right.

845
00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:35,570
So emo. What do you think we should go on the emo?

846
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:37,070
That's that is so wide open.

847
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:43,190
The reason why I've been getting I say this often, if I hear two or three people, I

848
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:46,830
don't know of each other, almost ask or say or comment on the same thing.

849
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,530
I've said this for many years.

850
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:52,970
I bring it up because to me it's like a synchronous coincidence kind of thing.

851
00:45:54,090 --> 00:46:00,710
Right. So so I've had several people with rated Y and outside bring up the emo

852
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:03,350
recently. And I said, I'll talk about it.

853
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:05,170
So what do you think we should go with it?

854
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:11,910
Chuck. Well, obviously, something that is practical, what what is a problem that could

855
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:16,730
be addressed with this? What is a circumstance that people would like to affect

856
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:20,090
most commonly that they could use to affect?

857
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:23,390
You know, that they would want to affect with it.

858
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:24,870
How about that? What do you think?

859
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:31,550
Well, that's the way I would ponder that and say what I ponder is this.

860
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:34,670
If you are focusing on food, clothing, shelter.

861
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:40,570
Remember, we got into the other things as well, which is water, energy and silver.

862
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:45,850
And you are, let's say, a happy camper to a degree.

863
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:50,010
The next thing would be affect others around you, because it's really the others

864
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:52,890
around you that control your happiness to a degree.

865
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:54,430
Right. Well, they're going to.

866
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:55,870
Yes, they can.

867
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:58,590
Right. They can. They can control your happiness.

868
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:04,870
So well, can you just generally have an effect on anywhere you go?

869
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:08,350
Is there a default that you can have that is?

870
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:11,830
Yes. OK, so why don't we describe that?

871
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:16,750
Well, you know, the description where two people approach a dog, one is definitely

872
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,530
afraid of dogs. The other one loves dogs.

873
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:19,870
Which one is the dog want to bite?

874
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:22,110
Well, the one that's afraid, of course.

875
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:24,470
Yeah. And well, how does the dog figure that out?

876
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:30,090
It's emo, right? The animals have this perception that they're stationary here.

877
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:32,570
This is like the flat Earth thing in the globe Earth.

878
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:35,670
But, you know, the Earth is a little flat and a little round.

879
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:38,030
And it's also very round and very flat.

880
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:47,270
Right. OK, anyway, the perception on this is which one does it want to bite?

881
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:52,670
The the the animals see that they're stationary and everything is moving around them

882
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:55,750
because the body that they're in overrules their actions.

883
00:47:56,250 --> 00:48:00,650
OK, what I mean by that, our body, for example, if someone is going to slap you,

884
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:03,170
you're going to flinch, try to move out of the way without thinking about it.

885
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:05,310
Right. That's not you doing it.

886
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:06,270
That's the human body.

887
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:10,310
That's a built in feature on the human body doing that kind of like the automatic

888
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:13,930
windshield wipers. You turn it one knob and they go a little bit and then you turn

889
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:15,850
another right and they go the net another little bit.

890
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:17,870
Right. That's built into the wiper.

891
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:20,870
You know, the first click, second click, third click.

892
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:26,290
So we have these clicks that are built into us that when we're going to fall and

893
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:28,510
slip and fall, we put our hands out like it or not.

894
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:30,410
Right. All these things.

895
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:31,490
That's the human body.

896
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:34,730
When you see a cat jump a certain way, like they're spring loaded.

897
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:38,650
Right. That's the cat body doing that.

898
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:41,790
Right. That they have that they don't have to think about doing that.

899
00:48:41,850 --> 00:48:44,590
Right. The dog will do a certain thing sometimes.

900
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:48,230
That's the dog body. A fish has a fish body reaction.

901
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:52,950
Swing its tail. It'll make its body bend like a C, letter C, if you look at it from

902
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:59,970
the top down. All these bodies have little built in reactions, reflexes, you can call

903
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:01,350
them or whatever.

904
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:09,170
So when the dog picks up the person who is in fear of dogs, the person doesn't even

905
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:12,750
have to be recollecting at the moment they're afraid of dogs.

906
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:14,770
It could just be stored in the back file.

907
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:16,850
The dog will pick up on it because it's there.

908
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:21,890
Right. And it's the dog body reacting on that.

909
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:27,330
So the animals do not see themselves moving through any situation.

910
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:29,350
They see situations moving around them.

911
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:35,070
That's why they're so well, in a way, in martial arts, you know how they have different

912
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:36,690
styles that are named after animals.

913
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:37,670
Right. You almost copy.

914
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:42,630
Yeah, because the animals have seemed like masters at certain styles and movements.

915
00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:45,310
That's because their perception is very different.

916
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:52,990
Now, we can perceive that also in a way where to a certain degree, see, we are vertical

917
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:57,570
creatures. Our spine goes perpendicular to the flowing energy field on the earth, but

918
00:49:57,570 --> 00:49:58,970
it goes parallel to the ether.

919
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:07,190
The animals go parallel with the flows, fields on the earth and perpendicular to the

920
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:13,750
ether. So they're being charged more by the fields on the earth or in flow with the

921
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:15,250
fields because they're parallel to them.

922
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:20,970
They offer no resistance, but they they're contrary and less attached to the etherical

923
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:25,610
fields. We are in line with the etherical fields, which are rays that go vertically up

924
00:50:25,610 --> 00:50:29,970
and down. And we are contrary to the earth fields that go horizontal.

925
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:33,290
Right. So the earth fields go left and right, front and back.

926
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:34,770
Right. Our spine is vertical.

927
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:38,630
So these lines on the earth cut are through our spine, different vertebrae at different

928
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:41,930
levels. Right. You see, I brought this up several times.

929
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:46,110
There's a couple of people, only one or two, why is the spine on the animal horizontal

930
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:47,950
and vertical? That's a long explanation.

931
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:51,290
And I just gave a basic introduction on it.

932
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:54,670
Now, plants are very interesting, too.

933
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:58,210
And if you study the creepy crawly plants, the ones that are horizontal versus the

934
00:50:58,210 --> 00:51:02,850
vertical ones, they follow a very similar suit in terms of the way they grow and the

935
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:07,910
way they react. And just to recap, you know, plants have a consciousness, but they're

936
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:12,330
always in dreamland. And I've said this many times, because this is a preface to a

937
00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:17,870
much longer discussion on the on how the physical, the ethereal archetypes

938
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:19,110
affect us physically. Right.

939
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:22,030
So if plants have a consciousness, why do we eat them?

940
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:23,410
But they're always in dreamtime.

941
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:28,010
So when you go up to a bush or a vegetable plant to cut off some of it to eat,

942
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:33,230
it would be as if you are having a dream and in your dream someone cuts your arm off.

943
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:35,090
You're like, oh, fuck it. I'm in a dream, right?

944
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:37,710
It's no big deal. You don't go into shock, do you?

945
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:41,650
Some plants can go into shock depending on the weather and the conditions.

946
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:42,610
Right. And they die.

947
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:48,130
Right. So and by the way, where do psychedelics and dreamlike chemicals usually come

948
00:51:48,130 --> 00:51:49,850
from? Right.

949
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:54,650
I'm not talking about licking frogs as an exception, but they come from plants 99

950
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:56,670
percent of the time. The dead plants.

951
00:51:56,870 --> 00:52:04,250
Right. So going back to the emo, there is the body of the human, the

952
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:09,370
autonomous reaction, because we sense that we are moving through the world constantly.

953
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:12,990
Right. Get up from the chair, go get a beer, get up from here, do this.

954
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:14,930
Right. The Internet gets shut down.

955
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:16,630
I get up, find this stupid rectangle.

956
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:18,510
Right. So I'm moving through the world.

957
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:20,230
Right. OK. Yeah.

958
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:21,550
The animals don't sense that.

959
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:26,810
So once you get into a certain emo thing, how about flipping it a little bit where

960
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,750
you're not moving? You're completely stationary.

961
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:30,370
Everything is moving around you.

962
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:35,050
Hmm. And I you know where I got a really good jolt of that, you know, back in the

963
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:38,030
eighteen hundreds, early 19 is that moving sidewalks in cities?

964
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:39,530
They tried that second conveyor belt.

965
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:44,090
So instead of walking down the let's say Fifth Avenue, you just stand on the sidewalk

966
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:45,490
and it's a conveyor just moves you down.

967
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:46,850
You stand right. Have you seen those?

968
00:52:47,350 --> 00:52:48,250
I've never seen them.

969
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:50,530
I've heard something about it, but I never saw them.

970
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:51,890
Yeah, they're quite popular.

971
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:53,830
They had them at train stations all over the place.

972
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:57,250
Yeah. There's a video called I think I posted in the chat a week ago.

973
00:52:57,450 --> 00:52:58,590
This is what you've missed.

974
00:52:58,590 --> 00:53:01,970
Showed all the technology in the eighteen hundreds that you don't have now.

975
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:05,230
Right. Electric electric cars is one thing, by the way.

976
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:10,530
Yeah. Eighty percent of the cars in 1920 were electric and they had greater range in

977
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:11,910
the car than the Teslas do now.

978
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:16,510
Think about it. And batteries didn't go dead in four years.

979
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:21,010
Like anyway. So think about these things.

980
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:23,150
You're stationary and everything's moving around you.

981
00:53:23,230 --> 00:53:26,170
Why? That's the emo aspect.

982
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:31,550
Right. The emo grabs the environment that way.

983
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:34,990
Once you have a stationary perspective and everything is moving.

984
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:38,770
Well, Greek, that's really hard for me to do if I'm jogging, you know, right.

985
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:42,250
Going for a run. Actually, that's the best time to notice it.

986
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:46,790
See, I don't think it's that hard to do nowadays because we have, again, like I brought

987
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:49,250
up last time you brought this up, video games.

988
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:51,510
This is exactly what happens during a video game.

989
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:54,770
Your character stays within a particular area.

990
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:56,690
The VR goggles, you mean, right?

991
00:53:56,870 --> 00:53:57,790
Well, yeah. The screen.

992
00:53:57,930 --> 00:54:03,510
Either one or either one works because you are going and just you're on the screen.

993
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:04,950
The world is coming to you.

994
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:07,350
Really? Yep. What do you think they're doing?

995
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:13,410
They're creating. They're redefining, redefining the reality that you're in.

996
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:19,090
I've seen videos, idiots, videos sometimes where the guy's got the VR goggles on playing

997
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:22,410
golf and he walks up and he swings and he knocks the TV down.

998
00:54:22,410 --> 00:54:23,410
Everybody's like, oh, no.

999
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:27,050
Right. Or grandma falls over because she's on a roller coaster standing up.

1000
00:54:27,050 --> 00:54:28,010
Right. Right. VR.

1001
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:31,630
Yeah. So what they're doing is redefining reality by bringing this to you.

1002
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:33,610
And I kind of brought up why and how.

1003
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:38,610
And from the ethereal end, kind of like a Steiner-ish, Rudolf Steiner-ish kind of

1004
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:46,290
perspective of how the emo, let's say, using the emo as a base.

1005
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:52,230
So when you go places, let's say you're invited to a party and it's a group of people

1006
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:55,030
and by the way, I would get to a party group.

1007
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:59,310
By the way, when you go into a situation, you rated why people are interested.

1008
00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:04,810
If you go into a situation and you're not in control, guess what?

1009
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:06,450
That situation is out of control.

1010
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:11,570
Now, if I tell this to your average Westerner, especially academic, they're going to

1011
00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:13,150
class out the Greek. Don't listen to him, man.

1012
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:15,490
He's a passive aggressive control freak.

1013
00:55:15,490 --> 00:55:19,030
Right. He's saying that you've got to go take control of every situation.

1014
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,170
Blah, blah, blah. Right. That's the way people take it.

1015
00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:22,470
When you first say it that way. Right.

1016
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:24,450
Well, see, and I wouldn't even start with the party thing.

1017
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:29,350
I would go with, you know, look, more commonly, people walk into a store, you're not

1018
00:55:29,350 --> 00:55:33,470
in control of it. I mean, there's certain expectations you have of what you're going to

1019
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:34,570
encounter when you go inside.

1020
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:38,370
You know, there's going to be a place where there is something to be picked up, goods,

1021
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:40,230
whatever. There's a place to pay, blah, blah.

1022
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:44,990
You have expectations, but you go in there, you're not in control of that situation, are

1023
00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:50,070
you? But you know, the thing is not to ultimately be in control, but to have the

1024
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:54,790
perception that when you enter into a situation, nothing, it's out of control.

1025
00:55:55,630 --> 00:55:59,130
In other words, there are controlling mechanisms there that are set by default.

1026
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:02,270
But any shit can be set off at any time.

1027
00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:04,770
You know, think about someone in a prison yard, right?

1028
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:08,590
You don't want to get to, even though it's for rec time, it's not you don't want to get

1029
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:10,310
to when they see you're really comfy.

1030
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:12,410
That's when they come and jig you with a sharpened toothbrush.

1031
00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:16,750
Right. When they pick up like a dog, they'll pick up when your guard is down.

1032
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:21,890
I'm not saying have your guard up, but when you go into a situation, most people are

1033
00:56:21,890 --> 00:56:25,130
thinking very passively that they walked into this situation.

1034
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:29,730
And I'm telling you from an emo perspective, that situation came to you.

1035
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:34,510
You haven't left from an ethereal, emotional, emo point of view.

1036
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:36,850
You never went anywhere in your whole life.

1037
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:38,670
Everything is coming towards you.

1038
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:41,110
That doesn't make any sense.

1039
00:56:41,870 --> 00:56:45,890
Right. From a mechanic, just like pulling on the steering wheel slightly as if you just

1040
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:49,110
upgraded, you know, 10,000 bucks worth of suspension and tires.

1041
00:56:49,470 --> 00:56:54,550
How can that be? You know, how can this old jalopy drive like a higher performance car

1042
00:56:54,550 --> 00:56:56,710
just by slightly pulling on the steering wheel?

1043
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:58,530
It doesn't make any sense in the mechanical world.

1044
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:03,390
So this is more advanced, but I thought I'd drop it out there because there are people

1045
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:04,650
thinking about it and using it.

1046
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:07,490
It takes a little bit to think about it.

1047
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:13,170
But, you know, if people ever listen to me speak on the ether potential, you know, with

1048
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:16,490
the weather work, the potential is different.

1049
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:17,650
It goes from low to high.

1050
00:57:17,790 --> 00:57:20,210
We're always taught that all potentials go from high to low.

1051
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:25,010
Right. You know, you have a battery, it's charged, high potential, and it discharges.

1052
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,210
Right. Well, the ether is different.

1053
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:30,750
What's low, it starts building up to a higher point, right, where the low feeds the

1054
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:36,290
high. So in a regular situation, the way we're taught potentials work, when you have a

1055
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:41,250
battery that's draining down, you have to attach it to a battery that's full, right, to

1056
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:48,070
charge it. But in an ether battery, when the battery is low, the way you charge is by

1057
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:52,030
attaching it to an even weaker battery and that weaker battery will discharge into that

1058
00:57:52,030 --> 00:57:53,470
one. Right.

1059
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:58,450
So when you want to charge, let's say your glasses, you're drinking the water in your

1060
00:57:58,450 --> 00:58:00,010
glass, right?

1061
00:58:00,350 --> 00:58:07,490
The way you would increase an ethereal environment is by putting it next to a glass

1062
00:58:07,490 --> 00:58:12,770
that has even less water in it or taking water from a glass that has less water in it and

1063
00:58:12,770 --> 00:58:16,530
putting it in your glass, you see, instead of a big pitcher.

1064
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:20,950
Right. I've actually seen people do that when someone's not, they drink their drink

1065
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:25,070
almost all the way down and they were drinking, they poured into their glass kind of

1066
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:26,330
thing or whatever.

1067
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:32,430
You know, it's but that's not a really good analogy because the physical reality that we

1068
00:58:32,430 --> 00:58:34,590
live in is all perception.

1069
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:38,470
And proof of that is with sound and with light.

1070
00:58:39,030 --> 00:58:42,130
You know, we only see one to five percent of the visible spectrum.

1071
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:45,530
It's easy to prove with an infrared camera, with ultraviolet.

1072
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:49,930
Right. You know, since the 60s, they've been looking through people's houses with

1073
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:52,610
infrared cameras right through the window.

1074
00:58:52,710 --> 00:58:54,110
You got the shades down. It doesn't matter.

1075
00:58:54,210 --> 00:58:55,670
They still see you with the heat signature.

1076
00:58:55,670 --> 00:59:00,470
Right. Unfortunately, I have a practical experience with this because I see stuff that I'm

1077
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:03,970
supposed to. And yet I miss things that I'm supposed to see.

1078
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:07,630
So because I'm in a different part of the spectrum visual.

1079
00:59:07,830 --> 00:59:08,730
Yeah. Yeah.

1080
00:59:08,930 --> 00:59:11,410
Sensitive. They try to tell you it's all mechanical.

1081
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:14,130
I think at all. You don't see with your eyes or hear with your ears.

1082
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:15,490
You see and hear with your brain.

1083
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:17,530
It's the processing. Right.

1084
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:18,570
But I'm highly sensitive.

1085
00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:22,730
Like I see heat as other people do not see it.

1086
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:26,050
I don't know why that is, but I can see heat differentials.

1087
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:30,150
Yeah, I'm with you. So I know someone who can see magnetic fields.

1088
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:32,250
It's a distortion. It's actually it's funny.

1089
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:33,770
It's a distortion that goes around it.

1090
00:59:33,810 --> 00:59:37,270
Like if you try and look just just slightly around something, you can see that it

1091
00:59:37,270 --> 00:59:41,670
distorts. And depending on the level of heat, it can distort a lot because it's

1092
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:44,610
emanating a lot of heat. I can see that before I get anywhere near it and

1093
00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:48,910
physically feel. Oh, oh, so just like the heat to share with the rest of what you

1094
00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:52,750
have in common with when we see the heat waves coming off of a hot road.

1095
00:59:52,810 --> 00:59:54,210
Yeah. Yeah. I can tell.

1096
00:59:54,270 --> 00:59:55,650
OK, so it's not a color spectrum.

1097
00:59:55,650 --> 00:59:59,930
It's actually it's it's a distortion or it's a diffraction, refraction thing.

1098
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:01,910
Well, there's a color thing, too.

1099
01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:05,410
But but aside from I'm just saying that for some reason, I don't know why that I

1100
01:00:05,410 --> 01:00:07,390
mean, I have less pigment in my eyes.

1101
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:08,990
So I'm what they call an albino.

1102
01:00:09,370 --> 01:00:13,990
So, yeah. So what I've been laying out some what most people might think is a

1103
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:18,630
little bit of nonsense here, but just things to think about that we're not really

1104
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:20,970
well here. You know, I said you don't go anywhere.

1105
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:22,950
Everything comes to you. Think of the movie The Matrix.

1106
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:25,050
You spend your whole life. Where are you in a pod?

1107
01:00:25,070 --> 01:00:27,170
The movie. Right. You're not going anywhere.

1108
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:29,770
Right. Well, again, it's a video game.

1109
01:00:29,850 --> 01:00:32,490
Same thing. I mean, look, you go from here to here and here.

1110
01:00:32,650 --> 01:00:36,810
It doesn't know your character and your whatever is on that same screen all the

1111
01:00:36,810 --> 01:00:40,150
time anyway. Or the pod in The Matrix or the pod in The Matrix.

1112
01:00:40,330 --> 01:00:42,750
You're sitting there and you're sitting there not going anywhere.

1113
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:45,470
Right. So this is where the emo works.

1114
01:00:45,490 --> 01:00:48,970
And that's how the emo works in terms of its fundamental establishment.

1115
01:00:49,570 --> 01:00:52,450
In other words, to establish a strong emo.

1116
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:58,970
Or to establish emo as a strong tool, you must first establish that you're not

1117
01:00:58,970 --> 01:01:01,230
moving. You've never gone anywhere, never done anything.

1118
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:04,490
All of it is coming to you like you're the center of the universe.

1119
01:01:04,950 --> 01:01:07,610
I know, again, if someone hears that the Greek is crazy, sounds like you're now

1120
01:01:07,610 --> 01:01:08,950
you're an egomaniac. Right.

1121
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:11,150
But this is true for all of us.

1122
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:15,310
It's the ultimate form of narcissism, the ultimate form of narcissism.

1123
01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:19,950
Right. Where I remember the big example was actually nothing.

1124
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:22,670
Everything in the world is just a pigment of my imagination.

1125
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:28,350
Sure. But this is not like this because we're looking to work the reality that we

1126
01:01:28,350 --> 01:01:33,510
perceive again, where the imagination, again, is perception and visualization and

1127
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:36,470
creativity. People with no creativity have no imagination.

1128
01:01:36,930 --> 01:01:37,870
You hear that often, right?

1129
01:01:38,050 --> 01:01:40,530
Oh, yeah. Well, you have no imagination.

1130
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:41,750
That's why, you know, whatever.

1131
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:45,030
So all of these things coming towards you.

1132
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:51,210
So if you are if you're not doing anything or going anywhere and everything is

1133
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:54,670
coming towards you and you know that the potential goes from low to high.

1134
01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:58,410
Right. That means that you are the most important thing and you have the most

1135
01:01:58,410 --> 01:02:01,490
potential because that's the lower things are coming to the higher thing.

1136
01:02:01,590 --> 01:02:02,710
This is ether now. Right.

1137
01:02:03,430 --> 01:02:05,530
This is where the the emo is working.

1138
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:09,050
It is a substance in the ethereal world.

1139
01:02:09,230 --> 01:02:13,570
We see it as non substance, as non material in any in any way.

1140
01:02:14,290 --> 01:02:16,530
And that substance is made of thought.

1141
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:22,350
And that's why I started getting into that inner voice is not you.

1142
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:26,190
It's something that comes into you when you're a child and it keeps changing as

1143
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:30,250
you evolve. But again, for most people in the public, you know, if you know anyone

1144
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:33,290
who's 70 or 80, they still have the same one that they had when they were probably

1145
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:39,390
10 or 12. By the way, when I was out yesterday, these old people cover your

1146
01:02:39,390 --> 01:02:41,670
ears or a lot. Most of them are just old scumbags.

1147
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:45,810
And I'm saying that as a as a as an accurate term.

1148
01:02:46,090 --> 01:02:50,930
In the past week, I've been out because I've been sourcing things and I don't I

1149
01:02:50,930 --> 01:02:52,750
try to see where people are at.

1150
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:57,750
And these old scumbags, old scumbags, meaning over 55, bring up certain things.

1151
01:02:57,750 --> 01:03:00,870
And when it gets to a philosophical, I'm going to give them a little Greek speak on

1152
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:03,290
how the end is near, but not in the way they're used to hearing it.

1153
01:03:04,470 --> 01:03:09,470
Every one of them this past two weeks says, well, I don't care because I'm going to

1154
01:03:09,470 --> 01:03:10,530
be dead by then.

1155
01:03:11,210 --> 01:03:14,230
That's and I, you know, and I say, oh, yeah, fuck the young people who cares about

1156
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:19,930
them. Right. So what that tells you is that is an irresponsible scumbag.

1157
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:25,690
And when I hear about them being drugged up and thrown into a nursing home with a

1158
01:03:25,690 --> 01:03:28,130
diaper, I have zero sympathy for them.

1159
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:34,210
As a matter of fact, a lot of the Agenda 30 and a lot of the communist regime stuff

1160
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:38,270
is if you're older than 55, you can't work, you get an option taking a pill.

1161
01:03:39,430 --> 01:03:43,710
Right. Or we put you in an area, whatever, turn you into food sludge.

1162
01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:49,030
I'm all I'm down for that, except for a tiny, tiny, tiny percentage that may have

1163
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:51,650
some modicum of some value.

1164
01:03:51,930 --> 01:03:53,610
And I'm disgusted with them.

1165
01:03:53,890 --> 01:03:55,510
I've had it with the older people.

1166
01:03:55,970 --> 01:04:00,910
I remember I put a we you and I did a sonic on this with Ocelli in the Greek and

1167
01:04:00,910 --> 01:04:02,510
we had this dumb lady put a comment.

1168
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:05,890
What do you mean? The old people's where you go to get truth and wisdom.

1169
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:07,310
Wait till the Greek hits 50.

1170
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:11,010
Remember that? Yeah, I'm already older than 50.

1171
01:04:11,130 --> 01:04:14,590
I mean, people don't understand that I'm objectifying these things.

1172
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:19,250
I have no care or regard or interest in anything people do.

1173
01:04:19,310 --> 01:04:24,050
Just like I say, if everyone wants to turn this world into a living paradise, have at

1174
01:04:24,050 --> 01:04:25,610
it. Just count me out.

1175
01:04:26,290 --> 01:04:29,690
If you want to turn into a living hell and start killing and eating each other, have

1176
01:04:29,690 --> 01:04:31,190
at it. Just count me out.

1177
01:04:31,590 --> 01:04:34,990
No matter what they do, whether it's good or bad, I want nothing to do with it.

1178
01:04:34,990 --> 01:04:37,790
You see, I don't want to I don't want to participate in either one of those things,

1179
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:42,210
but I do feel a responsibility to try and leave things in slightly better condition

1180
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:44,690
than I found them. I don't know why that is.

1181
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:49,590
I don't know where it comes from, but I have this idea that, you know, you're talking

1182
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:50,610
about these older scumbags.

1183
01:04:50,690 --> 01:04:53,110
And look, I'm just over 51 now.

1184
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:59,970
You know, I feel this just responsibility that you're supposed to leave things just a

1185
01:04:59,970 --> 01:05:01,590
little better. But that's you.

1186
01:05:01,730 --> 01:05:04,230
But the majority in the collective are just that.

1187
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:07,650
They don't care. They're like, well, now I'm not saying all of them, please.

1188
01:05:07,790 --> 01:05:12,030
I never include anything everywhere, all except for attorneys and doctors, by the way.

1189
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:16,470
I'm just joking. An intelligence agency is pretty much all of them are, except for a

1190
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:20,390
small group that realize what's going on and they want to exit, but looking for an exit

1191
01:05:20,390 --> 01:05:22,850
strategy. But the ones that stay there, yeah, they all are.

1192
01:05:23,030 --> 01:05:25,330
I've never met a doctor personally that's worth a damn.

1193
01:05:25,610 --> 01:05:30,170
But OK. Yeah, I mean, look, the all inclusive is true.

1194
01:05:30,170 --> 01:05:34,490
And I always say, except for those that figured it out and are looking for an exit

1195
01:05:34,490 --> 01:05:38,330
strategy and that gives you a two week to two year leeway.

1196
01:05:38,430 --> 01:05:42,750
Usually when a doctor, an attorney, intelligence or cop or whatever agency figures out

1197
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:48,750
this is all bullshit and it's actually to the detriment of society, they try to figure

1198
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:49,610
out an exit strategy.

1199
01:05:49,930 --> 01:05:52,570
And it usually takes them two weeks to two years to exit.

1200
01:05:53,270 --> 01:06:00,150
Right. And by the way, fact check, an attorney that does that ends up being a

1201
01:06:00,170 --> 01:06:01,610
car, a car salesman.

1202
01:06:01,910 --> 01:06:03,610
Pick it either new or used.

1203
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:06,550
It's it's amazing because I've followed a couple of them quit.

1204
01:06:06,850 --> 01:06:10,710
And if you want to think that I had something with them doing quitting, I'm not going to

1205
01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:13,010
brag about it, even though I do have bragging rights on it.

1206
01:06:13,890 --> 01:06:20,130
I found them ending up selling cars, which which is another thing.

1207
01:06:20,170 --> 01:06:21,170
What do you use car sales?

1208
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:23,050
Right. It's another negative connotation.

1209
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:28,950
Right. So anyway, well, because a lot of used car salesmen do cheat people.

1210
01:06:28,950 --> 01:06:31,690
And I mean, look, you got to take your skills somewhere.

1211
01:06:31,970 --> 01:06:36,510
But if you're an honest car salesman, then you're doing you know, you're doing something

1212
01:06:36,510 --> 01:06:39,070
that's practically serves a purpose, at least.

1213
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:40,290
Sure. It can be.

1214
01:06:40,450 --> 01:06:43,670
It's all about. Yeah, it's all about mindset, you know.

1215
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:49,090
So, again, with the I think I maybe I jumped in too deep or something like that with the

1216
01:06:49,090 --> 01:06:51,730
email because it still hasn't been too practical.

1217
01:06:52,330 --> 01:06:56,390
But I took it sort of like a little glimpse of the end of the matter.

1218
01:06:56,390 --> 01:07:03,090
When you start to get what makes a master, a master versus an amateur, two things.

1219
01:07:04,090 --> 01:07:09,330
Level of skill and confidence, because if you have the level of skill and no confidence,

1220
01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:13,010
you're going to shy away from most situations and you won't seem like you're a master.

1221
01:07:13,410 --> 01:07:17,790
Right. But if you have too much confidence and no skill, you're definitely going to show

1222
01:07:17,790 --> 01:07:18,810
you're not a master.

1223
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:23,250
Right. So it's a it's a combination of skill and confidence.

1224
01:07:24,970 --> 01:07:30,210
So to get to that point, you have to comprehend that you are sort of like a plant.

1225
01:07:30,610 --> 01:07:32,230
Like they say, it would be like a tree, right?

1226
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:33,370
That willow that bends.

1227
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:35,390
But sometimes you need to be like an oak.

1228
01:07:36,130 --> 01:07:39,730
You have to decide when. But what I'm saying is, you know, trees, by the way, when they're

1229
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:41,170
in trouble, they can't go anywhere.

1230
01:07:41,310 --> 01:07:43,990
Can they? Well, not very quickly.

1231
01:07:44,570 --> 01:07:49,410
Yeah. Right. So that is a good analogy with the email also, because you're not going

1232
01:07:49,410 --> 01:07:54,650
anywhere. If I tell people a couple of when I got to more of an evolved email talk that

1233
01:07:54,650 --> 01:07:58,730
I had some private talks, not even with the Skype groups, I said that, you know, you've

1234
01:07:58,730 --> 01:08:01,470
never done anything and you've never gone anywhere your whole life.

1235
01:08:01,570 --> 01:08:05,530
All this experience and all this is a product of your perception and your senses and the

1236
01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:11,570
reactions of your perceptions of your environment and those around you interacting.

1237
01:08:11,730 --> 01:08:13,690
But none of you have ever done anything or gone anywhere.

1238
01:08:13,970 --> 01:08:17,490
By the way, that sounds like a lot like what society is like.

1239
01:08:17,490 --> 01:08:19,790
It seems like, you know, nothing's going anywhere.

1240
01:08:19,870 --> 01:08:20,990
Sometimes you even hear that.

1241
01:08:21,550 --> 01:08:26,090
Right. You a lot of the things that we talk about in the email are cliches already in

1242
01:08:26,090 --> 01:08:31,090
society. Like, for example, people say or, you know, the inner voice that's not your

1243
01:08:31,090 --> 01:08:35,670
voice. How many times you hear people say something like, I can't believe I said that.

1244
01:08:37,050 --> 01:08:41,450
Right. That's what because it's not, you know, you're relying on that voice that you think

1245
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:42,750
is you because it sounds like you.

1246
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:49,250
Right. So, again, on the email aspect, there is the

1247
01:08:51,130 --> 01:08:55,250
projection into the environment by measured perception.

1248
01:08:55,770 --> 01:09:00,569
What that means is when you perceive something that immediately gets you excited.

1249
01:09:01,590 --> 01:09:03,670
Right. You can take that however you want.

1250
01:09:03,790 --> 01:09:04,890
I can make a couple of them.

1251
01:09:05,790 --> 01:09:10,270
Or you could perceive something that immediately gets you excited in a panic, in a

1252
01:09:10,270 --> 01:09:11,550
negative way, fight or flight.

1253
01:09:11,550 --> 01:09:17,069
Right. These things that we use the human body, like someone's going to throw a punch or

1254
01:09:17,069 --> 01:09:19,210
slap, you move out of the way without thinking about it.

1255
01:09:19,410 --> 01:09:20,990
Okay. That's not measured.

1256
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:22,850
That's the human body reacting.

1257
01:09:23,270 --> 01:09:28,330
Right. So when you have a certain level of composure and you are able to measure your

1258
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:33,149
movement down to the millisecond, let's say, then the email can be applied.

1259
01:09:33,310 --> 01:09:38,149
But if you're a reactionary person, you hear some bad news and immediately you go into

1260
01:09:38,149 --> 01:09:44,250
that mode that you should, right, it messes you up immediately or whatever, the email is

1261
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:47,870
not going to work on you. So it's by measured composure, in other words, measured

1262
01:09:47,870 --> 01:09:49,710
reactions. Everything you do is measured.

1263
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:51,229
It doesn't mean a long time.

1264
01:09:52,010 --> 01:09:55,950
It can happen in points where a lot of times when I see an example, I said I thought

1265
01:09:55,950 --> 01:09:57,290
about that in point three seconds.

1266
01:09:57,510 --> 01:10:00,710
Right. You hear me say that point three seconds is a long time, by the way.

1267
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:02,810
For who? Right.

1268
01:10:04,670 --> 01:10:05,730
Again, depends on who.

1269
01:10:05,730 --> 01:10:10,870
So and also your skill, your skill level, karate kid type stuff.

1270
01:10:11,010 --> 01:10:16,430
Right. So when you start seeing and you're measuring everything around you and you are

1271
01:10:16,430 --> 01:10:20,350
these things have. How many times have you you know, I said you haven't done anything or

1272
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:24,390
gone anywhere. How many times in cliche language, I can't believe you brought that upon

1273
01:10:24,390 --> 01:10:26,010
yourself. Right.

1274
01:10:26,030 --> 01:10:28,910
You've heard that. Right. They didn't say I can't believe you got into that.

1275
01:10:28,990 --> 01:10:32,990
Well, they say that to brought it upon yourself means you didn't go anywhere.

1276
01:10:33,110 --> 01:10:35,710
It came to you. But there's also.

1277
01:10:35,710 --> 01:10:38,870
You got into that. But I think brought upon yourself is used a little bit more.

1278
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:44,070
Yeah. When people are trying to reach for something higher, that's what they often say.

1279
01:10:44,190 --> 01:10:46,930
Otherwise, you know, I can't believe that happened to you is the most basic.

1280
01:10:47,210 --> 01:10:48,250
But or you went to it.

1281
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:51,230
It's more like it comes to you than you go to it in the cliche.

1282
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:52,490
So watch these cliches.

1283
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:56,890
In other words, it's already out there in the what we're what we're talking about on a

1284
01:10:56,890 --> 01:11:01,890
deep level is already out there in cliches in the collective, the ignorant collective.

1285
01:11:02,030 --> 01:11:04,330
But it's meant to be dismissed in the collective.

1286
01:11:04,330 --> 01:11:08,950
Well, however, they handle it, because, you know, where do you find people in the in the

1287
01:11:08,950 --> 01:11:11,510
collective? Right. You that's why I like Nepal.

1288
01:11:11,690 --> 01:11:16,470
OK. That's why I like Napoleonic law, Napoleonic law, you're presumed guilty.

1289
01:11:18,110 --> 01:11:19,910
Right. And then you have to prove innocence.

1290
01:11:20,010 --> 01:11:21,730
We're here. They tell you you preserve here.

1291
01:11:21,790 --> 01:11:23,130
There's no presumed guilt or innocence.

1292
01:11:23,130 --> 01:11:25,010
Just about monetizing the charge.

1293
01:11:25,150 --> 01:11:26,030
Right. Of course.

1294
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:29,170
Yeah. That's the one thing that people will never understand.

1295
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:34,190
Meaning until these people are these people that are here now will never understand this.

1296
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:36,530
The new people hopefully will now.

1297
01:11:38,810 --> 01:11:45,650
The the collective has when you are putting out stuff like that's unrated, why it's

1298
01:11:45,650 --> 01:11:51,930
actually aimed at the collective, but not it's not it's towards them, but not for them.

1299
01:11:52,510 --> 01:11:56,050
Right. You see, like sometimes they say, hey, we should get some more subs.

1300
01:11:56,090 --> 01:11:57,470
We need to put it out here, put it out there.

1301
01:11:57,530 --> 01:12:00,230
We're putting it out to the collective, whether it's alternative media or not.

1302
01:12:01,370 --> 01:12:04,170
The alternative media to me is like the lie that Satan said.

1303
01:12:04,230 --> 01:12:07,810
The first thing Satan got people to believe is that he doesn't exist.

1304
01:12:07,930 --> 01:12:10,510
Well, the alternative media got people to believe that they're really alternative.

1305
01:12:10,930 --> 01:12:13,710
Right. Anyway, that's just take it how you want it.

1306
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:14,630
I think that's pretty true.

1307
01:12:15,170 --> 01:12:16,610
Yeah. So.

1308
01:12:18,030 --> 01:12:22,850
Well, this is this is towards the collective, the stuff that's on rated Y, but it's not for

1309
01:12:22,850 --> 01:12:27,090
them, it's towards them, because there's going to be one out of a thousand, one out of a

1310
01:12:27,090 --> 01:12:29,630
hundred thousand that will hear this and say, I could use this.

1311
01:12:29,630 --> 01:12:35,770
Right. Or or this is super rarefied information that's super usable and super practical.

1312
01:12:36,090 --> 01:12:39,850
Right. So you see, that's where the emo works.

1313
01:12:39,870 --> 01:12:45,230
Also, you can when you're doing emo work and I think you and I have gotten over, I said

1314
01:12:45,230 --> 01:12:49,390
I'm going to save it for the solo sonics, but you and I have gotten over some of it or

1315
01:12:49,390 --> 01:12:55,570
enough of it where the emotions that you have are for a purpose and no one, even in

1316
01:12:55,570 --> 01:12:58,250
psychology and psychiatry, know why it's there.

1317
01:12:58,330 --> 01:12:59,210
It's just that it's there.

1318
01:12:59,710 --> 01:13:03,590
And the other example that I gave is it makes certain people that are measured character

1319
01:13:03,590 --> 01:13:07,090
a certain way, do things that are out of their measured character.

1320
01:13:07,270 --> 01:13:10,290
You know, the mild mannered guy that kills his whole family, what made him do it?

1321
01:13:11,030 --> 01:13:14,190
Right. Other than the voice in his head, it's the he had to be into an emotional state.

1322
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:18,910
Have you ever gotten into a frenzy where the adrenaline kicks in and you stop and your

1323
01:13:18,910 --> 01:13:21,550
heart rates go, you know, you need to relax, get out of it.

1324
01:13:21,550 --> 01:13:23,870
Right. That's all emotionally ticked off.

1325
01:13:23,990 --> 01:13:28,510
Right. So the emo can tick off your adrenals and all the dopamines and all this other

1326
01:13:28,510 --> 01:13:31,990
stuff. If you've ever been in a fight that you weren't planning or expecting or

1327
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:36,610
weren't skilled, when the fight ends and you pull yourself away, your whole body is

1328
01:13:36,610 --> 01:13:40,590
numb. If your fists are numb while you're punching the other guy, you don't feel

1329
01:13:40,590 --> 01:13:44,930
them. And if you got your face beaten to a pulp, you don't feel anything anyway.

1330
01:13:45,250 --> 01:13:46,910
No, not until the next day.

1331
01:13:47,730 --> 01:13:51,430
Yeah. And even like I'm saying during the fight, your body just shuts down.

1332
01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:53,010
So. Right.

1333
01:13:53,110 --> 01:13:58,010
So this is all the initial that is the the body, the human body doing that.

1334
01:13:58,010 --> 01:14:01,050
Not you. The emo overrides all that.

1335
01:14:01,850 --> 01:14:07,570
That's like. You know, the it doesn't override it to

1336
01:14:07,570 --> 01:14:12,250
stop it, but it overrides it either to enhance it or control it.

1337
01:14:12,530 --> 01:14:15,410
That's why I said earlier, when you get into a situation, if you're not in control,

1338
01:14:15,450 --> 01:14:16,990
the situation is out of control.

1339
01:14:17,450 --> 01:14:19,310
Right. It has nothing.

1340
01:14:19,490 --> 01:14:21,710
It's more on the emo ether perspective.

1341
01:14:22,330 --> 01:14:27,750
In other words, when most people walk into a room, they just as tall

1342
01:14:28,010 --> 01:14:29,550
tell me something about the room.

1343
01:14:29,690 --> 01:14:34,450
They're going to give you mostly physical descriptions

1344
01:14:35,010 --> 01:14:37,970
where when you're into the emo, you're going to give more of a feeling.

1345
01:14:38,110 --> 01:14:42,910
How does it feel? Fortunately, I was around people in the 70s and 80s that were

1346
01:14:42,910 --> 01:14:44,490
kind of new agey, but more practical.

1347
01:14:45,130 --> 01:14:48,050
They would talk a lot about energy like once they would meet.

1348
01:14:48,190 --> 01:14:49,530
So that person has good energy.

1349
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:52,010
That person has bad energy or this room has bad energy.

1350
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:53,330
This place has good energy. Right.

1351
01:14:53,350 --> 01:14:54,290
You've heard that, right? Of course.

1352
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:57,190
Yeah. Fortunately, from a young age, I was around that.

1353
01:14:57,190 --> 01:15:01,270
And I wasn't really digging it too much using language from back then.

1354
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:05,290
Right. And but it was stuck in the mind that it was something available.

1355
01:15:05,730 --> 01:15:10,690
And not until I kept asking what is the purpose of emotions and started piecing

1356
01:15:10,690 --> 01:15:15,730
that together into a workable form that I see that to see things in energy forms.

1357
01:15:15,930 --> 01:15:20,530
The other thing about the energy forms is this is something also I recently got

1358
01:15:20,530 --> 01:15:23,730
from listening to the Castaneda audiobooks is omens.

1359
01:15:23,730 --> 01:15:28,710
I heard like I was doing some masonry work and oh, the Don Juan looked free, saw

1360
01:15:28,710 --> 01:15:32,210
enough omens. I was like, oh, my gosh, we call that synchronicities.

1361
01:15:32,610 --> 01:15:35,810
And there is no level to how fine that can go.

1362
01:15:37,110 --> 01:15:41,970
When you're going into a situation, let's say yesterday I went to get some I

1363
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:44,090
didn't feel like I can get some fried chicken from Albertson's.

1364
01:15:44,090 --> 01:15:45,950
It was terrible. I just fed it to the cats.

1365
01:15:46,030 --> 01:15:47,550
I couldn't get it past my nose.

1366
01:15:48,530 --> 01:15:52,970
And actually, most people cover your ears, white people, whatever people don't

1367
01:15:52,970 --> 01:15:54,850
know how to cook, would think it's great.

1368
01:15:56,050 --> 01:15:58,530
I went, it's crunchy, it's tasty, it's a little salty.

1369
01:15:59,890 --> 01:16:03,110
So it's preference, yes, but I'm telling you, it's not good.

1370
01:16:03,830 --> 01:16:09,490
On my way there, I had so many little tiny omens showing me this is not the place

1371
01:16:09,490 --> 01:16:11,070
to get where and I ignored them.

1372
01:16:11,210 --> 01:16:13,930
But I acknowledge them, but I ignored them.

1373
01:16:14,610 --> 01:16:18,310
In other words, I didn't let that these little signs dissuade me from making the

1374
01:16:18,310 --> 01:16:21,650
order, actually making the transaction and taking it home.

1375
01:16:21,650 --> 01:16:27,990
But on another occasion and around people, I would walk into a place and use those

1376
01:16:27,990 --> 01:16:30,710
omens and say, this is not right.

1377
01:16:30,810 --> 01:16:32,870
And then someone else that we knew would go over there.

1378
01:16:32,890 --> 01:16:33,930
So how is that? Sucks.

1379
01:16:34,070 --> 01:16:36,510
I said, OK, so now I know I'm dialed in.

1380
01:16:36,650 --> 01:16:39,610
Right. I ignored all of the little omens.

1381
01:16:39,670 --> 01:16:43,790
What those omens are lots of minutiae, minutiae.

1382
01:16:44,530 --> 01:16:47,950
You look as you're walking through a path, you look at the from your peripheral

1383
01:16:47,950 --> 01:16:50,070
vision, what are you picking up?

1384
01:16:50,070 --> 01:16:54,550
Is the without getting into my personal details of what I saw in the space that

1385
01:16:54,550 --> 01:16:56,110
won't really help. Maybe it will.

1386
01:16:56,690 --> 01:17:00,830
But let's say you're walking from down a supermarket aisle or an open aisle where

1387
01:17:00,830 --> 01:17:01,710
the vegetables are.

1388
01:17:02,030 --> 01:17:05,550
OK, you're kind of not really hyper focused on where you're going.

1389
01:17:05,670 --> 01:17:07,310
You just know you've got to go to the back of the store.

1390
01:17:07,370 --> 01:17:09,770
There's no one in front of you that you're going to walk into like a dummy.

1391
01:17:09,890 --> 01:17:11,590
Right. You just keep walking.

1392
01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:16,870
And your main focusing is kind of off and kind of like general glancing.

1393
01:17:17,530 --> 01:17:21,010
You're not focused on it, but your peripheral vision at that point gets into

1394
01:17:21,010 --> 01:17:24,970
high, high view, but you don't notice it.

1395
01:17:25,330 --> 01:17:29,350
You don't notice it. I was picking up crazy stuff in the peripheral vision, maybe

1396
01:17:29,350 --> 01:17:33,870
things that other people couldn't see, maybe the presence of certain energies and

1397
01:17:33,870 --> 01:17:37,290
things. And just how you said you can see color.

1398
01:17:37,710 --> 01:17:39,770
I mean, you could see heat on something.

1399
01:17:40,010 --> 01:17:44,350
The peripheral vision I was picking up was a lot of greens, but not the green that

1400
01:17:44,350 --> 01:17:49,530
you consider with fresh fruits and vegetables and plants, but a putrid kind of

1401
01:17:49,530 --> 01:17:52,290
green aura right in the in the place.

1402
01:17:52,890 --> 01:17:56,290
And then some physical things like some a piece of fruit had fallen.

1403
01:17:56,470 --> 01:17:59,850
It was at the bottom of the stand and it was like pushed in by someone's toes.

1404
01:18:00,010 --> 01:18:02,410
And it was just sitting there more than a day.

1405
01:18:02,570 --> 01:18:05,990
Right. When I got to the counter, it looked clear.

1406
01:18:06,110 --> 01:18:10,110
But as soon as I turned around, there was a morbidly obese woman in one of these

1407
01:18:11,730 --> 01:18:14,850
motorized wagons that looked like you could carry masonry blocks.

1408
01:18:15,130 --> 01:18:19,210
She was about four feet wide and she could have weighed no less than 500 pounds.

1409
01:18:19,310 --> 01:18:20,270
That morbidly obese.

1410
01:18:20,510 --> 01:18:21,990
Okay. Didn't even look human.

1411
01:18:22,110 --> 01:18:24,050
Kind of like a job of the hut character.

1412
01:18:24,530 --> 01:18:26,810
Gotcha. About four feet wide.

1413
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:32,410
So she couldn't go into most shops because most shops are 36 inch or 38, 40 inch

1414
01:18:32,410 --> 01:18:34,710
doors. Right. She had for her.

1415
01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:36,710
It has to be the double door sliders.

1416
01:18:37,010 --> 01:18:38,210
No way she can go.

1417
01:18:38,710 --> 01:18:43,810
And the wheels on this thing were like very heavy, airless tires like you see on

1418
01:18:43,810 --> 01:18:48,830
heavy duty wheelbarrow carts that they have at railroad yards, solid tires and the

1419
01:18:48,830 --> 01:18:51,890
kind of carts you see at railroad yards that move heavy stuff.

1420
01:18:51,970 --> 01:18:55,650
Like if you go to a railroad yard and pick up a bucket of something, you try to pick

1421
01:18:55,650 --> 01:18:57,090
it up. Feels like it's bolted to the floor.

1422
01:18:57,190 --> 01:18:58,290
That's how heavy stuff is there.

1423
01:18:58,390 --> 01:19:02,490
Right. Nothing against morbidly, but she showed up out of nowhere.

1424
01:19:02,650 --> 01:19:03,890
She was not in my peripheral.

1425
01:19:04,050 --> 01:19:05,270
She was not in my view.

1426
01:19:05,770 --> 01:19:09,890
The moment I got to the counter and looked to the left, it's like Scotty Beam, you're

1427
01:19:09,890 --> 01:19:15,350
down there. At that point, I was already having everyone behind the counter laughing

1428
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:20,810
and the jerk off manager that got out of college was ready to spray the Windex, you

1429
01:19:20,810 --> 01:19:21,710
see, the glass cleaner.

1430
01:19:22,370 --> 01:19:23,790
Everything was going wrong.

1431
01:19:24,450 --> 01:19:28,850
But what I asked the guy behind the counter is I said, is this chicken dry?

1432
01:19:29,210 --> 01:19:31,270
He says, it's OK. I said, how long has it been here?

1433
01:19:31,270 --> 01:19:35,970
When someone doesn't give you a quantitative or quality of answer, then you got to play

1434
01:19:35,970 --> 01:19:37,030
detective. All right.

1435
01:19:37,030 --> 01:19:38,070
How long has it been out here?

1436
01:19:39,030 --> 01:19:40,370
20 minutes. All right.

1437
01:19:40,410 --> 01:19:41,770
Now I got something I can use.

1438
01:19:41,870 --> 01:19:42,610
Right. Right.

1439
01:19:43,110 --> 01:19:48,130
Right. The next thing I said is if your mom came here and she wanted to get chicken, what

1440
01:19:48,130 --> 01:19:53,150
would you give her? He says, I would go in the back and I'd batter some up and fry some

1441
01:19:53,150 --> 01:19:55,390
fresh. And how long would it take?

1442
01:19:55,450 --> 01:19:57,450
She'd have to wait, what, 15 minutes?

1443
01:19:57,530 --> 01:19:58,410
Yeah, 15 minutes.

1444
01:19:58,410 --> 01:20:02,310
Mm hmm. And he looks at me and he says, I'm going to do that for you.

1445
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:04,750
Right. And OK.

1446
01:20:04,970 --> 01:20:06,410
And that's how I talk to people.

1447
01:20:06,530 --> 01:20:10,690
Every time there's no one talks to them that way, they just say, I want a quarter pound

1448
01:20:10,690 --> 01:20:12,830
of ham sliced in and I want to.

1449
01:20:13,370 --> 01:20:14,570
OK, thank you.

1450
01:20:14,870 --> 01:20:16,590
That's all they get all day, all day.

1451
01:20:16,870 --> 01:20:18,050
They get no interaction.

1452
01:20:18,170 --> 01:20:23,070
Right. Right. So so I interact with these people like I haven't seen them since the third

1453
01:20:23,070 --> 01:20:24,370
grade. Right.

1454
01:20:24,370 --> 01:20:28,790
Right. So anyway, while this is happening and all this, I'm looking around and I say,

1455
01:20:28,870 --> 01:20:30,290
you know, I need to leave this place.

1456
01:20:30,410 --> 01:20:31,190
But I didn't. Right.

1457
01:20:31,670 --> 01:20:37,610
So again, I don't like to talk about personal experiences, but this is to illustrate how

1458
01:20:37,610 --> 01:20:39,010
the emo is being used.

1459
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:43,230
Now, I didn't use the Jedi on him very often.

1460
01:20:43,730 --> 01:20:44,850
Give some personal stuff.

1461
01:20:45,610 --> 01:20:48,490
I had gone with the wife once to get some recycled paint.

1462
01:20:50,010 --> 01:20:52,330
OK, and it's excellent, by the way.

1463
01:20:52,330 --> 01:20:57,610
Take a look up. Recycled paint, one coat covers it's the people bring all their trash paint

1464
01:20:57,610 --> 01:21:00,310
and they mix them in general colors and they sell them to you real cheap.

1465
01:21:00,950 --> 01:21:05,010
It's super thick. It covers really well because the particle sizes are so mixed up that

1466
01:21:05,010 --> 01:21:07,430
it's going to cover what I mean by particle sizes.

1467
01:21:07,610 --> 01:21:12,830
You know that a half a gallon of gravel, a half a gallon of sand and a half a gallon

1468
01:21:12,830 --> 01:21:18,700
of rock make one gallon all fit in a one gallon container.

1469
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:20,920
Most people say, how could that be?

1470
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:23,460
A half a gallon plus a half a gallon plus a half a gallon.

1471
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:25,080
You need a gallon and a half. No.

1472
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:30,000
If you take a half a gallon of rock, a half a gallon of sand and a half a gallon of gravel

1473
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,480
and mix them all together, they all fit neatly in one gallon.

1474
01:21:32,860 --> 01:21:35,360
Right. Because one fits inside the spaces of the other.

1475
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:37,020
Right. OK.

1476
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:39,780
Anyway, that's how the recycled paint works.

1477
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:44,880
So once you get recycled paint and they were advertising fifteen dollars a bucket, I get

1478
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:46,260
there, it's twenty dollars a bucket.

1479
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,200
I say, well, how about fifteen dollars?

1480
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:52,260
And the guy says, no, it's nineteen ninety nine plus tax.

1481
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:54,860
You know, when they say plus tax, it's like, fuck you.

1482
01:21:54,980 --> 01:21:57,620
Right. So I'm like, all right.

1483
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:01,580
Oh, I wasn't expecting this and I want to try this stuff.

1484
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:06,960
So we look around the store. I take two buckets to the cashier and I the guy is not

1485
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,920
busy. You know, when no one's behind the cashier, you're kind of taking a break.

1486
01:22:10,340 --> 01:22:14,700
All right. He wasn't thinking I caught he wasn't thinking about anything at all.

1487
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:20,640
And I went into his head and I said, dude, I love you and I need this paint.

1488
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:22,080
So and you're going to help me out.

1489
01:22:22,260 --> 01:22:24,160
Something like that. Emo without words.

1490
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:29,420
So he looks at me with a dead stare and I and I say, I'd like to check out these two

1491
01:22:29,420 --> 01:22:32,580
buckets and I'm dead stare back.

1492
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:38,580
He rings up ten dollars even just ten dollars even.

1493
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:41,360
And I had that number in my mind anyway.

1494
01:22:42,020 --> 01:22:46,880
OK, I'm not so sure if I had that number, but I wanted to just get the paint and feel

1495
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:49,440
like I just got a Christmas gift.

1496
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:51,520
You know how they say, right? It was Christmas.

1497
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:54,460
So I look at him. I always do this with him.

1498
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:56,580
I say ten dollars for these two buckets.

1499
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:57,760
Right. And he goes, yes.

1500
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:00,160
My wife's like, what?

1501
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:04,120
And I'm like, honey, go get the car, because I don't know how long this is going to

1502
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:05,460
last on this guy. Right. Right.

1503
01:23:05,740 --> 01:23:09,700
Go get the car right now. Also, you get out, leave the store now, get the car now.

1504
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:13,440
So when I'm done with the train, basically, you know, that means when I'm when I get

1505
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:16,320
when I give by telling him the money, the car's on its way.

1506
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:17,420
We get the hell out of here. Right.

1507
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:21,900
And she's in the car, she goes, oh, my gosh, I don't believe we did to that poor guy.

1508
01:23:21,980 --> 01:23:24,000
I said, what poor guy? He was a jerk off to us.

1509
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:29,620
And I've done this over and over and over and over hundreds of times in the past

1510
01:23:29,620 --> 01:23:36,740
decade in my life, in in commercial situations, not to get over.

1511
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:42,180
Right. One time I had done something out of hardware, so I don't to get in particulars of the

1512
01:23:42,180 --> 01:23:47,440
story. And I walked out with time and a half the money that I walked in with, with all

1513
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:48,380
the stuff I had.

1514
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:51,140
And I was like, this isn't right.

1515
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:56,580
So I went back in and I put the note because she gave me back my note and the change

1516
01:23:56,580 --> 01:23:57,900
and all the stuff.

1517
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:03,140
And I said, oh, my gosh, this is a single mom with three children that lives in a trailer

1518
01:24:03,140 --> 01:24:07,580
park. And at the end of the day, when they add up the register and it's fifty dollars

1519
01:24:07,580 --> 01:24:09,220
off, she's going to lose her job.

1520
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:11,900
That's not good. Right.

1521
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:13,860
So I go back in and I put the note on the counter.

1522
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,100
I said, just put this in the register.

1523
01:24:15,260 --> 01:24:17,060
It'll add up. It'll check out.

1524
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:17,940
Well, she goes, what?

1525
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:19,780
Why are you giving me this?

1526
01:24:20,220 --> 01:24:21,800
And then she's checking people's manager.

1527
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:24,980
I need a manager to just put this in the register and everything will be fine.

1528
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,080
And I ran out of there. Right.

1529
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:31,500
Because you always have to do the right thing, you know, to an extent.

1530
01:24:32,140 --> 01:24:36,740
But when someone is acting like they really don't like you and it's a cash business

1531
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:41,580
and you just met them and you're trying to be courteous, you could pull the email on

1532
01:24:41,580 --> 01:24:45,080
them and say, these are not the droids that you seek, you know, kind of thing.

1533
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:48,300
That's just more of an evolved position.

1534
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:54,660
But basically, it all comes from I don't like to use the word love, but I do because

1535
01:24:54,660 --> 01:24:57,960
love is doing the definition of the word love is to do the right thing.

1536
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:03,380
Right. When someone asks you for something, people always look at all these other

1537
01:25:03,380 --> 01:25:05,700
conditions and whether they're going to meet that request.

1538
01:25:05,860 --> 01:25:12,200
Right. And when you measure the degree of that request, the person is making and you

1539
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:17,080
measure the degree that you that your condition and you see that that you're much

1540
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:20,940
better off. You write that you show them love.

1541
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:22,320
Right. See what I mean?

1542
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:26,840
So when someone like the analogy that I give with love is if someone calls you up at

1543
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:30,140
three in the morning because they need to help moving, it shouldn't have taken that

1544
01:25:30,140 --> 01:25:32,480
long. Most people are going to say, dude, it's three in the morning.

1545
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:33,920
I got to go to work in the morning.

1546
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:34,980
Right. What are you doing? Call.

1547
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:37,100
Right. Where's the love?

1548
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:40,620
Right. And when you get there to help them, don't be begrudging.

1549
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:44,960
Right. Because then you cut the love off, you showed the love by agreeing to be there

1550
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:47,420
and showing up. But you have to do it joyfully.

1551
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:50,340
Right. So all this has to be done with joy.

1552
01:25:50,820 --> 01:25:58,860
But the funniest thing is to is to get over on these techno corporate morons, both the

1553
01:25:58,860 --> 01:26:02,320
people that work there and the institution itself.

1554
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:07,820
And the easiest way to do that, by the way, because the people that work in these

1555
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:09,280
corporations don't know anything.

1556
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:13,800
Like, for example, if you go to a bank, those bank tellers don't know anything.

1557
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:15,520
I used to screw them up.

1558
01:26:16,020 --> 01:26:20,000
Well, years ago, I used to go in with a check and I said, can I get can I exchange this

1559
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,100
for Federal Reserve notes?

1560
01:26:21,980 --> 01:26:24,660
Sure. Hold on a second.

1561
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:26,780
Don't call the manager. No, I have to call the manager.

1562
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:28,620
No, don't call the manager.

1563
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:30,520
Manager comes over.

1564
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:33,600
He said he wants Federal Reserve notes for this.

1565
01:26:33,740 --> 01:26:35,620
She doesn't even glance at the clerk.

1566
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:39,620
She elbows her out of the way and she counts the notes out and gives me a dead stare.

1567
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:41,500
Right. Because they're really dumb.

1568
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:43,680
The same with doctors and lawyers and all that stuff.

1569
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:48,940
But the really way to get back at the corporate system, in other words, the people that

1570
01:26:48,940 --> 01:26:50,900
work in these corporate other foot soldiers, right?

1571
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,020
You can't talk to them.

1572
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:53,320
Just pawn pieces.

1573
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:56,980
And when you play chess, what's the first thing gets wiped off the board?

1574
01:26:57,560 --> 01:26:59,060
Right. The pawns.

1575
01:27:00,060 --> 01:27:04,600
The way to do it is by not in non endorsement and everything has conditions.

1576
01:27:04,940 --> 01:27:06,880
You do everything with conditions.

1577
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:11,220
And the easiest way to do that is with your signature.

1578
01:27:11,420 --> 01:27:12,980
By the way, I don't know if I've ever shared this.

1579
01:27:14,580 --> 01:27:18,260
A lot of these patriot law types say, oh, it's your signature, right?

1580
01:27:18,260 --> 01:27:20,540
Your signature, right? Don't give them your signature.

1581
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:24,640
Oh, a cop wanted me to sign the ticket and I didn't want to sign.

1582
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:26,080
So they took me to jail. Right.

1583
01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:27,580
I don't know if you've ever heard this before.

1584
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:29,520
Yeah. OK. Stupid.

1585
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:32,980
Signature is yes, they're using it.

1586
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:36,600
And someone came back to me and said, Greek, any mark you make is bullshit because it's

1587
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:39,040
intent. Remember the logos marking them out?

1588
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:40,820
Right. Intent is very important.

1589
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:43,260
I'll sign anything all day long.

1590
01:27:43,340 --> 01:27:44,680
It don't matter to the Greek. Why?

1591
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:47,460
Because whenever I sign anything, I sign void.

1592
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:51,880
I haven't signed the Greeks government name in 15 years on anything ever.

1593
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:54,880
I sign void. How do I sign void?

1594
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:59,000
I don't write block letters V, O, D.

1595
01:27:59,860 --> 01:28:02,240
No, you sign it like a doctor writes void.

1596
01:28:02,980 --> 01:28:05,620
You scribble it and it kind of looks like a V.

1597
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:10,680
A scribble in the middle kind of looks like a D with an I over the left part of the

1598
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:14,640
scribble. So so if you look at that, it looks like a signature.

1599
01:28:14,780 --> 01:28:15,780
What does it say? I'm not sure.

1600
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:16,820
I said it says void.

1601
01:28:16,820 --> 01:28:18,580
The moment I say it says void, you look at it.

1602
01:28:18,580 --> 01:28:20,760
Yeah, I see it now like that.

1603
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,240
Right. Everything.

1604
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:27,320
So if you don't like what you sign or what they made you sign, you just simply write

1605
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:31,480
them a letter, tell them they have to settle that discharge or get rid of it because

1606
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:32,480
you signed it void.

1607
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,280
For this reason, this reason and that reason, what they're doing is unlawful.

1608
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:37,420
Holy shit.

1609
01:28:38,660 --> 01:28:40,580
Holy shit. What just happened?
