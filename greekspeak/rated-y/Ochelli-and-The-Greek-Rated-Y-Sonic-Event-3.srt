1
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:25,600
Sonic Event 3, actually, just for the record, Ocelli and the Greek, welcome. Anyway, we

2
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:42,420
will continue with the discussion from last time, sort of. And I always love doing this and creating a segue, so that's actually what we were discussing before I started recording. Just again, for the record, Greek, how are you this fine day?

3
00:00:42,420 --> 00:01:06,460
Oh, it's fine enough. You know, we haven't been doing the timekeeping. I'd say today is the 14th day of the 12th month, right? And the year, you just add, you know, from 1998 to 6000, so you add two years, so it's 6025 since that atomic thing went down, supposedly.

4
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:21,140
Well, there you have it. But of course, to the listener, it's kind of irrelevant, because they could be listening to this a year later, they could be listening to this a few hours later, right? So their timekeeping will vary as they are hearing you.

5
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:30,480
Yeah, let's just timestamp this one, that rough. What would it be the other way? Was it the 17th of February 2023 on the Pope's calendar?

6
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:43,100
Yes, indeed. And the day started, you know, according to the time we're at the day started on their schedule. Well, let's see about what 16 hours ago. But

7
00:01:44,080 --> 00:02:08,020
Oh, you mean? Yeah, right. Midnight. Yeah, day starts at noon. So I know high noon. Yeah. But that's the point is that 16 hours ago versus about four hours ago. Right. So when did the day start? There you have it. All right. But again, this your experience will vary. And that might come up, especially when we have to talk about something like, oh, boy, health.

8
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:36,560
And we were talking about that in the previous sonic event. And health, health in general. I'm hearing this more and more, by the way, and it's striking my ears rudely, in my mind. Because what do we have to say here, Greek? I want to increase my health. I want to make my health better. I want to be healthy, Greek. What do you say?

9
00:02:38,020 --> 00:03:04,140
This is not for children. Right. But so but anyway, I'll hold back. I usually start off with a bunch of pejoratives. Right. Cuss words, you know, who Greek said the bad word. I'm gonna tell my mommy. Right. Kind of stuff. Whenever I'm brought into a health discussion earlier on the Sonics, I brought up telling people right off the bat, they should do this or consider this.

10
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:25,720
They get they see it kind of a fronted affrontive. And that's too forward for me. But if you give them a hint, they can't take a hint. They don't get it either. So there's somewhere in between. And this is this. I'll try to stay in the between spot. I always start off yelling at people. Why are you asking about being healthy when there's no such thing?

11
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:48,540
Okay. In ancient tradition, you bid someone at a greeting or farewell. You you bid them good health. This is you'll find this more and more, you know, Saludos in Spanish greetings. Right. This means basically health. Right. So most of the toasts and all that is to health. But it is so general.

12
00:03:49,840 --> 00:04:16,880
But when it was done in ancient times, it was understood that it attached to your behavior, your profession, what you did in life, your age. When someone was very old, they wished them, you know, that may they live to 100, even on their ninety ninth birthday. Right. So you got to be careful with that one. But either way, there is no quote unquote health in general that can be discussed.

13
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:43,480
And what is he saying? I think I broached this before. I'll recap it real quick. Health for what? In other words, it implies some level of fitness and recovery that you will be able to sustain in the body. Right. So recovery would be you get tired when you get your energy back to continue. And fitness is how you know your endurance, how long you can go, let's say.

14
00:04:43,920 --> 00:05:08,820
Right. And this goes if you're just sitting in an office all day. You got eight hours of sleep, four hours of sleep. Let's say you got two hours of sleep every night working in an office. You're not doing well. You need more than two hours, even if you're just sedentary. So it gets I mean, I can give a million combinations on how there is no health per se. But there are certain things like lack of sleep, lack of nutrition, what that'll wear you down, no matter what you're doing.

15
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:27,220
But essentially, most of the people that are coming in to interest to have a health discussion already know that if you get an hour or two hours of sleep or sleep deprivation, you're not going to do well. Or if your food is devoid or intake is devoid of nutrition, by the way, air is also nutritive.

16
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:42,720
OK, so, for example, a poor, poorly nutritive or poor air quality. Right. You will not feel as good as fresh air quality or good air quality. So water, food, all of these things are well known.

17
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:57,800
So these general health discussions appeal to me off to the max, because when you're generally in fairly good healthful state, discussing health in general is completely moot, must be specific.

18
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:14,420
Are you going to be climbing the mountain, the mountain, the tallest mountain in the world or a short hill? Are you sitting at an office? Are you a UPS driver? Are you doing construction work? Are you a mom raising children? What are you doing that you need certain health for?

19
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:30,280
And I'll give a few examples and maybe we'll bring up a direct. What would you say a question? We have a chat right on the members site. Sure, we do. Actually, that would be a good thing to let people know in case they haven't taken notice of it.

20
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:46,900
If you are on the Sonics page at Ocelli.com, there is a wide open chat tango, which anybody could either sign into or post anonymously if they like to enter any sort of feedback, a comment, a question, a suggestion.

21
00:06:46,900 --> 00:07:06,060
All of these things are there and it's actually not run by us, but we do have some access to it and are able to observe it. Us meaning myself in the Greek, but someone else has taken on the duties of sort of running that and they will be responsible also for handling it.

22
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:25,960
And you're free to post there. And again, you don't have to identify yourself, but it's only being seen publicly easily on that page. Now you could access it without going to that page as well, but it is a useful little tool and we will be utilizing it in future presentations for sure.

23
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:46,540
And somewhat in this one. Yes, in a bit here. And the comments were good, by the way, so far, all of them and pertinent. Let's get into an experience I had when I was peddling water. Spring 2.0, we synthesized tap water into the finest quality spring water, similar to the finest quality spring waters in the world.

24
00:07:46,540 --> 00:08:06,340
And we were peddling it at a high end health food store, two of the high end health food stores in L.A. One of them is Arowana. The other one was Rossum, who got busted for selling raw milk a decade ago. So when I was at Rossum, their whole thing was you're going to get healthy if you eat raw food.

25
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:32,120
In other words, up until 108 or 110 degrees, if it's more than 110 or whatever degrees, it's no longer raw. So everybody's got to eat raw to be healthy. Well, people would come over while I was peddling water and ask me about this and that. I said, well, what about the raw deal? Do I eat raw? And I said, well, right now I don't because I'm not fully, fully active.

26
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:49,580
What do you mean by that? I said, well, it depends on what kind of work you do. And they're like, what do you mean what kind of work to do? I said, okay, let's look at the goats, the sheep, the cows, whatever, the monkeys or whatever. They eat raw food, right? I don't see them showing up with a kitchen, you know, the skillet and the pot and the crock pot or anything like that.

27
00:08:49,580 --> 00:09:10,720
And very few of them have time to enroll in a chef school. I mean, let's be honest. Yeah, right. And by the way, the thing about people when they say I went to cooking class, chefs that get formal training that can't get a job because they're not very good at cooking end up doing what? Teaching cooking classes. Think about that. So you have people who can't cook teaching other people who can't cook. How is that going to end up anyway?

28
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:40,320
Isn't that the way most professions work anyway? Okay. Yeah. But we're on the food topic. So I figured I'd hammer those guys. And I've proven this to people. But anyway, so I basically said, look, you know, these animals that eat raw all the time, what are they doing? You know, they're moving around constantly, constantly. So if you're not, let's say you have an office, what kind of work you do? And the person said, well, you know, I work in an office and this and that a file manager or something.

29
00:09:41,200 --> 00:10:01,260
And I said, well, how much is sedentary? This is about half of it. And I said, well, then I would say right off the bat, you know, half raw, half cooked. And because if you ate just raw and you were sedentary, it would just it would be kind of difficult to. Are we still on? Yeah. Yeah. I was wondering why you were pausing.

30
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:24,680
Yeah, we somehow dropped the connection. Oh, and it's not letting me know. It might be on your end, maybe my end. I didn't hear drop at all. So yeah, it's as if it's recalling. Okay, so let's see where we were left off, basically with the what kind of profession they did. And they were half sedentary, half not sedentary.

31
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:48,020
Right. And then you said that. Well, it depends because if you're active, if you take in the raw, if you were entirely raw, what would happen? That's where you'd be miserable. Yeah, you've got this very energetic, high fiber, pretty dense stuff sitting in your gut. And you'll wish you'll wish that you were moving around more.

32
00:10:48,600 --> 00:11:08,160
While I was saying this, some of the principles of Rossum pulled me aside. And not only aside, they took me out of the whole place outside and reprimanded me for saying, how dare you? Right. So that I kind of ran through my mind. I said, OK, all right. So this is about sales, not about reality.

33
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:33,540
So, well, of course, let's just look against your your your guest in their in their what do you call their proprietary space? Right. So, well, they gave me a spill. I was selling out of there to his commercial. But by the way, yeah. But either way, it's for a liter of water. So it wasn't cheap. Right. But either way, you can't work against the place you're working in. That's part of the deal usually. Right. You can't sit.

34
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:52,660
You know, in other words, you don't set up a coffee stand in the middle of the bookstore and then tell everybody the books all suck. You know, I mean, it just it's not what I was. It was at least in this case, it was half half suck. But, you know, I basically I did bring up the point that if you're really active, raw works fine in most cases.

35
00:11:52,660 --> 00:12:10,890
Let's let's take an analogy when you're not feeling well, when you've lost levity. And I'm saying that literally you no longer can levitate as much as, you know, stay vertical. You have to lay down because you're not feeling well. What are they prescribed? Soup, right? Chicken soup.

36
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:35,050
Right. A light, a lighter diet, a liquid diet, eating soup. It's cooked. You've lost levity. You can't stay vertical anymore. You're laying down. You're sick. In some circles, it's called Jewish penicillin chicken soup with the schmaltz on top schmaltz, which is the fat. All those things have in common is they've been broken down and they're warm.

37
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:49,330
So when it gets into the body, it's already in a in a state where it's just can't be broken down anymore. And the body just takes over when the food is raw. It's on a very high state and it takes a lot of energy from the body to break it down.

38
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:58,850
Well, quick question is the fact that it's warm at the moment you're you're taking it in. Is that relevant or is it just relevant that it's been warmed and therefore broken down?

39
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:15,870
Cool. Both. OK, both. Yeah, both. That's that could be complicated. But the simplest thing is in sports. Very often the football coach, you know, the team goes in and they start guzzling cold water. What do they say? Don't drink the cold water. Right. It's too cold. Right. So it'll shock the body.

40
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:38,450
If it's warm, it'll be more accepting. It has that warming energy. Yeah, I would avoid. Well, if you go to certain Asian cultures, they drink hot tea, whether it's hot or cold out. You know, it's they don't they don't seek icy drinks. Also, when you have an icy drink, for example, with a very fatty meal, you know what happens with fat in the refrigerator, right?

41
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:57,750
So I always recommend a warm drink with any meal. But the basis of this is an example on how people get dogmatic about one thing. I mean, this is the way to go. You have all these ridiculous diets. I think the most recent one is the keto thing. Right.

42
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:16,270
And it's all pranking, by the way. The people that know how the body works and all this are silent. They're just watching everyone fall for all these dietary pranks throughout time, which is funny, too, because like a merry-go-round, like these things come back around all the time to write a different version of it.

43
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:40,770
They call it something slightly different. But here's what you do. Just eat all fat and you'll be OK, you know, or just eat all one particular type of thing. Grapefruit every every day, every season doesn't matter. That's what your body needs. I mean, I'm not saying this is what to do. Let me just be clear. I'm saying that I'm giving examples of the repetitive and revolving cycle of this that I see.

44
00:14:40,770 --> 00:15:01,430
Right. I mean, it's it's absurd. Yeah. But again, no one's there is no public outcry. And most of the public goes for it. But it's coding. When you see people go for that, it tells you a lot about them. Obviously, those that are also wondering whether they should go for that don't see what's going on. I'm talking about those that have risen above all that muck.

45
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:26,550
Yes. And I mean, above in a vertical sense, you were looking down at this stuff. Right. But anyway, besides the food part, I gave that as an analogy. There is no particular way, because I can imagine that if you're new to hearing this type of speak, maybe someone might say, well, I should ask the Greek about this type of diet or that or eating right. Right. So get that all out of your head.

46
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:32,550
It all has to do with what you are looking to do physically and setting yourself up.

47
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:26,430
Yeah. Well, the one size fits all, regardless, whatever it is, is it's purposeful and it's part of the coding. I think we might have discussed that in the past where if you see a certain amount of people repeat something and use it in a way that it's not supposed to be used, you immediately broadcast what level of, you know, let's say not just intelligence, but what level of knowledge they have based on the thing. Right. So and they're easy to control that way.

48
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:39,110
You know, using things improperly, believe it or not, is one of the main, especially language is one of the main ways that if you want to control a society used to observe them.

49
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:56,250
So that back to the the general health, I just want to jump into because one thing that we haven't talked about is physical exercise. Again, irrelevant, completely irrelevant. What are you physically trying to get your body in shape for?

50
00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:16,950
Right. You just well, you know, if you have a some kind of exercise regimen or you physically work in a UPS driver or you go to the gym, you do construction, whatever, whatever. Yes, you do feel better than when you're sedentary. Right. But again, it's irrelevant. What kind of fitness do you want to achieve and for what you see?

51
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:33,170
Like for when I see people in the gym on those life cycles or treadmills and all that, they should be hooking up generators to all that so they could put it back on the grid. I mean, that's a purpose. But OK, so the physical thing, I'll just put that aside for a moment.

52
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:46,150
What I want to just quickly jump into is one of the comments. I'm just I'm not going to read the comment I don't have in front of me, but from memory about a person had listened to Greek speak and cut out dairy from their diet.

53
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:57,610
OK, and eat seasonally. But they still have, quote unquote, allergies for grass and grass season. But it's it skips a month. It's like May and July, I believe.

54
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:13,510
And skip June or something. Right. So that's a summer grass. Right. And I did answer the comment, but I'm not even answering reading the answer. I'll just go over it again. Sure. One thing when you hear allergies, it's a sensitivity.

55
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:28,390
This is more of the allopathic, you know, the way they accept it. But unless it's extreme, like, for example, I'm allergic to bullets, you know. OK. OK. So it can go that far.

56
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:48,570
What I would suggest here is just like the one size fits all reversal. You everyone is sensitive, more sensitive to certain things, including tastes and others and smells. Right. Someone might smell something before someone else does in a room or in the environment.

57
00:18:49,230 --> 00:19:02,270
And that other person who didn't smell it first might smell something else first because they're more sensitive to that. So it's perception, you know, olfactory, let's say the aspect of being allergic, quote unquote, to a grass.

58
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:18,590
We have something called buffalo grass in Tucson that some people are very and desert broom. They're very sensitive to. And I've done this with several people and it's worked. What I suggest that is going to the energetic side and component of it, by the way.

59
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:35,210
Again, what kind of health do you want? The allopathic medicine, the pharmaceutical, the stuff that's made from petrochemicals that you get at the drugstore from companies that don't give a rat's you know what about you, if it works for you, use it.

60
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:45,450
OK, and I just want to give an example. I've worked with many people over. I've been doing this alternative, quote unquote, health stuff since the 1980s.

61
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:54,770
There are one case that jumps in mind. There was a woman. She was in her 30s and she had you ready for this. A double horseshoe fistula abscess.

62
00:19:55,070 --> 00:20:07,230
Say say that twice backwards. OK. And we did all kinds of remedies for about five years. And finally, I said, you know what, you're a Westerner, you live in a Western society, you're in the middle of the city.

63
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:19,610
Go Western. Go get it cut out. Go to a surgeon. Have the whole mess cut out. Right. And guess what happened. They did that. Took about a month to recover. Gone.

64
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:26,770
Five years of remedies, energetic, doing this, that and the other. Didn't do anything. You see where I'm at with this?

65
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:36,650
That's why I prefaced by what do they give for allergies, antihistamines, supposedly to suppress the body's reaction. OK, if that works, use it.

66
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:54,590
But what I found to be successful from an energetic perspective, and again, just to recap, if you have a malady and you find a plant that heals it, treats it, it's the energetics of the plant, how the plant looks, when it grows, where it grows, how you consumed it.

67
00:20:54,990 --> 00:21:04,050
That's the energetic. The chemical materialist wants to take it and assay it, means like crush it up, centrifuge it, burn it and find out what the active ingredient is.

68
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:15,530
OK, so that would be the over-the-counter medicine. The energetic would be, again, the color of the plant. How tall does it grow? When does it grow? What kind of soil does it grow in?

69
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:24,710
How did you consume it? Did you eat it raw? Did you boil it? Did you dry it? OK, all those things matter because each one of those things adds a component to the energetic component.

70
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:38,490
So again, going back to this comment, it was, I believe, May and July or so grass. OK, so I'm presuming this is North America because May and July in Australia is wintertime, right?

71
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:50,950
So I'm presuming it's summertime. The energies are rising. So from a Taoist perspective, when you're in alignment with the rising energies during that season, you should be fine.

72
00:21:52,230 --> 00:22:02,870
So if you're getting allergies or whatever, sensitivity to it is because your energy in your body is not used to that rising energy, that elevating energy, right?

73
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:15,970
In the summer, the energies go up. In the winters, they go down. So what you do is you start coaxing the body by intake of things, a light, leafy, what's a rising energy?

74
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:35,310
An extreme would be sugarcane or bamboo. More moderate would be plants that are not as tall. And so when you want to, let's see, before you even have to treat, you want to set your body up so you don't have to feel sensitive to this stuff.

75
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:55,530
You know May is coming. So before May, you start drinking green tea, which is a bush, could be about shoulder height, easy to get, very elevating. You can do parsley tea, you know, things that are moderately green and light that you can make a tea or eat.

76
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:11,830
So before that time comes around, and as you start to consume these things, your body is intaking more of these rising energies. So as the rising energies come around from these plants, you're not affected.

77
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:25,930
It's the same idea that if you're standing on a sidewalk and somebody drives by at 30 miles an hour, right? The concept here is what if you're in a car going 30 miles an hour next to another car going 30 miles an hour?

78
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:33,770
You both roll down the window. Even though you're both moving at 30 miles an hour in separate cars, it doesn't look like you're moving. You could shake hands, right?

79
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:34,250
Right.

80
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,790
That's the idea.

81
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:37,150
Okay.

82
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,110
The next idea is the remedy.

83
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:50,950
Well, the inverse, just really quickly, the inverse of that, if you wanted to promote a slowdown a bit, would you do something like consume potatoes, which don't necessarily reach up?

84
00:23:51,570 --> 00:24:01,350
They're characteristic as they grow. They're in the dirt. They stay down there. They're a root, right? Like a carrot, too. Same kind of thing. The energy is heavier, is it not?

85
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:07,910
Downward. It's more about direction. Everything is about direction.

86
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:08,370
Direction.

87
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,650
Which way is up, right?

88
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:14,330
Well, which way the plant grows tells you a lot about the direction of the energy, right?

89
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:28,050
Right. Usually when you harvest it to consume it, it's what's manifested. It's how it manifests. Because something can grow down and then kick up again like a sprout.

90
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:28,750
Okay.

91
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:35,370
They grow downward first and then they kick up. So that's why sprouts have a very balanced energy.

92
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:43,610
Okay. So from a Daoist perspective, again, the remedy, instead of trying to get yourself in line with the energy, is you hit it with the opposite.

93
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:44,490
Okay.

94
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:50,890
Like putting out a fire, right? You throw water on it, right? Or you take the air away. It needs air, so you take air.

95
00:24:50,890 --> 00:25:02,650
Okay. So the opposite would be, let's say you find yourself and it is those months that you're having a hard time and you wake up and you're like, oh, crap. I'm feeling it. It's getting me hard.

96
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:11,310
Then it is too late in actually getting the rising energies to align yourself. It is not going to treat that.

97
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:25,630
So you go with the opposite. You go with downward energy. You would take root vegetables and make a tea. Ginger tea. Burdock would be the strongest. Burdock is the most tenacious root vegetable.

98
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:33,830
Usually when you try to pull burdock out of the ground, you really can't. It just breaks off at the top and you got a foot still stuck in the ground, right? It's very tenacious.

99
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:50,430
So burdock tea, ginger tea. Potatoes are kind of difficult because they're considered a nightshade, right? They bloom at night. You know, the nightshade is aubergine, eggplant, tomato.

100
00:25:50,670 --> 00:26:00,890
Right. I didn't think of that. I was just simply thinking about the directionality. Not the direction, but the way it grows, the way it presents itself. I'm thinking that's got to be down.

101
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:12,030
We can get into nightshades someday, but they're antagonistic. At night, the energies are going down, and here you have these plants that are blooming up into it, right?

102
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:16,190
So what it just means is that they're very extreme. In other words, extreme.

103
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:31,070
When I studied nightshades, growing them and studying them, I was like, with the right amount of tweaking, this is just a side note here, you can turn any nightshade plant, which is tomato, pepper, eggplant, potato, into a hallucinogenic.

104
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:47,870
They're not hallucinogenic right now, but if you understand what I'm talking about from an alchemic perspective, you can take those plants and make derivatives with some form of transmutation and turn them into hallucinogens.

105
00:26:48,730 --> 00:27:02,810
Very powerful ones, actually. This is something I've discussed with some people. Years ago, when I was doing this with Dr. Joe Champion, we were making silver into gold and making gold out of copper and all this stuff.

106
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:10,530
But anyway, I just wanted to throw that out there because it's kind of trippy, and if you're really in line with what I'm talking about, you'll see it.

107
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:21,350
Again, when you know something is coming and you can discern the energy quality, get yourself set up for it.

108
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:30,850
It's kind of like, you know it's raining outside, grab an umbrella. If you run outside in the rain and then come back for an umbrella, you're already wet.

109
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:44,550
So in this case, if you know what's coming, set yourself up at least one month before with the lighter, greener teas and things to uplift and supplement that uplifting energy.

110
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:54,190
If you find yourself hit with it, then you go with the opposite, and that's the simplest way to explain the Taoist perspective.

111
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:59,990
It's just as simple as saying you put out fire with the opposite, you start a fire with the same.

112
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:15,190
This Taoist perspective, it was in the Western culture, but we have this group called the Church that made sure that all that stuff went away, because how the hell are you going to control people when they don't get sick and understand their environment?

113
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:28,290
In that way, I was wondering about the carrots too, because that was the other thing I brought up that had the downward or that direction, and that's different than a potato.

114
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:35,050
What about that as energetic, in this case?

115
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:41,350
You also look at what's in the ground and what's coming out of the ground.

116
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:50,750
What's interesting about the carrot is if you're prepping yourself before the event or before the time when you do feel sensitivity, just do the carrot tops.

117
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:57,750
If you look at carrot tops and parsley, they're very similar, almost undiscernible.

118
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,290
I grow both in the garden here.

119
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:06,490
What's good about the carrot, you can go down and just have the root as the remedy.

120
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:15,130
There's a difference between setting yourself up for the condition and a remedy, which is to actually put out the fire.

121
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:17,750
They're very different.

122
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:25,130
That's why very often you'll see something put out like ginger tea or this tea or this or whatever, good for this.

123
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:29,110
Well, good for this, usually it means it's too late.

124
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:31,210
Why?

125
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,150
It's just too rudimentary.

126
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:37,250
There has to be just a little bit more understanding.

127
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:44,690
Plus, you're telling me about the whole plant as opposed to the different components of the plant.

128
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,810
I'm not talking about the chemical elements.

129
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:54,290
I'm talking about the root of the thing and the bark of the thing and the flower of the thing.

130
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:57,130
These all have different characteristics.

131
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:00,830
Because of the manifestation, it's not the chemical.

132
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,950
It's the way that it manifests.

133
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,110
That's what I'm saying, not because of the chemical.

134
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:07,950
When I said component, I wanted to make sure we weren't talking chemicals.

135
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:09,810
There's different characteristics.

136
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:19,350
The thing is, just because they've done so many harmful things and misled society with chemicals doesn't mean that they're bad.

137
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:24,070
A baseball bat is not bad unless you get hit over the head with it consistently.

138
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,710
Once, you can forgive it.

139
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:36,810
But if you're always being beat up with a baseball bat that's made for playing baseball, you've got to say, grab a tree, grab a branch instead.

140
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:38,010
It's still the same thing.

141
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:42,030
But if you look at the intention, you're still getting hit over the head with it.

142
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:46,810
Because it is very possible, by the way, to get hit over the head with this natural, quote-unquote, stuff.

143
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:54,630
Also, if you've been around some of these naturopaths and airy-fairy, I call them the granola, earthy-crunchy people.

144
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:56,830
They're always putting down.

145
00:30:58,210 --> 00:30:58,610
Whatever.

146
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:01,990
You could see anything.

147
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,670
It's not that chemicals are bad.

148
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:06,790
They're just chemicals and when they're misused.

149
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:11,510
Everything that we see in the material world is a manifestation of an energetic.

150
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:20,690
An easy way to look at that is if you look at the baby being born, it's a manifestation of the mother and the father.

151
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:27,090
They were also born in a similar way.

152
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:32,390
But if you take a slice off, the mother and the father exist because they eat plants and animals.

153
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:40,130
And if you go back and if you see they eat the plants, that's the water, the soil, the air, the sunlight.

154
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:45,110
If they eat the animal, well, the animal relies on the plant, which is the water.

155
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:50,310
So that means that what feeds the plant, where does that come from?

156
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:51,530
Where does the water come from?

157
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:53,590
Where does the soil, where does the light come from?

158
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:55,910
Then it goes back to energy.

159
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:56,450
Right.

160
00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:05,370
Well, also the animal will feed the plant because the animal, when it dies, it ends up in the earth and those components get returned also.

161
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:08,430
So there's a relationship there, actually.

162
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:09,370
Yeah.

163
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:09,830
Yeah.

164
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:10,990
But there's a chain.

165
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:14,390
Imagine a chain of events that goes around in a circle.

166
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:14,790
Right.

167
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:15,710
Okay.

168
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:24,950
So this is basically what you want to tap into if you wanted to complete or be more overall in your understanding.

169
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:32,890
Now, in no way would I say omit standard medicine, you know, the allopathic, the mainstream stuff.

170
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:41,530
The problem that I see with most of the mainstream stuff is people are too trusting and they have too many other things they want to do in their lives.

171
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:42,550
You hear this all the time.

172
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:47,970
I do this for a living and I'm not interested in studying medicine or the human body.

173
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:50,290
I just need to find a doctor that I trust.

174
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:51,450
That's fine.

175
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:59,090
But I'm telling you that that doctor that you trust has been narrowly trained with the best education government has to offer.

176
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:01,390
Right.

177
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:07,050
And he can't do any more than what he knows is what the point is.

178
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:10,030
And it's getting worse and worse and worse as time goes on.

179
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:13,910
Now, when I say it's getting worse and worse and worse, I'm talking about from the 1800s on.

180
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:15,510
It's gotten worse.

181
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:22,250
So at this point, I think I addressed the chat and I address that point because it was a very good point.

182
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:27,550
Most people will tend to suffer, quote unquote, allergies and sensitivities more than anything else.

183
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:28,290
Right.

184
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:31,710
Because some people might get a fever, catch a cold once, not every year.

185
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:34,090
If you do, you have to address it the same way.

186
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:39,770
But, you know, every so often, every few years, people come down with a fever or whatever.

187
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:40,510
This is different.

188
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:43,850
This is if it's a recurring thing and it's on a schedule.

189
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:45,710
This is how I would address it.

190
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:52,130
But, again, just to recap, if you have to go get antihistamines or whatever, do it.

191
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:56,830
But I wouldn't go all the way as far as saying, oh, you have to come in and take a steroid shot.

192
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:57,970
Right.

193
00:33:58,090 --> 00:33:58,970
I wouldn't do that.

194
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:00,630
That's a little too extreme.

195
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:04,530
If you're at that point, it's more than just allergies, you see.

196
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:09,790
So that's what I'd say about the health aspect.

197
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:11,670
There is no general health.

198
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:14,830
I love the term general health practitioner.

199
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:16,550
Oh, my goodness.

200
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:18,330
How is that going to work out?

201
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:25,530
When I used to be involved in bicycle racing or people that I knew that were fit and they wanted to go see a medical doctor,

202
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:30,670
it's funny how I'd say I'm going to go see the doctor like there's the doctor, right, but a medical person.

203
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:34,050
I'd say whatever you do, don't go to a general practitioner.

204
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:37,510
You must go to a sports doctor.

205
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:38,150
You must.

206
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:39,449
You have no choice at this point.

207
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:47,070
The reason why I said why, Greek, because these regular general practitioners, they're used to seeing people that are out of shape,

208
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:51,590
people that are old and people that have been hooked on drugs and don't know how to take care of themselves.

209
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:58,110
You walk in, even if you're feeling like crap, you're like a very well-developed specimen of a human,

210
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:03,250
they're going to look at you and you're the best looking and the most fit person they've seen in like five years.

211
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,370
They're going to tell you there's nothing wrong with you.

212
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:06,690
You see what I mean?

213
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:12,650
Because they're just used to looking at really crappy specimens, let's say.

214
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:17,190
So if you're in good shape, you must go to a sports doctor,

215
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:22,410
someone who's used to seeing people that are already very fit so they can discern the fine point.

216
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:23,130
You see what I mean?

217
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:26,590
This analogy goes with pretty much everything.

218
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:33,090
Whether you have a car, you get an oil change at one of these quick stops

219
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:37,270
or you go to a place that's a performance, you get a completely different oil change, right?

220
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:41,250
So yeah, that's what I would say about the health.

221
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:46,370
It seems like I always end up in any health discussion, even one like this one,

222
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:51,110
where I just don't know what to say about health because I don't know.

223
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,610
You see, I don't know what your situation is.

224
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:57,150
And talk about the antithesis of a one-size-fits-all.

225
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:04,790
If what I'm saying holds true, I've pretty much destroyed about 100 million videos on YouTube about health.

226
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:06,910
Easily.

227
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:13,870
So I guess this would be for the listener to discern and apply.

228
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:18,090
What I'm saying also involves you in the process.

229
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,870
You can't be lazy about it.

230
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:25,830
You ever heard about these life coach, I don't know, self-help people?

231
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:28,150
Make a list of all the things you want to do.

232
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:30,190
Just don't leave it up to chance or whatever.

233
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:33,430
Just make a list of where you want to be and what you want to do.

234
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:37,130
Well, I'm sorry to say that's pretty good advice.

235
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:38,270
Yeah, yeah.

236
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:41,950
Make a list of what you think your health should be.

237
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:46,830
And by the way, when you plan, it's called planning, you will achieve it with minimum effort

238
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,930
because it only takes a small amount per day.

239
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:51,510
This is the same thing about studying.

240
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:54,330
I used to always tell people if you want to learn about a subject,

241
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:57,550
you don't try to eat it all in one bite.

242
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:01,250
You do five minutes, a half hour, 20 minutes, whatever per day.

243
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:03,030
Or three times a week.

244
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:07,730
And before you know it, you've gone through thousands of pages of whatever,

245
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:11,330
memorialized or videos or whatever, after a year.

246
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:12,310
You see?

247
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:15,030
It's the same thing with the health situation.

248
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:20,530
Unfortunately, with most cases, when a personal discussion arises,

249
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:23,650
something very specific, and it's usually too late.

250
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:29,750
So you have to usually submit the remedy, you know, the opposite energetic

251
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:33,710
to cancel out what they're experiencing in most cases.

252
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:35,050
Right.

253
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:39,650
Well, you know, I think this subject has been addressed quite well.

254
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:44,030
And again, you know, it's rather interesting to me

255
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:46,910
because immediately when you started talking about these, you know,

256
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:50,570
life coach type people, I thought of Tony Robbins, you know, as an example.

257
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:56,750
Where, you know, on one level, you know, he's a clown like most others.

258
00:37:57,050 --> 00:38:01,190
But on another level, some of it's rather practical, you know.

259
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,950
And what do I mean by this?

260
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:08,750
Well, a lot of times people talk about, you know, your level of confidence,

261
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:10,430
how you carry yourself, right?

262
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:13,430
Things like this, what you're transmitting.

263
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:16,630
And we touched upon that briefly in a previous Sonic,

264
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:22,810
regarding, you know, the gestures and things like this,

265
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,550
what it is you're communicating,

266
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:28,950
not necessarily always with your voice or your words particularly.

267
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:33,850
But what about the idea, though, of, you know, like, again,

268
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:36,150
thinking about these people who say, okay, draw up a plan,

269
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:38,190
draw up a dream board, so to speak, whatever.

270
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:44,150
You know, a lot of that is based on confidence and what you project.

271
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:49,110
That's not invalid, although I got to say it's very childish

272
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,590
the way it's presented a lot of times.

273
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:54,290
And yeah, you're making useless a whole bunch of YouTube videos

274
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,590
and sets of videos and probably people's channels

275
00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:01,370
that they're making a living on with the health thing.

276
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:05,190
But when it comes to this, what about the idea of confidence

277
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:10,050
and, you know, how it is projected, I guess, and attitude?

278
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:11,950
I mean, what about that?

279
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:13,870
Because that's a big part of this as well, isn't it?

280
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:17,310
Perception versus confidence, I guess, would be the way to think about it,

281
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:19,710
or confidence of your perception.

282
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:22,710
Or by addition, confidence and perception, right?

283
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:23,430
Sure.

284
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:26,310
Okay, let's talk about that a little bit.

285
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:28,670
Well, you know, think about it.

286
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:32,670
We perceive however we perceive, usually with our eyes and ears,

287
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:36,790
and we think about things, and we take the menace to be true

288
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:40,090
or as a basis of knowledge, or whether it's cultural

289
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:42,050
or we like the way it is very often.

290
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:45,230
You hear people in a discussion, someone will say,

291
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,330
well, I don't agree with that.

292
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:48,630
So what they're telling you is it can't be true

293
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:50,690
because I don't like what you're saying, right?

294
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:54,410
So this is the confidence and the perception mixed.

295
00:39:54,630 --> 00:40:00,230
So when you perceive something to be true, you hold it in confidence as such.

296
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:05,670
What if you find out that what you perceive to be true is not true?

297
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,990
Well, in certain cases, you might still want to hold it out

298
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:12,010
because it's a form of control and acceptance.

299
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:15,790
But let's say you perceive something now very differently

300
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:17,970
as it was before perceived.

301
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:20,590
Should you still remain confident in it?

302
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:22,550
And the answer to that in most cases is no.

303
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:23,890
You lose confidence, right?

304
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:26,390
Now what about the other way?

305
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:30,510
What if you have perceived something and are confident in it,

306
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:34,570
but it is contrary to what other people perceive and are confident in?

307
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:41,810
A quick analogy would be people perceive CNN or Fox News or MSNBC

308
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:45,210
and they're confident in the information they're getting, right?

309
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:48,990
So then you approach that individual or person or group

310
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:51,730
and you're pretty confident that it's all BS

311
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:56,630
or 90% of it is 100% BS, okay?

312
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,570
Well, what happens there?

313
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:03,470
They're going to perceive you as a nutcase or contrary, right?

314
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:06,750
And here's an interesting thing, which you went over really quickly,

315
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:08,370
but I want to just hit it again.

316
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:11,650
This idea of agreement, it's a misnomer

317
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:15,330
because when somebody says, I agree or I disagree,

318
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:17,350
that's a loaded statement.

319
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:20,470
They're not just talking about their agreement or their alignment.

320
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:25,450
It's a bit more of a loaded statement, like you were saying,

321
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:30,090
which is interesting to me in that some people have different motivations

322
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:33,810
for their alleged agreement or alleged disagreement,

323
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:37,790
which again goes far beyond what they are saying,

324
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:41,810
because it's not just, okay, I agree with you, Greek.

325
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:45,510
It's I'm saying that not only do I agree with you,

326
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:47,950
but I perceive what you're saying as true.

327
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:50,570
It's not just that I align with you.

328
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:54,410
I'm not qualifying it by saying I have the same experience

329
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:58,250
or I have the same understanding or education,

330
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,770
and I don't mean education from a standard point.

331
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:02,890
I mean literal, true education.

332
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:06,430
You've actually learned something where you might recognize,

333
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:10,190
oh, I have learned a similar thing or the same thing.

334
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:15,130
There's a difference there, but people in shorthand kind of go,

335
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:16,410
I agree, I disagree.

336
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:19,350
Well, yeah, I'm just translating the gesture.

337
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:21,530
You ever listen to a host?

338
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:26,650
He's interviewing someone and they basically, oh, yeah, absolutely.

339
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:28,550
The host says, well, absolutely, absolutely,

340
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:29,590
and then they change the subject?

341
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:30,490
Yes.

342
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:37,850
That word absolute is a very, very heavy term to use it loosely like that.

343
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,170
But if you translate that, when you hear that,

344
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:43,570
the host placating the guest, yeah, absolutely, absolutely,

345
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:45,050
and they change the subject, it's basically saying,

346
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:48,850
yeah, I want to make this an interesting quote-unquote show,

347
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:51,270
so let's keep moving on to other topics,

348
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:54,230
and I want to sound like I still have, you know,

349
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:56,670
there's many ways to translate that, but they're not listening.

350
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:57,990
They're not listening.

351
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:01,170
So, in other words, being able to translate words as gestures,

352
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:05,590
gestures of dismissal, gestures of cognitive dissonance,

353
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:08,610
these are all gestures, and they're cloaked in these words,

354
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:10,010
which are heavily coded.

355
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:15,170
But the thing is, going back to the perception, we're perceiving,

356
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:17,650
in other words, you could be in a, let's say,

357
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:20,050
the greatest, most secret library in the universe,

358
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:21,870
and it's pitch black,

359
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:24,550
and you rely on eyes to read what's there.

360
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:26,910
It's a reading material, and it's always dark.

361
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:29,330
You're not going to be able to perceive anything.

362
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:29,970
You're not going to be able to,

363
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:34,850
and nothing will be imparted to you because your perception is off, right?

364
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:38,130
So there are many ways to block that,

365
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:39,890
also having a language you don't comprehend.

366
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:43,990
But we take in through perception, and then we, whether judge it,

367
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:46,270
in other words, ruminate, meditate on it,

368
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:49,850
you know, is this something I should be confident in, right?

369
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:51,470
And then you build up this confidence,

370
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:53,910
which is your measuring stick on that subject,

371
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:56,730
and there's conflict based on that.

372
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:59,950
Because if other people, let's say someone has perceived

373
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:03,410
that the opposite of what you are confident in is the truth,

374
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:06,590
and you believe that this is the truth, which is antagonistic,

375
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:09,950
you both come together, your perceptions clash,

376
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:12,910
and what your, the thickness of your armor,

377
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:17,110
and how you defend it is based on how much confidence you have in the subject.

378
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:22,630
So the ultimate point here is, just to fast forward,

379
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:26,550
we live in a reality, let's say we, the collective we,

380
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:29,910
that responds to your input into that reality.

381
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:32,550
And it's, you know, everyone's saying,

382
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:33,590
what can I get out of it?

383
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:35,090
It's actually what you put into it.

384
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:38,070
You know, your desires, your wants,

385
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:41,270
what you want to manifest is put out.

386
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:43,770
You say, you know, what is it?

387
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:46,870
You harvest what you, you reap what you sow.

388
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:48,150
And all that, right?

389
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:51,650
So you're sowing as we put in to the ground, and then it comes out.

390
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:54,250
So you're, we live in a reality where,

391
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:57,570
whether you want to attribute it to the gods, to the ether,

392
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:02,810
to a simulation, to a construct, to the matrix, whatever.

393
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:06,730
It is very, very receptive to what we put out into it,

394
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:10,270
and what we get back is what we've put out in most cases.

395
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:12,290
It depends if you join a group.

396
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:15,590
If you join a group, and you're one of those in a group,

397
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:18,210
the leader of that group puts something out that affects you.

398
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:21,630
So that's another concept of the follower and being individual.

399
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:27,950
But I would say the idea that you perceive something

400
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:30,330
and now have made it confident,

401
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:33,550
you're confident in that, and you hold that around,

402
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:36,850
will benefit you, right?

403
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:40,990
How many times have you heard, I'm meeting people of like mind?

404
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:43,730
When you hear that, that means that they are also confident,

405
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:46,750
similarly, in things that you are confident with.

406
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:48,030
Let's say knowledge base, right?

407
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:49,070
Okay?

408
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:52,490
The quote-unquote conspiracy researchers and all that,

409
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:54,590
they'll have a convention, and they all,

410
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:57,390
they might still be a little antagonistic,

411
00:45:57,530 --> 00:45:59,550
but generally they're all there because they're confident

412
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:02,850
in this particular subject as being true,

413
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:05,630
where everyone else would say these are where the nutcases go.

414
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:06,770
Well, an easy example.

415
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,110
I go to the JFK conferences on occasion.

416
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:10,930
I'm planning on going this year.

417
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:14,070
And the reason why I'm there is because we all,

418
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:15,770
at the very least, have an agreement

419
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:20,750
that it is valid to question the official conclusion

420
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:21,930
regarding that assassination.

421
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:28,090
And we believe that we have an idea that there is a difference.

422
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:30,610
I'm going as open as possible on this

423
00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:33,510
to make it as common as possible among us

424
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:36,310
that we all believe that, at the very least,

425
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:37,970
the official explanation is incorrect.

426
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:46,210
And we wish to present the real or the truth or et cetera, right?

427
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:48,370
So everybody there can agree on that.

428
00:46:48,490 --> 00:46:51,150
Now, they may have disagreements about how to get there,

429
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:55,270
what the methodology is, what the most important aspect is,

430
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:57,710
but we are of a like mind in that way,

431
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:00,470
so therefore we convene, right?

432
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:02,150
Sure.

433
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:05,190
Or you're looking for a more plausible experience

434
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:07,530
because you might think it's this shooter

435
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:09,570
or the other guy might think it's another shooter,

436
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:11,610
and you might argue about it,

437
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:14,350
but at the end of the conference you both know

438
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:17,110
that your shooter or the other guy's shooter

439
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:19,510
is not part of the main narrative anyway, you see.

440
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:23,390
Well, that's the development of it in the purpose for the gathering,

441
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:26,790
but that's what happens in many cases,

442
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:29,890
whether it's a lunch meeting or a convention or a conference.

443
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:32,490
You know, you confer, right?

444
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:32,970
Yeah.

445
00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:34,810
Well, you and I have gone through that.

446
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:38,630
I have a strong feeling intuitively that James Files

447
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:40,330
is one of the guys that pulled the trigger.

448
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:41,830
He'll even say there were two others,

449
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:47,730
where you don't think the guy has got any, what would you say,

450
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:49,770
when you validate or verify.

451
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:53,930
He's not verifiable or validatable or he's not genuine enough, right?

452
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:55,630
You and I can go through whatever.

453
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:58,930
You just give so many details that he seems to feel, right?

454
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:03,070
But neither one of us will ever say Oswald had anything to do with it

455
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:05,370
when he was most likely at the Coke machine, right?

456
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:06,590
There you go.

457
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:07,350
Fair example.

458
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:11,890
So the perception and the confidence here is this.

459
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:14,050
There is going to be a clash.

460
00:48:14,610 --> 00:48:17,250
The different perceptions will give the variety,

461
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:21,430
but the arguing, how much energy someone puts into

462
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:24,350
either offending or fighting someone

463
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:27,450
or defending their own belief is how confident they are in it, right?

464
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:33,370
So at the same time, when you consider that this reality that we live on

465
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:36,450
rewards those that are confident, right?

466
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:39,790
So then you have always a two-fold decision.

467
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:44,330
Like, okay, so I'm into this quote-unquote alternative stuff, one might say,

468
00:48:44,370 --> 00:48:47,990
but if my family finds out, they think I'm a wacko, okay?

469
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:51,970
But you still have to maintain the confidence in that

470
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:53,850
because if it is true,

471
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:59,390
because that confidence that you maintain in it will reward you.

472
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:04,370
In other words, the construct will reward you.

473
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:08,570
The universe supports those that are confident, not those that are not.

474
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:13,970
But at the same time, you have to realize that if there is a possibility of antagonism,

475
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:17,350
it's not going to be with what the other people are confident in.

476
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:18,610
It's just their perception.

477
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:23,810
So there's a fine balance between exuding your confidence in what you know

478
00:49:23,810 --> 00:49:27,670
and also offending and others perceiving it,

479
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:31,170
that they might be antagonistic to it.

480
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:35,390
But you want the simulacrum or the construct or the matrix,

481
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:40,790
whatever you call it in your mind, to receive that confidence.

482
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:45,910
You must broadcast that confidence in what you quote-unquote believe in and know

483
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:48,090
in order to reap the benefits of it.

484
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:52,410
But at the same time, tiptoe around everyone else's perceptions of you.

485
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:53,290
Right.

486
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:58,190
But you will run into the criticism, though.

487
00:49:58,770 --> 00:50:03,710
The main thing is when someone is set off when you say something, right?

488
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:06,490
Or they call it triggering, right?

489
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:09,450
People around you, it could be critical sometimes.

490
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:11,050
You might lose a job, right?

491
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:12,470
That's the latest common term.

492
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:18,610
You trigger somebody because you've offended some preconceived notion

493
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:21,030
of one type or another.

494
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:24,510
I'm trying to do this as objectively as possible, right?

495
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,450
Well, it's perception.

496
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:31,030
And their ability to fight you on it is how confident they are on their position.

497
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:35,430
Well, not necessarily their ability, but their enthusiasm,

498
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:38,410
their level of effort that they're willing to exert.

499
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:42,210
It may not necessarily be their ability

500
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:48,970
because they could be a very poor debater or defender of said belief, let's say,

501
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:52,310
or said thing that they are confident in,

502
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:55,430
but they have no adequate way to defend it.

503
00:50:55,810 --> 00:50:57,290
That's a possibility as well.

504
00:50:58,130 --> 00:50:59,430
They could just have the confidence,

505
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:05,030
and the confidence is unfounded by anything that's useful.

506
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:07,550
Well, how could they be confident in it?

507
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:10,150
Well, I observe this happens.

508
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:11,470
I'm not saying it's logical.

509
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:12,970
I'm just saying I observe it happens.

510
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:16,990
It's an observation as opposed to something that makes sense,

511
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:19,710
as many things are on the planet.

512
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:23,790
Well, you see, it's a difficult thing to explain,

513
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:26,450
but what I'm trying to convey here, especially after the help,

514
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:30,050
that this is part of your situation here in this reality,

515
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:33,430
your meaning the general you, the corporate you,

516
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:36,550
however you want to perceive you,

517
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:42,110
the way we interact with our environment,

518
00:51:42,270 --> 00:51:44,530
meaning not just people but just our thoughts.

519
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:46,470
If you're alone and you're planning your day,

520
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:52,130
you're putting out a field and energy, literally, that will come back to you.

521
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:56,250
Let's say, for example, listen to a bunch of Greeks speak.

522
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:57,930
A lot of the comments that I've gotten is,

523
00:51:58,150 --> 00:51:59,630
no one around me believes what I'm saying.

524
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:01,810
They think I'm crazy, but I know what you're saying is true.

525
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:04,990
I've looked it up and validated it, right, for example.

526
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:06,370
So then what do you do?

527
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:11,350
Well, what's happening is you're trying to blend your confidence with their perception.

528
00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:17,690
In other words, somehow it doesn't mean throttle back how confident you are.

529
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:19,910
It's just don't affect their perception.

530
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:24,770
You have to sort of tiptoe around more on the overt

531
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:28,830
because most of the people, for example, that believe in the BS that's out there,

532
00:52:28,830 --> 00:52:32,030
and let's say for a moment all the BS that's out there is fine.

533
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:36,770
The reality that we live in, quote, unquote, the mainstream, let's say,

534
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:39,610
which has been mainstream since ancient times,

535
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:44,290
is fine and is hunky-dory and it's just the way things should be.

536
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:49,670
Let's just say that, and you don't need to hear another side.

537
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:53,630
Actually, you never need to really look up what things are supposed to be based on.

538
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:56,690
Just go along with what everyone thinks they are.

539
00:52:57,150 --> 00:52:58,350
Will you be okay?

540
00:52:59,610 --> 00:52:59,930
Yeah.

541
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:02,950
So, for example, if you're in the mainstream

542
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:08,430
and you believe that it's okay to get sick for a week with a fever or the common cold or whatever

543
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:13,490
and be sick as a dog, as they say, that's totally normal.

544
00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:17,090
You will never know that there is a, quote, unquote, better way

545
00:53:17,090 --> 00:53:23,710
or a way you can, how would you say, take control of that so it doesn't happen.

546
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:26,730
In most cases, it may not work,

547
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:30,770
but at least you have more of the possibility in your mind that you can take control over it.
