1
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:14,960
Sonic Event 30, Ocelli in the Greek, rated Y, here we are, 30 episodes, Greek, what do

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,600
you think about that?

3
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,620
I don't know, what should I think about it?

4
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,320
I thought we would have maybe covered more up until now, but we didn't.

5
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:28,580
Speaking of 30, we finally got together with some of your car stuff and you're waiting

6
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:29,120
on a part.

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,720
We'll see how it works out for you.

8
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,700
I figured we might as well get back into what we were talking about a minute ago.

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,700
Yeah, a little update on that.

10
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:44,540
I mean, after all, you gave some driving instruction in the last one, I think it was, and boy,

11
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,360
that was interesting.

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:52,420
But no, I'm learning the hard way that car parts are up in price for sure no matter where

13
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:52,820
you go.

14
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,460
But yeah, so that's happening.

15
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:02,640
So if anyone, get in touch with Chuck if anyone has used or new car parts, he just needs a

16
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,920
starter for a 23-year-old Saturn, right, I could say that.

17
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:13,360
But you have one on the way, and you notice, let's just say the Greek encourages people

18
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,260
to work when it comes to turning nuts and bolts and things, because ultimately it's

19
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:22,500
just like if you know how to change a light bulb, it's not very different, it's just that

20
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,520
you need a tool.

21
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:24,720
Right, right.

22
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,460
And demystify it using YouTube.

23
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:33,580
Right, well, actually I demystified it by talking to you a little bit, and you saw me

24
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:37,960
struggle a touch with a few things, but look, I'm just not used to doing it, and I'm working

25
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,540
on it.

26
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,640
Yeah, but you see, I have a very different perspective.

27
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,280
I also made you run through some protocols that most mechanics don't even do.

28
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,600
So we'll see, you'll get it going.

29
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,840
Very useful, solid information, and hopefully I can just take care of this myself instead

30
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,880
of calling the...

31
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,560
Yeah, right, oh my gosh, it's a screwed up culture, like attorneys and doctors, their

32
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:07,440
culture, the people that are in those things, most of prefabricated, professional, whatever,

33
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:15,180
what's been done is the culture has been downturned, so in order to operate as one of those people

34
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,620
working in that field, you're going to have to operate in a downturned culture, you know?

35
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:26,200
Right, so I'm not calling the mechanic, okay, I'm actually going to tackle this thing myself

36
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,280
as best I can, and I'm working with the missus on it, you know, because she's got better

37
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,080
eyesight and we can team up, right?

38
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,000
Yeah, so basically it's just an elaborate, greasy light bulb, anything you approach,

39
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,500
there are things that you require special tools for, and there's especially diagnostics,

40
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:47,600
and especially when you get into transaxles and things like that, but otherwise the rest

41
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,380
of it is pretty, it's already, it's just R&R, remove and replace.

42
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:56,740
Yeah, I mean, again, outside of the computers and, well, transmissions are a little bit

43
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,420
more complicated.

44
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:05,380
That's what I mean, transaxles are generally tough to deal with, I wouldn't, because the

45
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:12,520
amount of tools, even something like dropping a gas tank to change a pump in a larger car,

46
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:17,400
I would take to someone who has a stand, even though a lot of the cars, you just take out

47
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,100
the back seat and they actually encourage you, you know, again, remove the gas, the secondary

48
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,800
gas cap for the pump, it's like changing a light bulb again, but.

49
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,040
So anyway, what else, what else have we got?

50
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:33,300
Well, we've got a couple other things, you're still working with magnets, and I brought

51
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,060
up something before we started recording.

52
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:35,900
Odd numbers.

53
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:41,340
Yeah, well, because you showed me a picture of something, and very, very cool, look, no,

54
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:46,220
I'm not going to learn that much from it, but it is interesting, because I looked at

55
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:51,620
the array there, and you had talked about using odd numbers of magnets in the past,

56
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,560
and I know some people in the chat are working on that a little bit.

57
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,340
By the way, for those of you that are subscribed, just a little warning, there might be a price

58
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:06,640
change soon, but if you're signed up and you're a current, you know, subscriber, your price

59
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,440
isn't going to change.

60
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,320
Oh yeah, because you said that current price is for up to a hundred, we might have gone

61
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,220
past that now.

62
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:13,600
Right.

63
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,680
Not that there's a hundred current, but a hundred people passed through.

64
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,180
Right.

65
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:22,600
So it could be that new signups after this, so this is to kind of encourage you to stick

66
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,940
around with us, because your price is going to stay where it is, and others might pay more,

67
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,580
just saying.

68
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:30,860
So magnets.

69
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:31,760
Anyway, magnets.

70
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,540
Magnetism in nature.

71
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,940
So I was noticing, though, and you brought it up, you said, look, you ever notice that

72
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:41,080
flower petals are always in odd numbers, and I said, well, logically, to me, there's always

73
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:46,040
magnetic elements in nature that are often ignored by those, you know, those people,

74
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,520
I forget how you describe them, but the people that just want to break things down to the

75
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,160
chemical and that's it, they don't consider the rest of all of what's happening.

76
00:04:54,380 --> 00:05:00,780
And there is a magnetic element to, well, everything that's alive, seems like to me.

77
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:05,960
So of course, the presentation of flower petals, which have a practical, you know, outside

78
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,260
of their aesthetic value, they have practical use and practical function.

79
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,860
They would present themselves in odd numbers as well, because that's just the way these

80
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:16,600
things work.

81
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,640
What do you think of that?

82
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,360
Pushing daisies, right?

83
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,000
There's a little cute little song online about that.

84
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,700
Pushing up little daisies, have you heard it?

85
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,700
It's kind of bizarre.

86
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,180
It's a Weezer song, I think.

87
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:28,980
Yeah, maybe.

88
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:29,580
Yeah.

89
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,420
Anyway, yeah, go ahead.

90
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:35,640
Magnetism, when you have an overabundance of it, like light or heat or whatever, you

91
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,720
get an adverse effect.

92
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:42,820
And the adverse effect of magnetism is a noticeable pushing away, repulsive force.

93
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:47,320
Everything in nature pulls, by the way, even when you're, pushes, I'm sorry.

94
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:52,300
Even when you perceive a pulling force, it's actually a pushing force going from a high

95
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,680
pressure to a low pressure, let's say, less resistance.

96
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:01,220
But the bottom line with what's discussed about magnetism is very simple.

97
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,740
A magnet is to electricity, or the dielectric, as photographic paper is to light.

98
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,940
So if you have anything that you discern as being, quote unquote, a ferromagnet, that

99
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:17,920
is just no different than holding a photograph that has been exposed by a certain event of

100
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,200
light.

101
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:26,500
So a certain electric event, dielectric really, event, is memorialized in iron, what we call

102
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:26,900
a magnet.

103
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,180
Now, you mentioned those other people that talk about this.

104
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,260
I got a joke, by the way, this ties into what I'm saying.

105
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,120
It's real simple.

106
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,240
It's called peer review.

107
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,640
That's the joke, and that's the punchline also.

108
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,540
So don't fall for that, right?

109
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,800
That's the joke and the punchline.

110
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,220
That's the whole thing in a nutshell.

111
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:47,800
So anyway.

112
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:52,520
It's so funny because you don't know this at all because we didn't discuss it, but believe

113
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:58,640
it or not, the phrase peer review came up with me a couple of days ago, and I did start

114
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:03,400
laughing at it and didn't explain myself, and then others started laughing at it that

115
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,620
were involved in the discussion.

116
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,800
It was pretty funny because it was like peer review, sure.

117
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,380
Well, they trust the science.

118
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:13,700
All scientific evidence shows that there is no more science, right?

119
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,480
Anyway.

120
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,160
And who the hell are your actual peers, okay, really?

121
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:19,900
Well, yeah.

122
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,740
If you're peerless, you're in trouble.

123
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,060
The other thing, it's kind of like with the psychologists, you know, anyone who wants

124
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,960
to see a psychiatrist should have their head examined, right?

125
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:28,680
Definitely.

126
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,600
It's all along the same thing.

127
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,040
So what's going on in nature, as you see the budding action, let's say, of a flower, you

128
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:43,580
notice the repulsion of the membrane of the blossom turning into a flower growing, right?

129
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,920
That is just the right amount of magnetism, and also there are other factors.

130
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:54,860
But essentially, because we see things mostly in balance, if a flower is out of balance,

131
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:59,820
it won't grow, it'll fall apart, it'll die, whatever, it won't go into its cycle.

132
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:04,980
So we see the magnetism in balance, but we don't see it as magnetism until we start,

133
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,420
let's say, putting power lines together and they're pushing each other apart.

134
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,460
That's overabundance of magnetism, right?

135
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:17,300
So the electrostatic, the dielectric, pulls together and the magnetic pushes apart.

136
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,120
That's when you overdo it to display that feature of nature.

137
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,380
So in essence, you need both.

138
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:32,280
If you see things growing outward, it's magnetic, and if you see things pulling together, it's

139
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:32,620
electric.

140
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:38,820
So when you have a break in the skin, a cut, and it's healing, right, it's electrostatic.

141
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,360
When you see a break in the cut in the skin and it's not healing and it's swelling up,

142
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:44,600
magnetic.

143
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:45,740
Get it?

144
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:53,480
So speaking of which, we got into the last time we finished off was about signing void.

145
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,300
I don't know if I should bring it up again, and I said, holy shit, once they find out.

146
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:02,800
I just wanted to tie that in because there's a lot of people that have a lot of hang-ups

147
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,520
about how things should be done by following others.

148
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,900
Take a pause there for a second.

149
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:14,780
A lot of people have hang-ups about following what others do, and what happens usually

150
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,600
doesn't end up well.

151
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,580
And if you know that's a trait, a social trait that people have, all you have to do is, let's

152
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,800
say you have an alternative group, whether it's legal, medical, political, whatever.

153
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,300
Let them do what they're doing.

154
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,500
All you got to do is steer them out a little bit, steer them in a certain direction, right?

155
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,900
Imagine you're on a ship and you turn the wheel like a quarter of a radian, right?

156
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,960
And a hundred miles, you'll be 50 miles off where you want it to be.

157
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,320
You won't find you lost, right?

158
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,800
So all they do with these groups, all you have to do is steer them in a certain direction

159
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,400
and get them off the target.

160
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:51,720
And then you'll have people, again, use the nautical analogy, they'll jump ship.

161
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:52,840
Some will drown.

162
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,500
Some will stay on the boat and be lost, right?

163
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,020
Some will get hijacked and pirated, right?

164
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,700
So this is what's going on.

165
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:08,900
And the reason I say this is because the signature in the, quote unquote, the legal study people,

166
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,640
patriot, whatever, they base everything on it and they fight with it and they don't understand

167
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:18,980
what happens when you approach any situation with finesse, regardless if it's legal or

168
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:19,280
whatever.

169
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:25,200
And the finesse, by the way, has even been lost by the professionals that practice it.

170
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:32,220
So attorneys, by the way, if you look at how their organizations are set up, they very rarely

171
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,360
even tell you they do anything legal.

172
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,200
They're known as a professional office.

173
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,400
That's what the category is, right?

174
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,940
And by the way, the Congressional Record has the attorney bar association listed as a communist

175
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,680
organization.

176
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,800
You could look it up.

177
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:52,540
Put in Congressional Record, Bar Association, Communist Organization.

178
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,780
It's been well established.

179
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,200
Not that it's political or whatever, but basically you're saying about how all the prices went

180
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,380
up.

181
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,700
This is just bouncing around here.

182
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,500
That's attached to the woke stuff, all the clothing stores and all the ads, Victoria's

183
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:11,620
Secret having fat guys in bras kind of thing, not that I'm saying anything bad about fat

184
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,200
guys in bras.

185
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:12,500
I'm just saying.

186
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,540
Whatever, do what you want.

187
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,260
But why the hell is a starter motor, a starter?

188
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,300
It's all attached.

189
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:22,500
Yeah.

190
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,320
There's a lot of controversy about their woke agenda.

191
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,440
Their ventures are controlled by BlackRock, right?

192
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,640
Or the other one.

193
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,720
What's the other one?

194
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,060
BlackRock and the other one, right?

195
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:33,720
There's another one.

196
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:39,080
Even when they were giving out the stimulus checks, I told people, you're going to destroy

197
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:39,740
the economy.

198
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:43,920
For every dollar you get on a stimulus check, you're going to pay for it a hundred times

199
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,760
over the next decade, but that's okay.

200
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,880
Their Vanguard is the other one, yeah.

201
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,420
Vanguard.

202
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,540
They have a very strict agenda.

203
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,160
They said either you're going to fold, you're going to go with this, or you're going to

204
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,160
fold or you're going to suffer.

205
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:03,400
But anyway, they control all of that now on the back end, or on the front end, sorry.

206
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,860
Just like if you have one of those WIC cards, what is it, Eat Better, EBT, Eat Better Tonight

207
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,420
card or food stamps.

208
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,420
That is full.

209
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,400
That's not government at all.

210
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,160
That's fully controlled by JP Morgan.

211
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,060
It's on the card itself.

212
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,820
Well, it was the last time I saw it a little while back.

213
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,380
What I'm saying is the private interests are coming to the forefront.

214
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:32,300
They're trying to tell you in a hundred different ways what you consider government is a non,

215
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,160
how would you say, something that just doesn't exist.

216
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,120
It's basically all under private control, kind of like what the Dutch East India Company,

217
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:44,440
the VSO back 200 years ago.

218
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:49,720
If anyone looks up the Dutch East India Company in terms of adjusted for today's currency,

219
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:53,880
it's bigger than Apple, IBM, McDonald's and all those companies put together still.

220
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:59,880
It was the largest model of corporate, let's say, new world order under corporate control

221
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,120
ever.

222
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,340
That was 200 years ago.

223
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,340
There's nothing new.

224
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,860
There's nothing new that's coming in respect of that.

225
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:09,800
It's just more and more is being told while the older stuff is being pushed to the side,

226
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,820
but no one cares.

227
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,660
That's why business goes on the way it does.

228
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:20,680
Again, just to go back to the signature thing, you just be upfront and be honest about what

229
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:25,600
you're doing and what you see and you'll pretty much have more of the universal forces on

230
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,140
your side.

231
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,500
Instead of saying, I'm not going to sign that no matter what and you're thrown in jail for

232
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:37,860
that or you're listed as or charged with moral turpitude, that's my favorite.

233
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:44,480
If you're dealing with a cop, they'll write obstructing justice or interfering arrest,

234
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:48,680
but if you go up higher agencies, they use more elaborate terms.

235
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:55,720
If you get in trouble with DHS or FBI, they don't say resisting arrest or obstructing

236
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:55,900
justice.

237
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,380
They'll say moral turpitude.

238
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:03,640
They'll start using the thicker version of the dictionary or the thesaurus.

239
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,100
The whole thing is the same.

240
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,140
It's all just commercial.

241
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:13,180
In commerce, you have free will and you have free – in other words, one of the biggest

242
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:18,300
sins in commerce is to obstruct someone else's ability to do commerce, by the way.

243
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,560
Think about that.

244
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,920
That's for another discussion.

245
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:29,080
I could show you many places how that – what I just said, the biggest sin in commerce is

246
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,540
to obstruct another person's ability in so many ways.

247
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,500
It's written in many other ways where you're given rights and privileges also.

248
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:42,400
That's why it's called – when you do this, you waive your right or you waive this,

249
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,120
you waive that.

250
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,260
That has nothing to do with – it has to do with free will.

251
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,560
Obstructing someone's ability to do commerce is the same as obstructing their free will,

252
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,100
isn't it, until you get to waive it.

253
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,980
All these things are very interesting in how they interplay, but it is satanic, adversarial,

254
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,000
because it relies on your ignorance.

255
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:08,280
When you – let's say these law enforcement or whatever or legal groups, professional

256
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:14,140
groups or authorities interact with people, they don't interact with people based on

257
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:19,980
what is supposedly in the law or code, legal code or statute or whatever.

258
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,540
They act on the individual based on their level of ignorance.

259
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,860
You see, it's kind of backwards.

260
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:32,920
It's quite interesting, but ultimately, remember, you're dealing with a group of

261
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,320
people that have no problem sending 200 million people to their death.

262
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,320
Who sent 200 million people?

263
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,940
World War I and World War II.

264
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,820
You could study World War I and World War II, not in the bullshit textbooks that have

265
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,860
been peer-reviewed.

266
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,020
Remember the joke?

267
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,320
But study – you'll see no sound reason for any of those world wars, but yet you're

268
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,660
talking about throwing millions of people into meat grinders, right?

269
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,300
Same people behind that.

270
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,480
That's what occurs over and over again, though.

271
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,580
The next one is going to be actually pretty bad, but it's going to be over different

272
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:09,960
reasons.

273
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:10,820
It's going to be religious.

274
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:16,680
When I say religious, it'll be when they're in the middle of it, you tell them this is

275
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,240
a religious war.

276
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,220
They'll say, no, it's not.

277
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,380
You see?

278
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,700
So it's never noticed for what it is.

279
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:27,840
Kind of like when you deal – by the way, I've been out around the past few days and

280
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,500
mainstream interacting with people in various shops and locations.

281
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:32,600
They're screwed.

282
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,760
They have no concept at all about where they've been, where they are, and I don't have to

283
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:41,800
say this, but it's interesting when you – I'd say this to this audience, but they have no

284
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,120
clue.

285
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:46,400
In other words, the steering analogy I just gave, when people steer a certain way, there's

286
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,680
no way you could correct them.

287
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:56,780
It's really sad to see a waste of resources and human bodies that are so out of, let's

288
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,340
say, sync.

289
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:02,580
But they're in sync with something, and that's something I've talked about, known as the

290
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:06,319
end of the societies, what they're in sync with.

291
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:11,020
Kind of like – I used to give the analogy, you know that look, the look that you see

292
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:16,220
on the normie's face is the same look you see on a baby seal's face right before it

293
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,319
gets clubbed.

294
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:21,700
Now, most people listening are probably not old enough to remember, but Save the Seals

295
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,060
back in the 70s, remember that?

296
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:23,859
Oh, I do, yeah.

297
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,380
The fur movement, yeah, the fake fur, you know.

298
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,760
So anyway, they would show pictures of a little baby seal, you know.

299
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,100
For a little while, they would spit on people that wore fur, and then they'd fake spit

300
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,560
on you if you wore fake fur, yeah.

301
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,120
Or they'd dump red paint on a fox, on a $50,000 white fox coat.

302
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:41,400
Oh, yeah.

303
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,060
That was the other thing, right, dousing people with paint, yep.

304
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:44,840
Or spray paint.

305
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,000
Spray paint was another thing they did, too, for a little bit, the spray paint, yeah.

306
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,120
Yeah, so all that stuff.

307
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:53,820
So anyway, they have that look, a baby seal right before it gets clubbed.

308
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:59,480
I just wanted to bring that up because there's nothing out there, but, you know, hey, you

309
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,020
use them for what they're good for, which is whatever interaction you have, right?

310
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,120
You're going to be working somewhere or doing commerce somewhere, even socializing.

311
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,520
You just take all those things into account, you know.

312
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,040
It really sucks, though, because when you deal with the normies in the population at large,

313
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,860
you have to be very superficial, and if you're not used to being superficial, it's quite

314
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,540
the shock, by the way, you know.

315
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,240
So what else did we want to cover?

316
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,400
I think that's pretty much it.

317
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:30,380
Well, I want to continue a little more with the emo because I felt kind of like I gave

318
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:34,960
too much of my personal situation that day to illustrate what happens when you get involved

319
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,480
with the emo and what you perceive.

320
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,080
But right before that, I want to just go into the chat.

321
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:45,300
There was something about someone putting in something about their, I don't know if

322
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:50,740
you've read it, Chuck, one of their parents, I believe, health condition, and I went on

323
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:56,720
with some too long responses on what's going on, and I don't think there's the ability

324
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,340
to drive home enough what's going on with the human body in a more simple way, and I

325
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,620
try to simplify, and I just want to cover that again.

326
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,960
Did you read any of the chat this week?

327
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,900
No, I'm opening it up right now because I didn't catch this one, though.

328
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,680
I caught other stuff previous, but go ahead.

329
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:19,260
Basically, we're looking at an individual, I'm guessing is older than the one who's

330
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:25,240
writing the post, who's a sub, I'm presuming, and they had parts of their body removed

331
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:30,120
and they're in a state of what we call not doing so well and then recovering and on and

332
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,540
on and on.

333
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:35,960
Now, just generally, I gave a response, and what's more important about this is the point

334
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,180
of view on the response.

335
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,420
Very often, you hear people's parents and friends or co-workers or whatever, they fall

336
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:49,820
into the medical system, and it's either getting on a drug cocktail regimen or series of surgeries

337
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,860
or therapies along those lines, right?

338
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:52,340
Right.

339
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,260
Okay.

340
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,340
And usually, the person has to make the decision themselves.

341
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:56,900
Usually.

342
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,140
Sometimes, it's a court order, by the way, because they're all the same, you know,

343
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:05,160
it's an organization, but ultimately, the person makes a choice.

344
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:10,660
Now, they have to be in such misery and such pain or discomfort that they actually make

345
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,680
the choice to go ahead with the drug cocktails or the surgeries, right?

346
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:24,840
What's always never, never perceived, actually, it's not, is that the body's ability, right?

347
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,720
You'll never hear this anywhere else, by the way.

348
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:35,880
The body's ability to get sick, disease or ill, even growing tumors, is part of its system

349
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:43,120
that's built in, just like when you put up an important building, you build in safety

350
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,020
features, like a sprinkler system in case there's a fire, right?

351
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:46,480
Okay.

352
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:51,220
Or automatic shutoffs, you know, like for return vents and air vents, if there's a fire,

353
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:56,320
there's a switch, basically, it's very primitive, it's like a tube that holds a chain or a cable

354
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,980
and the hook is inside of a wax pot.

355
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:04,900
So if that duct gets so hot that the wax melts, guess what happens, it releases the chain

356
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,960
that closes the duct, stop the airflow, it's called a fusible link, could be a piece of

357
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,220
rope, right?

358
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:15,900
All these very simple things, but let me ask you, actually, without asking, let's just say,

359
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,080
okay, but once the event is over, okay, the body's just like that, the body has all of

360
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,100
these things built in.

361
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:30,360
So when things go wrong energetically, usually from food and mental state, these emergency

362
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,460
things click on to do what?

363
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:32,860
To block.

364
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,300
What does a sprinkler system do?

365
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,200
It douses, right?

366
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:41,360
To save the building, but what happens when the sprinkler system works great to save the

367
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:41,620
building?

368
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,480
Oh, everybody just come home and go back to work, or are you going to be like, the carpet's

369
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,700
wet, all the paperwork's ruined?

370
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,620
Yeah, clean everything up, replace carpets, you know, go ahead.

371
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:53,100
Yeah, you've got to call a restoration team and you've got to restore the building, but

372
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,920
it's not catastrophic, usually, right?

373
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:00,140
The same with the duct work, the automatic shutoffs, every time I talk about this, think

374
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:04,040
of the World Trade Center, because, by the way, the World Trade Center, before they

375
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:09,840
sabotaged the demolition scheme there, they had to shut down all the mains that are connected,

376
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:10,160
right?

377
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,160
Yeah, of course.

378
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,020
Yeah, because they have actually, on those big skyscrapers, they have shock sensors,

379
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,560
I forgot what they're called, there's a specific name for them, that if there's an explosion

380
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:27,340
or something, and the main senses a shock, it will shut off the water, it'll shut off

381
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,680
the power, right?

382
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,140
So they had a dilly-dally with all that stuff.

383
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:36,220
By the way, World Trade Center was not terrorism, it was sabotage, because everything that was

384
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,860
needed to take it down was already in place.

385
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:43,120
So anyway, just like pulling a fire alarm, right, it's a form of sabotage.

386
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:51,100
So the body has all these safety mechanisms built in, and when the diet, the intake of

387
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:57,240
the diet, starts to, let's say, inhibit the way the energies need to move, too much of

388
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:03,660
one energy or too little of another energy, the body will start to develop a blockage,

389
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,020
could be an aneurysm, it could be a tumor, it could be a cancerous cell, to stop the

390
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:08,320
flow.

391
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:12,480
No, you're not talking about a manifestation of something like...

392
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,820
Oh, you are, okay.

393
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,620
Various manifestations.

394
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,620
Okay, okay.

395
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:21,920
That's why very often when people are concerned with bad skin, I'm like, be thankful, because

396
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:26,080
that means your insides are not... you're doing it on your skin versus doing it on the

397
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,440
inside.

398
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,340
Okay.

399
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:27,620
Right?

400
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,420
Very rarely do you see someone with bad skin that has liver failure or kidney failure or

401
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:35,100
cancer, but they have to live with the bad skin appearance, right?

402
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:35,660
Right, right.

403
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,360
And you'll never hear...

404
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,160
It's funny how...

405
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,300
This is basic Taoist perspective.

406
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,940
By the way, the Western societies also had this, but it's been lost, obviously.

407
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:50,240
Could you imagine being in Vatican Europe in the 1500s talking this way when they wanted

408
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,860
to put their medical on you?

409
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,720
You know what they would do to you very quickly, right?

410
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,800
Yeah, you'd disappear.

411
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,260
Yeah, you'd disappear.

412
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:03,360
So the body has all these built-in systems to shut down parts of the body.

413
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,260
It's kind of like on the extreme side, how many times have you heard of a wild animal

414
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:10,980
getting caught in a trap and having to gnaw its leg off to get out of the trap?

415
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,040
Yeah, I've heard about it a lot.

416
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,340
I've only seen it a few times.

417
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:14,580
Mice do that.

418
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,620
But yeah, yeah.

419
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,520
Mice, rats, yeah.

420
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:16,840
Right.

421
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:17,700
Yeah.

422
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,960
Occasionally a lizard or whatever, but there's no lizard traps that I know of.

423
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,200
So this is really how it's set up.

424
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,020
So in other words, when someone has disease or is ill, you ready?

425
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,020
That is manifesting the perfection of the human body.

426
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,260
Its ability to deal with such an adverse situation.

427
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:43,720
And by the way, before a tumor or cancer or organ failure appears in the body or manifests

428
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:49,960
in the body, it has given you sign after sign and signal after signal over a long, long

429
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,940
period of time.

430
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,920
But if you don't know that language, well, you're going to ignore it.

431
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,800
Yeah, that happens a lot where somebody goes, well, now I know why this was hurting.

432
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,460
I know why this was doing this.

433
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:04,840
I know, you know, and you figure it out afterwards because like, well, that makes sense now that

434
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,600
this was happening.

435
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,260
A lot of people catch it later.

436
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,380
So very often I hear, you know, my mom got cancer.

437
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,780
I was, you know, first thing I said, I have to be very careful.

438
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,340
My mom got a tumor.

439
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,040
So I say, good.

440
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,500
I say, whoa, good.

441
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,440
Like they think that you mean them negative, right?

442
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:24,160
Well, because what follows that is, because that means your body's, if she got, I mean,

443
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:24,780
she can get rich.

444
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,600
She could reverse it.

445
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,000
You see?

446
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,480
But if you go the right center medical route, you probably won't.

447
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,660
They'll kill you because they look, they want that kind of situation, you know?

448
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:39,480
So actually the doctors that are working, remember, whether it's legal, law enforcement,

449
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:46,480
medical, financial, if you have people interacting with the public, the less they know about anything

450
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,500
that they're doing, the better, right?

451
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:54,180
So if you are interacting with a medical, financial, legal, or whatever person, judicial,

452
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:57,420
whatever, they absolutely know nothing about what their field is about.

453
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:57,840
Right.

454
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,640
And if they did, they would be pulled back.

455
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:01,300
Not either.

456
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:05,420
The organization they work for would say, we have to make a decision.

457
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,220
Do we pull them out from dealing with the public and keep them here because maybe they're

458
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,740
valuable in this or do we get rid of them?

459
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,780
Make sure they never work in this again, right?

460
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,260
That is one or the other.

461
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,560
If they don't run away from it themselves, once they realize what's going on.

462
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:18,860
Yeah.

463
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,060
And this is a sad reality.

464
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,340
It's getting worse, actually.

465
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:27,080
By the minute, I want to say by the minute, you know, at any point they say, you know,

466
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,020
there's like 500 babies an hour being born, you know, there's 1,000 people dying every

467
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,640
hour across the world, let's say, that's why I say by the minute.

468
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:42,100
So anyway, the perfection of the body to not only persist in a robust manner as it does,

469
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:48,840
it has a very robust safety system that gets to the point where almost like you hear of

470
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,280
an animal chewing its leg off to get out of a trap.

471
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,960
And that's what all of these manifestations are.

472
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:59,640
I did post, it was kind of hard to find, a Michio Kushi playlist.

473
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,640
He's actually hard to listen to.

474
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:07,540
But in 1980s, I was made aware, I actually went to a dinner party and they asked me to

475
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,180
make the dessert for his party, which I did.

476
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:16,480
And I didn't appreciate all the information that he gave at the time, but I was mentored

477
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,960
by someone else, Shizuko Yamamoto.

478
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,500
Very simple.

479
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:25,180
Just like, you could be mentored, you could be around someone for a few weeks or a few

480
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:29,240
months and you could bring up a situation and they give you like a three-word answer

481
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,540
that you have to think about for a couple of days, right?

482
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,160
That, you know what I mean?

483
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,980
Most people considered learning or being a mentor sitting down for an hour and hearing

484
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,400
them speak for an hour, right?

485
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,540
It wasn't like that at all.

486
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,500
It was just pointing you in the right direction and this is how maybe you should think about

487
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,360
it, go for it, right?

488
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,880
Is he hard to listen to because of the accent?

489
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,320
Is that what the problem is or?

490
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,280
The recording.

491
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,160
And the accent.

492
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:53,620
Oh, okay.

493
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,000
Okay.

494
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:54,400
Yeah.

495
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:54,840
Accent.

496
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,560
Very Japanese.

497
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:00,940
The thing that I don't like promoting about macrobiotics is really a modified Japanese

498
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:07,180
culture and modified diet, but it just means eating locally in the environment and it means

499
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:11,680
eating seasonally and it means understanding the energies of the body.

500
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:18,260
Recently I was discussing something with someone about diet and they brought it up how people

501
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:22,040
around them are not eating well and I said, look, it's not about changing, you never first

502
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:27,020
of all tell anyone they should change anything they're doing in an insecure world, right?

503
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,200
Because everything is so insecure around them that the thing that they have secure is their

504
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,980
diet and you tell them you're going to change that, it's like their whole reality just fell

505
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,340
apart.

506
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,340
The way to do it is by substitution.

507
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,420
So I think I've said this before, if you eat McDonald's for breakfast, Burger King for lunch

508
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:45,500
and Wendy's for dinner every day, you don't tell them to stop that.

509
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:50,440
You just keep eating that, but go home and prepare some of this and some of that and

510
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,400
bring it with you.

511
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:56,320
So when you go to the breakfast for McDonald's, eat some of that and don't order so much McDonald's.

512
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:59,680
So when you go to Burger King for lunch, bring some of that, eat some of that with your Burger

513
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:03,760
King so you don't eat so much Burger King and when you go home, don't bring so much

514
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,540
Wendy's home, eat that instead.

515
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,300
Gradual transition.

516
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:12,460
Transition, right, until it gets to the point where you'll notice that, hey, I'm eating

517
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,100
so little McDonald's and I'm feeling better eating this, I don't need that.

518
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:18,960
You see, transition, that transition could be a matter of days, weeks or years.

519
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:19,620
It doesn't matter.

520
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,640
Just get yourself into something that is going to work for the body.

521
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:29,720
The other thing that I had conversation with this person is they're kind of hung up about

522
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,580
proteins and carbs and measuring pH in the body.

523
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:38,240
I said, all of that is fiction and you know when I really got forthright and used a few

524
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:45,100
pejoratives when they brought up the word calories, oh man, I said, are you telling

525
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,960
me you're fucking pooping charcoal, right?

526
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:55,300
So all that doesn't matter, push it to the side because there is no protein by the way.

527
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,160
No one has ever seen a protein, right?

528
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:00,480
It's what they see as the presence of amino acids.

529
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:01,580
Guess what?

530
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,080
There's amino acids in carbohydrate food.

531
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,300
So, hey, guess what?

532
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,500
Oh, carbs.

533
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:08,960
You know what?

534
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,380
What they call protein foods, guess what?

535
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,860
There's carbs in that too.

536
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,380
It doesn't make any sense.

537
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:16,940
It's all energy.

538
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:22,340
Here's the short of it because I might lean a little bit into yes, you do fix most things

539
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:22,840
with diet.

540
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:28,040
I think I have gone on a sonic a while back saying if you have a very clean diet, anything

541
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:32,200
in your body, you'll start to see it healing in a few days to a week.

542
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:37,300
Well, that's why I've never objected to people that say, look, your food is your medicine,

543
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,360
your medicine is your food.

544
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,640
I've never objected to that because I think it's correct.

545
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,280
Right, but you don't need medicine if you're doing it right because medicine to me is like

546
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:44,780
a band-aid.

547
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:49,740
Well, no, but if your food is your medicine, excuse me, your medicine, then therefore that's

548
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,580
all there is to it.

549
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,220
You know what I mean?

550
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:55,740
No, but I'm saying you don't even need medicine because where do you put the medicine?

551
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,340
The medicine cabinet next to the band-aids and all the crap that you really don't need

552
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:03,500
to use unless you are trying to help something.

553
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,400
Yeah, the thing is to be robust, right?

554
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,640
Humans are robust.

555
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:14,980
Even the weakest mainstream normie that eats on a standard American diet, which is sad

556
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:19,840
food, yes, standard American diet, they're extremely robust.

557
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,080
Extremely robust.

558
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:26,040
In other words, the body can take tremendous amount of abuse before it gets ill.

559
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,940
What does that say?

560
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:32,060
For most people, for them to come down with an illness means it's many, many years of

561
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:35,080
abuse or giving the body stuff.

562
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:41,900
One simple way to reset this, which is very easy, I said, is get yourself brown rice.

563
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:45,860
Lundberg is a brand and short grain.

564
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:52,120
It doesn't have to be that, but that is a brand that has been consistent for decades,

565
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,360
and it's very high quality.

566
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,960
Then learn how to make a dish called kimpira.

567
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,400
Very simple.

568
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,500
Get yourself some burdock root if you can.

569
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,600
It's actually a weed.

570
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,740
It's in the thistle family.

571
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:10,560
Get some carrots and onions and some high quality sea salt and learn how to prepare

572
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:10,840
that.

573
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,380
I'll get into that on the food stuff.

574
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,540
The best way to prepare, you know the matchstick cut for carrots and things or the burdock,

575
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:24,020
you cut it on an extreme biased angle, so it looks like these very thin elliptical shavings

576
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,440
of the vegetable.

577
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:31,400
Then you lay them down flat and you go across them and you make a very thin, very fine matchstick

578
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,260
and saute that and have that with the rice.

579
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:38,020
Get some kuzu root, not kudzu, but kuzu.

580
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,100
It's a starch.

581
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,040
It's like corn starch, but it actually has medicinal properties.

582
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,920
It's an intestinal tonic.

583
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:52,340
What this will do, this food that I just mentioned is extremely bracing.

584
00:32:53,200 --> 00:33:00,380
It will give you, for most people that are hungry and need some energy, if they sit down

585
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:06,520
and have a really good burger or a steak or something, if you eat animal, you get energy

586
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,140
right away.

587
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,880
That's why people like eating animal.

588
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,320
They call it stick to your ribs kind of meal, right?

589
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:11,920
Yeah, okay.

590
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:17,220
Yeah, when you eat animal food, even fish, it gives you energy right away, but at a cost,

591
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:17,480
right?

592
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,440
Your body has to produce something that is dead.

593
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:26,420
It's actually, we're not meat eaters, we're carrion eaters because we don't eat things

594
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:29,160
alive usually, so it's a form of carrion.

595
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,580
People that say, oh, I'm a carnivore.

596
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,000
No, you're not.

597
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,680
A carnivore eats a live animal.

598
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,880
That's different from-

599
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,600
You're a scavenger, you're a carrion, yeah.

600
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,860
That's why they encourage the bald eagle as a noble bird, but they never really talk about

601
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,400
its behavior.

602
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,140
It's mostly a scavenger bird, looks for dead things.

603
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:52,560
The only thing they show you is this beautiful, when it's in flight and it glides down and

604
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:56,960
dives and pulls a fish out of a lake, right, or something, but very rarely.

605
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:01,000
I've been around where the White Mountains of Arizona, where there's a very large bald

606
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,820
eagle population.

607
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,320
They are pretty big birds, by the way.

608
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:09,060
I mean, their wingspan is like a grown man stretching their arms out, right?

609
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,540
It's quite a thing to see.

610
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:16,639
Or you could just look at it as a good looking turkey, so anyway, because turkeys are pretty

611
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,080
big too.

612
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,739
Yeah, they're scavengers.

613
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:23,080
They'll go through garbage cans, they'll eat dead stuff, they'll even take a shoe away.

614
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:26,239
If you've got a leather shoe and you're sunbathing by the lake, they'll fly it on, swoop down,

615
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,500
mm, that's leather, I could eat that.

616
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,020
It's not like it took your shoe by mistake.

617
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,800
It will try to eat, it will eat your ... Anyway.

618
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,900
So, yeah, they're not ... It's not the noble picture that we get, right?

619
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:37,800
No, not at all.

620
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:43,980
But in essence, eating something that's very bracing like that, it doesn't have to be that

621
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:44,300
way.

622
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:46,760
In other words, brown rice and kimpura.

623
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:54,780
If you're ... In other words, take some time and assess what's in your environment.

624
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:00,720
If you have a farmer's market, whatever, if you are, let's say, in an urban environment,

625
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:05,820
go cross-latitude with your finger on a map and you can enjoy foods from anywhere along

626
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,120
that latitude in the world.

627
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,980
That'll be very similar, right?

628
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:14,760
So let's say where you and I are, I'm about 32 degrees latitude or something, I think

629
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,360
you are also.

630
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,140
Go across the world.

631
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:23,300
We could have Middle Eastern, Chinese, you go across, you're right, all along there.

632
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:27,400
Southern European, right, pretty much, North Africa.

633
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:36,100
So all those different varieties that I mentioned, those are very tasty foods and very rich menu

634
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,320
all across in variety.

635
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,740
That's another way to do it, cross-latitude.

636
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,920
But it should be whole.

637
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:46,620
If you were trying to heal the body and have food that is very bracing and empowering to

638
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:54,420
the body, when you go out and do shopping, if it has a list of ingredients on it, it's

639
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,760
probably not ...

640
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,020
In other words, it shouldn't be packaged food.

641
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:05,160
It should be as whole as possible, right, and not pre-packaged, right, and vacuum-sealed

642
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,340
or whatever, right, or made at a factory.

643
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:13,140
Yeah, I'm somewhere between 32 and 33 degrees, but yeah, I was just looking to make sure about

644
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:13,700
that, but yep.

645
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:14,660
Yeah.

646
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,640
A while back, I memorized all that when I used to talk more about all that stuff.

647
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:26,660
But if we just generate latitude, yeah, so cross-latitude is pretty safe for the seasonal

648
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:32,180
macrobiotic part, let's say, or I don't even like to use that word, but it's just a simple

649
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:34,560
thing to send people to, you know what I mean, to study.

650
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,540
But here's the other hard thing about it.

651
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:41,120
If you go online and study macrobiotics, there's very little there, and the other thing is

652
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,480
if you try to study the yin and yang online, forget it.

653
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,380
There's nothing really.

654
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:48,560
Oh, yin is soft and yang is hard, oh my goodness, right?

655
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:53,820
One of the questions were how does the body go, the energy move up, how do you know which

656
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,360
way it moves?

657
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,940
Well, these are old principles, and they will be discussed.

658
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:03,080
But essentially, for men and women, it's the same, the vertical, left goes down and right

659
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,420
goes up, except for the top, right?

660
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,020
One is counterclockwise, one is clockwise, you know, the crown of the head.

661
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:20,660
So, in essence, I don't know how to steer people to eat things that will empower them

662
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:24,920
and recover and heal the body, because it's very location sensitive, it's very seasonal,

663
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:25,860
right?

664
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:31,740
But one thing to avoid is, of course, anything processed, anything with a label on it, and

665
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,660
then the next thing would be things like nightshades, you could look up what nightshades are, right?

666
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:40,140
Or things that grow very tall and fast, right?

667
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:48,420
So, in other words, getting a sweetener made from a grain is not going to be as extreme

668
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:55,560
as sugarcane, because if you look at how tall grain grows, and how tall does sugarcane grow,

669
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,980
one is more expansive.

670
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:05,740
The same thing with fruit, what's interesting about fruit is it comes from a tree that bears

671
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:10,680
energy from the earth that is moving upwards, but all of the energy in the fruit is pointing

672
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,000
downwards, right?

673
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:12,780
You ever notice?

674
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,220
Well, that's where it ends up going, yeah.

675
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,240
And eventually, when it's, yup, right?

676
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,660
It falls to the ground.

677
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,360
It'll fall, right.

678
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:26,140
Yeah, but, so there's a point of, that's why in some ancient cultures they had many dishes

679
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,620
where they would use unripe fruit, right?

680
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:34,060
When it was still in that middle stage, I don't know if you've ever had pickled limes or pickled

681
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:36,280
lemons, you'd pickle them in a jar, right?

682
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,500
Things like that.

683
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,820
Or fried green tomatoes, right?

684
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:40,800
Things like that.

685
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:46,640
So, there's an art and a science to all of it, and the science is what you learn, basically

686
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,940
knowledge on these matters.

687
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,880
But essentially, there's another aspect I also talked about of resetting the body.

688
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,960
Easiest thing to do is, when you reset, you're new, you go back new.

689
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:01,080
When you were new, what did you eat before you had teeth?

690
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:01,740
Baby food.

691
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:07,160
Believe it or not, most of the baby food is still pretty unadulterated, so if you want

692
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,440
to help someone reset or reset yourself, just eat baby food for a week.

693
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,340
And like I said, most of the baby food, last time I investigated it was four years ago

694
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:21,040
when I needed to nurture back a cat, I gave him chicken baby food, and I said, oh man,

695
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,020
why am I paying like $2 for half an ounce of this?

696
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,940
I could make chicken baby food myself, right?

697
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:30,400
But most of it's still unadulterated, so what do you mean baby food?

698
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,800
Yeah, applesauce, pureed chicken, pureed beef, pureed whatever.

699
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,040
Whatever they got for babies, they'll get the menu.

700
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:39,720
It's actually not that bad, believe it or not, baby food.

701
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,660
And warm drink, no cold drink.

702
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,540
Stay away from milk.

703
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,940
By the way, milk is for babies to grow, so if you're an adult, you don't need it.

704
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:55,520
Then there's, of course, there's the animal, right?

705
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:02,940
But there's an old saying that if you drink cow's milk, you'll become like a cow, right?

706
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,240
And that's why there's a lot of problems with it.

707
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,800
There's more problems with cow milk when it's processed, by the way, than whole milk.

708
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:15,020
That was one of the first things they did in the U.S. was make sure that they were going

709
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:18,020
to, well, they knew they were going to give people in the U.S. a hard time, and they knew

710
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:22,300
they were big on cattle, so let's make it even worse for them by putting in regulations

711
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,240
where they can't drink whole milk, right?

712
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,940
So they can't get any nutrition anyway if they're starving.

713
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:33,900
But the larger the animal, you know, the cow is not really compatible with the human.

714
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:41,400
I like what Dr. Lorraine Day says, you know, you go to a cow to get milk for your babies

715
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,060
or your children.

716
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,620
Do you ever have a cow knock on your door asking for human milk for its calf, right?

717
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:53,380
And a larger animal, something like a whale milk, by the way, yes, whales are mammals,

718
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:56,260
A lot of mammals make milk, you know, right?

719
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:01,120
You would die if you drank, because it's so extreme from that point, right?

720
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:06,500
Actually you would be probably, I'm just saying from an energetic point of view, I don't know

721
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:12,740
if this is, I'm just speculating, it would cause death, pretty much, if you try to live

722
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,120
on whale milk, right?

723
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:21,440
Because look at the conditions, extremely yeeing conditions and extremely yeeing body, and

724
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,580
then you have a yeeing liquid that carries all that energy, it would just tear your system

725
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:25,960
apart.

726
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:32,220
So if you're going to have any dairy, a small animal, coven hoof would be very compatible,

727
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,000
sheep's milk, goat's milk, by the way.

728
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:38,600
By the way, speaking of small animals, you know there's something called mouse milk,

729
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:42,300
but it's not really a milk, it's like a WD-40 in a syringe.

730
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:46,380
It's for really fine instrument, like it was developed around World War II to put into

731
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,720
like very fine gear mechanisms, right?

732
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:53,120
So anyway, I thought I'd just bring that up, let's take it as a joke, if you will.

733
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,620
No problem, didn't know it, but good.

734
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:58,500
Yeah, it's called mouse milk, but anyway, very fine oil.

735
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,860
It's a very, very high quality oil also.

736
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:07,480
Yeah, so I would suggest that, you know, this is one of the hardest things to suggest, I

737
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:14,400
would suggest, is what to eat or whatever, but I would always by default, if you can

738
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,420
cook the Lundberg brown rice and make kempira, do that.

739
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,900
Just make it, eat whatever you're eating and add it, just start adding it and see how

740
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,640
you feel, especially with the kuzu.

741
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:31,440
You can always make simple ingredients, but here's the thing, you should never suggest

742
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:37,720
someone prepare something as food if you know they cannot prepare it well, right?

743
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:45,340
So, I mean, I've gone through the years, through many people's homes that were not good at

744
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:47,300
cooking and they just ruined the meal, right?

745
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:54,160
Does it mean that the meal, let's say, Chuck, I say it was a sirloin steak with mashed potatoes,

746
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:54,540
right?

747
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:55,700
What's wrong with that?

748
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:56,560
It's delicious.

749
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,300
Sounds fine to me, yeah.

750
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,800
Yeah, but can it be ruined?

751
00:42:59,140 --> 00:42:59,440
Yeah.

752
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:00,880
It could be ruined.

753
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,160
You know, they put the steak first and then the potatoes, right?

754
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:06,700
They started cooking the steak before the potatoes started cooking, right?

755
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:08,180
Guess what happens?

756
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:12,560
So, anyway, it goes on and on and on, I mean, so with the rice, you have to put it under

757
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,100
pressure and rinse it well.

758
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:19,320
Now, here's the thing someone once asked me, I'll get into some of the food, food sonics,

759
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,440
but can you roast the rice?

760
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,520
Yes, go ahead and rinse it, put it in a strainer, let it sit and go ahead and roast it.

761
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:30,420
It'll be wet, but the rice doesn't, the brown rice does not absorb the moisture, so it'll

762
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:31,240
just be on the husk.

763
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:34,800
So, as you're, well, in the husk, it'll be on the shell, I think it's called.

764
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,720
I think you have the husk on the outside, then the shell.

765
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,380
Anyway, the brown rice will not get soggy.

766
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:44,500
Go ahead and stir it in the pan to roast it, because when you roast the grain, it has a

767
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,240
nice flavor, right?

768
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,040
Mm-hmm.

769
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:46,340
Right?

770
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:49,040
Like roasted peanuts versus non-roasted peanuts, let's say, right?

771
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:51,220
This is a big difference, almost like a completely different thing.

772
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,380
Roasted chestnuts on an open fire, right?

773
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,380
So, kind of thing.

774
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,280
So, yeah, you can roast it once you've rinsed it.

775
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:02,160
So, I don't know what else to say about food, because here, the most difficult thing is,

776
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:07,920
if you're suggesting someone eat something and try something, you also must include how

777
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:08,740
to prepare it well.

778
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,520
It's just like, for the reason, writing a book.

779
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:14,820
It's like writing a book and putting it out there, you're presuming that people know how

780
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:16,060
to read, right?

781
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:21,120
So, telling people or suggesting that people eat a certain thing or try a certain thing,

782
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:25,020
you're presuming they know how to cook it well, and I don't mean well done, but cook

783
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:27,920
it so it's delicious, and that's not a good presumption, right?

784
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:32,080
But I think giving the step-by-step on how to, and things to look for to produce it well

785
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:38,260
to make a delicious meal should always preempt the actual introduction of the food.

786
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,280
So, yeah, it's a more complete way.

787
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:47,840
Yeah, and again, it goes back to the, you know, upgrade your food and your shelter and your

788
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,120
clothing, right?

789
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:51,240
Good food, good shelter, good clothing.

790
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:56,540
So, you know, these are all excellent pursuits, right?

791
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,080
Not to most.

792
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:06,480
The water, energy, silver is after food, clothing, shelter, and those are very broad, but you

793
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:14,180
notice I didn't, when it ends up with silver, I didn't say gold, you know, but, you know,

794
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:18,060
that's a perspective that I've introduced recently and that we'll work on that again.

795
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,500
Another thing I want to work on, which we started, I gave a lot of personal stuff on it, was

796
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,360
the emo work.

797
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:23,700
Right.

798
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:28,540
One of the things I want to put out with the emo is, I think it's self-evident from the

799
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:36,700
previous Sonics and even previous to that introducing the, let's say, how, the purpose of emotions,

800
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:37,760
why we have them, right?

801
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,580
Like, what's your pinky for, you know, kind of thing, you know?

802
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:44,160
Well, you can kind of make up things like that, but the emotions, I think, override

803
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:48,260
what a pinky is, especially if you, someone in the Yakuza, right, it wouldn't matter,

804
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:52,360
but, well, you know, they chop off their pinky, they cut their pinkies off to atone

805
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,360
for their mistakes, right?

806
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,980
But something like the emotions is never, ever, ever addressed.

807
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,200
It never is.

808
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:04,540
So kind of gone on that theme on how to guide yourself and guide actions and things around

809
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:10,200
you, it's actually one of the keys and carrier waves of, let's just use the word manipulate

810
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:15,060
or influence the world around you, physical, mental, and yes, physical, did I say physical?

811
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:15,700
Yes.

812
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,920
Yeah, world around you, and I mean literally.

813
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,500
So the thing is about the emotional state, we have these emotional states always, even

814
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,180
to the point of boredom, that's why, I don't know if you've ever heard me, when people

815
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:33,320
say they're bored, I always ask, could boredom be a form of anger or is boredom an emotion

816
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:33,900
on its own?

817
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,920
I would suggest it's more of a form of anger, right?

818
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:39,340
And if you actually get someone who's bored, they're pretty easy to tick off, by the way,

819
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,000
aren't they usually?

820
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:40,440
Oh, yeah.

821
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:44,880
You set them off one way or you could set them off in another way, because anger is

822
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:50,340
a release, it's a, that actually some might make people feel well, good for a short time,

823
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:56,580
but then it, of course, has its own constraints and can be negative to the individuals feeling

824
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:56,760
it.

825
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:03,500
So the emo aspect is be mindful of your emotions, and then also be mindful of what you want

826
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,640
to accomplish and find a corresponding emotion.

827
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:11,000
You know, we've always said the easiest one, the analogy was the hug, it's when someone,

828
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,220
there's a lot of that giving, people want you to give, right?

829
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:15,160
Give that person, right?

830
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:19,880
Send good energy, give, that's the hug, when you give a hug, the, right?

831
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:23,840
You have the emotion, that is the giving emotion, right?

832
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:29,600
Denial is the protection, you know, when someone accuses you for something and you deny it,

833
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:32,100
that is your protection emotion, right?

834
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,480
And all these other things.

835
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:37,940
There's the love emotion, which is doing the right thing, which covers everything, right?

836
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:41,940
You know, sometimes punching someone in the head is doing the right thing, right?

837
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:44,540
To stop them from doing something worse, you know?

838
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:47,080
So there is love in that too.

839
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:55,720
So the, on the emo part though, the technical aspects, one thing I'll throw in here is aside

840
00:47:55,720 --> 00:48:00,400
from understanding that is something that should be understood, that is completely negated,

841
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:06,240
is that once you start getting into the emo, you'll notice that the way it works is not

842
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,500
the way other things work.

843
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:12,240
It works independent of time, it works independent of distance, right?

844
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:17,780
So and it also works independent of things that we consider to be the what they are.

845
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:24,240
An example would be someone says, hey, I have a friend and I want you to send them some

846
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:24,920
healing energy.

847
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,140
That's all you need to know, right?

848
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:34,200
Usually in many other quote unquote disciplines, you need to know who they are, a picture of

849
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,160
them, they go even further.

850
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:39,580
I need a, when you get into some of the other magical stuff, they want a hair sample or

851
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:40,760
some nail clippings, right?

852
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:42,140
Or something.

853
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:45,900
Yeah, this is very, very, this goes above that.

854
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:47,420
So let's say, let's go back to this.

855
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,800
You know, hey Greek, I have a friend that needs some healing energy, could you please

856
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:52,400
send it to them?

857
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:52,700
Okay.

858
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:55,140
How do you send, how do you identify that person?

859
00:48:55,240 --> 00:49:03,140
All you have to do is ask to yourself, and this is by the way, again, because ask yourself,

860
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:06,340
you're going to have that inner dialogue, you know, you have to be very careful who's,

861
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:09,200
you know, where that voice is.

862
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:09,560
Yeah.

863
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,540
And this is done with no voice.

864
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:17,860
In thought, when you are asked, requested to send energy to someone, how do you create

865
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:18,420
the identifier?

866
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:26,540
All you have to do is ask this person that is to receive what I'm going to send, do they

867
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:28,420
have any unique properties?

868
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:32,840
And you can think of where his social security number, telephone number, if they had an eye

869
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:37,260
scan or a fingerprint, do they have anything, a gene, a code in their genes that's unique

870
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:37,700
to them?

871
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:38,480
Yes.

872
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,260
The answer is yes.

873
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:40,860
Everyone has something that's unique to them.

874
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:46,660
That's all you have to do, is focus in on the thought of what makes that person unique.

875
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:48,840
And that's all, the only identifier you need.

876
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:52,700
It's not like when you're ordering something from, and who will, shall I be sending this

877
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:52,920
to?

878
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:55,140
Will I please have their address or their name?

879
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,740
You don't need any of that.

880
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:57,380
Okay.

881
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:57,760
Right?

882
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,320
You see how it works?

883
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:02,380
And it actually works better that way.

884
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:06,240
Better if you don't have the specific, if you just have the...

885
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:10,740
If you don't have a photograph or a hair sample or their name or anything like that, yeah,

886
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:11,540
it works even better.

887
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:16,300
The reason why is because once you start to get specifics, it starts to tie you down into

888
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:22,720
this physical realm, and now it's no longer 100% emo work, it's 50% physical, 50% emo.

889
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:23,960
Okay.

890
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:24,620
You see?

891
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:30,700
So now it gets to the point where eventually, once you start working with emo, you'll notice

892
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:32,160
that the physical world ain't shit.

893
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:35,600
And there's a lot of shit in the physical world, by the way.

894
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:40,760
But in other words, you're detaching from that and you're going for identifiers that

895
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,060
are beyond what...

896
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:48,940
How many times have you heard one of the pitfalls of society is what they identify things as

897
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:49,260
being?

898
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:50,560
Right?

899
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,280
Yeah, that's always a problem, yeah.

900
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:56,920
All within the misgivings and the misinterpretations and the misinformation in the world.

901
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:02,180
Now I'm not saying that if you do have a photograph or a name or you've even met the person in

902
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:06,820
the past, it's a negative, but don't dwell on that at all.

903
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:11,860
Just asking the question, is there something unique about this, right?

904
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:17,800
So now this allows you to pretty much send energy or whatever you so desire in your transmission

905
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:22,920
or in your transmittal into a very, very specific place without even knowing anything

906
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,520
about it in the physical realm.

907
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:32,260
And one thing I would suggest, the less time, the less that time is considered.

908
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:37,140
In other words, if you send energy there, well, when will they get better?

909
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:41,200
Oh, maybe five minutes from now, maybe three months, or maybe they have even before you

910
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:41,760
asked, right?

911
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,620
Don't leave time out of it.

912
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:50,360
In other words, yes, there is time as a function, right?

913
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:55,320
In other words, a person might say, they got better in three days after you did that, right?

914
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:58,300
Or they got better in five minutes or three months or never.

915
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:00,020
That's a time constraint.

916
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:03,880
So leave the time constraints and all the physical constraints out of it, right?

917
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:07,880
And learn how to create these identification markers based on the information that you're

918
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,200
getting and the email that you're going to send out.

919
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:15,000
See, this gets very, it seems, woo-woo, airy-fairy.

920
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:19,960
Well, doesn't it help to just, like, say that something is as opposed to something is going

921
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:20,620
to happen, though?

922
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:21,780
Yeah.

923
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:28,260
What you do, and when you say something is going to happen, it's all reference points.

924
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:34,260
In other words, it's a waste of time, in most cases, to say, I want that person to get

925
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:36,280
better, even if you had the specifics.

926
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:43,140
Because the coordinates in the reality that we live in don't work that way.

927
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:48,840
They require specifics, but not physical specifics, conditional specifics.

928
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,200
What I mean by that is this.

929
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:56,040
If someone is not doing well, you would wish that they go back to the state that they were

930
00:52:56,040 --> 00:53:01,020
before they were not doing well, is the simplest, most general one.

931
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:06,000
All you hear in culture and society is, I hope you do well, I hope you feel better.

932
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,120
That never works.

933
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,340
Very rarely does it work.

934
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:14,920
But once, if the stimulus or the impetus in the ethereal world is put out that they go

935
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:20,220
back to before they were, because that's a condition that already exists, it already has

936
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:21,240
been achieved, right?

937
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:27,960
So someone who's in their 70s who's suffering various illnesses, you would put out, make

938
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,020
that person like they were when they were 18.

939
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:35,340
The problem with that sometimes is, what if they had that condition when they were 18?

940
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,860
Then you should go back to when they were born.

941
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,020
What if they were born with it?

942
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:41,720
There's another problem.

943
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:42,700
The time of conception.

944
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:46,880
What if it was carried over from one of the mother's side or father's?

945
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:51,580
Then you have to go back to the genetic line before that thing emerged, you see?

946
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:55,880
So all those have to be taken into consideration.

947
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:04,160
So you do need specifics on that to know what to avoid for when you want them to go back to.

948
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:06,400
Well, yeah, that's just part of the menu.

949
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:11,060
One thing that, I'll tell you what I do with that, is I go back to the whole genetic line.

950
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:20,860
All of the ability, all of the reworking, the ethereal reworking that they came from,

951
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,200
you know, because as more babies are being born over hundreds and thousands of years,

952
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:29,940
because we are degrading, we are not getting, right, our, in other words, genetic code,

953
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:34,180
hereditary code, and our bodies are not as fit and as strong as they were, let's say,

954
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,780
a thousand years ago or 5,000 years ago.

955
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,360
We're constantly degenerating.

956
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:43,740
And this is even shown, let's say, in the quackademic because of the cosmic rays damaging

957
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:48,920
the chromosomes and the DNA consist constantly, right, because we're not shielded.

958
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:51,120
We're barely shielded, let's say, right?

959
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:56,640
Where in former days, we had more shielding and the codes were much more robust, right?

960
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:00,600
It's kind of like carrying someone's business card in your wallet for five years.

961
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:02,020
What do you think it's going to look like, right?

962
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:04,940
Generally, it's going to get mangled.

963
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:06,660
It's going to look like crap, yeah.

964
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:11,620
So from that perspective, what I typically do is go back to the line,

965
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:16,600
the entire, I do it on a genetic ethereal level, like in other words,

966
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:24,200
I'm going back to what a perfect human, whatever perfect human they came from, right?

967
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,820
Yeah, it is typically and then move forward.

968
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:30,480
Typically, it's very rare that I don't get any information.

969
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:36,400
So then I include some of that any information when I get it and very carefully.

970
00:55:42,290 --> 00:55:47,670
What I mean by that is within that information that I'm getting is how long have they been

971
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:49,450
this way and were they a happy person?

972
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:52,370
I always ask first and were they a healthy person?

973
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:55,850
So you got to get an idea of what was in the past in order.

974
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:56,650
No, you don't have to.

975
00:55:56,790 --> 00:55:57,490
No, you don't have to.

976
00:55:57,570 --> 00:56:01,110
But usually it comes up in conversation than I do anyway.

977
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:03,810
It's supplied before I even consider doing an email.

978
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:07,990
It's supplied like, hey, Chuck, I know this guy.

979
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:12,870
I've known him since I was 12 and he was pretty happy all the time.

980
00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:16,210
And recently, you know, he's in his late 50s and he's got this and that, right?

981
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:16,790
Right.

982
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:20,950
I got a lot, you know, already, you know, I don't come back.

983
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:22,110
Were they healthy when they were young?

984
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:24,550
They actually supply enough information, I presume that.

985
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:25,330
Right.

986
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:28,210
But you go back to where the human, the perfect human.

987
00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:30,330
This is almost like you read about the resurrection.

988
00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:32,710
When you're brought back, you're in a perfect body.

989
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:36,950
Perfect human body, physical body, that type of body.

990
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:41,110
It's actually transmitted by light.

991
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:45,830
You know, when they look at matter, you know, they don't find matter.

992
00:56:45,830 --> 00:56:48,270
If they look at it fine enough, they just find energy, right?

993
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:48,650
Right.

994
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:54,110
And usually they know it's energy because it's somehow photoluminescing, right?

995
00:56:54,450 --> 00:56:56,710
Yeah, well, that's how you end up with those.

996
00:56:56,870 --> 00:56:59,130
Every couple of years, there's a new eureka, right?

997
00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:00,670
That says that everything is energy.

998
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:05,090
And then a couple of years later, they come back out and say the same thing again,

999
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:06,530
as if they just rediscovered it.

1000
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:09,970
But it just keeps happening.

1001
00:57:10,190 --> 00:57:11,190
Well, it's a distraction.

1002
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:15,890
It's to make sure that you never really, it's to keep you going around.

1003
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:17,130
It's an amusement park.

1004
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:19,470
Well, what's the purpose of going to amusement park?

1005
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:22,770
It's the only place that has a purpose to have no purpose.

1006
00:57:23,930 --> 00:57:24,290
Right.

1007
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:26,030
That's what's going on.

1008
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:27,610
Because it changes, right?

1009
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:31,530
You're on the teacups, you're on the merry-go-round, the power slide, you know, what?

1010
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:32,450
There's no purpose.

1011
00:57:32,570 --> 00:57:33,290
What's the purpose here?

1012
00:57:33,330 --> 00:57:34,230
What do you mean there's no purpose here?

1013
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:35,630
Look at all these various things you could do.

1014
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:38,450
Look at all the various professions and things you could study here.

1015
00:57:38,450 --> 00:57:41,210
I'm telling you, all these things are purposes with no purpose.

1016
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:42,450
How do I know?

1017
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:45,650
It's kind of like the same thing I hear about, oh, the Greek philosophy.

1018
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:46,830
Oh, look, OK.

1019
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:49,490
If all that stuff was so good, how well has it served you?

1020
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:51,610
How well has it served society?

1021
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:53,750
Where are you?

1022
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:54,670
Where is society?

1023
00:57:55,090 --> 00:57:55,190
Right?

1024
00:57:56,590 --> 00:57:59,110
So I kind of like, I recently heard an Eric Dollard.

1025
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:03,290
And he says, Eric, he says, the society is going down the toilet bowl.

1026
00:58:03,470 --> 00:58:07,430
And it's at that point, you know, that sound that a healthy toilet, that burping sound

1027
00:58:07,430 --> 00:58:08,750
that a healthy toilet bowl makes.

1028
00:58:10,910 --> 00:58:14,630
He's always, if you asked him that 40 years ago, he'd say the same thing.

1029
00:58:15,090 --> 00:58:16,310
But I like that analogy.

1030
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:23,230
I just say it's just someone needs to go into the room and pull the chrome handle on the porcelain

1031
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:25,150
bowl, you know?

1032
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:25,910
Now, fair enough.

1033
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:29,410
I guess the purpose of being at the amusement park is just being there, is it?

1034
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:30,370
Yeah.

1035
00:58:30,530 --> 00:58:31,270
Yeah, exactly.

1036
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:31,730
Yeah.

1037
00:58:31,830 --> 00:58:32,470
What's the purpose?

1038
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:34,230
Well, there was a lot of purpose to build it.

1039
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:35,650
And there's a lot of purpose in it.

1040
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:39,270
But when you're all said and done and you're tired, time to go home.

1041
00:58:40,070 --> 00:58:40,610
What do you say?

1042
00:58:41,290 --> 00:58:42,050
Did you have fun?

1043
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:43,250
That's it.

1044
00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:45,390
So when you come to Earth, did you have fun?

1045
00:58:46,370 --> 00:58:46,730
Right?

1046
00:58:47,010 --> 00:58:49,610
I don't know how everybody's going to answer that one.

1047
00:58:50,170 --> 00:58:51,450
Well, that's what's going on here.

1048
00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:52,250
Did you have fun?

1049
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:52,610
Did you?

1050
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:55,190
Because, you know, you're going to be made fun of for being here in the first place,

1051
00:58:55,290 --> 00:58:56,070
cosmically, right?

1052
00:58:56,390 --> 00:58:58,910
I mean, well, you're going to have the sympathetic side.

1053
00:58:58,970 --> 00:59:00,530
You're going to have the side that's going to mock you.

1054
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:02,570
You're going to have the side that's going to be judgmental, right?

1055
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:03,570
Yeah, of course.

1056
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:04,810
Yeah, it's pretty obvious.

1057
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:06,130
Like, how do you know that Greek?

1058
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:09,010
It's like, oh my gosh, boy, have you never done any homework?

1059
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:11,790
Sometimes people, when I talk about law, these things,

1060
00:59:12,310 --> 00:59:13,270
it was, where'd you get that from?

1061
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:15,170
I'm like, oh my gosh, you know what you just said?

1062
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:16,770
Like, yeah, I just asked you where you got that from.

1063
00:59:16,830 --> 00:59:19,250
I said, no, let me translate that in English.

1064
00:59:19,710 --> 00:59:22,710
What you just said by asking that question means you've never done any homework.

1065
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:24,770
Right?

1066
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:29,450
What happens if you stand up in front of class and never done any homework?

1067
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:30,430
It's going to show, right?

1068
00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:32,490
Generally, that's what happens.

1069
00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:33,370
Right, yeah.

1070
00:59:34,810 --> 00:59:35,230
Yeah.
