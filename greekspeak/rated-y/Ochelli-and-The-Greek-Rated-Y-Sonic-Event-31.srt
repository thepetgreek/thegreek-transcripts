1
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,960
Sonic Event 31, Ocelli and the Greek rated Y.

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,280
Yeah, I'll announce that every time anyway.

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,140
Greek, interesting mood tonight.

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,480
I guess we should kick it off with pork.

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:19,560
Bacon.

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:20,200
Bacon.

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,220
Kevin Bacon.

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,080
Kevin Bacon.

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:22,820
Why not?

10
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,000
If you want to know what I'm thinking, listen to what I'm saying.

11
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,500
I said, Chuck, I stopped listening to you about 30 seconds ago.

12
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,240
Let's get, let's start recording, right?

13
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:37,680
So we started off talking about bacon and it was funny what you played, right?

14
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,520
Some cartoon thing.

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,680
But I retorted saying that the reason I've discovered what I've discovered is because

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,440
I stayed away from all the mainstream stuff.

17
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,980
If you showed me a picture of Kevin Bacon, I'd call him Tom Cruise.

18
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,520
All the white guys are Tom Cruise in Hollywood to me and all the black guys are Will Smith

19
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,220
or Eddie Murphy.

20
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,460
My wife, the wife always laughs about that, right?

21
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,760
I said, look, Tom Cruise is a new movie.

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,420
She looks like this.

23
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,280
That's not Tom Cruise.

24
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,300
That's so-and-so.

25
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,300
I'm like, yeah, it's a white actor.

26
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,000
It's Tom Cruise.

27
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,440
Black actors, Eddie Murphy or Will Smith.

28
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:10,560
That's how much I care about anything they put out for the no Wesley, no Wesley Snipes

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:10,920
in there.

30
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:11,560
No, no.

31
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,480
James Earl Jones.

32
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,960
I've heard of those guys.

33
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,880
I've heard of those guys.

34
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:18,980
When I was much younger, actually, I have a family that's in the film business pretty

35
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:19,400
high up.

36
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,040
There is about as high as you could go.

37
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:26,580
And I'm still not interested because I know I actually, uh, I played around with film.

38
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,980
I was a scout locator, you know, a long time ago and, uh, talking about, let's see, I'll

39
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,300
give you a, what, 1985.

40
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,040
How long ago is that?

41
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,360
Well, it's almost, uh, it's two, it's a two years shy of 40, right?

42
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,320
38 years ago.

43
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,860
So yeah, yeah.

44
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,600
It was funny story.

45
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,180
These guys, I was being a scout locator.

46
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:48,080
It was contracts for them, but they paid me a salary and they figured if I work real quick,

47
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,620
they'll pay me the salary or the wages and they'll keep the, they'll keep the, um, the

48
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,060
balance.

49
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:55,520
Okay.

50
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,820
It turned out it didn't take that.

51
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:57,920
It wasn't that quick.

52
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,880
And, uh, it took a long time and they ended up, you know, uh, getting upset that they

53
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,500
didn't make money over the money that they were supposed to give me, if that makes any

54
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,039
sense, right?

55
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,460
It's like a hundred bucks to Chuck.

56
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:14,180
Maybe I'll get him to do it for 70 and I'll keep the 30 and it works out that you need

57
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:14,740
120.

58
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:20,100
So anyway, yeah, I lose money on it because what I did is I, I basically, uh, put you

59
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,420
in the contract, hire you out for a certain amount and then it ends up costing me more

60
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,640
than what I actually collected on your behalf.

61
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,720
Yeah, I got you.

62
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,400
Right, right.

63
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,200
So in other words, when they got the contract amount, it was under, it was really, really

64
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,940
short and they didn't know it.

65
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,180
And I didn't know it was a con I say, if you guys told me it was a contract thing, I would

66
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,800
have kicked back 20, 10, 15% to you anyway, and would have done it for the contract without

67
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,480
keeping time.

68
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,360
But your lack of, uh, what would you call it?

69
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:56,360
Uh, when you're, when you have open rec or openness, uh, is what candor or transparency

70
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:01,380
or honesty or whatever, so that we're working together, but everyone's trying to subjugate

71
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,140
everyone else.

72
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:02,420
Right?

73
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,480
That's, you know what I've been saying?

74
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,080
Not everyone, but you know what they do is they, you're, the population is trained to

75
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,760
give 99% of their effort to the corporations and then stab each other in the back for the

76
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,900
remaining 1% where it could be the other way around.

77
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,640
Give 1% of the corporations, uh, and don't stab each other in the back.

78
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,060
99%.

79
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:22,720
It's interesting.

80
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:27,620
I recognized, uh, this week, actually, you know, in a personal situation that somebody

81
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,960
asked me why it is that people, you know, constantly try to push certain things out

82
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,180
of me.

83
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,040
I said, because I make the mistake of being too honest.

84
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:41,860
See, they expect me to be the one trying to, you know, by subterfuge con and extra something

85
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,800
or other out of them.

86
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,480
And I'm not, I just know this is what it is.

87
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,780
Like, okay, somebody comes to you and says, uh, look, um, I need a certain amount of money

88
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,420
to do something.

89
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,260
You agree to pay him.

90
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:52,540
Okay.

91
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,260
They come to you and they say, okay, you ready to do that?

92
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,820
And you say, look, I don't have the money right now.

93
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,520
They don't hear, I don't have the money right now.

94
00:03:59,600 --> 00:03:59,940
Literally.

95
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,700
They think he's holding back.

96
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,620
He has the money.

97
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,840
He just doesn't want to pay it right now.

98
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,860
Or he's trying to get, get it for less when literally I've actually communicated the honest

99
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,120
thing.

100
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,820
No, I just don't have it at this moment.

101
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,500
It's called mindset.

102
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,279
In other words, that person will do that no matter who they're talking to.

103
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,200
Not just, in other words, you know, you've heard the term, don't take it personal.

104
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:20,640
Yeah.

105
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,560
Well, but that's the thing is it's like the problem I'm having is that I honestly communicate

106
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:25,840
it.

107
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,500
See, I'm not going along with the way everybody else is doing business with them, but you can't

108
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,120
be honest.

109
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,860
In other words, it's in that other person's mindset.

110
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,020
There's no such thing.

111
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,840
It's my, this is the way I see the world and people.

112
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,660
And that's it.

113
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:43,380
There's no possibility that I just simply told the, well, come on, if we do this, if

114
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,380
that doesn't change what I just told you, I already told you, I didn't play a game

115
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:47,640
with you.

116
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:53,400
I told you up front, this is what is, you know, they're confused in games.

117
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,220
You've played poker.

118
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:54,920
Yeah.

119
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,520
Games.

120
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,520
You don't have to be honest because it's a game.

121
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:02,600
So I don't know, but that's anyway, let's when, no, but when you're honestly, okay.

122
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,000
When I honestly deal with some, it's like, listen, I told you what it was to begin with.

123
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:06,820
So that's what it is.

124
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,860
They, they, they so can't compute the idea that I've just honestly told them it isn't

125
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,380
here yet.

126
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,780
It can't be done yet.

127
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,840
They think that I'm somehow doing something else.

128
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,420
So therefore it just never gets to their mind that, Oh, he didn't just tell me that to save

129
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,440
us all time and energy and just to be straight with what's going on.

130
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,900
No, that's not even possible.

131
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:28,940
You know?

132
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,120
And it's like, uh, so this is the thing is like, I realized my mistake is that I didn't

133
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,640
do like everybody else does.

134
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,960
This is, this is why I'm not getting the proper communication from them because they're insisting

135
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,140
on something that can't be done.

136
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,200
You know, it's the weirdest thing.

137
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,840
Well, well, you want to talk about weird things?

138
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:47,560
Yeah, sure.

139
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,240
Yeah.

140
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:48,760
Pork.

141
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,780
We were talking, we brought that up.

142
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,320
I've said this many times.

143
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:59,160
If, if you're a pork eater, like a Jimmy Dean sausages, Italian sausages, stuff, 10% would

144
00:05:59,160 --> 00:05:59,880
no doubt.

145
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:00,940
No doubt.

146
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,760
I assure you.

147
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:05,100
I don't like to use the word guarantee because guarantee means you need to put up if it's

148
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:05,280
not.

149
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:05,800
So, right.

150
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:11,720
I assure you that five, two to 5% of all the pork you've ever eaten is, is, is human meat

151
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,140
in there.

152
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:12,420
Right?

153
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,000
Um, so anyway, that's, that's one.

154
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,520
And this has been known since ancient times and that practice has been done since ancient

155
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,380
times till now.

156
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,040
And you know what?

157
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:28,220
So now even more because it's very efficient years ago, if you wanted to process a human

158
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:33,840
being into a massive ground pork, you had to have people do it right now.

159
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,160
It could be fully automated, right?

160
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,940
So there's no witness other than the guy pushing the buttons and even then he could look away

161
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,700
for half an hour.

162
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:41,980
Right?

163
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,320
So yeah, it's pretty interesting.

164
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,660
Uh, well back then, if you go way back then, more things were automated.

165
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,740
You know, we were, I've been saying this since I was on with Seth Michael and revolution

166
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,640
radio in 2009, 2010.

167
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:01,540
Uh, if you dig down any major city in North America or North Africa under the Sahara,

168
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:07,000
I mean down more than 30 feet to 150 feet, you will find advanced civilizations.

169
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,660
As a matter of fact, they got this guy, Bob Lazar, right?

170
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,680
Area 51 guy.

171
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:12,300
Oh yeah.

172
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,220
Thousands of hours, hundreds of hours was taught.

173
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,400
But if you look at it very care, the part that I'm interested is where they find the

174
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:18,780
stuff.

175
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:19,640
Right?

176
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:24,400
And, and one, and one interview says, Oh, it's a, it was archeological dig.

177
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,560
They find the flying saucer, right?

178
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:28,840
Archeology, right?

179
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:28,960
Right.

180
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,900
And so anyway, um, yeah, pork, uh, don't do it.

181
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:38,260
Um, for many reasons, uh, the prionization, if you eat enough human and you're human,

182
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,000
you have problems.

183
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,060
If you eat enough cow and your cow, right?

184
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:42,800
The same cow.

185
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,020
Yeah.

186
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,520
Yeah.

187
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,140
Right.

188
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:44,560
Right.

189
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,220
Yeah, exactly.

190
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,760
Uh, so yeah.

191
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:51,800
And it's, then there's ethical and moral reasons, but we've always, I've talked about in the

192
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,700
past Sonics, the, the voice in the head, that's not you that keeps switching up as your consciousness,

193
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:03,260
let's say expands, um, that consciousness that's not you, that's you think is you, that

194
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:07,540
voice you hear in your head has a, it also lends you your morality.

195
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:11,360
In other words, you know, the cartoon where someone has the angel on one shoulder and

196
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,500
the devil on the other, right?

197
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,100
And one is that getting them on.

198
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,180
The other guy says, don't do it.

199
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:20,220
Well, that voice in your head does both that voice in your head tells you, Oh, go do that.

200
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,260
And that, and that same voice will say, but wait a second, you know, better.

201
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:27,960
So when you transcend that, when you go beyond that, you'll notice there is no right and

202
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,240
wrong.

203
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:34,620
It's what set of rules you agree to live by what covenant you live by.

204
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,860
There is no right and wrong.

205
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:37,940
And most of the time is nothing to do with it.

206
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:41,400
And most of the time when they show you that angel and that devil, the truth is, is that

207
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,520
the angel, the devil, or the same person, just one has horns.

208
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,480
One doesn't, you know, pretty much, right.

209
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,240
And that's it.

210
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:52,120
Uh, they're usually the same voice, even if they, uh, uh, anthropomorphize it using a

211
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,880
different individual.

212
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:53,300
Right.

213
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,020
Uh, you know, say they put you on, on my shoulder, uh, both as the angel and the devil, it'll

214
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,060
still be the same voice.

215
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,920
Just a, you know, that's my moral reasoning and the, and they have no more, they know,

216
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:10,600
but they see, they present this fiction known as a right and wrong or moral reasoning and

217
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,000
all that.

218
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,440
No, that, that only depends on what rules you go by.

219
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,480
You see that all the time on cop shows, you know, they do something unusual to a person

220
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,520
and they'll say, well, the law allows for us to do that.

221
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:19,720
Right.

222
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,260
We never heard of something so bizarre.

223
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:21,660
Right.

224
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,500
You see?

225
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:23,960
So, uh, yeah.

226
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,900
But, uh, the devils and all that, you know, a little spackle and paint makes a devil look

227
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,480
like a saint.

228
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:28,880
Right.

229
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:36,800
So anyway, the, the demon, a lot of the devils that you hear about through culture are actually

230
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,280
people that were demonized.

231
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,000
Right.

232
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,220
Right.

233
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,060
Yeah.

234
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,760
Or yeah, actually they were demonized.

235
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:41,920
Yeah.

236
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,240
Well, you know, look at history.

237
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:43,520
Right.

238
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,020
Yeah.

239
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,700
Most of the, it's all backwards.

240
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:53,960
So yeah, there's a stuff in the chat about, uh, lawfulness in terms of, uh, you know,

241
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,640
the covenant, let's say, uh, about mixed fibers.

242
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,440
That's real easy.

243
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:00,560
It states about, uh, don't put mixed fibers on your body.

244
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,320
It's not animal and vegetable.

245
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,560
Like, uh, if I see linen and cotton blend, I don't, I don't wear it.

246
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,740
And linen and cotton are both vegetable.

247
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,120
Right.

248
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:08,620
Okay.

249
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,500
Uh, right.

250
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,720
So, but, but you can have a one sewn onto the other.

251
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:19,220
I have a, a, a wool jacket that has a silk liner and the silk is a hundred percent silk

252
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,260
liner and a hundred percent wool coat.

253
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:26,600
And it does state, you can sew one fast and one onto the other, but don't weave them together.

254
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,240
Okay.

255
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,980
And it's not, it has nothing to do with animal or a vegetable.

256
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,620
It's interesting how people try to stretch these things out, like only wear natural fibers.

257
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,400
So well, wool is natural.

258
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,160
Cotton's natural.

259
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,300
So we'll cotton blend.

260
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:41,500
Right.

261
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:46,000
No, you know, you, you hear stuff like your food is your medicine and your medicine is

262
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,440
your food.

263
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,240
That's from the Bible.

264
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:47,500
Right?

265
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,340
No, it's not.

266
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,080
Right.

267
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,340
And you don't find stuff like that.

268
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,140
This is very, that's one of the things.

269
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:53,880
Here's the thing.

270
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,420
I live, I don't believe any of this.

271
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,480
I don't want to believe anything.

272
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,220
I decide, make a decision.

273
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:58,700
I make it.

274
00:10:59,100 --> 00:10:59,420
Okay.

275
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,920
You have choices.

276
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,860
You make a choice and then you decide on that choice, right?

277
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,220
And when you do it, it's all or nothing.

278
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,100
You can't cherry pick, right?

279
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:12,940
But you need to resolve before you make that decision on the choice.

280
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,740
Listen very carefully.

281
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,300
Now you have choices.

282
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,120
You make a choice and then you decide.

283
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,300
They ask you that all the time.

284
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,460
Have you decided it?

285
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,080
You read an order?

286
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,080
Have you decided yet?

287
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,920
You got all the choices, right?

288
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,180
I made my choice.

289
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,500
I want the tuna fish, but I want it on, I don't want it on a sourdough.

290
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,540
I want it on rye.

291
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,020
All right.

292
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,560
You see, that's the decision, right?

293
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:34,920
Okay.

294
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,580
So you see the fine points here?

295
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,840
And before you make the decision, you have to see, are you going to accept it or not?

296
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,900
Like in marriage, for better or for worse, right?

297
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,060
That says there's no divorce, right?

298
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:46,380
Yeah.

299
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,020
Well, you've already accepted that you're going to eat here.

300
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,200
You're going to eat at this place.

301
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,800
You're going to eat food from this place.

302
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,400
A whole bunch of things have already been decided, right?

303
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,500
Now you get into the-

304
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:56,960
About marriage?

305
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,080
That could get real lascivious on that.

306
00:11:59,100 --> 00:11:59,780
Well, no.

307
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,780
I wasn't going to the marriage.

308
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,720
I was back to the restaurant, but that's fine.

309
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,140
That's not eating at the place.

310
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:03,300
Okay.

311
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,360
So here's the thing.

312
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,820
I know this is never put out that way.

313
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,540
You have choices.

314
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,300
You make the choice.

315
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,820
And within that choice that you made, you decide whether it's really the decision part

316
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,520
is the committal.

317
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,640
And when you say something like, you know, when you, I give the sandwich board a lot,

318
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,200
you know, because you have choice, you know, unless you go to like a nice European place

319
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,300
that's price fix, then you could either have it or not be, right?

320
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:30,980
Okay.

321
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:35,200
You know, your price fix menu is one, you know, this is the appetizer.

322
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:35,780
This is the entree.

323
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,240
This is dessert.

324
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:36,640
That's it.

325
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,780
Well, I don't want the appetizer.

326
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,140
That's it.

327
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,280
That's your only decision you can make.

328
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,720
You can't get another appetizer, right?

329
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,980
So that's a good example for there is no option for cherry picking.

330
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,700
But what I find with ancient Ritz, especially the Bible, people like the cherry pick a lot.

331
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,340
I'm going to do this, but I'm not going to do that.

332
00:12:54,700 --> 00:13:00,640
Or this could mean that, you know, there was a, a very, what do you call it?

333
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:06,620
Reformist synagogue in the Bronx back in the sixties and the rabbi, you know, when they,

334
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:11,200
when religion seemed dogmatic and orthodox, they have reformists to make it more liberal.

335
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:11,980
Let's say, right.

336
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:12,380
Right.

337
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,240
And, and liberal, by the way, used to mean a good thing, by the way, you know, used to

338
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,080
be stuff, of course, is called liberal arts within the person who was a liberal arts major

339
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,460
or whatever.

340
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,960
It was very well versed in many different fields, you know, now it means something else.

341
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:31,640
But anyway, there was a liberal reformist synagogue in the Bronx and he basically said,

342
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,800
well, Torah says you shouldn't eat pork, but what it means is in certain restaurants.

343
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:37,840
Okay.

344
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,620
I don't know where that came in, but okay.

345
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:40,760
Yeah.

346
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,220
Well, I don't know where a lot of this stuff comes in that people bring up in scripture,

347
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:44,660
right?

348
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,520
Crucifixion is another one, right?

349
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,760
Well, that one's easy.

350
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,240
That one's easy to fall into that trap.

351
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,000
You know, a trap means you don't know better.

352
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,280
Right.

353
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,940
Because if you know avoidance of a trap is knowledge of its existence.

354
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,820
Once you know there's a trap there, there's no longer a trap.

355
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,720
Now, if you fall into it, now it's a tragedy.

356
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:01,720
Right.

357
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,140
So you mean you willingly went into, it's no longer a trap.

358
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:12,440
So so what I mean by this is the reason I've been speaking on these things for decades

359
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,460
now, it's not to make people believe, as a matter of fact, that's how people stay away

360
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:16,800
from it.

361
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,480
Because why?

362
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,620
You're not going to understand anything in it, because you need to have a high level

363
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,340
of comprehension.

364
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,820
And that's gone for most people.

365
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,740
Gone like gone.

366
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:31,700
And those that want to get interested in whatever they're going to read that's ancient or old,

367
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,700
they have to gain comprehension, general comprehension first, and then go back into it.

368
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:40,620
But the crucifixion part is really easy trap to fall into because they actually state it

369
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,240
in all the things.

370
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,080
Crucifixion, they actually write it in the version, the King James or whatever, right?

371
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,840
You see what I'm saying?

372
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:52,660
So and, and even the Greek, you know, these things don't mean any, they've actually, it's

373
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,960
called adulteration when you put something in, it shouldn't be there, right, right.

374
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:01,380
You can adulterate directly by putting in something, redacting something, taking out

375
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:06,920
something or putting in something that is a vague term that could be taken different

376
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,420
ways.

377
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:12,300
You know, so, so all of these things are quite simple.

378
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:16,440
And I've been coming out and speaking on law, legal matters, code statutes, a lot of people

379
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,100
like, um, you know, with law and stuff like that, you know, Oh, that's codes and their

380
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,120
policy and force.

381
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:22,540
That's okay.

382
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,340
You should know that too.

383
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:27,660
Because if you look at the definitions for all the codes and statutes and municipalities

384
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,880
or whatever have, those are good because they, if you look at the definitions, it only applies

385
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,380
if you're an employee, right.

386
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,920
Or a resident, right.

387
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,620
That's another big thing.

388
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,620
They make you a resident.

389
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:43,800
And the reason why, you know, you can only be a resident in a, in a hotel, a jail hospital,

390
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:44,500
right.

391
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,080
Okay.

392
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,940
And if you ask people, are you resident and they're like, yeah, well, where do you inhabit?

393
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:49,620
Where do you live?

394
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,280
Well, what do you mean?

395
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:50,820
I'm here.

396
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:51,360
Okay.

397
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,340
So if you're parked your ass here as a resident, guess what?

398
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,160
You go in the constitution, there's something called the vagabonds.

399
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,960
You can look it up, look up where the word vagabond is in the U S constitution and how

400
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,780
are they to be treated?

401
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:06,340
Right.

402
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,960
That's all I'm going to say on that, you know?

403
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:14,600
So, uh, so it's kind of like 14th, 14th amendment, there's no slavery unless you're convicted

404
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,280
of a crime and that scumbag Scalia that they strangled at that ranch, molesting children.

405
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:19,540
Right.

406
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:19,880
Yeah.

407
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,980
I wasn't there and I didn't see it.

408
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,400
But look, if you say that you're pretty much on the money, right.

409
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:30,460
Well whatever, uh, you know, he said the constitution doesn't say lawfully or rightfully convicted,

410
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,120
just convicted.

411
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,880
So you could, the constitution allows room to be falsely convicted.

412
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:42,660
It's not, if you're truly lawfully convicted, it's that you're convicted, you see, isn't

413
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,280
that interesting?

414
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:43,720
Right.

415
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,560
So, uh, yeah.

416
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,000
So I, it's good to get into all this stuff.

417
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:54,180
Uh, uh, you know, one, one guy, an attorney once says, are you a constitutionalist?

418
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:59,940
I know that document that's written by a bunch of saboteurs, uh, they wanted to commit Regicide.

419
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,780
Regicide means kill the King, right?

420
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:10,540
And uh, and cause King George did the King George proclamation around the 17 seventies

421
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,599
and the proclamation.

422
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,700
You can look this up.

423
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,339
You said, uh, to the colonies, uh, you're to leave all indigenous lands and indigenous

424
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:18,160
people alone.

425
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,220
I want to preserve them.

426
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,760
Oh shit.

427
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:21,700
Right.

428
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,400
That's like tailing the pelting at Pentagon.

429
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:25,300
You got to leave.

430
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,420
Uh, imagine a president, imagine Kennedy tells the Pentagon, you got to leave everything

431
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,560
in the Middle East alone.

432
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:31,300
Yeah.

433
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:31,640
Right.

434
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:32,500
Right.

435
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:33,360
You see?

436
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:38,320
That's why we'll never know why he, why they took him out.

437
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:38,600
Right.

438
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,000
Uh, you see, he could have said that that's enough to take them out.

439
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,280
Right.

440
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:46,500
We don't have anything in writing, but you see what I mean to the point?

441
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,260
It's just open.

442
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:52,080
So, but this is in writing what I'm saying, you can look up the proclamation of whatever

443
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,920
17 whatever.

444
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:58,820
So, you know, these saboteurs, uh, George was, someone sent me a, an email, uh, a very

445
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:03,120
well-respected listener, a subscriber also that frequently mails me.

446
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,560
I let him know.

447
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:09,460
I enjoy listening to his, uh, reading his messages, uh, about, uh, military handbook

448
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:12,460
defense, uh, where forest fires in the U S will be used as a weapon.

449
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:17,600
And I said, well, George Washington was known as the village burner, right?

450
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:21,480
If you didn't like you, you know, the whiskey rebellion was bullshit by the way.

451
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:27,080
You know, uh, the whiskey rebellion was about people that were promised a salary for fighting

452
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:27,680
in the revolution.

453
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,360
Never got it.

454
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,500
So let's accuse them of something else and go kill them for it.

455
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:32,800
Right.

456
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,240
There was a whole tobacco war too, uh, that went on, uh, same, same kind of thing where

457
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,180
they were okay.

458
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,900
Well, we'll, we'll, we'll work for you.

459
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,580
We'll cut down, you know, they will do all this work and harvest the tobacco and all

460
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:44,820
that.

461
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,240
And then when it came time to pay them, they stiffed them.

462
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:51,680
And uh, then when that happened, they turned around and said, well, they're actually committing

463
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,200
sedition against the state.

464
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,020
And uh, then they just burned down their, uh, their, their farms and everything.

465
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:57,260
Yeah.

466
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:57,780
Right.

467
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:02,680
And the masses go along with that because they unquestionably would go, you know, go

468
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:07,240
along with what the state or the authorities tell them where in actual actuality, they're

469
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,300
supposed to be participatory, uh, and they're not.

470
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:15,000
And if you try to be participatory, go down to a courtroom down here and say, I need the

471
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,320
courtroom.

472
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,980
I'm going to be, you can't do that.

473
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:22,220
You know, you can't say you can't, this is a private building, but you can look into

474
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:26,620
all the different stuff they did with the people with tobacco in Virginia and, uh, and

475
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,480
also in Kentucky.

476
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:32,380
Uh, exactly what I'm talking about here is that they just, when it came time to pay and

477
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,080
they just didn't and, and you know, okay, well they were criminals.

478
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:41,520
So we had to, uh, take out their farms and they ended up, uh, not sure how they have

479
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,160
something called letter of Mark.

480
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,780
A lot of people pronounce it Marquis, uh, it's great.

481
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:52,700
And that means that, uh, if I don't like you, I could just, uh, go into seizure, you know,

482
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,460
seize your stuff.

483
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:58,620
And as long as I divide it, see in a letter of Mark, uh, you can go and take someone's

484
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,800
stuff, but you can't take the, when you take someone's stuff, you can't keep all of it.

485
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,400
You have to divide it amongst the authorities and then it's okay.

486
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:11,280
By the way, if you read what the letter of Mark allows you to do, a bounty hunters used

487
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,000
to have one, but you can't have a lawful bounty hunter anymore because you know, you're under

488
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,840
a legal system, but they, a letter of Mark doesn't work anymore.

489
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,120
Seals don't work anymore.

490
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:25,340
You know, if you have a seal for your family or whatever, they'll say, Oh, uh, that's a

491
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:25,980
notary seal.

492
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:29,280
You're impostering a notary, you know, cause everything is, yeah.

493
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:35,880
So in essence, uh, in the chat, what I did promise someone, I was going to speak about

494
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:42,540
a yin and yang a little bit more, well, that's a, that's an Asian term and I don't like it

495
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:46,200
because it's an Asian term, but not that I don't like Asian stuff is we should have a

496
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:46,960
Western equivalent.

497
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:47,700
We don't.

498
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:51,040
Well, and everybody equates it to that, that, that black and white symbol, right?

499
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:56,900
You know, which is kind of the equal, yeah, it should be instead of black and white, you

500
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,300
know, they say nothing's black and white.

501
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,680
It should be multicolored.

502
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:04,340
You should have a, the color wheel divided because certain colors are yin, certain colors

503
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:04,700
are yang.

504
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:09,680
Just like I showed, you could keep the bugs away from your nightlights by painting a blue

505
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,260
stripe.

506
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:14,420
Well, could you divide that along the lines of a, what they say are hot and cold colors

507
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,120
pretty much?

508
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,180
I mean, exactly.

509
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:16,740
Yeah.

510
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:20,380
The cold colors would be young and the hot colors would be yin.

511
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:20,900
Okay.

512
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:27,540
But, but, but, but hot is young and yin is cold.

513
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,620
Oh my gosh.

514
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,480
Isn't that confusing?

515
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,120
It is a little bit, but the cold, they shouldn't be.

516
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:39,960
So when something is something like yin and it becomes extremely yin where it can't get

517
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,420
any more yin, it flips and becomes its opposite.

518
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:50,320
When something is young and gets extremely young, it flips and becomes yin.

519
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,140
Perfect example is making a magnet.

520
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,880
Now, I don't know if you ever see a go on YouTube university.

521
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,300
They have a, how do you make a magnet?

522
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:00,640
Basically an iron slug with a coil of a thousand amps, three volts.

523
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,640
And if you overcharge it, what happens?

524
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,680
Boom, it explodes.

525
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,160
Right, right.

526
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:16,480
So, uh, uh, the core of a nuclear device is another example because so tight, the detonation,

527
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,680
it's either the rifle detonation, the barrel or the old style uranium, which is atomic,

528
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,260
not nuclear.

529
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:28,360
Uh, and then the nuclear, which is based on implosion to concentric spheres with a beryllium

530
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:28,620
mirror.

531
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,160
Ooh, I'm not supposed to talk about that.

532
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,460
Um, anyway, uh, that implodes, right?

533
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:40,360
An implosion pushes, makes something so young when you get to a point and then it becomes

534
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:40,860
yin and explode.

535
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,340
Grenade.

536
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,480
Grenade is very young.

537
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,120
It's very heavy.

538
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:43,740
Right.

539
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,660
It's very dense.

540
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,720
And when you pull that pin, the gases react.

541
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,340
It makes it even more dense and more dense and then can't take any more density.

542
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,120
Guess what happens?

543
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,560
Well, it's a grenade.

544
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,020
Right.

545
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:53,440
Boom.

546
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,280
Interesting.

547
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:54,640
Yeah.

548
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,060
Okay.

549
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,580
Same thing with people.

550
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:04,280
Uh, but here's the thing, the yin and yang is, is an easy, it's just a tool.

551
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,120
They're words we use in language, right?

552
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,560
I don't like that.

553
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:12,280
It's Asian centric and to a Western audience, but we'll work it this way.

554
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:13,960
Let's define it.

555
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,880
Let's work with it anyway.

556
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,600
It's what we've got.

557
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:15,860
Right?

558
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,020
What?

559
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,540
First of all, there's nothing online and there are very few books you can get on, on

560
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,260
what I'm going to give out right now.

561
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:27,240
And this is through many years of discussion, which people I looked up to and contemplation

562
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,380
and looking at old, old methodologies, Taoist methodologies, right?

563
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:39,860
So, um, the, the thing about, um, the yin and yang, when you look up, uh, anything like

564
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,120
that online, they're going to give you a list, a chart.

565
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:42,960
These things are yin.

566
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,780
These things are yang.

567
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,580
And that's how people, you know, move forward on it.

568
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:49,420
And many things are in oversimplified and dumbed down like that.

569
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,760
Are those things incorrect?

570
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,160
No.

571
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:56,840
But if you dumb something down so much and that's all you offer and you try to apply

572
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,180
it and it doesn't work, you could say it's incorrect because it's not working.

573
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,060
You know, if it's a functional thing, right?

574
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:06,660
So, so what I'm trying to say here is this, let's start all over.

575
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:10,280
So yin, when people, you talk about like, uh, you know, they'll, they'll give you a

576
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:10,440
list.

577
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,240
These are yin foods.

578
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,140
These are yang foods.

579
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:12,560
Okay.

580
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,340
The human body, anything that's alive is yin.

581
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,560
It requires yin.

582
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:22,380
So all the food you eat is yin, right?

583
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,900
Life force giving everything you eat.

584
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,680
Now, if you eat a rock, right?

585
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,820
The ability to get induction to transmute that rock and digest it is very rare, if not

586
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:33,340
impossible.

587
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,720
It is very young, right?

588
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,080
But it's not food.

589
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:41,540
So all food, anything that's considered food is yin.

590
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:46,380
Now all food, if all food is yin, then how come there are yang foods?

591
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:46,760
Okay.

592
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,400
Anything the body takes in for nutrition is yin.

593
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:56,560
And within that category of everything you take in, those can be divided as more yin

594
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,380
and more yang.

595
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,100
You see?

596
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:58,420
Okay.

597
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,260
Now, where does the yang come in?

598
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:06,420
If all the, if everything in the body is yin nourishing that you take in, including the

599
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:09,520
air and the water, where does the yang come in?

600
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:15,340
Well, when the body, when a living being, whether it's a bacteria, a plant, a human,

601
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:22,240
a whale, a cockroach, bird, once it's nourished with all that yin, some of the yin is dedicated

602
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,680
to become yang as a protective element.

603
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,920
And so the yang protects the yin, the life.

604
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:35,820
What I just gave you, you will not find on the internet anywhere or in books printed

605
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,380
that simple.

606
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:41,400
So this is actually, we make a good transcript, by the way, and someone post it to a degree.

607
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,700
This is critical.

608
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,780
This is very serious stuff, by the way.

609
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:47,720
Okay.

610
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:54,040
So what do I mean by some of it breaks off and becomes yang and to protect the yin?

611
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:59,420
You know, when you eat that nutrition, the quality of nutrition regenerates your skin

612
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,600
over time, regenerates your bones over time, right?

613
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:04,860
You've had, you've heard of diseases where people have deficiency in their diet and their

614
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:08,620
skin goes bad or their bones go bad, scurvy, crickets and things like that.

615
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:08,820
Right?

616
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,200
Okay.

617
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:16,180
So when you have a good diet or the yin that you take in as a balance of yin and yang within

618
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:20,720
that yin, the yang manifestation are the protective elements of the body.

619
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:25,840
So the protective elements of the body is the ability for the body to regenerate skin, right?

620
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:29,460
Bones, you know, they say, well, the milk commercials help to build healthy muscles and

621
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,320
healthy bones, right?

622
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:35,140
Yeah, well, they tell you that these different types of food will build different parts of

623
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:35,800
the body, right?

624
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,140
Exactly.

625
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,620
That's the yang component.

626
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,140
Okay.

627
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,000
Of the foods that you've already subdivided as yin and yang.

628
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:46,480
So this is going to take a little thinking about, but also energy.

629
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:51,820
If you eat food that zaps your energy and you've got to sleep and you have no energy because

630
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,280
you're eating 14 snicker bars a day, right?

631
00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:01,100
How much yang protective elements does the snicker bar develop for your body?

632
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:01,560
Nothing.

633
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,860
Very little, right?

634
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:07,780
Some, but not enough, enough to keep you alive, to contain that life force.

635
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:11,380
Because when all the young leaves, the life force leaves the body.

636
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:15,940
Just like in a cartoon, when someone dies and you see the spirit leave the body, you

637
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,120
know, like Casper, the ghost or something.

638
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,140
Yeah.

639
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,220
That means there's no more young to hold it in.

640
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:25,420
So when you're talking about a living being, whether it's a plant, a whale, a roach, a

641
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:30,180
human, a bird, whatever, everything that it takes to nourish, including for its soul,

642
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:36,520
including water and air is yin to support the yin, the life force.

643
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:44,220
And the product, how that being uses what it takes in, a certain amount of it is dedicated

644
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:50,260
to become yang, to protect, to create the actual, to facilitate the container, right?

645
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,920
The container that holds you is yang.

646
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:57,020
So for example, like when I go to places like Houston or the rainy season here in Tucson,

647
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:02,340
I don't get bit by mosquitoes, very rare, because I have thick skin, ha ha ha, right?

648
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,240
You have to, if you talk, speak this way.

649
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:04,820
Of course.

650
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,360
Yeah, you do.

651
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,880
And thick blood.

652
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:13,360
So if someone eats a lot of things that thin out their blood too much and thin skin, the

653
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,300
mosquitoes know that, they can see that.

654
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:19,680
They go to that person and the person's like, oh, mosquito, oh, it's bad, you know, it's

655
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,080
biting me.

656
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,220
No, mosquito senses.

657
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:26,200
It won't go to the one that has a thick skin because if it goes to the guy or the woman

658
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,660
that has the thick skin and the thick blood, it tries to put that needle, you know, that

659
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,960
stamen thing into your skin.

660
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,300
Right.

661
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,500
And it'll, it'll break.

662
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,300
It'll break off.

663
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,140
And the mosquito will die.

664
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:44,400
Well, so mosquitoes are attracted to the thin blood and thin skin because it's easier to

665
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:44,960
get nourishment.

666
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,160
Well, yeah.

667
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:46,740
Think about it.

668
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:53,060
Think if you have a tool that you use and you know that if you're, you're very well

669
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:56,660
familiar with the use of the tool and the methods of using it and you're very well skilled

670
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:00,560
in it, you know that if you do this with this tool, you'll break the tool, right?

671
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,260
Yeah, of course.

672
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,160
It could be any tool.

673
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,300
For instance, a drill.

674
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,180
I got, I got a couple of drill bits.

675
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,620
I know they go just fine through wood, through sheet rock.

676
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,180
No problem.

677
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:12,140
But if I decide I need to drill a hole in cement, I'm not using that because I'm going

678
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:12,260
to break it.

679
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,480
Yeah, you don't even have to try.

680
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,400
I already know.

681
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,580
It's going to, you know, no good.

682
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,900
You know, even intuitively, even if you weren't told or even if you didn't do it.

683
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,240
Mosquitoes are not that dumb, right?

684
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:29,360
So, uh, so, okay, I just, this is a side note, but so the, the ability, so does the mosquito,

685
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,640
it sees the, how much yang you have, right?

686
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,420
Even though you're yin, right?

687
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:35,760
You see?

688
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,920
Couldn't have, so if you have enough yang to protect you, right, to protect the yin,

689
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,720
it won't come if it sees the yang, right?

690
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,660
So this is where the yin and yang is energetic.

691
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:46,440
Okay.

692
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,420
Let's go back to the food.

693
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:52,220
People who have various things, now here, here's the thing.

694
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:57,000
Anyone who was lived near a Chinatown, they, uh, they have these apothecaries, right?

695
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:01,580
All these herbs and you walk into all these jars and before you buy anything, they have

696
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,560
a doctor in the back or someone who diagnosed you.

697
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,020
They look at your palm, they look at your eyes, they ask you your date of birth and whatever.

698
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:11,200
They ask you how active you are sexually or do you sleep and all this.

699
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:15,060
They could put the puzzle together and then they write a prescription, you know, these

700
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:19,000
roots, this here, this, that hopefully, you know, it's nothing too unlawful, right?

701
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,560
And they do that.

702
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:28,220
Now, why don't they have a, a one pill fits all people for people, but it doesn't work

703
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:28,660
that way.

704
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,040
Cause everybody's a little different.

705
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,780
Everybody's in a slightly different condition.

706
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:37,060
So that's, that's the, that's how, you know, right away, the vaccines are a scam because

707
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:45,320
in their own paperwork, it says that a blood type, body weight, age, and race are a factor

708
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:49,400
when you inject someone with something that's supposed to do with that, right?

709
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,340
So that's why people, you know, I think I've mentioned before, you know, someone was being

710
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:57,440
made fun of when he was telling the nurses, they're giving vaccines that aren't tested.

711
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:00,580
They all, all the nurses laughed at him, but I said, are you taking consideration, you

712
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:03,880
know, things I just mentioned, then they packed up and left, right?

713
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:09,280
So anyway, uh, in a real world, those people will be taken the back of the building and

714
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,520
shot by the way, in a real world.

715
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,560
So we know it's a fake world, so they just keep doing what they're doing.

716
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:16,960
Um, okay.

717
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:24,600
So when someone says they can't sleep or this or that, I don't, I can give you the generalization

718
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:30,420
and then you self-diagnose, which is the best thing that goes back to learning how to fish

719
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,660
instead of asking for fish, right?

720
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:39,460
So what I'm trying to say here, emphatically, emphatically, indubitably, right?

721
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,000
Is that everyone is, is very different.

722
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,320
In other words, you can have four people with headaches, uh, at midnight and there's four

723
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,040
different solutions, completely different, right?

724
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:51,740
There's no pill.

725
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:56,780
Now the suppression, we know the allopathic medicine, by the way, uh, there's still a

726
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:58,360
confusion about Western medicine.

727
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,240
It's allopathic.

728
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,960
They're only supposed to treat the symptoms.

729
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,100
It's a treatment, no cures that are allowed, right?

730
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,260
So that, you know, you're, cause they're, you're at war.

731
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:09,220
They've been at war with humanity for a long time and people don't take the hints.

732
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:18,520
So, all right now, um, very simple when, uh, even from doing weather work, if you look

733
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:23,340
at the atmosphere, when the sun starts approaching over the earth, the atmosphere expands like

734
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,000
a balloon, right?

735
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:29,460
It goes up, literally, um, uh, expands physically.

736
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,060
It's measurable.

737
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:38,440
And, but etherically, etherically and energetically, uh, also, and that is a young quality of reaching

738
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,160
up, right?

739
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:44,400
This is where it gets confusing when you start looking at foods, by the way, because certain

740
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:49,800
plants, for example, like sugar cane or corn that are taller than wheat and other things,

741
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,180
they're considered yin because they rise up, right?

742
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,400
So that's another discussion.

743
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,900
Maybe we'll try to tag it on here.

744
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:01,360
So people maybe after listening to this can do some diagnosis on their own.

745
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,100
All right.

746
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,560
So when the sun goes down, it contracts, right?

747
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:10,100
And, uh, the atmosphere comes down on the earth.

748
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,260
By the way, for weather work, that's how you make hurricanes.

749
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,740
You know, those currents go from west to east.

750
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,880
So I'm in, let's say the American Southwest.

751
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:24,600
So I know that, um, when it's afternoon for me, east of me, even when, as the clock says,

752
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,100
I think we're three hours apart, right?

753
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:26,400
Right.

754
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,100
Three hours apart.

755
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:27,800
Okay.

756
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,820
It's already sundown over there when it's late afternoon for me.

757
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,760
I know what I did three hours ago here.

758
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:39,620
If the atmosphere is like a rubber membrane, if I push my finger, you could see my finger

759
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,160
coming through the rubber, pushing up.

760
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,740
I can do that ethereally.

761
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:49,620
And naturally when you, uh, elongate something elastic and you let go, what happens?

762
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,380
It snaps back.

763
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:50,640
Right?

764
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:50,960
Right.

765
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:51,740
Okay.

766
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:59,560
So what I do is, uh, I push up into the, uh, when it's, um, when it afternoon here, I push

767
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,120
up vertically.

768
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:05,420
And as it goes towards the east, um, it's going to want to shoot down a snap back down,

769
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:10,800
but it's naturally going to want to snap back down more gradually because it's getting nighttime.

770
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,580
It's contracting.

771
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,940
So it's going to have the nighttime contraction, uh, and the elasticity contraction that I

772
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,280
created.

773
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,020
And you get a, um, tornado.

774
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:19,440
Sorry.

775
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,040
I said hurricane.

776
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,719
The hurricanes are made the same way.

777
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:24,820
So you could really inflict bad weather downstream by doing that.

778
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:29,080
What I just mentioned, uh, using a simple tube and things like that.

779
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,679
This is a weather engineering.

780
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:35,840
Um, I think you've witnessed that in real time with Danny once when he asked me to stop

781
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:40,199
the rains in Washington because his brother was visiting about eight years ago and he

782
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:40,840
came back and says, thanks.

783
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,320
It was no rain.

784
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,260
It was any rain or forecast.

785
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:42,500
Yeah.

786
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,420
It was all written in the forecast.

787
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,060
It was no rain.

788
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:47,080
And when he came, so that I said, don't ask me again.

789
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,719
Cause that took like 20 hours worth of work, right?

790
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,400
It's a lot of work.

791
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,320
You have to monitor it.

792
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:56,280
When I was doing hurricane stuff on the roof, I had to get food and drink brought to me.

793
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,920
Well, you know, so cause you really, that's how delicate the device is, right?

794
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:02,180
You have to constantly be working on it, I guess.

795
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:02,500
Okay.

796
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,540
You got to stay on it.

797
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:03,700
Yeah.

798
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:08,040
Think about like someone in a B29 machine gun turret, you know, they show the guy sitting

799
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,040
in the back, you know, he's freezing his off, right?

800
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:13,620
You got to bring them, bring them a cup of coffee or something, you know, right, right.

801
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,360
Can't get up from his post.

802
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:16,960
Uh, yeah.

803
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,200
So anyway, back to the, uh, elasticity and all that.

804
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,860
So when the atmosphere is contracting at night, right.

805
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:28,840
It's yin, but it's contracting, but it becomes more yin, right?

806
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,600
And yang when it raises.

807
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:37,640
So when someone says they can't sleep, that is the environment around them is contracting.

808
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:38,840
All right.

809
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,300
And contraction normally means yang, but it's actually creating a yin condition.

810
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:48,900
So everything is contracting, uh, coming down and you can't sleep because somehow your body

811
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,940
cannot be aligned with that energy.

812
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,100
Right?

813
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:52,520
Right.

814
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,060
Right.

815
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:56,780
So what I mean by being aligned with that energy, let's take it from an emo side.

816
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,640
Imagine going to a place where it's really quiet and you come in and you're all high

817
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,900
energy and all hyped up.

818
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:01,220
Right.

819
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:01,960
Right.

820
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:05,260
Even if you're not saying anything, everybody looks at you, they turn around cause they're

821
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:08,860
all relaxed and chilled and they look at you and they're like, wow, this person's all hyped

822
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,080
up.

823
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,000
Even though you haven't said anything.

824
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,020
They could tell from your energy.

825
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:11,380
Right.

826
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:11,680
Right.

827
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:12,480
Yeah.

828
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,320
Disruptive.

829
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:14,260
Yeah.

830
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:14,860
It's disruptive.

831
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,740
Even if you haven't, you know, no matter how quiet you try to be, they feel that, you know,

832
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,540
it's a, it's okay.

833
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,800
That's the energetic part.

834
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:25,040
So somehow, uh, you know, nighttime comes down, you can't sleep.

835
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:30,000
It's because you have too much energy going up, but that's young considered young, but

836
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,480
it's actually contrary to the yin condition that's being created by the contraction.

837
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:38,540
That's why it's so simple to take a sedative, right?

838
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,060
To make you go to sleep.

839
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:48,460
But what's happening here is, uh, as the atmosphere contracts your body, whatever you were eating

840
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:51,540
or during, during the day should be in sync with that.

841
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:56,620
So as you get to the point where you want to sleep, you're winding down naturally with

842
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:56,800
it.

843
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,820
You're in sync with it like a dance.

844
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:04,620
So when you can't sleep at night, it means that you're out of sync with the environmental

845
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:05,520
conditions.

846
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:06,600
Right.

847
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,020
Now, the simplest way to do it is like, well, I can't sleep, but why don't you take this

848
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:10,280
pill?

849
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,380
This, uh, they have stuff to make you sleep, right?

850
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:12,760
Yeah.

851
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:13,580
Right.

852
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,920
Or a tea, a certain teas.

853
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:26,520
Uh, uh, we make, um, uh, lemon balm, chamomile and mint, uh, lavender, uh, lavender.

854
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,600
Is it lavender?

855
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:27,920
Yeah.

856
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:28,400
Lavender.

857
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,520
Lavender.

858
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,560
You're sure about that?

859
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:31,800
Yeah.

860
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,240
Lavender.

861
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:32,460
Yeah.

862
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,060
I have lavender.

863
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,500
I've cooked a little lavender.

864
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:40,860
Often people, uh, you ever heard of herbs, the herb, the Provence, they put it, they,

865
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:41,880
it's a good dry rub.

866
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:46,540
When people do a roast, uh, whatever, the secret ingredient is lavender in there.

867
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,700
Like, oh, I love herbs to provide.

868
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,460
I use, I use it very often.

869
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:53,680
The lavender plants are wonderful, beautiful, uh, blossoms and it smells wonderful.

870
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,460
Lavender is very common scent.

871
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:55,900
Yeah.

872
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,940
No, I wasn't aware of it using it that way though.

873
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,580
I was more aware of it like, oh, for eating, yeah, as a scent, as, as in cosmetics, right?

874
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:02,780
Right.

875
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,560
And cosmetic stuff.

876
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:03,800
Right.

877
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:04,200
Yeah.

878
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:04,740
No, it's edible.

879
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,120
Yeah.

880
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,560
It's, it's in the sage family.

881
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,520
It's like a sage.

882
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,140
Uh, uh, yeah.

883
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:17,200
So, uh, lavender lemon balm, which looks like a nice triangular leaf, looks like a mint leaf,

884
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,140
but it's like lemon.

885
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,340
It tastes like lemon.

886
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:20,940
Uh, chamomile.

887
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,920
That's what when you say I'm having tea, I'm like, this doesn't make any sense.

888
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:28,540
It's not like when people say tea, it's not like coffee because when you say coffee, it's

889
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:28,900
a bean.

890
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,320
It's a very specific, you know, then you have varieties of growth, but when you say tea,

891
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,300
anything can be a tea.

892
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,100
I have compost tea outside, you know, when you compost and the water runs out, right?

893
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:37,920
They call that a tea.

894
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:42,240
So a tea is anything that's steeped in water, boiled.

895
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,000
That's why I've asked you, I wasn't giving you a hard time.

896
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,400
I said, is it a leaf tea, a twig tea or root tea?

897
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,460
Well, you can make, you can make a mushroom tea also.

898
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:50,440
A mushroom.

899
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:50,900
There you go.

900
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:51,220
Yeah.

901
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,840
Anything in water, right?

902
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,400
Pretty much.

903
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:54,300
Sun tea.

904
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,480
You don't, you don't leave it in the sun.

905
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:55,620
Right.

906
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,440
You've heard of that stuff too.

907
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:56,920
Cold brew.

908
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:57,920
No, I've done that.

909
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,200
I do that a couple of times a year.

910
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,380
I make a few gallons of that.

911
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:01,540
Yeah.

912
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,100
Yeah.

913
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:02,720
But with what?

914
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:02,980
Right.

915
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,540
So you can do pine needles, right?

916
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:11,500
Which have an incredible astringent value to it that lasts, you know, if you do a pine

917
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,740
needle tea, it lasts about two weeks in the body.

918
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:16,980
You know how they say the cannabis THC is like 30 days or something.

919
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:23,740
Pine needles are two weeks, especially if you do it during the moon phases and it's

920
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,640
astringent quality anyway.

921
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:25,740
Okay.

922
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:36,200
So I would suggest that the main thing, okay, let's, without repeating why you can't sleep

923
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,560
because you're out of the natural order, you should be winding down as the environment

924
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,500
is winding down.

925
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:40,740
Right.

926
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:45,180
And you could supplement that, but people, you know, why should you be dependent?

927
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:45,520
Right.

928
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,780
Now the opposite is true as well.

929
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:52,840
What if the sun is coming up and it's expanding, but you still want to remain sleeping?

930
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,620
That means you're out of touch with the natural order.

931
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,500
Everything's expanding.

932
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,960
You should be expanding with it, you know, getting levity, right?

933
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,840
Waking up, let's say, but you stay in bed.

934
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:03,080
Yeah.

935
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:08,380
A lot of times if I don't try to do anything and I just let myself run normal, I want to

936
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:11,640
go to sleep when the sun's coming up a lot of times.

937
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:12,100
Okay.

938
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,400
Well, that's another condition, right?

939
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:20,000
So that means that you have a lot of one thing and when the sun is coming up, it's nurturing

940
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,440
to try to bring you in balance, but you can't receive that unless you are laying down, right?

941
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,580
In that other condition.

942
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:32,580
So, um, so in other words, when a fireman don't usually show up with fire hoses and

943
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:35,440
water, if the house isn't on fire, right?

944
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:39,280
So the two, the condition of the house being on fire and the fireman showing up, putting

945
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,420
water down, it's very rare that you see a fire truck and, uh, breaking a window and

946
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:47,180
just shooting water into a house when there's no smoke or no flame.

947
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,020
So you don't want to get it.

948
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:54,380
You never want to get to that point, uh, the classic, in other words, that's a classic

949
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,020
situation.

950
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:59,400
You know, if you saw a rendering fire trucks and hoses, you see in the background, the

951
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,200
building and the artist will have to put in flames and smoke.

952
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:05,580
It would be, it wouldn't make any sense if there was no flames and smoke in the picture,

953
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:05,900
right?

954
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,400
So it's that you can take it that simply.

955
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,000
So what's in the picture?

956
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:16,900
Uh, now if the person, it's easier by the way, let's look, let's go this way.

957
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:23,740
Remember how I said all the food is yin and it could be within that yin, yin, all food

958
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:24,140
being yin.

959
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,340
It could be divided as yin food and yang food, but what the manifestation of the food is

960
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:30,620
feeds the yang that protects the yin.

961
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:31,080
Okay.

962
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:37,860
Um, within that also is certain things are harder to do than others.

963
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,520
Take, go back to the example.

964
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,360
You can't sleep.

965
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:45,280
The reason why you can't sleep at night is because your body is not in sync with the

966
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:45,680
environment.

967
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,440
Contracting.

968
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,280
Okay.

969
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,760
It stays expanded.

970
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,760
And how do we treat that?

971
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:55,780
Well, we consider that and we say, I need to wind down, right?

972
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,980
Or take a supplement, you know, whether it's a over the counter, I think they have things

973
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:05,380
that make you sleep and where the tea, uh, that I mentioned or others, chamomile will

974
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:05,780
do it.

975
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:06,760
Okay.

976
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,960
That seems to be very normal to do that.

977
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,080
And it's not that difficult to do.

978
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:12,560
Right.

979
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:19,380
Let's take the opposite one where the sun is now appearing and the atmosphere and the

980
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:21,260
environment is expanding, but you can't get up.

981
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,240
You still stay in bed.

982
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:28,660
That one, that condition is much harder for the individual, right?

983
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:29,260
Okay.

984
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,440
What are you going to do?

985
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:34,380
You know, uh, I'll sip on some coffee while I'm laying down and my eyes closed and snoring.

986
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:37,760
No, it's very hard to do that, right?

987
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,820
It's much more difficult for the other, the other one.

988
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:47,360
You see, to, to go from the yin laying down, to go into the expanding environment, to get

989
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,600
in sync with something that is becoming more yang.

990
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:53,700
So when something is becoming yin, it's much easier.

991
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:54,720
Here's another example.

992
00:42:55,840 --> 00:43:00,080
You're standing out on the shore or on the side of the deck of a swimming pool and you're

993
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,780
young because you're not wet, right?

994
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:06,140
You jump into the pool, which is yin, water is yin.

995
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:07,860
And now you're yin.

996
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,000
You're all, you're wet instantly, right?

997
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:10,320
Right.

998
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:11,320
Okay.

999
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:17,280
That would be the analogy of, you can't go to sleep, but then you find a way to go to

1000
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:17,520
sleep.

1001
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,460
Now, the other way is more difficult.

1002
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:25,620
If you're wet from the pool to become yang, where you're totally dry, how long does that

1003
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:27,200
take to stand there with your clothes?

1004
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,220
Even in the desert, it takes a long time.

1005
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:29,740
It takes a while.

1006
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:29,980
Yeah.

1007
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:30,700
Yeah.

1008
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,020
So your shoes might take days.

1009
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:32,680
Good.

1010
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:33,020
Yeah.

1011
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:33,560
Okay.

1012
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:39,160
So basically that analogy is when the sun is appearing and the environment is expanding,

1013
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:44,860
but you can't expand with it and you stay in bed, let's say, or you're really tired.

1014
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:45,760
Okay.

1015
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:49,460
You see how you see the difference there, how one is easy to become wet, but it's harder

1016
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:49,920
to dry.

1017
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,600
It's easy to go to sleep, but harder to wake up.

1018
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:52,840
Yeah.

1019
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:58,740
It's easier to get wet than it is to dry off in any case, because just, yeah, that just

1020
00:43:58,740 --> 00:43:59,420
makes sense.

1021
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:00,840
That's an analogy of yin and yang.

1022
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:06,560
So just because one condition is yin and the other one is yang, oh, it just becomes, the

1023
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,080
response time is very different.

1024
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:08,760
Right.

1025
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,040
It's very different.

1026
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:13,920
Much easier to think about it again.

1027
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:15,540
You can't sleep or you want to relax.

1028
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:19,360
There's things that you could take that will put you out pretty quick.

1029
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,860
Some people, 10 minutes, five minutes, 15 minutes.

1030
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:26,480
But if you're really tired and you want to take something to wake you up, something that's

1031
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,940
going to wake you up that fast is considered dangerous.

1032
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:31,760
It'll probably do liver damage or kidney damage or brain damage.

1033
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:32,660
Right.

1034
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:33,660
Yeah.

1035
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,020
Cocaine is a hell of a drug.

1036
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:36,300
Yes.

1037
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,520
That's from Rick James.

1038
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:40,280
Yeah.

1039
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:41,340
Dave Chappelle.

1040
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:41,800
But yeah.

1041
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:42,220
Yeah.

1042
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:42,460
Yeah.

1043
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:43,300
Yeah.

1044
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:44,220
Cocaine is a hell of a drug.

1045
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:44,840
Yeah.

1046
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,060
But even then it doesn't do it.

1047
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:46,460
Yeah.

1048
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:51,240
I've seen people do whatever and yeah, and go to sleep.

1049
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,360
So yeah.

1050
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:59,120
So mind you, they show yin and yang and that little symbol, the black and white, if you

1051
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:02,960
look at the black and white symbol you mentioned earlier, that's the classic representation.

1052
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,640
Everything looks pretty balanced in there, right?

1053
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:09,660
It's a circle and the amount of black is equal to the amount of white, whether it's the dot

1054
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:10,080
or the circle.

1055
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:10,320
Right?

1056
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:11,200
No, that's not how it works.

1057
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,360
That's not it.

1058
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:16,520
That's something somebody, some school put out like 200 years ago or a hundred years ago.

1059
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:23,580
If you were to make that more accurate, depending on how I just explained it, it would not look

1060
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:24,100
like a circle.

1061
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:29,340
It would look more like an egg or an ellipse and much more of it would be black than white.

1062
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:36,100
See, you'd have more of the black and more than the white and it would look elliptical

1063
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:39,860
in that round and on one end of the ellipse, right?

1064
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:44,020
That would be more accurate in terms of the way, the working principles of yin and yang,

1065
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:46,300
not just the symbol of it.

1066
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:47,020
Excellent.

1067
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:47,260
Okay.

1068
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:52,580
So, what I just gave was something that it's very rudimentary, but if you work on that

1069
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:59,640
and you think about what I just said, it leans one more to a more correct working understanding

1070
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:05,580
versus just a simple understanding of it's, in other words, what I mean by that is you'll

1071
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:09,700
be able to start working with it versus just if someone asks you, do you know what yin and

1072
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:10,080
yang is?

1073
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:14,760
And you say, yeah, yang is hard and yin is soft or whatever, right?

1074
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:16,760
That's not workable.

1075
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:17,740
You can't work with that.

1076
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:18,560
There's nothing to work.

1077
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,520
Now, I want to just add a few more things.

1078
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,660
Again, this sounds very macrobiotic.

1079
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:29,060
Again, I don't, if there was another alternative, but eating whole foods.

1080
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:31,240
You don't like that term, but yeah, got it.

1081
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:31,560
Yeah.

1082
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:35,920
Well, for many reasons, if you go online right now and start, look, there's nothing there.

1083
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:37,100
I mean, there's not much there.

1084
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:41,740
And then, you know, it sounds very dogmatic, but here's the thing.

1085
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:47,240
Even with like a skin manifestations, you know, typically someone would run to rub something

1086
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:47,540
on it.

1087
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:52,440
You know, the, the classic dermatology, look, if you want to go to dermatology school here,

1088
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,920
I'm going to save you a, what is it a quarter of a million bucks and five, 10 years.

1089
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,240
This is everything you need to know about dermatology.

1090
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:01,560
If someone shows up with a dry spot, make it wet.

1091
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,860
If someone shows up with a wet spot, make it dry.

1092
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:04,400
That's it.

1093
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:06,040
That's the extent of dermatology.

1094
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:06,420
Yeah.

1095
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:06,980
Pretty much.

1096
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,060
That's it.

1097
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:08,680
That's it.

1098
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,400
They have no concept of anything else.

1099
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:16,320
What I'm saying is if you learn how to cook brown rice, short grain Bloomberg, I keep

1100
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,000
saying this.

1101
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:17,880
Why?

1102
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,280
Because the highest quality Nishiki makes a brown rice.

1103
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:21,540
I don't know if you could get it here.

1104
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:24,560
Very high quality brown rice, organic, of course.

1105
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:32,300
You learn how to prepare that properly and then have a root vegetables with it, sauteed

1106
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:32,820
root vegetables.

1107
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:35,360
It'd be burdock, burdock and burdock.

1108
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,320
Did I say burdock?

1109
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:37,300
I think you did.

1110
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:37,740
Hold on.

1111
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:38,320
Okay.

1112
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:44,620
It's very binding and bracing, but burdock, carrots, onions, right?

1113
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:45,040
Okay.

1114
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:46,620
Parsnip.

1115
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:47,440
Right.

1116
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:52,160
Learn how to use, cut those on a bias, very thin, potato chip thin on an angle, and then

1117
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:55,000
lay the bias slices down and cut them again vertically.

1118
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,120
So they're like julienne.

1119
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,640
Well, that's all root stuff that's close to the ground.

1120
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,480
So it's, that kind of energy is young.

1121
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:02,260
So right.

1122
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:02,600
Very young.

1123
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:06,560
And by the way, you know, the 28 elements in the soil are what we're made of.

1124
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:10,300
So it's going to drag you into that realm.

1125
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:11,840
And guess what?

1126
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:17,980
If you eat like that, you will be in sync or how, what's another way to say it?

1127
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:22,060
You will be in accord in resonance with that basic material.

1128
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:28,960
Let me ask you, is the soil outside and the ground outside in sync and in resonance when

1129
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:33,100
the environment expands, when the sun comes up or when the environment contracts, when

1130
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:37,880
the sun goes down, is the soil in the dirt in accord with all that in balance with that

1131
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,200
answer is yeah.

1132
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,440
As a matter of fact, no, the answer is fuck yeah.

1133
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:46,780
So you're putting, you're setting yourself up, right?

1134
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:51,000
It's kind of like, um, you don't have to think about it right now.

1135
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:55,940
Here's the thing I was saying, even with skin manifestations, which is supposed to be a topical

1136
00:48:55,940 --> 00:49:02,420
thing to the Westerner, even the Eastern now also, uh, doing a whole food diet like that,

1137
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:05,340
the skin manifestations disappear very fast.

1138
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,920
They start, you start getting relief within a few days and they're gone a week or two

1139
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:14,460
usually when we're in about 75% of the cases, right?

1140
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,340
So very, very simple.

1141
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:23,960
Uh, and I keep, I keep leaning on variety is, is the key to health by the way, unless

1142
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,620
you have superior quality.

1143
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:31,760
So years ago, people said, if you read an ancient text, we're starving, give us bread,

1144
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:32,620
right?

1145
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,600
Literally, that would be enough because I don't know, most, most Americans have never

1146
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:42,260
had real bread or real cheese or real milk or right, even so someone I've been, I've been

1147
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:47,200
to some American's house and it's whatever for dinner, uh, string beans.

1148
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,940
And I go over and it's Kansas string beans, string beans come in a can, right?

1149
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:53,200
That's how you get, that's what string beans are.

1150
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,820
There's something that comes in a can, right?

1151
00:49:54,820 --> 00:50:00,980
So away from that, but back to the bread, uh, if you've ever had bread, have you ever

1152
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:01,520
had bread?

1153
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:07,480
People say yes, but have you ever had bread that was baked, uh, from flour that was ground

1154
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,380
a certain way?

1155
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,520
So while it's being ground and never reaches a temperature, it doesn't touch metal.

1156
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:17,960
And also it was from the same people that are doing this also grew the wheat, right?

1157
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,260
No, the answer is no.

1158
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:24,300
When you have that, it's like you feel the love and you feel the energy.

1159
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,860
You can actually survive off of just something like that.

1160
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:31,300
But if you're in a modern world and try to survive on just bread, you're going to come

1161
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:33,280
down with a whole bunch of diseases in like a week.

1162
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:36,780
You're going to feel like crap in like two days guaranteed, right?

1163
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:40,600
Well, that very much explains why I enjoyed the bread in Sicily.

1164
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:46,100
When I went to Sicily and saw relatives there, of course, because they, uh, grew the wheat.

1165
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,040
Yep.

1166
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:51,440
And here's the other thing I want to fast forward.

1167
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,520
I was having a long conversation with someone who was traveling recently.

1168
00:50:55,640 --> 00:51:00,580
Uh, you've heard of homeopathy where it's how little of something you put in it that

1169
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:02,300
actually makes it more effective, right?

1170
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:03,680
Homeopathic remedies.

1171
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:10,300
And it's, it's actually been, uh, poo pooed for many years, but now they're finding out

1172
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:14,340
since you could use radio frequencies to create things in water.

1173
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:16,120
I don't know if you're familiar with that.

1174
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:22,600
You can have a test tube with water with DNA in it and another test to be there in another

1175
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:28,820
room or another part of the world and send hit, hit the tube with their DNA, with radio

1176
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:32,280
frequencies and the radio frequencies that bounce off of that, get recorded and sent

1177
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:32,780
to the tube.

1178
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:33,660
That's just pure water.

1179
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:39,540
And within a day that other tube doesn't matter where it is, uh, will develop the same DNA.

1180
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:40,680
Are you familiar with that?

1181
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:43,320
I have not heard this.

1182
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:44,320
Okay.

1183
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:44,980
Look it up.

1184
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:47,340
DNA recreated with radio frequencies and water.

1185
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:48,200
It's all over the internet.

1186
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:49,800
Well, I should be able to find it.

1187
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:53,380
Someone, I'm sure in the chat, we have a very active and vibrant chat.

1188
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,720
Uh, someone will put a link to it.

1189
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:58,580
Uh, there's a French, uh, he's not the only one.

1190
00:51:58,680 --> 00:51:59,640
There's many people that did it.

1191
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:00,480
Reif has done it.

1192
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:04,340
I mean, Tesla was working on stuff like this, but not DNA and water.

1193
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:04,660
Yeah.

1194
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:06,940
That was the only thing I was thinking of when you talked about the radio.

1195
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:10,600
I thought about the Reif stuff and I said, well, yeah, but I never heard of them like

1196
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:14,800
transmitting DNA basically, which is, yeah, well, DNA is a new thing that wasn't heard

1197
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,560
of before the sixties.

1198
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:17,520
Let's say publicly.

1199
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:17,980
Yeah.

1200
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:20,580
This is the experiments that were done in the eighties and nineties.

1201
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:25,180
Uh, and you can do it also, by the way, it's not that difficult to do, uh, with, it doesn't

1202
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:25,820
have to be DNA.

1203
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:26,680
It could be any material.

1204
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:27,400
Okay.

1205
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:31,820
So that was when, when they studied that, they said, wow, the homeopathic people are right.

1206
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:35,180
You just need the frequency of the material, not the quantity.

1207
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:35,900
Right.

1208
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:36,900
Okay.

1209
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:41,920
So with that in mind, what I'm trying to say is growing the wheat, right.

1210
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:49,160
And right there locally and, uh, processing it into flour and making the bread is a whole

1211
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:51,460
product, a wonderful product, right now.

1212
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:57,380
Why is it the other one is not, well, let's just say, here's one variable.

1213
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,900
Let's say you wanted to make really good bread, but the wheat was a thousand miles away there.

1214
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:03,860
How are they going to get it to you?

1215
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:07,620
Most likely it's going to end up, even if it's by train, it's going to end up on a truck

1216
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:10,240
because the trains don't come to your doorstep.

1217
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:10,460
Right?

1218
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:10,880
Right.

1219
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:17,500
So here you have this wonderful flower and it's packed in a semi truck or whatever truck

1220
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,620
and it's a powered by diesel.

1221
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:23,860
There's a diesel tank strapped underneath and the diesel is being combusted.

1222
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:29,980
Now your flower, your container that holds the flower is totally airtight, but the energy,

1223
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:34,620
the homeopathic resonant frequency of that diesel engine, no, I don't know if you've been

1224
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:38,200
around diesel trucks, it's a nasty, I mean, I don't mind the smell of diesel, but it's

1225
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:42,840
all the lubricants and the carbon and it's just like a rubber residue.

1226
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:44,940
It's like a nasty chemical residue.

1227
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:45,760
Yeah.

1228
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:50,620
And the rubber and the brake liners, even with a, you know, air brakes, you know, the material

1229
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:53,520
from the brake dust and the, you know, all this stuff, right?

1230
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:55,280
Diesel vehicles just stink.

1231
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:59,700
Again, I, you know, when I worked at gas stations in Jersey and I just had to deal with, cause

1232
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:01,820
you know, you're not allowed to fuel up yourself in Jersey.

1233
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:08,180
I had to fuel up the diesel trucks and it was like, they always had a residue all over them

1234
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:09,340
They stink.

1235
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:11,360
The exhaust smells more, everything.

1236
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:12,160
Yeah.

1237
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,720
And actually, if you work with that stuff, you will stink like it, right?

1238
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:24,040
So I remember growing up in the seventies, sitting next to someone who's Matthew Gavinelli

1239
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:28,820
and his family and his uncle, they had fish stores where they sold fish and he always smelled

1240
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:29,220
like fish.

1241
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,720
And I said, dude, you smell like fish.

1242
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:31,280
You need to wash.

1243
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:32,160
I wash all the time.

1244
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:33,020
I know I've been told before.

1245
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:33,760
I can't help it.

1246
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:34,800
I eat fish.

1247
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:35,400
I work at fish.

1248
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:36,620
I smell like fish all the time.

1249
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:36,780
Right.

1250
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:37,580
So he sat next to him.

1251
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:38,680
I don't want to sit next to him.

1252
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:39,480
Right.

1253
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:47,300
So anyway, going back to the homeopathic, the virtue of it being transported the way

1254
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:52,420
it is now is going to affect the quality of the flour from a homeopathic resident point

1255
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:52,780
of view.

1256
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:58,360
You see, even if you're, so in other words, if you ship that flour that was grown by the

1257
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:03,420
people you were with Sicily or the one that's here, Barrio bakery, uh, ship it to another

1258
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:06,600
part of the country or the way it's not going to be the same because of the virtue

1259
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:09,940
of that homeopathic residents or the D you see what I mean?

1260
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:10,220
Right.

1261
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:11,700
So what does that mean?

1262
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:15,380
Am I a big proponent for growing it locally and eating local?

1263
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:17,300
Yeah, of course you should be.

1264
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:20,380
Anything that's organic is subject local.

1265
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,980
Well, but anything that, but that wasn't what I was going to say.

1266
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:28,640
Anything that's organic is subject to pick up on, uh, some of what it's exposed to no

1267
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,740
matter what that is along its travels.

1268
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:35,600
So, you know, the people handling it, the way it travels, if it's in a truck, if it's

1269
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:38,140
in a train, if it's in a plane, it doesn't matter.

1270
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:40,440
Everything around it.

1271
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:44,680
It's, it picks up some of what it's exposed to one way or another, right?

1272
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:45,340
That's right.

1273
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:51,620
So, so in essence there was a local movement about eating local and all that, that's more

1274
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:58,400
correct than most people have given it, uh, uh, you know, it's attribute for it because

1275
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:58,900
of that.

1276
00:55:59,100 --> 00:55:59,980
Now here's the thing.

1277
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:00,940
Well, what if we use electric?

1278
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:03,180
Well, you know, you got the big lithium power pack, right?

1279
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:03,780
That they're using.

1280
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:04,680
That's very toxic.

1281
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:06,340
So eating local.

1282
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:12,660
So in other words, um, uh, we attempt here to, we have box gardens cause the soil is

1283
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,040
very alkaline in Tucson.

1284
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:18,500
If you try to do even amend the soil, if you work with soil in your hands or even with

1285
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:21,240
gloves or without gloves, you get alkaline burns, right?

1286
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:22,220
That's how alkaline it is.

1287
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:23,960
Cause it used to be an ancient seabed.

1288
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,480
So everything's on a flat.

1289
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:29,600
What you do here is you just get some wood and you make a box and you fill it with top

1290
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:34,460
soil that you acquire or you make, you amend the soil using compost or, you know, hopefully

1291
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:39,520
you'll get something that looks like soil and try to grow as much vegetables seasonally

1292
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:43,360
as you can, or a farmer's market or, or, or.

1293
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:48,540
So if you go to these organic markets, uh, if, if it's the more locally it's sourced,

1294
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:53,660
the more eating it'll be meaning energy and all that.

1295
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:55,200
Yeah.

1296
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:59,860
So I think we'll just consider this a primer, just a place to start for this, uh, Sonic

1297
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:00,380
31.

1298
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:01,520
Fair enough.

1299
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:05,420
Thanks.

1300
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:06,240
Bye.

1301
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:06,340
Bye.
