1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,570
Is it's going to be 32? Yep. Did you check chat? Yep. Okay, I did. I'm trying to stay active.

2
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:14,190
Looks like we got some pretty good, pretty good bunch of folks. Actually, it's the best bunch I've

3
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:21,970
seen ever, which makes me happy. It doesn't take much to make me happy. So yeah, I look at it when

4
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:27,250
I can. I also try to take frequent breaks from what I'm doing. So I don't, you know, get too crazy.

5
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:31,890
And, uh, I've been looking at the chat as a hobby. So there you go. Well, it's a different,

6
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:35,750
definitely different from you doing something that's, you know, completely organized and

7
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:41,010
whatnot. So, right. Let me take, sorry. I just bumped into my mic. Let me take a quick look

8
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:47,350
at myself. Why don't you just, just, just do it, man. Hit it. 32. Oh yeah. Yeah. No problem. I'll

9
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:52,590
do that too. I just wanted to look real fast. Just get a quick cursor. Look, let's see. Uh,

10
00:00:52,590 --> 00:01:02,250
contemplate what I said here. Thanks for the insight. Okay. Water confirmed. I miss how to

11
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:08,990
detox energetically. Energy. Are you trying to do your homework when you're show up at class?

12
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:16,230
No, I'm not doing homework. I'm just kicking my mind. I'll give you the cliff notes. No,

13
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:20,410
I don't even want them. I'm just kicking my mind into the right set. That's all. Just so I'm not

14
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:26,990
surprised. It's just a quick peek around the corner. Not a full analyzation. Let's see. All

15
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:34,030
right. Anyways, they're talking about the, uh, how do you spell that? Analization. Yeah, that's

16
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:38,970
true. Is that how you spell it? Well, the anus is an important part of the body. Is it not? Yeah.

17
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:45,290
It depends on whose it is. I've seen walking anuses too. Have you ever seen those? Uh,

18
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:49,690
I believe so. But you know, I guess, uh, no, no anus is created equal. Yeah.

19
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:54,950
Um, all right. Not after I'm done with it. Well, listen, I don't know what you do with

20
00:01:54,950 --> 00:02:00,010
them yourself. And I'm just joking. Hey, I'm Greek. You know, the word Greek means to analyze.

21
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:06,110
Oh, I know. But not, not analyze, but analyze. It's a, it's a pejorative term from old French,

22
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:10,790
not common slang. Still is old prostitutes in the seventies. You know,

23
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:14,410
I don't do Greek, right? You know what that means? It wasn't just the seventies though,

24
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,470
because I remember how I learned this as a kid was, you know, the personal ads,

25
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:23,170
uh, like in the, you know, like in the village voice or in the, or in the rock magazines,

26
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,450
you know what I mean? The, uh, the rock newspapers on the East coast. Well,

27
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:31,690
yeah, we do Greek. Yeah. The ones that say that go Greek. Yeah. Yeah. It'll be a bunch of things

28
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:38,590
then. No Greek, you know, or no Greek, no Greek. That's right. I'm like 13 going, Whoa, no Greek.

29
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:43,490
What? They don't, they don't want to bang Greek guys. What are they saying? No, it just means

30
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:49,590
this. Oh, okay. Then. So I'm supposed to be lascivious when we're, when we're recording

31
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:55,310
that one. We're not. I know. I know. You probably are. So let's go, let's go hit it. Don't worry

32
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:59,970
about it. Just follow my lead. Right? You got it. Okay. So hang on. I'll play the intro and all

33
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:05,130
that. And, uh, what? 32, right? Yeah. 32. Okay. Here we go.

34
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:20,230
Oh, Charlie in the Greek rated Y Sonic event 32. And, uh, there's your announcement as per usual

35
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:25,650
and all that good stuff. So how are you doing this? Uh, well it is evening here. I don't know

36
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,970
if the sun is down where you are yet, but, uh, should be. Yeah. Almost. Speaking of the sun,

37
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:35,010
it's been really hot here in the Southwest. And I said, Hey dummy, you can do the weather. So

38
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:41,050
let's try it. So they're about two hour hop. I call it an op op short for operation. Uh,

39
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:45,690
and, uh, actually I set it up the night before, did it in the morning and that following 2am

40
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:50,210
lightning. I'm like, okay, there's lightning. And then a thunder and then

41
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,250
raindrops, you know, the big raindrops, you know, you could hear them on the roof

42
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:57,230
everywhere outside for about five minutes. So I'm like, yes,

43
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:02,430
still got it. You know, it's kind of like riding a bicycle, you know? Well, and you're doing that

44
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,550
what in between, uh, you were doing some home improvements. You're not done with that yet.

45
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:10,590
Right? No, no. Uh, going around the house, I got most of the elevations done. We had something

46
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:17,670
called roof thrust, which, uh, is, uh, it goes, uh, decide misdiagnosed by architects. If you have

47
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:21,029
cracks in brick walls, you call an architect engineer, guess what they say? Oh, that's

48
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:26,610
foundation work. You need foundation work, right? Yep. And what they do to foundation work,

49
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:32,850
it's, uh, tens of thousands cause they dig below the existing foundation and poor gobs and gobs,

50
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,630
massive amounts of concrete as they're supporting the old foundation. They fill

51
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:41,590
that and they go all around the building where they think it's necessary. 90%. That is not the

52
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:48,290
problem. Uh, when you have what's called a gable roof, which is a pitched roof, uh, 90% of the

53
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:52,590
time people do that and the cracks get worse and you'll see why. I'll go back to why the cracks

54
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:57,130
get worse after they spend 50,000 on foundation reinforcement and architects. Engineers don't

55
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:02,990
know this by the way. I started a movement on this a long time ago and now there's some of them

56
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:09,970
catching up on it and I shouldn't say I'm taking full credit for it, but anyway, what is really

57
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:14,690
happening. Okay. Well, let me just, uh, with a gable roof, you know, it's on an angle on a pitch.

58
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:19,550
If you don't support that roof and the peak starts to sag and lower the edges of the roof,

59
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,810
push the brick walls apart at the top and the bottom is pinned to the foundation. The bomb

60
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:28,210
doesn't want to move. So you get cracks and they get bigger really fast. Some of them are scary.

61
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:32,810
I've seen them where you, it breaks the plaster and, uh, the brick outside and you can actually

62
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:37,690
see light right through, you know, literally like it's coming apart at the seams almost

63
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,270
at the mortar. Yeah. And people get really frightened and they call the, you know,

64
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:46,230
and then they reinforce the car. Now what happens is the roof is pushing at the top,

65
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,590
the foundation's holding it stiff at the bottom. So the cracks follow those lines.

66
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,970
What happens when you make the foundation stiffer and don't support the roof? The cracks continue

67
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:59,090
even more, right? It's kind of like when you get more attention. So, and then what happens the

68
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:05,950
next step after that, after 50 to a hundred grand worth of improvements that don't work, uh, they,

69
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:10,430
they abandon the house, they condemn it. And somebody comes in, figures it out,

70
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,950
fixes up the house, you know, they buy the house for a dollar, you know,

71
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:17,390
and put it on the market again. And I've seen that over and over. So anyway, this house was

72
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:21,910
suffering that. And I did re-support the roof and you have to go along the ridge of the roof

73
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:26,950
and prop it up. The only problem when you do that is that you actually end up loading the

74
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:31,310
interior walls and you could, if you're a slab on grade, you end up cracking the floor, the ground

75
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:38,290
inside, but it's minor. Uh, so yeah, so doing all that and, uh, doing some additional work at,

76
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:45,470
you know, add ons and, um, yeah, no, it's pretty neat. And restoration. It's a 75 year old house

77
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:51,670
or 70, let's just say a 71 year old. Well, that means it's kind of about due for some maintenance

78
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:57,350
work anyway of that type, right? I mean, generally speaking about 75 years is the lifespan of just

79
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:02,470
any of these buildings where you have to do something. Well, this is before that time was

80
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:07,790
deemed. I mean, this house, like, um, uh, give you an example. Uh, this, this is the same

81
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:13,870
construction that's been used for thousands of years. Uh, stone foundation slab on grade,

82
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:18,870
no basement, you know, brick masonry and the masonry, the mortar is just lime and sand.

83
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:23,430
You know, you could scratch it with a screwdriver. It's not like cement and sand, you know? Okay.

84
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:28,090
And, uh, but it's still pretty sturdy. And what I mean by that is I remember back in

85
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:34,770
1976 was the U S bicentennial, right? Right. And everybody celebrated that. Wow. We're 200

86
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:40,470
years old. Like I was on, I called someone in Europe. I was a family friend and I said,

87
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:44,130
it's the 200th bicentennial. What are you doing in the summer? I said, it's the 200th bicentennial.

88
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:48,630
They're like, really? I I'm in France and I'm living in a house. That's 800 years old.

89
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:53,890
You know, so much for your bicentennial being a long time, right? Right. Because,

90
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:58,410
you know, uh, if you build it right, you know, if you support the ridge of the roof,

91
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:03,190
if you go online, for example, well, 15 years ago, 10 years ago, there was nothing on roof thrust.

92
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,690
Now you go there, there's like two or three people talking about it and they'll actually,

93
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:11,330
some of them will mention stories. We hired architects and engineers and they told us it

94
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:16,950
was foundation work. And it's a simple concept as the roof sag, it pushes the walls out, you know?

95
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:24,350
And, uh, yeah. What have I said about attorneys and doctors? Now we can say that about guess who

96
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:30,050
else? Uh, well, architects and engineers. If you want to know about architects, it's all ego.

97
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:37,130
It's all ego. Look at every, any city is total chaos. Oops. I used a medical term there,

98
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:41,909
but it's totally chaotic. And people look at postcards of these cities. Look how beautiful,

99
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:47,050
beautiful, it's total chaos. This is total. These are all ego driven phallic symbols.

100
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:52,510
And I've, I've learned this, not the ego driven phallic symbol part, but working with architects

101
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:59,890
firsthand, they want to show that they do expensive work. So they, right. So when they build a house,

102
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:03,790
they want to set this house costs this much. And then I was, Oh, wow. Well, what I do,

103
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:08,930
they, I used to work as a liaison between the, the owners and the engineers and builders and

104
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:14,270
architects. And I used to look at the plans and how to make it more efficient and cut the cost.

105
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:18,090
And the architects hated that. What do you mean? It's going to be cheaper. I need it to be, you

106
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:23,130
know, expensive for my portfolio. You know, it's kind of like, uh, it's kind of like these prosecutor

107
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:30,030
jerk offs that, uh, they, they want during election time, they, we put up, um, uh, attorney

108
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:34,770
generals or whatever they put up, uh, attorneys, they put up the, uh, billboards. Uh, we have an,

109
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:40,410
I have a 98.9% prosecution rate. Well, that just means you could prosecute a ham sandwich,

110
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:45,910
right? That people don't know. It's like, why, why would you say that? Because 99% of the

111
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:51,670
people in jail are innocent, right? You can't tell me they're the 6 million people in jail

112
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:56,490
in this country are all murderers. I'd say about 600,000, right? Maybe.

113
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:01,750
Well, yeah. And they count their conviction rate is usually what it, what they, what it is, right?

114
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:06,370
If you're running for office, it's about your conviction rate. Oh my gosh. And yeah, well,

115
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:11,150
that means they've convicted a hand sandwich, you know, it's all, you know, so anyway,

116
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:16,630
I'm not saying that, you know, I used to have conversations with people that worked for the

117
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:20,690
city and the state like this. And they would say, they wouldn't address anything I said. They would

118
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:26,650
say, are you trying to say we shouldn't exist? And I heard that from one guy, I was like, Oh shit.

119
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:31,030
And then I months later, I had another conversation with a different part of the office.

120
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:36,030
They said the same thing. Like they all have the same spirit, you know, like they're robots or

121
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:40,410
something. Are you trying to say we shouldn't exist? I'm like, Whoa, this is interesting.

122
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:45,870
Getting the same car. And also I found out attorneys give Pat statements and soda doctors.

123
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:49,490
So it always goes down to that. And look, and there's the next logical step after, you know,

124
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:52,470
are you trying to say we shouldn't exist? The next thing is, well, what do you want? You want

125
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:57,430
anarchy? You want chaos? What? There should be no law and order. You're against law and order.

126
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,610
This is the right, which is a sidestep because they don't know anything about law. It's about

127
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:07,430
order. You can definitely keep be lawless and keep order. Yeah, right. Go to a Nazi prison camp.

128
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:12,910
Listen, you could have a human slaughtering facility and it can be very orderly. It doesn't

129
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:17,270
mean that it's lawful. That's right. And all the human slaughtering could could be grandmothers,

130
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:22,510
you know? Yeah. Yeah. It could just be grandmothers, you know, that, you know, whatever.

131
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:27,750
Yeah. Yeah. So it's pretty interesting. I thought we'd bring that up because it might help someone.

132
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:30,970
Maybe it won't, but at least you'll have people listening to this that are knowledgeable about

133
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:39,690
something, a phenomenon called roof thrust. Speaking of thrusting last 31, I got into the

134
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:46,390
basics of Yin and Yang, which is still haven't found another word for it. Someone, I think,

135
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:50,950
suggested calling it something else and didn't really. I thought it was OK, but it didn't strike

136
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:57,050
me enough to even remember it now. Right. But something come universal compliance or something

137
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:01,770
that sounds legal, doesn't it? Well, that reminds me of what the universal product code,

138
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:07,770
right? The UPC. OK. For the universe. Yeah. Yeah. But a real the real one. Real. Yeah. Not the

139
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:12,610
thing on paper, but the thing that's actually built into the structure. I have one of those,

140
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:18,330
by the way. It costs around 750 bucks a while back. I have a UPC product or you could change

141
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:24,050
the product. Oh, yeah. Organic UPC, so to speak. Right. Yeah. It was it was registered with all the

142
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:29,650
financial and all that, you know, to be legit. I mean, anybody can make a UPC, but there's there's

143
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:36,090
the one that's a registered one for commerce. Right. Oh, yeah. I used to make bootleg CDs.

144
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:39,930
I would slap UPC codes on them all the time. Matter of fact, occasionally, just to be funny,

145
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:44,170
I would take something like, you know, a box of Cracker Jacks and put that, you know, and like

146
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:50,890
just paste it on as a UPC code. And that just looks legit. You know, we have a little bit of

147
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:56,230
an age difference, not much. But the last time I bought something bootleg was on Canal and Canal

148
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:02,510
Street off of West Broadway. I remember it was a rainy Sunday night. A bunch of guys from Staten

149
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:08,070
Island in hoodies. And they were selling tapes. And one guy had a little walk. Let me hear. I said

150
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:13,650
the audio quality is not that good. Like there's no highs. It's all mid bass and low lows. And

151
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:16,650
it's all right, man. It's Wu Tang. It's Wu Tang. It's me, man.

152
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:21,170
That's Wu Tang. You go dig it. You know, I'm Wu Tang. He's my crew right here.

153
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:26,310
Right. That was the last time I got a bootleg tape and it was 10 bucks.

154
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:31,550
And if you guessed it, yeah, I got it from those guys from Staten Island. Yep. Yeah. No,

155
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:35,650
but I never got a never got a bootleg CD. That was after my time.

156
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:40,690
No, but I listen, I did the tapes and the CDs. I did all that. Matter of fact, for a short time,

157
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:46,210
I even had the little record pressing machines, you know, at my disposal for a bit there when

158
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:50,790
I was, you know, more involved with guys that were more organized. And it was great. You could

159
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:55,850
actually press records, you know, straight up, though. I mean, I would only get maybe about 100

160
00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:00,090
of them a day or whatever. But a regular record sold in the store for like seven bucks. You sold

161
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:05,910
these things for 20. So how about how about old office equipment? You ever heard of Pitney Bowes?

162
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:11,130
They made office equipment. Oh, yeah, sure. And they also made these things called cashier check

163
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:16,390
machines. And it's like a thing. You put the check, slide it, and it puts the amount you type

164
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:20,410
in the amount. It's like an old you have to move the pegs. Right. Oh, yeah. And it puts the amount

165
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:26,090
with a color bars over it and like a rasper looking thing. Right. Yeah. That's the thing

166
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:29,690
where you actually got to manually move the dial with your finger. Yeah. Two, three. Yeah. And it

167
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:35,310
writes it out in cursive the amount. And it's it's it writes it out in like almost like a scan line

168
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:41,390
with different colors. Someone I know got one of those for about 50 bucks. It's a two thousand

169
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:46,530
dollar machine a long time ago. And he caught he did some research on his Social Security and

170
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:51,630
birth certificate and actually got a routing number from the Treasury. He used he had a bunch

171
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:55,210
of numbers attached to that. I guess one of them would have been the routing numbers. He put the

172
00:14:55,210 --> 00:15:00,030
routing number on the check and he wrote it out for seventy five dollars. He went to a bank and

173
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:05,130
said, is this good? Actually, he sent it in somewhere and they said it was good. Right.

174
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:10,290
Because it was a signature. And then he kept going up. I said, you keep going into the tens

175
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:14,870
of thousands. It'll still be good, but someone will investigate and you'll get busted. And they

176
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:19,630
got busted. Yeah. Once you break. I think it's once you go over on a personal level, if you go

177
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:23,150
over, what is it, nine thousand nine hundred ninety nine, like even a penny over that,

178
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:27,750
you're done. That's that's where it triggers. Well, I'm not because in other words, if you

179
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:35,110
well, I'm not anyone who knows how it works. GE doesn't write. Microsoft doesn't. People do

180
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:41,150
because people are unconditionally endorsing means you can do anything to me. Right.

181
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:46,130
But you have to know how to do conditional endorsements. Like, for example,

182
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:54,470
when you look, let's say people that might have sight impairment get leeway. Right. With the IRS

183
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:59,210
and other authorities. Right. It's not because they're sympathetic to your condition. It's

184
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:04,550
because they have not put out any of anything official for the sight impaired. Right. I happen

185
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:08,750
to be familiar with this. Yes. Right. And because they haven't put out statements for the sight

186
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:14,090
impaired officially, they can't hold you responsible for what they want to do to you.

187
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:20,710
All right. It's very interesting. We used to have fun. Homeland Security at the border used to

188
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:25,810
seize boats and cash and all that in the Mexican border. And they have to post it. The Treasury

189
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:32,690
does to post it under the Treasury Department. This is what we seized and all this. And you'll

190
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:38,270
go up for auction. So we used to call up down there by Nogales and say, we want an appointment

191
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:44,410
to have access to the cash that you have. And they're like, why? I said, because I want to

192
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:49,450
take all the serial numbers down and claim them, you know, each serial number. And they wouldn't

193
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:52,990
let us. And finally, we got through to someone. So why are you letting us do this? This is according

194
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:57,750
to law. You're not doing anything illegal. What you're saying is not illegal, but we just don't

195
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:03,550
want you to do it. So when you get to that point where they want to hurt, you know, right, blatantly

196
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:08,650
tell you, we don't we we know what the law is and we know that, you know, but we just don't care.

197
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:14,450
No, you can't do it. Right. So it's interesting. Yeah. But you can do that. By the way, when cash is

198
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:20,670
out there, you just say, hey, look, I need to go and get the serial numbers off of that.

199
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:26,510
And if you do, people used to ask me, someone said, why don't you talk about that? You know,

200
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:31,810
writing serial numbers down. The serial numbers are on commercial instruments paper for a reason.

201
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:36,590
It's for what's called competent record keeping. But and it's on commercial paper, by the way,

202
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:43,930
if you could find it, there's a statute, you know, the bank notes, checks, anything you that has a

203
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:48,410
serial number or index number or transaction number is called commercial paper. Right.

204
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:54,030
There is a code that says that anyone dealing with it is expected and presumed to be an expert

205
00:17:54,030 --> 00:18:00,050
in commercial paper. Right. That's pretty ruthless. So if you don't act like an expert in it, guess

206
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:05,070
what they're going to do? They're going to act like expert scumbags to you. Right. So and you got

207
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:11,350
to kick a third to them somehow. That's not that bad. But most Americans are paying about 80 percent,

208
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:18,770
not 30 percent. Slaves used to pay 10 percent. Average Americans pay 80 percent. How? Well,

209
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:24,590
they get 30 percent off their paycheck and then everything else gets taxed. All the utilities

210
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:29,670
are taxed. All the sales purchases are taxed. And then the ancillary fees that are added on

211
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:37,770
taxes and inflation is a tax. And I think I've said that before. Chuck, let's say 20 years ago,

212
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:45,490
if we put 20 grand away. So and we have a time machine and we're going to show up 20 years in

213
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:50,030
the future. And when we show up, we want to look cool. I don't want a time machine. We're going

214
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:54,690
to buy some new dig, some new clothes and we're going to go buy a new car. Right. So we already

215
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:58,870
put 20 grand away. So we show up 20 years later with a time machine ready to buy a new car,

216
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,530
20 grand. They're going to laugh at you. Right. I think the cheapest car now is 30

217
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:06,330
or something. You know, some there might be something under 20, but you know what I mean?

218
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:09,990
Well, let's say in 1950s, you put three thousand dollars away to get a new car.

219
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:15,170
You show up in the year 2020. Right. Seventy years later with your time machine, you don't

220
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:18,370
want to look dated. So you go buy a new car with three thousand dollars. Right. Well,

221
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:22,510
even all the way up to the 1970s, 10 grand would have covered a new car for you. No problem. Yeah.

222
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:29,410
Average car was under four or five. I remember in 76, the Cadillac Seville was the first car,

223
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:35,270
American car to go stock, American car to go over ten thousand dollars. I was 1975. It was a big

224
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:39,550
deal. They advertised it. First American car to sticker price more than ten thousand dollars.

225
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:44,530
Cadillac Seville coming out. You know, I know that because of my neighbor. Neighbors bought one.

226
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:51,230
But anyway. So what does this have to do with anything? Yin and yang. It's just the way

227
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:57,270
things move. It's just the flow. But anyway, 80. When you factor in inflation,

228
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:06,170
80 to 90 percent inflation is a tax. Right. Yeah. So, yeah. Anyway, I think the dollar,

229
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:11,450
by the way, now buying power is less than a penny when you measure it against lawful money.

230
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:17,010
The actual current dollar that people call a dollar is less than a penny in value compared

231
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:22,050
to a real dollar. Right. I mean, you can take a look at if you wanted an interesting comparison.

232
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:30,170
OK, you take a look at a 1923 dollar, a silver dollar. Right. So how much is that dollar worth

233
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:34,750
today currently? Right. And you divide that. It's about 30 bucks. It's really

234
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:41,570
conservatively 20. So that would make it a dollar, a nickel worth of nickels buying power. Right.

235
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:46,510
About what? But what the it hasn't. They're leaving. There's many reasons to leave the

236
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:51,050
silver market low. Right. You understand that because it's an industrial commodity

237
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:57,330
and they know that they'll shoot themselves in the foot if they bring it up in price. But even

238
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:01,830
with the manipulation, you're still looking at a nickel to the dollar. So, you know, with silver

239
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:05,570
as a measure. Yeah. And if you use silver as a measure, gasoline is pretty cheap because

240
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:12,190
it that means that gasoline back in the 70s cost about 12, 13 dollars a gallon in today's money.

241
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:17,030
Right. Remember, it was about 70 cents. Yes. Right. So it's a big be around 12 or 13.

242
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:22,250
If you measured a silver, then was a dollar. You can go to a bank and get, I think, for a dollar

243
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:28,990
20. You can get a silver dollar. Right. A little bit over a dollar. But nonetheless, the actual

244
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:33,910
buying power practically, you know, when you're going to the stove, buying stuff, it's about a

245
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:39,510
penny. In other words, if you look at what it costs to buy a shovel today and what it costs to

246
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:46,370
buy a shovel before 1913. Right. It's about that much difference. And when you have fiat currency

247
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:50,930
like this or inflation, what people don't understand, they're in a culture. That's why I

248
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:56,130
say you could do anything to humans if you wipe out the previous generations in memory of history

249
00:21:56,130 --> 00:22:00,890
and the new ones that are raised are raised in a certain society where things are a certain way.

250
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:06,750
They never they will never figure it out. So in other words, what a shovel cost in 1913 is what

251
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:14,450
a shovel cost in the year 1613 and what a shovel cost in the year 13. Right. Because it was based

252
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:20,950
against the fixed price of gold and silver. So by the way, the score, you hear the term,

253
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:26,010
I have a score to settle. You know, of course, that means the 20. It's a 20 dollar gold piece

254
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:33,210
as a score. So you're right. Score was 20. Even young again. Let's let's not forget.

255
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:39,330
We won't. I'm famous for tangents and I'm famous for taking a tangent off of a tangent. But

256
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:48,510
and I'm also famous for going back. So how famous are you? Yeah, right. We got into the basics last

257
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:57,270
time, like the contemplative nature of it. But what's what's what really here's the thing. The

258
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:03,410
most functional aspect of when people hear the balancing of energies and all that is regarding

259
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:09,690
to health. So maybe we'll steer towards that more now. OK. The yin, I think, talked about

260
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:16,730
anything you eat to nourish is yin all. You know, if it's if you water, air, food, any food is all

261
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:22,850
yin. All things which you can gain energy from are energetic and therefore for life that had to.

262
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:27,690
Yeah, right. In other words, in other words, to sustain a living soul or a life form is yin.

263
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:33,650
So that which is life sustaining is yin, period. All of it. Yeah. Now, once you look at that food

264
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:37,890
as a category, then you could subdivide it. Well, this is in the middle. This is very

265
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:43,010
yin and this is yang amongst that entire group. So then where is the yang come in? Well,

266
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:50,250
once you take that sustenance and it rebuilds the effect of the sustenance, develops the yang

267
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:56,770
once it meets the body. Right. So let's say the hardness of your skin, if you have a thick skin,

268
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:02,210
it's more yang than a thin skin, that soft skin, which is more yin. Right. So depending on your

269
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:08,570
diet, if you're eating things that are more yang, but not too yang, more near the middle,

270
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:12,650
but leaning a little towards yang, you'll have a durable skin, which would be yang.

271
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:18,790
But if you're eating things that are very yin or leaning on yin and near the middle,

272
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:23,370
you'll have a moderate skin, but a very yin, you'll have a very thin skin and which mosquitoes

273
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:26,870
like. And they could see that. They know that. By the way, animals know their prey.

274
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:33,670
They know their food. Right. So don't blame the mosquitoes. We should get bit. I don't get bit.

275
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:37,890
Even in Houston, Texas, where it's very swampy in some areas, the bayous and all that,

276
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:43,190
people would just, if they didn't run from the car to inside and they walked, they ended up

277
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:47,850
with 10 mosquito bites just walking from the car to the front door. Right. With me, I just sat

278
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:54,490
outside all day. I didn't get bit at all. Right. But if you saw us eating together, how I ate and

279
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:59,910
what I ate, even though it was the same dishes and all that, you'd see I was very different. Right.

280
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:05,350
Well, what about the how outside of the what? Because you talked a bunch about the what,

281
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:09,110
how about the how? What's important about the how and the preparation?

282
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:16,110
Yeah, let's do that. OK, give an example. Years ago, more than three decades ago,

283
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:20,890
I was thinking it would be fun to work at the Alaskan pipeline. So I went to this thing and

284
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:25,090
they talked about it and they said, well, take this home and read it. You know, I went late

285
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:28,970
to the meeting and they give you these things called cut sheets, which is like, you know,

286
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:34,690
just whatever old fashioned way of calling something that's Xerox copied. Take home and read.

287
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:39,230
Right. And it said that if you decide to go up there two weeks before you go up there,

288
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:44,350
you're supposed to for two weeks go to the stove and give yourself a tub of cool whip,

289
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:49,290
miracle whip. Well, I mean, cool whip, whip cream, a tub of that. Right. Get yourself a

290
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:55,010
bottle of corn oil and put a cup of corn oil in the cool whip, stir it up and eat a cup of that

291
00:25:55,010 --> 00:26:01,510
every day for two weeks before you go up there. Right. I was like, oh, my goodness. And I said,

292
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:07,310
you know what that is? That's synthetic seal blubber, isn't it? Right. OK. All that oil and

293
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:12,590
fat. Right. And basically it said, if you do this, you'll have an easy time up here in Alaska.

294
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:17,750
Right. And I was like, hmm, that's very interesting because it sounds a lot like

295
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:22,690
you're eating seal or whale blubber or something. Right. Guess what people up there live on?

296
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:27,630
Seal and whale blubber. Well, not anymore, but typically that was traditional. Right.

297
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:32,450
So it was good to build like a natural insulator. Right. It would help to keep you warm.

298
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:40,510
Yeah. Sort of. Sort of. What it would do, it would it would sounds a lot like eating seasonally or

299
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:46,250
eating locally. Right. If you were to go to the tropics and work on the Panama Canal back in the

300
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:53,330
day when the French tried, what did they eat? Oh, French food from Europe. Well, that didn't work

301
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:59,590
too well. So we got all that malaria. Right. Right. And don't believe the quinine aspect. Yeah,

302
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:04,970
it is true. If you take the quinine from the quinine tree or whatever in tonic water. Right.

303
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:09,330
Let's say I think they denature that, by the way. Anything you buy that might have something that's

304
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:13,730
medicinal, like rye or quinine or poppy or whatever, they make sure it's denatured

305
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:17,830
right before you get it. So it doesn't have most of its natural properties.

306
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:23,830
So what they did was they were looking for people that were used to working in those areas or from

307
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:30,470
those areas because they were more in balance. So this is the how. Very simple. You could use the

308
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:37,730
moon. You could use the sun. OK, if you use the sun, that would be a daily event. If you use the

309
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:43,790
month, it would be a the moon. It would be a monthly event. Or you can use a seasonal event. And

310
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:51,130
basically you would look at it as the three main seasons that do you have with seasonal. You have

311
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:56,410
the two main seasons, summer and winter. Those are the main. And then you have spring and fall,

312
00:27:56,470 --> 00:28:01,170
which are transitions. Transitional. OK, don't most people say, well, there are four seasons,

313
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:05,950
Greek. There's winter, spring, summer, fall. You know, well, you know, right. I'm like, no,

314
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:12,090
no, there's actually two seasons. There is winter and summer and the spring and the fall are

315
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:17,990
transitions. OK, so once you see it that way, it seems like now you what do you mean transition?

316
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:22,870
Transition means I shouldn't, you know, transition means change. Right. Transition means it's not

317
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:27,610
steady. Transition means I'm going from one thing, one thing to another. Yes. Yeah. But when you

318
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:31,210
establish it in your mind, the spring season, well, it's just spring. What do we do in the spring?

319
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:36,730
You know, what do we do in the fall? You know, take pictures and whatever, fly kites, whatever,

320
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:42,570
you know. No. So these transitional seasons are when you transition from winter to summer and then

321
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:49,450
from summer to winter. Right. OK, so that's the how the in other words, what the reason I'm

322
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:52,830
emphasizing this because they've done a big disservice to even children. You know, there's

323
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:58,750
winter, spring, summer, fall. Right. You know, as well. Then you grow up thinking, well, you know,

324
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:02,890
this is just how I go about things because this is how I was told without realizing really what's

325
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:10,890
going on. So in essence, if you were to look at the basic energies, it takes summer. Let's just

326
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:16,770
take summer growth. Right. Energy is going upward. How do you know? Well, the things are growing fast.

327
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:22,110
Right. Which do when things grow fast and hardy. Which way are they going? They're going up.

328
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:28,590
Right. Upward and outward. Yeah. Yeah. The typical heat concept of chemical heat rises. Right. Goes

329
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:33,310
up. Right. But actually upward, upward and outward. Both. Yeah. Same time. But what's

330
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:38,970
interesting is if you go to in summertime, the atmosphere is colder above, by the way,

331
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:42,550
than it is in winter. The higher up you go, the colder it is in the summer. But that's another

332
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:48,990
that's more on the ether discussion. But the typical chemical idea of heat, if you, let's say,

333
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:53,390
let a room or a box heat up. Yeah. The heat wants to rise up. Right. You open the windows at the

334
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:59,610
top, let the heat out. It's chemical heat. OK, so everything's rising and expanding and going up.

335
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:08,310
Right. But the direction of of it is young and heat is considered young and the effect will be

336
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:15,370
Ying. Right on you. It will slow you down, make you soft. And then when you run out of things

337
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:21,010
that allow that you to slow down and become soft, you end up becoming young. You dry out. OK.

338
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:27,390
OK. All right. So that is the fundamental aspect of summer. Now, the fundamental aspect of winter

339
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:33,150
would be things are not growing. Leaves fall down. Fruit falls down. Everything's going down.

340
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:40,090
Right. Nothing's coming up. Things are going down. The leaves fall. Snowfall. Right. Snow.

341
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:44,490
Not only does it fall, but it stays on the ground. It doesn't stay up in the air. So everything's

342
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:51,990
going down. And that would be Ying. Right. The cold is Ying. Right. But if you get something

343
00:30:54,930 --> 00:31:01,530
too Ying or cold, it starts to get in. It runs out of its ability to balance that Ying. It starts

344
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:07,910
to get hard. It becomes young. Right. Comes its opposite. So like water. Right. Or things

345
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:15,090
freeze and they become hard. That means they've got too much of the winter contraction. Right.

346
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:21,070
All right. So most people, if most people do actually, I was thinking most people have

347
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:26,090
problems in the spring and the fall because of pollen. Right. But that's one way to look at it.

348
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:29,890
But really, the overall challenges come at the height of winter and at the height of summer,

349
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:34,970
because when you're most heated up, you have difficulties. You know, it's harder to breathe

350
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:40,810
just in general because and I've always thought of it as the air is larger. The molecules of the

351
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:44,370
air are larger. Therefore, you're getting less air. That's the chemical. Just in other words,

352
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:48,630
if you can die from it, you know, let's just get to the point. Sure. You'll probably die

353
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:56,110
in the summertime from overheating and you'll probably die in the winter from freezing to death.

354
00:31:56,210 --> 00:32:00,670
But in the spring and the fall, you won't die from the extreme, you know, extreme conditions

355
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:06,010
don't come in and do the extreme thing. So until the winter. Yeah. How many times in New York? Oh,

356
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:09,650
it's a hundred degrees in New York today. Twenty five people died. I'm like, damn,

357
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:15,250
what? Right. Or in England, there was a big thing. They hid it from the media. They

358
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:20,730
pensioners couldn't afford to. Old people couldn't afford to warm their flats and they were

359
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:29,290
frozen solid. Right. Right. Because the pensions were so low they relied on. But OK, so most I

360
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:33,310
want to address the transition point here, which I did once just to recap.

361
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:41,010
And I'll do a recap of the recap. What I mean here is in the springtime, you transition from

362
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:46,650
the winter to summer, which means now things are starting to go upward. Right. And people say,

363
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:50,690
oh, it's the pollen. Yeah, it's the pollen. But it's the energy, the pollen carries.

364
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:56,470
You know, here's the thing. What's interesting about it. You can take someone who has allergies.

365
00:32:56,470 --> 00:33:01,050
It's very, very sensitive to pollen, you know, in spring blossoms and things like that. Yeah. And

366
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:07,150
put them in a clean room, totally isolated, and they'll still have those allergies because it's

367
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:13,250
the energy, not the the material. Right. In other words, the condition won't be as bad because the

368
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:17,370
material is not there to aggravate it. But they'll still have that feeling. They'll still be very

369
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:24,110
sensitive until the sun, until the season is completely over. Right. They actually say it

370
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:28,490
like I don't want to go outside. I feel it. I'm very sensitive. Right. But you're inside. There's

371
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:33,650
no pollen in here. You've got to have a filter here, have a filter there. Right. Well, OK,

372
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:39,710
so there we go. There's something to it. You can literally change the actual chemical condition.

373
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:44,970
Right. Like, for instance, if I'm in a house and it's very hot outside, very hot, very humid

374
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:49,950
outside. Now I've got air conditioning. So the conditions in the place where I am have been

375
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:54,550
adjusted by the air conditioner. Chemically, chemically, they've been adjusted. So around me,

376
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:58,830
I should feel fine. Right. But I don't. I still feel the effect of the heat or

377
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:04,350
when it's very rainy outside. I have a lot of injuries I've had. Right. So I've got, you know,

378
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:09,449
achy bones. I describe it as all the time. Arthritis. Well, I don't have the arthritis,

379
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:14,389
but I do have to get it. I feel pain in places where I've been injured before

380
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:21,350
when the atmospheric pressure changes. So the thing is, it's raining outside. I still feel

381
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:24,790
the effects of the rain outside, even though I'm in a dry place.

382
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:32,750
Sure. Well, that's the energy part. You see the and when you learn to go into balance with the

383
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:37,389
energy part that takes care of the chemical material part. Here's the I've done experiments

384
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:43,330
with this. You can have a room at seventy five degrees, dead seventy five degrees and boil water.

385
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:49,270
Water will boil at the temperature normally boils up, but it'll take in the winter time. It'll take

386
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:56,090
longer to boil than in the summer, even though you have to do an experiment all year round,

387
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:58,850
keep everything the same temperature, the temperature of the room, temperature of the

388
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:03,630
water. And you'll notice that it always boils faster. It takes less time to come to a boil

389
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:07,530
in the summer than in the winter, even though the room temperature and the water temperature is

390
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:13,810
exactly the same. That's an energetic effect. And this is always excluded in science, by the way.

391
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:17,810
They leave that out. That's why they keep repeating experiments so they could do this

392
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:21,550
exclusion. No, we don't want this one. We want the ones that support what we want to tell people.

393
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:28,730
Right. Of course. So. Yeah. So. OK, so here when we go into the springtime, things transitioning

394
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:34,810
to going up so you can get a head start on that. We covered this already on one of the I think

395
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:44,990
single digit episodes. You get a head start by getting a light leafy teas. You know, I don't

396
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:48,710
like the word tea because you can make tea out of anything. Right. I think I went over that.

397
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:54,090
So a green tea, if you don't want something caffeinated, you can get a mint tea. Look at

398
00:35:54,090 --> 00:36:00,910
the plant. And, you know, the was it the Autobahn drawings. Right. Or compare or a

399
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:05,330
plant comparison in height. Learn what you do. Wikipedia, believe it or not, is pretty good for

400
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:10,530
this. When you want to pick a tea, put in what the tea is from, let's say mint and then go to

401
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:15,730
put in the mint plant and it'll tell you how high it grows. Right. OK. Gives you a height. Right.

402
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:20,810
And then if you let's say you want green tea, right. Go look up the green tea, whatever,

403
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:26,110
and the plant and how high it grows and the higher it grows, the more it's going to stretch

404
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:30,450
you up into that direction. Right. Well, let me ask you about the pine needle tea,

405
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:34,710
then, in that case, since you mentioned these other two, because that's another thing you can

406
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:40,470
do. Right. Pine needles. Yeah. Pine needle. It's an evergreen. Now, most people have the idea that

407
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:46,650
an evergreen doesn't change. It's the same. It's not. It does change. The color changes extremely so

408
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:53,950
between seasons. And of course, it has a different type of most evergreens are not single trees. You

409
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:58,410
know, they're connected at the roots. Right. And they like to do that. And also the way that they

410
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:03,670
make pine cones and all this other stuff. Right. And their shape. They only grow at a certain

411
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:10,050
altitude also. Right. As you go higher, you take a hyperbolic. The energetic part of the evergreen

412
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:17,370
is thus a hyperbola or a funnel, a vortex funnel. Right. OK. Turn it upside down and the trees will

413
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:24,530
always start to turn the hyperbolic shape upside down. OK. And the bottom would be sea level or

414
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:30,490
slightly below sea level and start doing horizontal lines and scale at thousands of feet throughout

415
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:37,270
the hyperbolic shape going up. And if you start cataloging what trees grow at what elevation,

416
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:42,650
they fit exactly in that hyperbolic shape. So the hyperbola, if you turn upside down like a

417
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:46,750
trumpet, it would be very wide and low at the bottom. And as it goes up, it gets skinnier and

418
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:52,410
taller. Right. Right. A hyperbolic shape. By the way, science completely academia. They avoid

419
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:57,450
hyperbolic shapes. They might talk about parabolas because that has to do with military weapons.

420
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:03,250
Right. The parabolic curve on a projectile. OK. Right. Yeah. But they avoid hyperbolic. So if

421
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:08,150
take a hyperbolic shape, put it upside down, draw a horizontal line and you start fitting your

422
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:13,510
trees as they go up and you'll notice the trees follow that hyperbolic shape. Exactly. So as we

423
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:17,810
get to the higher, higher elevations, you know, the hyperbolic curve is very narrow at the bottom

424
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:22,990
and very pointy at the top. Guess what that looks like? Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. And then, well,

425
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:27,210
there's different types of evergreens that are shorter and squatter at different different heights.

426
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:31,590
Oh, yeah. But it's a typical like typical pine tree, Christmas tree kind of deal,

427
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:37,270
you know, common. Right. I'm not talking about the holiday. The pine tree will do both. It'll

428
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:41,250
accommodate you see pine trees. If you go out in the summer and look at a pine tree in the forest,

429
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:45,410
it's chilly, chill. Right. It's fine. Right. It's not burning in the right. It's not like,

430
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:49,550
hey, man, you know, turn on the A.C. or cover me. The sun's killing me. You know, nothing like that.

431
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:54,450
Yeah, it's just fine. And it's just fine in the winter. It looks like it does change quite a bit

432
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:58,350
in the winter. You'll notice it takes on more of a bluish gray green. Right. Yeah. People don't

433
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:01,710
realize the shift in the green. They just think it's green all the time. Yes, it is green,

434
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:07,410
but it's different shades. It's a metallic it's more of a metallic green versus a very,

435
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:14,170
very deep forest green in the summer. But all right. So what that does for you, it will it

436
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:22,090
will take you very quickly up into an uplifting, both energetic, uplifting and very narrow,

437
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:29,030
right. Energetic beam through the body. Good for like I said, if you take a pine needle tea or

438
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:35,170
something like that, it's a very strong astringent. It will stay in the body for a long time because

439
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:40,590
it's very focused energy. But someone it would I would not suggest it for someone who is having

440
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:45,950
trouble in the springtime with allergies. It would probably have a strong astringent quality,

441
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:51,670
meaning they they have clean. They go to the bathroom really well for a few days. Right. But

442
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:58,310
then it'll just lean over and it might actually weaken some aspects that could be nurtured with

443
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:04,730
something that is not as extreme as that. And I wouldn't call it very extreme. But for the purposes

444
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:11,810
of this recitation dissertation, I would say it is more extreme. Right. The point only because of

445
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:19,170
not seasonality, but its location. Right. But but here's the thing. If you live in a higher

446
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:23,410
elevation place that does have pine trees, yeah, you could work on it. But the thing about the pine

447
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:29,390
tree, it's not transitory. In other words, it's not it's not it's perennial versus an annual

448
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:36,450
or something that doesn't really react very much like something like a mint plant will react,

449
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:43,190
be more reactive from winter to spring to summer than a pine tree. Because if you look at a mint

450
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:49,450
plant or a mint tree or mint bush, it's pretty much dead in the winter. Right. And it comes to

451
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:53,890
life in the spring and really blooms out in the summer. So that would be a representation of

452
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:58,110
something that has transitory aspects. Right. In other words, it's following the seasons more

453
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:04,490
more than a pine tree would visually. So that would be more recommended. OK. You see, because it has

454
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:11,710
that transitory energy, you see, when you do things that are medicinal like that, if you

455
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:17,110
you're doing it as a medicinal, it's it's good to have something that transitions. It doesn't

456
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:25,630
really last that long when you're doing something as a stable, stable staple or stable staple.

457
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:31,510
Right. Adding it to your diet and it's geographic, a pine tree like the pine needles. You can do that

458
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:36,350
all year round and incorporate that in your diet. Right. Let's say it would be a consistent thing.

459
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:42,670
So what I would suggest is when you start looking at your plants, look at how tall they grow and how

460
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:48,750
fast they grow. Right. So if you look at something like corn, for example, which corn is pretty tall

461
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:54,190
and it grows so fast, you can actually hear it growing. You can do a recording of it as the

462
00:41:54,190 --> 00:42:00,410
fibers are expanding. I don't know if you've heard that before, but it's it's known by people in

463
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:04,270
Nebraska and places where they grow it. No, I can't say I've heard that before. I mean, I've seen I've

464
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:08,910
seen a lot of corn growing. I mean, you remember Jersey corn was always good. Yeah. Yeah. If you go

465
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:14,690
to a big place, a lot of cornfields and it's not too windy and you spend the day there and you leave

466
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:19,150
the cornfield, you notice how quiet it is. Yeah. You go back to the cornfield and you're like,

467
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:24,310
it's really noisy here. Well, because it has a very subtle crunchy. It's almost below audible,

468
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:29,190
but it's still there. It's kind of like ambient noise. When I play music during the day, I turn

469
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:34,630
the amplifier, let's say up to like 10 or 11. But when at nighttime, when all the ambient noise,

470
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:38,550
everybody's asleep, there are no cars in anywhere around. I'm not I'm not in a noisy place at all,

471
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:44,690
but just in the city. If I turn it up to nine, it's too loud because of the ambient noise. Right. You

472
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:48,430
could do this experiment at home. You ever notice if you want to listen to music late at night while

473
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:52,630
you're sleeping, you have to keep it really low because where the normal, even low, low,

474
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:58,410
normal during the day was too loud. Right. Because it's the ambient noise. So it's an ambient. So

475
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:07,310
again, look at how fast things grow. So if they grow very as they grow vertically, here's the

476
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:12,730
thing. They are more and more young, but at the rate of their growth and their final height

477
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:18,630
determines if they got from the ground to that height very quickly that now it's a yin energy

478
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:26,470
because yin is expansive. Right. You see. So even though going up is young, something that grows

479
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:33,630
quickly and to a height ends up having a yin manifestation in the body. Right. So, again,

480
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:39,690
just to recap, if the spring comes along and you're having what they call sensitivity to it,

481
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:46,890
it's because you're not in line with that seasonal transition. So the way you get in line with it is

482
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:52,690
by taking things in that are transitional, that grow. Here's a very simple way to do it.

483
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:59,430
Sprouts. Start eating sprouts when the springtime comes. What are sprouts? Right. New growth. Right.

484
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:04,750
That's what you expect in springtime. Right. Sprouts. Things that grow to a moderate height.

485
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:09,050
My thing is not growing more than chest height. Well, who's chest height? Right. Or waist height.

486
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:16,750
Okay. Right. If it grows higher than that quickly, it's going to have the opposite effect,

487
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:22,110
even though it's going in a young direction. Okay. That gets more advanced. But this is just

488
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:27,170
generally, I want to give generally, this is the recap of what we did on a previous episode on that.

489
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:32,450
Now, if you do the contrary, which is the wintertime, as wintertime comes,

490
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:38,610
you want to go towards the ground, things that are very low towards the ground or things that

491
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:43,510
are in the ground, like root vegetables. But there are a lot of things that are in the ground as root

492
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:48,850
vegetables that are considered nightshades. Right. And they are there for a different reason than

493
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:56,570
the nightshades are mostly there to nurture the soil. Right. Okay. To pull excess nitrates out.

494
00:44:56,810 --> 00:45:00,490
Right. Like, you know, beans put nitrates. Okay. You can study what plants do in their

495
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:05,830
complementary plants. Right. But, you know, it's interesting. Here's here's one. If you're Italian,

496
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:10,490
you'll like this. You know, if you plant basil and tomatoes together, they complement each other.

497
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:16,610
Right. Naturally in, you know, in the garden. But you know what else? They also complement each

498
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:23,090
other in the pot. Right. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. So you can you can go that way. That's why

499
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:26,910
there are many things that may even consider a nightshade that complement

500
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:31,170
up another plant and they go well together in the pot, you know, like potato stews and things like

501
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:38,530
that. Okay. Now, recently, what I've been doing is suggesting that people get Lundberg brown rice.

502
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:44,290
Lundberg is a brand only because it's the highest quality you can get still reasonable,

503
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:50,390
more fairly accessible and Burdock root, which is in the thistle family. There's wild thistle.

504
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:55,410
There's very but Burdock. And the reason I suggest this is because let's say you're new

505
00:45:55,410 --> 00:46:00,330
to Greek speak or you're listening to the Sonics and Greeks talking a lot, but not showing anything

506
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:07,750
or whatever, you know, for all this stuff. It's a lot of talk. So what I do for show here is here's

507
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:13,510
a simple way to create a condition for yourself that is very bracing and binding internally.

508
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:21,550
In other words, it's it's it transcends all of the seasonality. Right. It's just like a basic.

509
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:25,510
It's like, you know, when you're painting, it's good to put a primer under it. Depend.

510
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:28,990
Doesn't matter what color. If you're putting a summer or winter color on the wall,

511
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:35,290
you put a primer. Right. It's a better paint job. Right. So this is like a primer in a mechanical

512
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:41,710
sense. The the rice. A lot of people say it's carbs. Yeah, it's carbs. But it's a whole it's

513
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:47,450
a whole grain which has more digestible, quote unquote, amino acids. I don't like saying protein

514
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:52,650
because no one has ever seen a protein. They just see amino acids, which are both in you'll find

515
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:56,640
amino acids and carbohydrates and what they call proteins and what they call carbs. So it's

516
00:46:57,010 --> 00:47:01,370
right. Don't I'm not even going to get into calories because, you know, calories are irrelevant

517
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:07,590
unless you're pooping charcoal. Right. Right. So the whole joke about that. But the the whole

518
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:12,070
the wholeness and the thing is, I haven't suggested this in the past and I'm going

519
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:17,210
more into it. The burdock and the brown rice, because first of all, you never want to suggest

520
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:21,770
someone make something that they can't make well. You never want to. Here's the thing. And

521
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:26,590
even in Japan, they have certain purveyors of fine ingredients and they will refuse to sell

522
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:33,030
it to someone who cannot cook it. Why? Why? Because if you have this wonderful, exclusive,

523
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:36,590
quality rice and you sell it to a restaurant who can't prepare it well, what is that restaurant

524
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:41,230
going to say? That rice ain't shit. Rice isn't so good. It ruins your reputation. Right.

525
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:46,950
So to make the brown rice properly, you need a pressure cooker, a pseudo pressure cooker.

526
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:50,590
Personally, I don't use a real pressure cooker anymore with the rubber gasket because I could

527
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:54,990
taste that rubber. It's exposed inside, even though it's thermal rubber. So I make my own.

528
00:47:55,070 --> 00:48:01,910
I have very fine, let's say, pots with a fine fitting lid and you put a weight on it and it

529
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:07,510
just as well. Learn how to cook that medium, whatever instructions they give you, run the

530
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:13,430
medium heat a little bit more, not just low. But we'll get into that on the cooking and the burdock

531
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:19,410
root. You cut it on a bias, which then it looks like an ellipse, very thin. Right. And you lay

532
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:24,930
the ellipses down and you cut them again vertically in a julienne cut, very, very fine cut matchstick

533
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:30,430
cut. And you saute that with some seasonings and you eat that with the rice in addition to whatever

534
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:35,510
else you want to have with that. Even fish or beans or I wouldn't suggest meat because that's

535
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:41,050
like an over to overkill. A lot of these restaurants, they serve like this health, healthy

536
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:45,710
food and they'll serve brown rice with salmon or brown rice with it. Whenever you do an animal,

537
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:50,770
do a white rice. Don't do a brown rice. It's too much for the body to handle. Right. Do a white,

538
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:54,830
a plain starch, you know. Right. Like in other words, if you're going to have pasta,

539
00:48:55,610 --> 00:49:01,410
don't do a whole wheat pasta when a bolognese sauce with a meat sauce to the regular. If you

540
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:06,270
do a whole wheat pasta, do it with just a veggie sauce. Right. Right. Right. It's its own, quote,

541
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:10,910
unquote, protein in air quotes. So I've been suggesting that I've gotten some feedback

542
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:14,190
from people. They were like, yeah, that Bloomberg race on this. How do you feel from it? You know,

543
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:19,190
just like you said, you get this energy. You know how when you have a really good steak dinner and

544
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:24,550
you don't overeat and you feel this rush of energy in your body. Yeah. Right. Or power or whatever,

545
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:29,530
you know, it's I call it bracing and you'll feel that, but it's longer lasting. It's not like a

546
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:37,230
carbo load or anything like that. So when people start doing something basic like that and they

547
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:42,410
feel the difference, right, then it's easier and it's more credible to start looking at the rest

548
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:47,210
of the stuff. Right. Because you've already started. You see the effects. Right. But if

549
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:52,170
you start talking about, oh, do this and do that and do this or you could do this or do that and

550
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:56,090
haven't done any of it, it's like, well, what do I do first? It sounds like, you know,

551
00:49:56,550 --> 00:50:00,890
foreign, you know, whatever. So that's why I just keep suggesting people start with the brown rice

552
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:06,050
and the and the burdock root. Right. Because the burdock root is the most bracing vegetable you

553
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:12,230
could possibly eat. It grows a straight taproot down into the ground. The top of it looks like

554
00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:16,290
you have these pointy, jagged leaves, blossoms that look almost like clove blossoms. Right.

555
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:22,730
And this is going to do during any season, any season, any season. Yes. But particularly in

556
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:27,330
the winter, if you were to do the brown rice and burdock, burdock soup, burdock saute, burdock added

557
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:32,710
to ingredients, you'll pass the winter very, very well. In other words, you'll be cool. You won't be

558
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:36,990
cold. See, in the summer you want to be warm, not hot. And in the winter you want to be cool,

559
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:40,990
not cold. I noticed that most people, especially Westerners or Americans,

560
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:44,970
they want to be cold in the summer and hot in the winter. That's too extreme.

561
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:51,990
Warm in the summer, not hot and cool in the winter. Right now, not cold. Don't try to

562
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:56,410
adjust your body to the lower temps and adjust your body to the higher temps.

563
00:50:56,590 --> 00:51:01,490
Now, I've had this weirdness. And look, the way that I see it is people I've encountered

564
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:05,750
over and over again throughout my entire life. During the summertime, they turn their houses

565
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:12,430
into iceboxes. I mean, they crank up the diet. It's ridiculous. Yeah. That was more with

566
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:18,170
the millions and billions of tons of coal were probably burned to keep the air conditioners

567
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:23,110
going when salmon, I was just joking, when salmon was in vogue. A decade ago, remember,

568
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:25,690
it was like salmon, this, salmon, that. In the news, they said, oh, the government says it's

569
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:29,570
okay to put collar in salmon. Salmon, this, salmon, that. You're killing people with salmon.

570
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:33,850
You go into someone's house and they have the thermostat turned on like an icebox, right?

571
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:38,850
What'd you have for dinner last night? Oh, I love that salmon. What'd you have for lunch

572
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:48,110
yesterday? I love that salmon. Yeah. Save that for when I've met someone 20 some odd years ago.

573
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:54,110
I was out in a shirt. She was out in a jacket. It's a fall. She was cold and I wasn't. And I

574
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:58,050
went over to where she lived and she had bananas on the counter. It was like, you know, in the 50s

575
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:03,330
and 60s outside. I took the bananas away, poached some salmon, said, eat that for three days. In

576
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:07,610
three days, she was outside with me in a shirt feeling just fine, right? Because the salmon

577
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:13,510
will adjust your body. Right. Right. Now this, uh, you notice how it always goes back to, you

578
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:18,110
know, how I say eat seasonally, you know, how I make a short metaphor on that, you know, notice

579
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:22,870
now how I'm getting a little more detail into this. It goes back to eating seasonally. It does.

580
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:28,430
Right. Yeah. But seasonally, a little finer. You see the problem with commerce and getting your

581
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:34,110
food is they bring it from far away places and it's exotic, right? And it doesn't pertain. So

582
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:38,390
you feel like you're, you're an advantage because you can eat anything you want. Right. You hear

583
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:42,650
people say that I'll eat anything I want. Right. You think that that's an advantage to you. Right.

584
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:48,810
You know, uh, here's the thing. Uh, I use the car analogy, you know, Mitsubishi

585
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:54,770
engines in the early nineties. If you talked about getting one, oh no, don't get those men.

586
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:59,710
They, they, they smoke after like a year, they start smoking. You know, you hit the gas pedal

587
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:04,610
and the smoke comes out the back. Well, I was like, oh man, Mitsubishi, they're famous for

588
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:09,730
precision. I looked into it and they were one of the first car manufacturers to ever specify

589
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:15,710
using only synthetic oil only. And what did people do? They went to a Jiffy lube or whatever

590
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:19,170
those places. And when they went, they got the special oil change. You think they're going to

591
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:24,150
put five quarts of synthetic glue, which was very expensive. It was way more expensive. Yeah. Yeah.

592
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:27,110
You think they're going to do that or they're just going to, you think they're going to look

593
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:30,350
at the manual, you think they're going to look at the sticker where it says synthetic only,

594
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:35,330
the guy doesn't even know how to read probably English. Right. So anyway, so what do you think

595
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:41,890
happened? They got a bad reputation for right. Well, who is it? Mitsubishi's fault. Maybe they

596
00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:44,670
should have took it a little step further and said, Hey, if we sell these cars here,

597
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:49,510
no one's going to pay attention. Right. But that's not how it's done. So the body is very

598
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:55,850
much like that. Right. So you go to the store, uh, grocery store and you see pineapples all year

599
00:53:55,850 --> 00:54:00,570
round or this, you know, if maybe sometimes not all year round bananas, bananas or year round

600
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:06,370
though. Yeah. Bananas. Yeah. Yeah. So I've done this analogy many times where a school teacher

601
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:12,250
who I've known a few, I got sick this winter. I got, I caught it from the kids. Right. You hear

602
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:18,410
that? Right. I work kids. I caught a cold. Okay. But you know what? Here's something really

603
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:24,050
interesting though. The woman from Calcutta, India who teaches math and the guy from Beijing,

604
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:31,350
China who teaches science in the same school didn't get sick, right? They didn't get cold

605
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:35,250
from the same children because they know how they change from period to period, right? Yeah. So same

606
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:38,930
kids go to a different class. They're, they're exposed to those teachers that came from other

607
00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:43,550
countries and still adhere to their traditional diets. Didn't get sick. Why? That's why you tell

608
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:49,870
me because the children, if you follow them on the grocery store with the mom and the shopping cart,

609
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:54,230
what look, examine what's in the shopping cart. The teacher goes to a similar grocery store,

610
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:59,030
look at her shopping cart. Guess what? In the winter, almost identical food with some,

611
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:06,450
but similar, you know, you see no concept. Um, and this is approved. I've done this. I've,

612
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:10,990
I've been looking at this concept now since the mid eighties and I've studied it. Whenever I heard

613
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:17,730
someone said, even in a conversation in a restaurant or somewhere, yeah, I got a cold

614
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:22,170
from, I caught it from the kids at school. I'd get up and say, hi, I'd like to meet you.

615
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:27,170
You're a teacher or so-and-so. Yeah. Uh, which school? And I would actually take time out and

616
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:36,070
investigate all the teachers get sick or just this one. Right. And it turns out just like I gave it

617
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:39,890
over and over. I would look at these scenarios. What's funny is that sometimes I tell people

618
00:55:39,890 --> 00:55:43,830
I've been studying medicine for over 35 years. They look at me and like, wow. You know, cause

619
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:48,410
doctors don't speak that way. Right. Right. They don't speak that way. They never study anything.

620
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:54,050
Well, unless they're told to, or unless some of them do, some of them do, but the specialty guys

621
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:59,190
will tell you, you know, continuously whatever. Yeah. So are you a doctor? I'm like, no,

622
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:03,870
are you kidding me? In order to be a doctor, you have to, you have to be state certified.

623
00:56:03,970 --> 00:56:08,890
If you notice anything, the state puts out, you know, first of all, anything past the eighth grade

624
00:56:08,890 --> 00:56:15,570
is a shame. Right. But, oh, but when you go to apply to medical school, uh, uh, they put this

625
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:20,990
pixie dust on your head and suddenly you become intelligent. Right. Yeah. The magic dust. Yeah.

626
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:25,610
Right. Yeah. Some of them do take magic dust by the way to stay in those schools. You know,

627
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:32,130
if you know what I mean? Well, there's that. So anyway, uh, so what I'd like to do is share

628
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:37,630
these perspectives and they're very, very, very, very simple, but here's the thing from mentioning,

629
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:42,390
hearkening back to the last one, you can have five people with the same condition and they go

630
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:48,190
into a Chinese apothecary, you know, and the guy comes out from the back to do a diagnosis.

631
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:51,670
All five of them have the same thing. I don't know what, what do you want to say?

632
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:57,790
What's the condition people typically get, you know, the sniffles, sore throat, right? Sure. A

633
00:56:57,790 --> 00:57:03,130
cold, a cold. Yeah. Right. Well, I assure you the five people that go in there, it doesn't matter

634
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:07,230
if they're white, black, yellow, green, whatever, they're going to have to be diagnosed separately.

635
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:10,450
And they're going to get a different prescription. You know, what, what the, he writes something down

636
00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:14,330
and the lady behind the counter goes, opens. He looked like fish bowls, but you know, take some

637
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:19,470
mouth, put wraps in a piece of paper, boil this in a pot and drink it. Right. So it's going to be

638
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:26,150
different for everyone based on your condition and your constitution. Now that is very different

639
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:30,590
from now. They have TV commercials. If you have this, go take this medicine. Is that just for

640
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:35,550
one person or for everybody watching the TV commercial to do it? No, no, that's everybody.

641
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:41,190
Here we go. The same chemical compound, because you put a description, well, not all of the

642
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:47,470
symptoms, but many of them. So therefore this. Yeah. Yeah. So how the contrast there,

643
00:57:47,850 --> 00:57:52,810
and I hate to say Eastern medicine. Yes. Cause it's been preserved by the Easterners is more

644
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:58,450
accurate to the Western medicine, which is all pharmaceutical, whatever, which is fine. I mean,

645
00:57:58,450 --> 00:58:03,030
well, actually it's not fun. The word pharma means poison in Greek. They call it pharma key,

646
00:58:03,030 --> 00:58:14,410
which is poison. Um, but, uh, the, the knowledge base, for example, that one has like, again,

647
00:58:14,410 --> 00:58:18,730
let's take the four people that have the common cold and they start using the principles that I

648
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:24,610
mentioned when they study root vegetables, they will naturally gravitate to some, some of those

649
00:58:24,610 --> 00:58:29,650
people will gravitate to some things and others will gravitate to others. And that will probably

650
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:36,190
be more correct for you on that level. What I found out with this, usually when people

651
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:41,290
understand the principles of energy, this is where the individual intuitive, the spiritual,

652
00:58:41,570 --> 00:58:46,830
all this stuff comes together is I find that when you have a person that says winter's coming

653
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:52,190
and I understand it's energetic and I need to, uh, my intake of food should be things that growing

654
00:58:52,190 --> 00:58:57,210
downward, right? In other words, root vegetables are very low to the ground or Hardy. Like for

655
00:58:57,210 --> 00:59:03,070
example, if you grow things like kale or collards or a Swiss chard, it seems like those things have

656
00:59:03,070 --> 00:59:08,270
antifreeze in them. If you have a winter freeze, everything dies, but these plants are still fine.

657
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:13,430
Right. Right. Imagine a lettuce in a freeze, what it looks like the next day, right? Mush

658
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:18,890
collard greens or a mustard greens or something like that. No problem.

659
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:24,010
Most likely not the mustard, most likely the collard, the kale, the Swiss chard.

660
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:28,470
You think it's pumped up with antifreeze, right? It looks just fine. It could take the freeze.

661
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:30,800
Mustard greens don't stand up like that. I thought they did.

662
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:36,230
They, no, not the ones I have here. They're very too thin. No, they, they will. They can. They're

663
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:41,230
in between. They're in between. Let's say, yeah, they can, they can, uh, the more peppery they are,

664
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:45,850
the less they hold up. All right. But here's my point. So if someone is looking for those,

665
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:49,870
uh, greens that have the antifreeze built in, you could look up frost Hardy greens

666
00:59:50,430 --> 00:59:55,450
and root vegetables. Four people have the same cold. Instead of going and watching the TV,

667
00:59:55,650 --> 00:59:59,330
I take the robot tests and whatever the, whatever, whatever they tell you to take or pills.

668
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:04,590
When they start researching, researching on this on four people, same condition that they need

669
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:09,230
winter's coming and they need to go for this, uh, frost Hardy plant or root vegetables.

670
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:14,190
Uh, you put four people, uh, let's say four computer terminals and you have them to pick

671
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:19,950
out on their own, which root vegetables they would prefer to go and shop or cook or, or have

672
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:26,330
someone shop and cook for them and which greens you'll notice, uh, the, the four people most

673
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:31,690
likely will have four different menus for different desires. Some might be, it'll be a little similar.

674
01:00:31,890 --> 01:00:38,350
Some will overlap, but not, not all four will be identical. And believe it or not, once a human,

675
01:00:38,350 --> 01:00:43,750
a man, woman, mankind understands these principles, they will make the more specific

676
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:49,370
right decision to suit their own body and specific on their own. You don't need someone to diagnose

677
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:54,650
you. Isn't that fantastic? That is that you will naturally gravitate towards the right thing for

678
01:00:54,650 --> 01:01:00,610
you. Yeah. That's what, that's, what's so interesting about this concept is that you end

679
01:01:00,610 --> 01:01:05,630
up being your own quote unquote doctor. How, I mean, how self-sufficient is that, right?

680
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:09,950
That's the best way to be. I mean, look, if you can prevent the problem to begin with

681
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:17,630
by staying in tune with what's going on and utilizing the energetic guidelines, the guideposts,

682
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:22,970
uh, it helps you avoid more things than you ever had to contend with, which is better to avoid,

683
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:29,270
right? Yeah. The point to underscore though, is that, uh, the fine tuning, like which vegetable

684
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:34,830
you would prefer, even the four root vegetables, one might prefer you, you might have four people

685
01:01:34,830 --> 01:01:39,590
prefer two of one and one of the other, whatever that will, you'll find is more correct. So there's

686
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:45,210
like this natural order that takes over, but, but here's the thing you said, it's a problem.

687
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:50,910
You know, it's not a problem. It shows the body is working. What's happening in the body is losing

688
01:01:50,910 --> 01:01:57,810
biological vacuum. Right? So it has to clog you up because obviously it's like, uh, you know,

689
01:01:57,810 --> 01:02:01,550
it's like, Hey, you know, uh, it's like the idiot lights on the dashboard, you know,

690
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:06,070
that check engine light and all that. Right. It's very much like that. It's like, Hey dummy,

691
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:10,190
you don't know that you're compromising the vacuum of the body. So what we're going to do

692
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:16,570
is, uh, where, where do you lose vacuum orifices, right? So we're going to start

693
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:22,010
plugging up your orifices. And if you don't believe this, by the way, the medical establishment has

694
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:29,850
taken on this term for that, um, for that, uh, application. And when a woman is pregnant at the

695
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:35,350
bottom of the cervix, it's what keeps the baby and they call it a mucus plug. Yeah. Yeah. That's

696
01:02:35,350 --> 01:02:40,250
what it's called. So you get, so I used to make jokes about that. You got mucus in your nose.

697
01:02:40,310 --> 01:02:43,250
That's like, you're a pregnant woman's cervix. You know, it's the same thing. And they're looking

698
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:48,230
at me like, what, you know, it's the same, same reaction to hold something in. Well,

699
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:51,650
it's true. Now, one of the things about like natural guidance and the things that can be

700
01:02:51,650 --> 01:02:57,350
provided to you, you know, by a simple, you know, just understanding the signals given,

701
01:02:58,110 --> 01:03:01,150
right. It's going to sound strange, but just bear with me a second. In other words,

702
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:05,270
that's not a problem. Having a cold is not a problem. It means the body's working really

703
01:03:05,270 --> 01:03:10,470
well, but it's uncomfortable to you, right? It's discomfort. But the thing I was going to get at

704
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:15,050
next was this, uh, the idea that signals are given to you and you have guidance,

705
01:03:15,050 --> 01:03:20,810
which is provided to you by just paying attention to certain things. Okay. You have a desire for

706
01:03:20,810 --> 01:03:25,210
something. Cause you were talking about how people naturally start to pick things. It seems to me as

707
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:30,590
though sometimes, uh, when you seem to have a desire to eat something, you, you, you suddenly,

708
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:36,470
uh, have a craving for something. Often this is created out of necessity. I think it's your body

709
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:41,770
telling you that you need that thing. You know, uh, the typical pregnant woman cravings and three

710
01:03:41,770 --> 01:03:45,510
in the morning, she pushes her husband out of bed. You got to go get me pickles and ice cream

711
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:49,830
right now. It's just the pregnant woman craving, but I mean, you ever just been sitting, I'm really

712
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:55,750
in the mood to eat this or that, uh, you know, maybe. Okay. So you're, you're in need of a root

713
01:03:55,750 --> 01:04:00,250
vegetables. Well, maybe you want carrots. Well, here's, let me, let me say something about that.

714
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:06,510
But if you have no idea of the energy flow and the energy contained there in of these things and how

715
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:11,910
it really matters, you are pre-programmed and you're going to express what I call emotional

716
01:04:11,910 --> 01:04:17,150
laziness. So you're, you say, uh, most people won't say root veg. Most people will say, I crave

717
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:24,510
chocolate ice cream or chocolate cake or Doritos or right. Because that's all they know. Right?

718
01:04:24,970 --> 01:04:31,550
So the, the reason for doing these discourses is so you understand that there's these energies

719
01:04:31,550 --> 01:04:37,170
are important and to become familiar with them. Right. And then once the, these choices are put

720
01:04:37,170 --> 01:04:41,330
in front of you, you make a decision. Uh, and that decision, what I'm saying again,

721
01:04:41,450 --> 01:04:46,310
I can't underscore this enough. Each person will make the more proper decision,

722
01:04:46,310 --> 01:04:50,190
but here's the thing. Let's say you're craving a sweet, you know, for example,

723
01:04:50,350 --> 01:04:54,690
as people ask me, what's your favorite food? I'm like, uh, what do you mean? Uh, savory or sweet,

724
01:04:54,850 --> 01:04:59,770
you know, a favorite for dessert, favorite as an entree. You can't ask someone what's my favorite

725
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:04,090
food. It's like, well, what's your favorite color? You mean for, for what? I mean, interior space,

726
01:05:04,130 --> 01:05:09,490
my clothes, the car, what, what these are stupid questions. Don't even bother. If someone says,

727
01:05:09,590 --> 01:05:12,990
do you believe in God? That's another stupid question. There is no such thing.

728
01:05:12,990 --> 01:05:17,910
Yeah. But with the idea that you're actually, you have some education on this, where you have

729
01:05:17,910 --> 01:05:24,670
an idea about how these things can be addressed. Then it might guide you to, okay. Uh, since I have

730
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:30,110
a certain feeling, then you, you could have simply a craving for it. Right. So I, you know what,

731
01:05:30,130 --> 01:05:35,670
I really want to eat some potatoes. Okay. Well, why do I want the potatoes? Uh, it starts to come

732
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:40,370
across. It might start to work together, right? Like both things work together and then your

733
01:05:40,370 --> 01:05:45,850
cravings can become potato. A potato for example, is a nightshade. So it's going to be very yeen,

734
01:05:46,190 --> 01:05:51,070
very expansive. So you don't want to eat much of it, but here's the thing. Let me just get into

735
01:05:51,070 --> 01:05:55,470
potatoes for a second. I'm going to do some solo Sonics on, on this stuff. And I think someone,

736
01:05:55,590 --> 01:06:01,130
Sam posted, it's all ready to go and it will be happening or it is happening. It needs to be

737
01:06:01,130 --> 01:06:06,590
worked out, but on cooking, but here's the thing you ever go to a fast food establishment or a

738
01:06:06,590 --> 01:06:11,270
restaurant, they say French fries, right? Yeah. And like, let me give you an example. A direct

739
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:15,590
example is a place called in and out burger. And I want to tell him, you got to change that on your

740
01:06:15,590 --> 01:06:20,470
menu. They're not French fries. Why? Because you see the guy, Oh, this is a really good French

741
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:23,830
fries. Cause they make them fresh. Yeah, they do. You see the guy there, he's peels the potatoes

742
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:27,930
and he cuts them right there, fries them. And then, uh, salt some and serves them. Those are

743
01:06:27,930 --> 01:06:33,710
not French fries in order to be French fries. You're ready. You take the potato, you peel,

744
01:06:33,710 --> 01:06:38,550
you cut it, you blanch it in boiling water, right? You take the potatoes out, you let them

745
01:06:38,550 --> 01:06:43,690
cool. Then you fry them until they're still white. Take them out, let them cool down. And then you

746
01:06:43,690 --> 01:06:50,070
fry them to crisp them Brown. So it's, it's three times cooked, right? French fry. So if you're just

747
01:06:50,070 --> 01:06:53,930
frying potatoes, like they do it in and out, those are not French fries. Those should be fried

748
01:06:53,930 --> 01:06:57,910
potatoes. I always make a big deal. I go in there and said, you got to change your menu. They're not

749
01:06:57,910 --> 01:07:02,530
French fries. They're fried potatoes. Big difference. Well, that's why the ones in McDonald's are done

750
01:07:02,530 --> 01:07:06,090
that way though, where they take them, they blanch them, they do that already. No, actually. Well,

751
01:07:06,130 --> 01:07:11,130
they're the ones that these main they're, they're pre they're frozen. They're frozen to the second

752
01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:15,930
stage. That's my point is that they're, they're frozen up to that point. They freeze them after

753
01:07:15,930 --> 01:07:19,990
they've done all those other things. Those are still French fries, but when you actually just

754
01:07:19,990 --> 01:07:22,890
cut them up fresh like that and you fry them, you're right. They're just fried potatoes. They're

755
01:07:22,890 --> 01:07:27,610
not French fries. They're fried potatoes. Right, exactly. So here's the point. Why are French

756
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:34,030
fries so popular and why do they work better than any other potato basically is because the very

757
01:07:34,030 --> 01:07:39,270
yin gets subjected to a young treatment first with water, then young fried, cool down back to

758
01:07:39,270 --> 01:07:43,750
eat and then young fried again. So it's more balanced, believe it or not, than just a fried

759
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:48,930
potato because you're hitting it. You're hitting it with the young. You remember cooking and food

760
01:07:48,930 --> 01:07:54,430
and heat is young. So, and then the salt is even more young. So a little bit of French fry would

761
01:07:54,430 --> 01:08:00,630
be more balanced than let's say something else. That's why I always suggest big potatoes. I've

762
01:08:00,630 --> 01:08:06,150
seen too many people heat up a massive oven and put two lonely potatoes in there. It looks kind

763
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:11,150
of stupid. You know, you open the oven and they let the thing go for an hour. I'm like, Oh my gosh,

764
01:08:11,230 --> 01:08:15,490
what a, you know, you could have heated like 15 homes in China or Japan with all that heat,

765
01:08:15,550 --> 01:08:20,970
you know, and that you burned electricity or whatever. So I tell people par boil them

766
01:08:20,970 --> 01:08:26,950
20 minutes in a pot and just turn the dump, the water put, leave the potatoes with the skin on

767
01:08:26,950 --> 01:08:32,390
in the pot, a low heat for five minutes, turn it off, come back, you know, tight lid and low heat,

768
01:08:32,470 --> 01:08:37,310
five minutes, turn the potato. And guess what? What you have left is resultant. Almost what

769
01:08:37,310 --> 01:08:42,290
is a baked potato and discernible really. And you've using so little energy, a tiny little

770
01:08:42,290 --> 01:08:46,710
burner, right? Right. I think we, you have a listener that really got, I think is, I don't

771
01:08:46,710 --> 01:08:51,229
mind him mentioning him, Joe. I think he was really excited years ago. He says, that's all,

772
01:08:51,229 --> 01:08:55,470
that's all the only way we do them now. Right. And it's much faster also. That's how he got into it.

773
01:08:55,490 --> 01:08:59,830
Yeah, exactly. Uh, that was like one of the first big things, you know what I do the potatoes. I'm

774
01:08:59,830 --> 01:09:04,450
like, okay. And I hadn't even heard it yet. He got excited. He got really excited. And I love that

775
01:09:04,450 --> 01:09:09,430
because it is exciting. Look at the amount of put a meter on the gas meter and see how much gas

776
01:09:09,430 --> 01:09:14,450
you're going to use. You doing it the traditional way and how much gas you're going to use doing it

777
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:18,770
this way. Stove top. Yeah. Next to nothing. If you do, and the time is in half, right? Yeah.

778
01:09:19,250 --> 01:09:23,189
And it's indiscernible. Uh, and if you really want to fool people, when you're almost done,

779
01:09:23,229 --> 01:09:26,630
wrap them in aluminum foil, put them back in the pocket, you know, they'll say, Oh, wow. You know,

780
01:09:26,710 --> 01:09:30,870
big potatoes and a half hour. Wow. Plus the skin isn't as dried out. You know, that's the other

781
01:09:30,870 --> 01:09:35,250
thing is that the actual potato skin is a lot more dried out. If you do it in the oven, if you do it

782
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:39,609
this way, you can do it. You can make it indiscernible, especially if the, if when the

783
01:09:39,609 --> 01:09:43,810
potato starts to soften and it's laying on the bottom of the pot, it'll get that, that bright

784
01:09:44,609 --> 01:09:49,430
orange, golden brown, caramel thick. You know, when they have a baked potato and it's leaning

785
01:09:49,430 --> 01:09:53,270
against the oven, it's kind of, it gets a little hard and caramel colored and it's real tasty,

786
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:58,950
real strong potato flavor. You can imitate that. You can imitate that. Of course it takes skill.

787
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:03,730
Some people have more skill than others, but here's the thing. I hate the, I don't want to

788
01:10:03,730 --> 01:10:09,850
get into the big feet thing, you know, again, but if you, if the better sense of smell and taste you

789
01:10:09,850 --> 01:10:14,090
have, the better, the more delicious your food will be. So if you're living amongst others,

790
01:10:14,470 --> 01:10:18,170
I'll say that again. If you're living amongst others, whoever those others might be, women,

791
01:10:18,330 --> 01:10:23,770
children, wives, husbands, grandma, whatever you need to figure out who has the best smell,

792
01:10:24,110 --> 01:10:28,290
sense of smell and the best sense of taste and guess what their job will be.

793
01:10:28,510 --> 01:10:33,670
The chef will cook nothing. Yeah. There are going to be ones that do in the cooking. And guess what?

794
01:10:34,210 --> 01:10:40,350
Once you figure that out and you appoint that person to do that task, everyone will be a lot

795
01:10:40,350 --> 01:10:44,950
happier, right? It doesn't work that way. What if you live in a traditional family,

796
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:50,850
which may not exist anymore, where the woman does all the cooking and between her living home

797
01:10:50,850 --> 01:10:54,650
parents and her husband and her children, she's the one that has the worst sense of smell and taste.

798
01:10:54,890 --> 01:11:00,690
Guess what the food's going to be like. Yeah, it's going to be rough for everyone. So when people say

799
01:11:00,690 --> 01:11:04,450
my mom's cooking sucks, I say, oh, probably she didn't have a good sense of smell or taste.

800
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:11,630
Yeah, she she never had a sense of smell. She had a problem. See, how do you know? I'm psychic. That's

801
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:19,290
why I'm psychic. The other one is when you go to a diner or a restaurant and you order an entree,

802
01:11:19,390 --> 01:11:22,170
you go with someone else, they order another entree or whatever, and you're eating it and

803
01:11:22,170 --> 01:11:25,750
you're like, how's your food? And you're like, oh, my food's a little salty. Everything's

804
01:11:25,750 --> 01:11:30,290
a little salty. Let me taste yours. Hey, yours is salty, too. And then the waitress comes. How's

805
01:11:30,290 --> 01:11:36,330
everything? I said, you know, the way the cook eats a lot of sweets, doesn't he? And she's like,

806
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:40,090
yeah, how do you know? Do you know? No, no, I'm psychic.

807
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:47,830
No, because he eats a lot of sweets or internally he's overly leaned and his body needs to express

808
01:11:48,230 --> 01:11:53,590
some young, but he's eating all the sweets. And if he eats the young, he'll crash. Right. So what

809
01:11:53,590 --> 01:11:58,270
he does is he starts adding all the salt that he should be taking to everyone else's food. Right.

810
01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:04,350
Because you need the salt to balance the sweet, you know, Coca-Cola recipe, right? A teaspoon of

811
01:12:04,350 --> 01:12:09,510
sugar and a teaspoon of salt. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Of course. Yeah. OK. So so this is what's going.

812
01:12:09,590 --> 01:12:13,970
So, you know, people like, oh, yeah, he's psychic. That's how he knows. It's like, oh, my God. So

813
01:12:13,970 --> 01:12:19,670
