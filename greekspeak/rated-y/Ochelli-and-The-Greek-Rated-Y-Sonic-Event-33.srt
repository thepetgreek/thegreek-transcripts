1
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:25,280
Event number 33 in the Sonic Listings on Ocelli and the Greek Rated Y, so here we are.

2
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:33,840
And let's begin where we started before we started recording real fast. Greek, you know,

3
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:41,480
people occasionally get intimidated by some people's presence. And I was sharing with you

4
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,420
just before we went to air and you said I should be recording this. So here we go.

5
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:52,140
I have two odd reactions with people in person, and it's totally different from what they get off

6
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,860
me this way, you know, through the recordings. If you've never met me, never been face to face

7
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:01,860
with me, never been in the same room with me, they have one impression of me, and it's usually not

8
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:06,940
very accurate. It's very interesting, the ideas people have about me. But when people get around

9
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:12,040
me in person, one of two things seems to happen. Either I'm a very, very heavy, like deep dark

10
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:19,220
sort of presence, almost foreboding, or I'm unnoticeable. I seem to slip in and out and like

11
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:25,580
I'm invisible to them emotionally, like I don't shake up a room or I'm a heavy presence,

12
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:31,600
one or the other. It's these two weird extremes. And you were talking about because I mentioned

13
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,180
to you that somebody emailed me that said that they were a little intimidated by you.

14
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,700
They didn't say that directly, but that's what I gathered from what they were saying.

15
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,220
And they didn't want me to pass along the email to you, but gave me permission to talk about it on

16
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:50,340
Sonic. So we'll get into that in a minute. But what about that, you know, being in person with

17
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,400
somebody and picking up something like that? What does that indicate? What do you have to

18
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:00,000
say about that? In person, I want to just deal with the first part, when you're through the

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,660
Sonics. What's interesting about technology, you know, remember the old rabbit ear TVs,

20
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,979
you're not getting the image, you got to start playing with it, right? So you can actually

21
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:16,060
using technology, even like before the technology of the written word, when people were pen pals,

22
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,080
they fell in love and they made each other and they're like, Oh, you're nothing like the letters,

23
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:26,360
right? Because it's technology or you can tweak your persona with technology, right?

24
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:33,580
So that's the first part. Oh, this is true. And I've met people in person that I've encountered,

25
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:38,680
you know, doing shows and things. And they do look a little different. They do feel a little

26
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:44,880
different. They sound generally the same, right? The technology is a filter. And let's go back,

27
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,540
forget about the computers. Back when people used to write letters to each other,

28
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,460
the pen pal thing, remember? Or even the telephone. I remember the telephone. Yeah,

29
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,980
there you go. It's technology. You and I are old enough that there was a point in time when

30
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,680
people would meet and somehow you'd end up like in a telephone conversation with a girl or something

31
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,300
for a little while. I mean, as teenagers, did you ever have that experience?

32
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,220
Yeah. Like, you know, you got a friend. Okay. So the friend's trying to hook up with this girl.

33
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,440
He's over your house. He's talking to the girl over the phone and she goes, Hey, look,

34
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,280
I'm here with my friend. Do you have a friend there? And all of a sudden you get introduced

35
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,720
to friends. This, by the way, is a weird thing because this is how I'm told my parents actually

36
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,060
met each other. And I met a couple of the girlfriends, you know, in my early teenage years,

37
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:35,720
exactly that way where it was like I got a telephone handed to me and then started a

38
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,840
conversation with somebody I didn't know. Pleasant voice went with it. Definitely created a picture

39
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:47,020
of who they were in my mind that hardly ever really totally matched exactly who I met.

40
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:53,120
I mean, it was close, but never exact. You know what I mean? And I would go off of some of what

41
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,160
they described themselves as, which is part of the projection, the intentional part that they put out.

42
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,920
And this is with a phone, by the way, not with a computer, but I mean, just with a telephone alone,

43
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,340
right? You could have impressions. And then what your mind does with them

44
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,620
is another issue. And what your emotions do with it on top of that, by interpreting what your

45
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:17,820
mind has decided is the picture is the image is the experience, right? Or reading what the other

46
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:25,020
people have. I'll say this humbly. I've always whenever I met women, they were always like,

47
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:31,300
oh, hello, right? It's like, come over and meet this guy or whatever. And I'm like, they're like,

48
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:36,640
okay. And they see me like, oh, hello, you know, so I've always had women being attracted to me.

49
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:43,840
So it's kind of an unfair advantage in that respect on that side. And on the on the on the

50
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,760
other race, because there's two races, male and female, right, man and woman. It's, it's where

51
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,280
the more of the dynamics are based on what you were saying, you're invisible, or you're, or they

52
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,400
see you as being heavy or something like that. But well, that's, that's the weird thing, too,

53
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,400
is with the opposite sex, because I was going with everybody overall, with the overall impression

54
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,620
about when they meet me in person, with the opposite sex, I would tell you that women to one

55
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:15,540
of two extreme reactions, right? Either and who cares? Or Wow, the Hello, usually, it would be

56
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,720
focused on Oh, you have, you know, beautiful blue eyes, because I have an unusual color blue eyes,

57
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:26,040
because of my, my, my condition, right? Because I'm lacking pigment in my eyes. So it's a weird

58
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:31,320
color blue. It's an odd sort of color blue, or it's just, yeah, not blue. Yeah, I don't trust

59
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,480
the scientific reasoning anymore, by the way. But it's good to mention is allegedly allegedly,

60
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:43,520
but here, here, let's, let's, I feel like we're going a little wonky. So what's interesting about

61
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:50,900
it is, look at the intelligence operatives perspective on the on that, because the email,

62
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,220
there's a lot of talk about the email, I want to say a few things about it, maybe.

63
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:59,120
When you're an intelligence operative, and you want to go check out another society,

64
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:06,120
you become a bartender, taxi driver, or homeless person, vagabond looking Why? Because those people

65
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,460
are generally those that's the two first two are service industry that are no one pays attention to.

66
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:16,600
And the third one is a aspect or rank in society that no one pays attention to.

67
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:23,440
So actually not being paid attention to is the best way for the one who is not being

68
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,400
attention to be paid attention to to collect as much as they want, if they can. Well,

69
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,400
that's what they do. Yeah, because people would relax. Look, a homeless guy. Okay,

70
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,400
it's just a homeless guy. He happens to be around. So no matter what you're doing,

71
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,680
it just you know, it's a matter of proximity. Yeah, I've done that. And there's you're completely

72
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,920
invisible. There are people. There's a woman and a man ready to cross the street. And I'm standing

73
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:56,060
there looking homeless. And she's like, you know, you can't just push it in so hard. You got to wait

74
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,980
for me to adjust my diaphragm. You know, it's like, that's not really good, you know, to do

75
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:05,720
that. Just like, you know, I'm like, Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. You know, this is back in the days

76
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:11,000
when we use diaphragms, right? So who cares if the homeless guy hears this? Yeah, no, it's like,

77
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,200
oh, my gosh. And then the next, you know, few hours or so I start hearing conversations about

78
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:21,640
like the deepest, most personal stuff, financial stuff. You know, what they're going to do,

79
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:27,720
personal stuff, family stuff, business stuff. Oh, my gosh, even on the telephone on the cell phone,

80
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:33,560
right? Super private cell phone conversation. No, not if a homeless guy is there. It's still

81
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:40,820
in other words, it's still super private for them, but you know, so it's look at it that way.

82
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:46,840
It doesn't matter what they think. It's what you think based on what you think. In other words,

83
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:54,740
you know, I always say people look for approval, right? Okay. All right. So why do some people,

84
00:07:55,100 --> 00:08:00,740
if I never wonder what someone else was wondering about you, it's always from the

85
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:06,860
perspective of what you want to get out of the situation, what you see the situation as being.

86
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,920
And like I've said before, if you go into any group of people, which is two or more

87
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:17,860
and you're not in control, guess what? That situation is out of control because people

88
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:22,380
don't know anything there. In other words, they're unlawful. They're as seen, listen to them

89
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:28,300
speak. Every word, every thought is as seen on TV, right? But their behavior will adjust based

90
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,860
on how they interpret you to be there. Cause like you're saying, I mean the old,

91
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,840
what is the old expression? Blending in, right? You go somewhere, you blend in,

92
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:41,260
you don't stand out. Then therefore you're not a factor. So their behaviors are unaffected.

93
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:46,960
If you project that, if that's the thing that you're projecting, right? So doesn't this have

94
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:51,360
to do with the emo when you're projecting, you know, you're sort of, you know, could be easily

95
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:57,040
misunderstood. Um, the emo could be misunderstood. The emo is not something on its own.

96
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,500
It's something that we have that here. The first thing I talk about when I introduced the emo is

97
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:09,120
the thing to really lean on. They try to give us reasons for all these things, these aspects,

98
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,120
senses, and things that we have about our ourselves. Right. But they never address

99
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,020
them. Meaning the authority of the people who were supposedly, right. They never address why

100
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:21,720
we have emotions. Never, never, ever. But we've always find out that the emotions are the strongest

101
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:27,320
drive or impetus or catalyst or change that anyone can have in their life. The example I give is the

102
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,520
mild mannered guy winds up shooting everybody at work. Is it never, no one would have ever expected

103
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:36,980
that it was emotional that drove them to do it, right? There's other things too, but the emo then

104
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:42,120
connects to the inner voice, which is not you, which I keep talking about, right? Which is another

105
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,640
entity. So all these things tie in. It's not, people are trying to still, I noticed in the chat,

106
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:54,140
tie the emo to other things that we see in scripture that they see in memorialized and

107
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,040
from ancient times. By the way, I just want to throw this out. Someone put a thing about the

108
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,600
evil eye and it has nothing to do with the emo. The evil eye was the eye of God. It was also,

109
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,320
it's a part of the crossing, the crossing. Archaics talks about that a lot. Jason Breshears,

110
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:14,560
the Phoenix phenomenon, right? The, the, everything, all the planets go from east to west.

111
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,120
I was been aware of this for, since the eighties, but I never got into it. I'm glad he has,

112
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,980
because if I want to listen to something on the internet, I'll put him on in the background,

113
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,000
see what kind of, because I'm a history buff. People who remember me from the days of,

114
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:33,240
with Seth Michael in 2010, a revolution radio, I was always saying, you want a new idea,

115
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,700
go to an old book. You got to look at the old books before 18, before 20th century.

116
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:42,380
Breshears is saying the same thing. His whole thing that I thank him a lot for is the 138

117
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:49,400
Phoenix cycle, right? Sometimes it's bad. Sometimes it's not so bad. And the 552 cycle

118
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:54,640
and all that. So all those ancient things, if you see something round and it brings bad

119
00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:01,420
in ancient times, it's the crossing. It's what I mean by the crossing is we see all the planets

120
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:05,080
and stars have gone on the ecliptic. They go east to west, east to west, east to west.

121
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,920
Well, the crossing means you have an object coming from north to south crossing it, right?

122
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:14,100
That's what the sun disc, the cross was that the right, that the ancients use,

123
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:18,380
sort of like the crucifix, it's the cry. And when that comes, it's always bad.

124
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:24,520
Always. Well, that's why the sacred cross is a constant disruptor in ancient scripture,

125
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:29,880
ancient scriptures and symbology. The, the cross itself, not the, you know,

126
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,540
the crucifix symbology. No, no. Well, that's the symbology that we use around, but they,

127
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,060
they just overlap it. Right. Well, before that, the X, so to speak, where you have

128
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:44,860
it's the cross. So, right. Yeah. And it says it goes like the evil light goes back 5,000 years.

129
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:50,520
Well, he, guess what? Another thing this person posted also is about the, I do appreciate their

130
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:55,660
postings by the way, about old texts. And I've never said it this way before, but this is my

131
00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:01,300
mindset from the beginning for three decades. Now, every ancient text that's out there that

132
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:07,040
you have access to, right. Check it out, check it out. Right. And the second, first thing is

133
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,780
check it out. Just get familiar with it. Even if it's not interesting, get familiar with it.

134
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,500
Cause it'll come up again. You'll see things that are used from it. Right. That are never given

135
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:20,920
credit. Right. The second thing you have to, whenever you see an old text, any old text,

136
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:26,100
biblical, any, any, any, any, any culture, any culture in the world at any time, that's old.

137
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:31,280
When I say old, more than 150 years old now. Right. Why are they letting it in public?

138
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:40,760
Hmm. Why? Because 99% of all the ancient texts are hidden. So more than 99%. Right. Right. So,

139
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:46,160
you know, I say we found this ancient text. What are you talking about? There are perfect records.

140
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:51,000
I mean, not even a crease on the page from 5,000 years ago that still exist.

141
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,660
If you, if you saw it, it would look like it was written a month ago.

142
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:58,780
Right. That are preserved that, that carefully, not on the surface though.

143
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:06,040
Hmm. Not for you. Right. So anything that's old, anything, you know, here's the thing. You want to

144
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:11,020
have fun with this. You want to make it light and easy to study old stuff. Sure. Uh, go look up on

145
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:17,720
the internet, uh, vintage ads from 1800s. Just have fun with it. What does an ad do? An ad has

146
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:22,380
to appeal to the society. Some people, a sector of the society, a group of, you know, what do you

147
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:27,020
call it? Demographic. Right. Sure. Go check it out. And that's all I'm going to say about that.

148
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:32,040
And then you'll see what I'm talking about. Well, there's a target audience and that target

149
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,760
audience could be, uh, dependent upon many different things. Right. I matter of fact,

150
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,380
I've gone back for, you know, studying a big pharmaceutical companies. I've gone back and

151
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:47,540
studied the ads that they used to have for women, uh, you know, for their menstrual cramps and how

152
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:52,140
they would sell them a opium basically for their menstrual cramps. Right. Uh, I know that sounds

153
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:59,200
pretty mundane, but you can see how the ad is structured to get women to understand this will

154
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:04,860
give you a relief from this problem. You have to go back to cooking and looking pretty. Yeah. Right.

155
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,000
So, you know, you want to feel better. Here you go. We got a way for you to feel better.

156
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:13,060
Uh, and it's, you know, a little piece of a newspaper. Yeah. Also it's how it's done.

157
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:17,600
The demographic was the way people, it has to appeal to a mindset, right? Like, uh,

158
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,360
look at the stuff they put out today for people. The mindset is horrible. And guess what? If you go

159
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:28,580
out and look at the mindset of people, it's well, in my opinion, you have a gender, you have an age

160
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:33,340
group because obviously up to a certain age, you don't have menstruation after a certain age. You

161
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:38,680
don't have menstruation. So you have a target of an age group automatically built into this. You

162
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:43,820
have a gender automatically built into this. You have a, a linguistic built into it because it's

163
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:48,140
printed in whatever language it's printed in. Right. Right. But what I mean about the,

164
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:54,020
going back to the eight 1800s is old, right? Yeah. Uh, mid 20th century, there was a flip,

165
00:14:54,080 --> 00:15:00,100
right? After world war two, especially after Vietnam. Well, okay. That's a whole other thing.

166
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,820
The study of what's being shown. The important thing is to know that anything that you're being

167
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:11,360
shown that's old is for a reason. Why are they, why is it being allowed to be shown? Because it

168
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,980
can easily be, which it is right now. History is being changed. I know people that have children

169
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:21,480
and I always chide them about what are you doing? Keeping children public school. What's wrong with

170
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,160
you, man? Uh, they're saying, well, the history they're being taught is nothing like the history

171
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,240
I was taught, you know, and they're in their forties or whatever. Right. Well, look, it's one,

172
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:33,580
one mistake I'm not making, but I do observe what, uh, you know, some of Frankie's playmates are

173
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:39,300
being taught about history. Dear God. Uh, what a mess. Yeah, it's all, but it's a look at the

174
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:45,200
human body, you know, blood pressure, diabetes, uh, you absorb nutrition calories. My favorite.

175
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,600
Yeah. Really? You got calories, calories matter. Oh, it means you go to the bathroom. You don't

176
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:55,720
wipe because you, you know, it's charcoal, right? Yeah. Okay. So let's get into it. Yeah. The email

177
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,100
basically from the gist of it, we got earlier was, where do you start right with the Greek speak

178
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,680
stuff? Well, thinking about and asking the question, where do you start? Is the start

179
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:10,820
don't, don't think about where to start. Just do. And what you do is what you feel is the best at

180
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:15,960
the moment. Right. And, but best at the moment, you know, I'm not even going to say, you know,

181
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:20,360
that helps others and is good for you. What is best at the moment based on the stuff that I lean

182
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:25,360
on. That's really simple. Yeah. And in fairness, it seemed to me like he was leaning on, okay. You,

183
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,980
you often talk about, you know, what are the things that you can improve easily? Uh, your,

184
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:35,660
your food, your water, right? Your shelter, your clothing. Okay. Uh, so those things,

185
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:40,860
if you begin there, that's not a bad place to start for sure. Food, food, clothing, shelter,

186
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:47,240
the, okay. This is a mismatch. This is what I do for, for personally food, clothing, shelter,

187
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:53,520
start clean. Uh, like if you speak to people who have some Jewish heritage and they're not Jewish,

188
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,480
right. And they'll say my grant, like, let's say the mother's side was just, so the grandmother

189
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,380
was Jewish, right? So my grandmother, she ate clean. They won't say she was kosher or they were,

190
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:07,640
she was, you know, biblical law or anything like that. They just say, when you hear eating clean

191
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:13,140
means they're using, you know, no pork, no shrimp, no lobster, no clams. Right. Right. It doesn't mean

192
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:17,760
now like no, no fat, you need fat. The reason it's like, you know, your brain stopped working.

193
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:25,480
If you don't eat fat, so clean with the food, uh, food, clothing, clean, learn how to clean

194
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:30,180
your clothing. I still get, uh, when I meet people, let's say, uh, when I used to meet people

195
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:34,280
on a roommate level, we're going to live together as roommates, or, uh, you're going to couple up

196
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:39,700
with someone, or you're going on a camping trip or a vacation where you're living with other people

197
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:44,140
for what a few days, maybe a week or two or three, or maybe a month. Right. Right. You start,

198
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,260
what I've always found is I can't help it. I start sharing on tips on how to get your,

199
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:53,500
your clothing clean, their stains, how to get rid of stains, uh, body, body fluid,

200
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,960
stains, armpits, uh, stains from foods and other things all the way down to, you can imagine,

201
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:02,420
right? What the easiest thing to do. I've never mentioned this before, other than the

202
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:07,440
hydrogen peroxide is a strong oxidizer and a spray bottle as a cleaner in the house, right? Like if

203
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,260
you have a pet and it throws up, you wipe it up and you come back with hydrogen peroxide, wipe it

204
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:16,880
up. Always put a plastic bag over your hand, right? I can't stand. See, seeing people pick up

205
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,080
something that's foul, uh, with a paper. We think the paper towels impervious, put a plastic bag

206
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,700
over your hand, then grab the net, right? Or glove. Right. And you save the plastic bags or

207
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:32,180
whatever. So hydrogen peroxide and spray ball, excellent oxidizer works really, really well for

208
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:37,640
like blood and organics, armpit stains, you know, the yellow, whatever, uh, that's a urea. It has a

209
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:44,700
low pH, not too low. It could damage cotton. By the way, if you have organic fiber and it's very,

210
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:51,600
very dry out and hot in temperature. And the peroxide happens to be strong. Uh, when you put

211
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,900
apply peroxide, you'll notice it starts to smoke. As a matter of fact, if you use the

212
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,900
pharmaceutical or military grade peroxide, which is 33%, it will catch on fire. I don't know if

213
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:06,560
you've ever seen that. No, I've never seen that. It's rudimentary rocket fuel. You've heard of

214
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:11,480
liquid rocket fuel, right? Of course. That's, that's, that's hydrogen peroxide is C one thirties.

215
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:14,780
When they have a payload, that's too much. And they have a problem taking off on the runway.

216
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,220
They attach hydrogen peroxide rockets. They don't call them hydrogen peroxide rockets. That's what

217
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:23,000
they are. And you could see videos of them. They're like a skinny, look like very skinny pipes

218
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,760
and this bright, bright orange, red, orange, yellow flame comes out the back hydrogen peroxide. Um,

219
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:35,360
so I noted that you don't have as much of a discharge of any sort chemical reaction.

220
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,400
Uh, when, when you have a lot more humidity, I think in a drier climate, you see more of that

221
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:44,380
smoke though. Don't you? Or is that has to be very dry because what happens is if it's not dry,

222
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:49,160
it's diluted. Yeah. Well, again, with a lot of humidity, a lot of moisture in the air though,

223
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:54,160
it kind of dilutes it on the reaction. Yeah. There's a, there's a, it's an oxidizer. All

224
00:19:54,160 --> 00:20:00,200
oxidizers require, you know, certain conditions depending on the oxidizer. But so basically I get

225
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,960
into doing the laundry well, right? Okay. And then the next thing is shelter. Well, again,

226
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:10,420
where do you start with your shelter? Um, uh, Oh, by the way, always when you wear anything other

227
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:15,280
than a t-shirt or sweat pants, make it look like it's pressed. I used to always, uh, get the

228
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,200
coupons at the, at the cleaners, a dollar to launder a shirt. And I like them. They're folded.

229
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:25,300
I ask for extra starch to come with the cardboard band, you know, you know what I mean? It's kind

230
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:30,380
of classy. You know, you got the nice creases and the show, you know what I mean? So, uh,

231
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:35,180
I used to do that. Not anymore. But by the way, if you have a laundry line in a dryer or whatever,

232
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:40,560
hang the clothes on the laundry line and then go to the dryer saves a lot of energy that way.

233
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,020
Never dry your shirts, dress shirts, man or woman, uh, all the way in the dryer, uh,

234
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:51,880
saves on ironing. And it looks real sharp. What you do is you have them damp, dry, uh, 90% dried

235
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:58,680
is fine. 75% might be better. And you hang the shirt on the line. How, uh, from the label to

236
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:03,040
the tail of the shirt. So the sleeves are pointing down towards the ground. So right in the middle of

237
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:07,800
the collar, you start fold, you fold the shirt from the middle of the back of the collar to the

238
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,500
middle of the bottom tail of the shirt. Right. And just pull it real tight. Put that over the

239
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:17,220
laundry line, let it hang. So the, so the, uh, collar is open sleeves pointing towards the

240
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,740
ground. It takes up a lot of room in a laundry line, but there's shirts that you could overlap

241
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:26,040
them. Guess what? If you final dry your shirts that way, they look like they were pressed.

242
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,540
It stretches. It looks, it has, in other words, the shirt has a nice body. You know,

243
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:34,940
it's wrinkled. It doesn't have body to it. Right. But the shoulder. Right. So it has

244
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,800
really nice body and all that. I just want to give that tip that I'm going to, that's

245
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:44,000
by the way, greekspeak.com, greekspeak.com. It's a double E on the speak part is the solo

246
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,760
Sonics. That's going to be starting soon. Uh, there's an intro with the Archon, but I'm going

247
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:55,820
to be putting very, very heavy kind of monotonous, not monotonous, but details on these things and

248
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,860
just going through it very, very fast. So Chuck doesn't have to be subject to it. And it is

249
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:05,920
subscriber only also. Interesting thing about this, hanging the shirts this way, uh, just real

250
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:10,620
fast. What about, uh, doing it with the, uh, I've seen it done with the upright stick method.

251
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:14,800
And sometimes that comes out nice and pressed looking. Yeah, it can, it can, but don't,

252
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,740
don't do this. It's too elaborate. Okay. Elaborate the stick. Yeah. This is simple.

253
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,600
You could do that. This is really, you get laundry lines. As a matter of fact, they got laundry lines.

254
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:26,340
Now you hook them on a door or something for apartments, you know? Oh yeah. There's a big

255
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:31,980
comeback for that for some reason. Uh, the other thing, you know, laundry line is multi-use,

256
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,140
right? Well, people are trying to save energy, I think is what it is. Cause you know,

257
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:39,760
electric bills are getting ridiculous, especially in other countries. Uh, uh, quite frankly in the

258
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:46,520
U S you know, we're getting hurt with our power bills. Uh, it's because the federal

259
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:51,400
stimulus checks, I don't know. I didn't, I wasn't very vocal. I said, don't do the stimulus.

260
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:55,660
Tell everybody, stop sending some stimulus checks back. If you get a stimulus check,

261
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:59,700
you're going to pay for it a hundred times in a decade, 10 times for sure. Real soon.

262
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:05,980
It's a scam. People don't know how the money it's the easiest thing to destroy a society using the

263
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:11,100
money system because they know nothing about it. Do not use banking. If you cannot like,

264
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,680
in other words, the minimal, minimal, absolute minimal. And if you have the

265
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:19,220
digital transactions or whatever, keep them to an absolute minimal, you know, when you write,

266
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:23,340
I think I've talked about many times when you write a check to someone and you go back and you

267
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:26,220
see the a hundred, let's say you write a check for a hundred bucks and you come back and you see

268
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:31,620
the a hundred bucks has gone from the account you're using. No, you reason. Oh, that's because

269
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:35,380
you know, Chuck got the check, right? And my bank took the check. No, the money's still in your

270
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:40,400
name. And the legal side is the money that you write for a check for is created with the other

271
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:46,140
person's signature. Nothing ever leaves one account and goes to the other. Uh, it's so

272
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:50,860
pathetic. It's so horrible what they're doing under the old fractional reserve rules that actually

273
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:56,200
creates a thousand dollars, a thousand dollars and they, and they on the other side, right? So

274
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:01,320
the bank keeps the 900 in this case. Good. But when the government sends you a stimulus check,

275
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:08,900
you know, they're 30 trillion in debt. They can't even, they can, by law, they cannot even pay their

276
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:15,900
employees at all. Right. At all. And as a matter of fact, for many years, the IRS employees,

277
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:20,360
um, their paychecks came from the department of agriculture. And someone asked one of the

278
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:28,440
IRS people, the admins, why is the department of agriculture doing your payroll? And the IRS people

279
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:34,820
said, Oh, because they have a better accounting system. No, I'm serious. It's not based on any

280
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:39,920
accounting. Look, for example, I know someone that the people that are keeping track of

281
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:45,620
ostensibly, uh, you know, again, agriculture shake, the IRS is a shakedown operation. It has

282
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:51,580
nothing to do with, uh, going anything or you owe the, it's all present. It's like, if I write you

283
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:56,600
a bill for $10,000 for whatever. And if you don't answer it, you owe it. Right. Even though I never

284
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,020
met you this, you know, they were actually foreclosing on people's houses. Didn't have

285
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:05,260
mortgages using this system. IRS uses that system. Give me an example. I know someone who gets a

286
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:09,160
didn't think about it much. The IRS says, well, your tax returns,

287
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,460
not getting anything back this year. Plus you owe us 1,500 bucks. And he's like, Oh yeah,

288
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,960
I don't want to owe. I'm an honest American. I don't want to owe them 15 or so. He writes

289
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:22,100
him a check for 1,500 bucks, right? The IRS three months later, he gets another bill from the IRS

290
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:28,280
for 1,500 bucks. And it says, what's the 1,500 bucks again for, it says for processing the check

291
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:36,200
for 1,500 bucks, right? There's no, no one owes money to anybody for anything. This is a scam

292
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:43,640
beyond, but you know what? If the people didn't allow it, it wouldn't last a week. I assure you

293
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,260
that. And that's how they want it. That's why I want nothing to do with these people here on this

294
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:52,680
planet. You know, this is across the globe. I have no sympathy for them. You know, recently I hear,

295
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:58,180
Oh, they person passed. I got no sympathy for them. No sympathy for them. You know,

296
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,980
what about you? So when I say to me, well, if I pass, you throw me in a dumpster.

297
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:06,180
The problem you're going to find by throwing me in a dumpster is that they're locking all

298
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:10,540
the dumpsters now. So you'll have to throw me under the dumpster or on top of the dumpster. Okay.

299
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:14,920
So that's what I think about being here. That's what I think about the people here.

300
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:22,020
It's really, really that bad in reality, not the harmonic romanticism. Oh, I want to make the world

301
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:26,480
better. Oh, people are okay. If they only know they're not okay. Even if they only whatever.

302
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:30,540
All right. So wouldn't it be more productive to stick you in a garden though, instead of the

303
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:34,860
dumpster? I mean, whatever that, well, that's too much effort. And because if you throw me in the

304
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:38,640
garden, you're going to put flowers and you're going to be safe. Pretty thing. No, don't just,

305
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,440
just piss on me. If you have to, it's really disgraceful to be here from every aspect.

306
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:50,240
Just by looking around. I mean, geez Louise, but look, I have incredible memories and visuals of

307
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:56,060
all the beauty here in nature. And in some people, some people I'm holding up one hand and maybe one

308
00:26:56,060 --> 00:27:02,520
finger down when I say some people. So how many fingers am I holding up? Right? So here's the

309
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:08,860
thing, food, clothing, shelter, shelter, guess what? Keep it clean. You, you like, for example,

310
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:12,980
back in the days, I get an apartment. I walk, I get to one of those sponge mops, right? And I

311
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:18,800
sponge mop all the walls and the, and the ceiling even right before I start living in it. Right.

312
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:24,240
Just clean it out really, really well. So the first step, where do you start cleaning food,

313
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,860
clothing, shelter, cleaning, how do you clean your food? Greek eat clean. How do you clean

314
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:33,740
your clothes? Greek? Well, there's lots of tips on the way. I just gave you some, right? And how

315
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:38,120
do you clean your shelter? Well, there you go. Certain things, by the way, if you live in a

316
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:43,440
place with carpeting and it has that foam carpet, not the, not the jute, you know, not the jute

317
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:49,720
backing, the natural jute, but that foam stuff, you know, that looks like you ever see white

318
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:53,960
people make scrambled eggs. Anyway, you have an omelet. It looks like that carpet foam. Anyway,

319
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:59,220
that stuff is constantly giving off urea and all kinds of nasty stuff. So you have to live

320
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:05,800
with the window slightly open all year round. It's constantly outgassing constantly foam,

321
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:11,420
mattresses, foam for in the furniture. You have to, if you have enough of that stuff in the space

322
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:16,360
that you live, you have to always have a window slightly open. As a matter of fact, a lot of the

323
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:20,940
new houses, what they have now is like, you know, a little bathroom fans, right? They go on the

324
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:24,840
ceiling. They go to the highest point in the house and they have one of those things running 24,

325
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:30,240
seven. So when someone opens and closes the door, it gets to a little fresh air exchange, right?

326
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,300
You could look this up and what they do with the, especially the new builders,

327
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,700
every two years, they come in and change it. Well, the house is under warranty or whatever,

328
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:41,980
but usually they burn out and people forget. And then all children start dying of allergies.

329
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:48,400
Allergy just means sensitivity. Now from the spiritual side of things, this is good to

330
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:53,060
cleanse and clear a space that you're going to live in. You're going to occupy

331
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:59,680
quite often. Anyhow too, right? Easy, easy to do that. Okay. In order for a spirit to,

332
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:04,440
okay, you have a spectrum of spirits, let's say from good to bad, right?

333
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:09,500
They're polarized, really, really polarized. You know what I mean by polarized? Like if you throw

334
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:13,220
a piece of metal on a magnet, boom, it sticks to the magnet. It's kind of hard to get off. That's

335
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:17,420
the extreme polarity, right? Of what I mean by that. The really good spirits don't come to you.

336
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:21,480
The really bad spirits don't come to you because you have to be very much on the end of the

337
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:29,900
polarity, right? Heavy drug use, heavy insanity for the negative spirits to come. And for the good

338
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:36,400
spirits to come, we're talking about piousness and a level of dedication that most people

339
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:42,400
wouldn't have, right? So someone in the middle, spiritual cleansing has a lot to do with that

340
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,020
understanding that little voice in your head that sounds like you, that you think is you,

341
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:51,160
that talks to you. It's not you. That keeps, that changes. I think just to recap,

342
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:58,120
how many times have you heard people say, oh yeah, I love this guy's YouTube channel. I woke up in

343
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:03,100
2010. I started listening to that, right? How many times you heard that, right? A lot. Okay.

344
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:07,340
Well, when you get through with something like that, or let's say you become, oh, I'm a born

345
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:13,660
again, you know, born again, Christian. Now I'm born again. Right. Or whenever you change your

346
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:19,780
modality, that spirit, that voice, the inner voice you had has that, that being has to be replaced.

347
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:24,000
They bring in another one. Sometimes it happens within the same day. Sometimes it happens within

348
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,820
a few weeks. That's why I like talking to people when they say, oh, I'm converted Satanist. I

349
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:34,240
remember when that happened, or I'm a born again, Christian. What's the difference, right? Uh, born

350
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,560
again. I said, when did that happen? Or I woke up in 2010. When did that happen? Do you remember?

351
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:45,520
And I try to get them to go back to that week or day when they decided to do that. And I said,

352
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:50,960
do you remember like extreme moment of clarity for a few days or a week after you woke up or

353
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,920
converted to Satanism or Christianity aware? Do you remember, you know, when they change their

354
00:30:54,920 --> 00:31:00,440
life, they're like, oh yeah. So when they, when they exchange it, that's when you're really neutral.

355
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:05,340
That little voice in the head goes away. You have peace and silence. And the last time you

356
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:11,320
had something like that, maybe you were eight years old, right. Or a teenager, peace and silence. And

357
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:16,220
then what comes in, they usually, if you say you're going for something, that's better. Like we woke

358
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:20,960
up to the matrix. They're going to send in a being nine out of 10 times that makes you doubt

359
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:27,200
everything and brings a little fear bug inside. Right. So you have to be very careful. That's why

360
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:32,260
very often I say this is for the bold, you're right. You know, when you start becoming more

361
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:38,820
aware, you're going to be quote unquote medical term tucked with, okay. You're going to be seriously

362
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:44,500
messed with and, uh, not, not because they want it. They just, that's what they do. That's what

363
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:48,900
they do. We're in their space, by the way, the earth was dropped in this particular place where

364
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:55,400
we were, it is on top of their world, but they are a nonphysical world, right? So that's the

365
00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:01,660
spiritual part. There's many, many more aspects to it. The emo part is no, has nothing to do with

366
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:06,940
what people have been attaching it to that I've seen around me. Mostly the emo is strictly,

367
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:11,760
you just learned that you have a pinky finger. Of course that's used for picking your nose,

368
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,400
right? You could pick your nose. You just can't pick your friend's nose, whatever,

369
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:19,640
how that goes. Right. Right. Okay. So what's the appendix for, right?

370
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:26,140
That's digest to regulate digestion, right? Lower fast digestion, right? You want slow digestion,

371
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:30,200
faster. And that's what that does. Pinky is definitely for picking your nose. You let

372
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,220
the, you ever see some of the, they leave the long nail on there for picking up things, you know,

373
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:40,660
whatever. Anyway, it's, it's kind of gross, but okay. So what is the emo for? It's just that,

374
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:45,100
what is it for? It's to, it's a carrier, right? It is not attached to any other modality. It's

375
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:50,940
not biblical, but by the way, uh, it's kind of like saying, what's the pinky for? Is it in the

376
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:57,240
Bible? Well, see, I don't think it's that simple because emo in and of itself is it in my mind

377
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:03,520
is just there to be a motivator. Okay. Yeah. But here's the thing. No, it's going to do what it

378
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:07,380
does anyway. It's just that we don't acknowledge it. Yeah. But, but that's what I'm saying. It's

379
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:12,260
control. If you can't measure it, you can't manage it, but it's just to motivate things.

380
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:18,080
It's too. And that's the thing. It is to actually put energy, not, not to create energy necessarily,

381
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:23,580
but to give it directionality. Right. Uh, yeah. Focus. It's the same thing. Like,

382
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:27,480
what are the eyes for? What are the ears for? What are the, not the eye, the organ,

383
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:32,120
it's the senses. What are the senses, right? Remember when we talk about senses,

384
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:35,620
it's all in the brain, right? You don't see with your eyes. You don't hear with your ears.

385
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:39,500
It's you see in here with your brain, you taste with your brain, by the way,

386
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:45,480
right? All this other stuff. The emo is very interesting because it is part of the brain

387
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:50,340
function very much. So just like the others, it's a sense, but it also is the carrier wave. It is

388
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:56,960
what manipulates. It's what manipulates your abilities within the abilities that, you know,

389
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:03,000
to manipulate anyway. And then once you discover that it's all emo based, then you find the things

390
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,860
that you don't know how to manipulate that you heard of can be done. Now you can start going

391
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:11,179
there. Well, it's just like every other sense though, there is a give and take right where

392
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:17,760
you can experience something else and gain from outside, but you can also push outward, right.

393
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:23,000
And, and, and have through any of the senses, just like with the eyes, we've talked about this

394
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,480
before the organ in and of itself, actually there's a little bit of light that comes from the

395
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:34,040
eyes. Uh, you know, so there, there is an in and an out. It's not all about collection coming in

396
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:40,760
sound coming out of the ear, right? Both things happen. Um, as for which one you acknowledge more,

397
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:45,199
you acknowledge the one that has the more profound effect. So to your mind, it is the collection.

398
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:48,820
That's mostly what you get, but that's the whole thing about, you know, the guy who

399
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:54,380
eventually explodes one day that it didn't happen to just one day. It happened over the course of

400
00:34:54,380 --> 00:35:00,080
time, but he didn't know it. He didn't know that it was emotional, right? Others around them might

401
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:04,800
look at it, but they don't even know that it's the emo. And then again, how do they know anyway?

402
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:09,880
Because it's not acknowledged. Yeah. If it's not acknowledged, I mean, look, I can ask you how you

403
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:16,060
feel acknowledged, but in such a juvenile, stupid way, but I ask you how you're feeling, right.

404
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:22,380
And a general typical response is okay. Good, bad, whatever. Very general. Um, you might tell

405
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:26,680
me about a specific complaint or something very good that's happening. You know, one way or the

406
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:30,060
other, I feel really good today. I feel really bad today. Something's hurting me, whatever.

407
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:35,840
But you told me next to nothing. Even if you talked for an hour after I asked you, how do you

408
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:41,600
feel? Um, you still told me next to nothing. There's a hundred other two types of feelings.

409
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,240
There's the nervous feedback you're getting. Then there's the emo in Bushido. You don't talk

410
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,860
about, you're always fine. Even if you're dying of stomach cancer, you say you're fine.

411
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:56,180
Yeah. Right. In certain cultures. So, um, but the email work, the email work is very different

412
00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:00,820
because now you've found out you have a pinky finger, right? Because your whole life, whenever

413
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:05,340
you show that, Oh, that doesn't exist. Now you find it exists. And what's it for picking your

414
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:09,960
nose? Let's say, so now you could teach advanced nose picking, right? Okay. You see where this is

415
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:14,580
how the email works the same way. Uh, you acknowledge it and you'll find out that the

416
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:21,260
abilities that you've told that you have, uh, you, you use normally still on acknowledge that

417
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:26,180
they're emotionally based. And then you hear in the superhero movies and all that, right?

418
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:30,160
The, the, what is it? There's a whole bunch of X-Men. There's, you can name, you know, heroes

419
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:34,540
on TV, right? Back in the day, all that, that's, you notice how they changed their emotional state

420
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:40,180
before they said something on fire, right? Or that's all PK work. Well, it's always the case,

421
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:44,160
whether it's, you know, uh, one of the X-Men or the fantastic four or whatever,

422
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:49,140
you know, uh, the Hulk, the Hulk is the best example. Uh, he gets angry and therefore he

423
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:55,380
hulks up. Um, emo, right. It's all about an emotional motivator that is seized upon that

424
00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:01,040
creates this cascade of reactions, the human torch, right? He gets excited or scared or

425
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:07,080
whatever. He lights up, uh, et cetera. I mean, there's always the, the emo is always in there.

426
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:11,640
It's always, it's, it's built into the character's trait. In other words, Oh,

427
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,840
he's getting to the state right now. He's going to blast some fire or Mr. Freeze or

428
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:22,980
the Hulk. Yeah. You see? So the emo, here's the thing there's a society is to, uh, you know,

429
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:26,900
we're, we're not all okay. Ultimately when you go to the top, it's non-human, then it's humans,

430
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:32,200
then it's humans. And it's many tiers of humans that run society. And the whole thing about it

431
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:38,300
is to give people a low self-esteem. So you see, that's why I always tell people, don't go to the

432
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:42,380
rapist, the therapist, right? If you look at the way therapist is spelled, it's the rapist.

433
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:47,420
They know nothing. They have no, absolutely nothing. They're all morons on their own

434
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:51,600
volition. They don't know that they're morons. Uh, here's the thing. Know how I said, if you want

435
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,240
to save a quarter of a million bucks, go to dermatology school, this is what, this is all

436
00:37:55,240 --> 00:38:00,460
you need to know. If it's dry, you can put something wet on it. And if it's wet, you put

437
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:04,440
something dry on it. That's the entire basis of dermatology. They know absolutely nothing,

438
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:10,680
right? Okay. The entire basis of therapy, right? You're ready. Don't even bother, uh,

439
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:17,160
to getting it. It's all these trades are ridiculous. By the way, the whole basis of

440
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:25,720
therapy is you try to create in the person's mind, uh, who they're treating, let's say, uh,

441
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:31,640
a sense of self-importance and how they've been wronged. And it's partially their fault. It's

442
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:37,660
not their fault or whatever. Why? Because you live in a society that takes any self-importance

443
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:41,720
out. Generally, you know, the big bang, you know, it came from monkeys. You can't be important,

444
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:45,340
right? There's 8 billion people on the world, which they're not. It's more like 3 billion,

445
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:50,120
by the way. How do I know that? Very easy. Who T who gives you the numbers of the population,

446
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:57,720
the bankers or the bankers? Honest, anything accurate, anything they do accurate on your end,

447
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:02,720
maybe they tried it, you know? No. Okay. So they're all this we're so insignificant. So

448
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,560
all the therapist does, the rapist, all they do is they try to instill and structure with

449
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:11,160
emo, by the way, they don't know that they're doing it, but it's in their structure, a little

450
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:17,360
bit of self-importance, right? And then they manipulate the, the person is manipulated.

451
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:23,660
How many times have you said, especially with whatever a is another example? Oh, I went to a

452
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:27,420
therapist. I'm much better now. And if you ask him, what did they do? How did it go? If they

453
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:30,880
can communicate it, you'll see all they did was they went in feeling like a piece of shit.

454
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,400
Therapist made him feel like they were important in some way. And now they can handle their stuff.

455
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,640
You need a therapist for that. It's a trick they're playing on you, right? Like the AA,

456
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:46,200
I said, it's a demonic organization. I think we knew somebody mutual person back in the day.

457
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:50,380
You're going to go to a place that you're going to affirm that you're an alcoholic. Every time

458
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:54,680
you go, what the fuck you, you gotta be sick. You gotta be sick in the head to not see that right

459
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:59,840
away. If you go to AA, you deserve it. But the point of that distorted. Yeah. But the point of

460
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:04,480
that is okay. Now, except that you got this problem so you don't slip. I get the reason

461
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,300
they give you, but it is sick and distorted. No, no, no. I get it. I'm not, I'm not, believe me,

462
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:13,020
I'm not backing it. What I'm saying is method. And do you know, Bob, I'm pulling it back and

463
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:16,480
saying, okay, here's the deal though, is that they tell you, look, here's the problem you

464
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,160
actually have. We're going to identify it. You have this problem. Now here's your solution to

465
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:27,020
that problem. You had this problem. Oh no, no, no, no. No, no, no. You still have the problem.

466
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:31,300
Remember AA is a constant thing. That's how they keep you coming back. So you, you have this

467
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:36,000
problem, but here's the solution. Unless you're sitting there drinking a bottle of Thunderbird

468
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,580
right in front of them. If you drank a bottle of Thunderbird five minutes before you walked in,

469
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:43,980
you still just had that problem. You don't have the problem. Yeah. You and I are using

470
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:48,340
proper logic here. I can agree with you on this, but you and I, but I'm telling you that this is

471
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:53,940
the methodology is that you have this problem. So now that you have this problem, here's your

472
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:59,540
answer to that problem. And since you can do that, here's your self-worth because you were able

473
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:06,540
to grow, to get better, to be validated, et cetera. Yeah. There's self-importance. It's a

474
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:10,440
trick. It's, it's all, it's all manipulation. There's no therapy. They don't know anything

475
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:16,700
like nutritionists. Oh, the calories. Oh my gosh. I'm a nutritionist. I've been interested for 35

476
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:21,640
years. Calories matter. Really? Do you poop charcoal that matters? Well, my gosh, you cannot

477
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:29,460
deal with these people that look the way these trades, uh, rabbis, priests, doctors, uh, whatever

478
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:35,900
lawyers are all screwed up is because society wants it that way. It's really, it's, it's a catch 22

479
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:40,540
in this case. I think it's an interesting universal methodology though, is that look,

480
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,860
okay. Except the fact that you, you, you were on a lower level, you were lesser because,

481
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:49,180
all right, now we're going to show you how to climb up the ladder and become greater.

482
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:54,900
So now you're greater. Now you're special. And because you're special, this is why you're

483
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:58,760
improved. And this is why you got to give us your money. Keep coming back, participate in our stuff

484
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:05,180
because whatever it is, whether it's a priest, rabbi, uh, the therapist, the rapist, uh, which

485
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:10,000
I, I love that by the way, I really feel like there's probably already a t-shirt for it, but

486
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,280
anyhow, um, I, I think it would be a good business. That t-shirt right there, the rapist therapist,

487
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:24,880
um, anyways, loose idea point is that it makes the person special. Therefore, this is the thing.

488
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:30,780
It gives them a good feeling. They instill self-importance that that's really stupid.

489
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:35,260
Yeah. But it's an illusion. Sometimes it's break it down first. It's the, you know,

490
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:38,520
break down first and then build up. What do they say about the military? Right.

491
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:42,880
They break you down in order to build you up. It is a workable methodology,

492
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:48,860
but again, it's just the trick. Now, did it actually do anything concerning what it is you

493
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:54,580
came in there for in the first place? It does because the people going, yeah,

494
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,780
they're, they're trying to function. They're looking up to the society that they're in

495
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:04,480
to be quote unquote, functional and normal. They even say that. Right. Yeah. And, uh,

496
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:09,040
so yeah, it's of course, it's all crap. It's all crap on many levels, but you know,

497
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,660
I think we just touched on it, but there's nothing, there's nothing more to go into.

498
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:16,440
You look years ago, I knew some guys and they were like, man, I can't, I can't meet a girl,

499
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:20,280
a girl or whatever. I said, what are you talking about? You know, pick a demographic,

500
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:26,940
like you remember pizza Uno? I don't know if they had them. It was like a dim light. Yeah. Pizza

501
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:32,360
Uno is like a deep dish. I said, go down here, pizza Uno and pick up some upper middle-class

502
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:38,260
chicks with a low self-esteem. You, you, they're easy to meet everywhere you go. I used to say,

503
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:41,600
go, go to the bar over here and just pick up a chick with as low self-esteem.

504
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:47,020
That's like the first, the first thing of pimping. You live in a pimped out society.

505
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:51,700
You're being pimped constantly. The cookie cutter restaurant, you go to your Applebee's or whatever.

506
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:56,260
They all, they always got a bar section guaranteed. One thing is that there's going to be groups of

507
00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:01,040
women sitting there, uh, at certain points. And what are they out there to do is to run

508
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:06,060
into somebody who's looking for them. They are there. Um, but the whole thing is the

509
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:11,340
entire society is based on low self-esteem and unimportance and all this. So the best

510
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:15,060
therapy they're going to do give you is tell you that you're important. Oh, wow. I'm important.

511
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:20,160
Cause you said, so now it works. That's the whole crux of the therapy, just like the dermatology,

512
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:26,500
you know, the method or whatever. So that's also the preferred way of meeting women too,

513
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:29,760
as they tell you, you know, you compliment them in this and that you make them feel important.

514
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:34,760
You make them the center of attention. And this is your methodology for a hooking up with women

515
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:39,300
too, right? Yeah. It's ridiculous. Yeah. What does that do for the curve? In other words, you know,

516
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:45,360
what does it do for anyone? It, it, because again, you're floating in a, it's a type of fish,

517
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:48,220
you know, like, you know, when you go fishing, you got to know the characteristics of the fish,

518
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:55,400
right? So the society has been so knocked down. And, uh, but look, can you blame the upper

519
00:44:55,400 --> 00:45:00,320
echelons that do this because they, they want control, right? The last thing they want is,

520
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:04,760
you know, billions of people, each wanting to rule the planet, you know, cause that,

521
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:10,300
that could happen. Right. And by the way, there was a city States, you know, back in the day,

522
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:15,420
right. So, uh, that each, you know, each little city state had a King. Imagine each neighborhood,

523
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:19,620
by the way, you don't have to imagine it right now. It's going on in Somalia. They have warlords,

524
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:24,060
each neighborhood, literally neighborhood, you know, a group of city, few city blocks

525
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:29,820
has its own warlord, literally. And, uh, when you go from walk through a neighborhood in certain

526
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:34,960
places, like in East Congo or Somalia, places like that, you, you see like city streets or

527
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,540
whatever. And then you get to the certain, you walk a little bit and you get to a certain point.

528
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,080
And there's like this corrugated sheet metal laid out, like a, like almost like, what do you call

529
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:47,300
it? Where they stop the cars? What do they call it? A checkpoint, almost like a very loose

530
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:50,180
checkpoint. And you're like, you're coming in this part of the neighborhood. This is run by

531
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:54,520
Mustafa, whatever. Right. You're like, what the fuck, you know, what's going on here? You know,

532
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:00,860
Mustafa's whatever neighborhood. Yeah. You see that in South America, you see that in South

533
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:05,080
America, there was actually a fairly popular, like, you know, artsy movie made not too long ago

534
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:11,440
called the city of God. And because there's a place called the city of God in, uh, in, uh,

535
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,800
I forget which South American country, but literally what you're talking about is laid

536
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:20,280
out there. This is all over the place, actually. So in other words, if you're going to have a big

537
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:24,320
city, you can't have that. I mean, it's still, by the way, it exists growing up in, in Brooklyn,

538
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,920
New York. It was kind of like that. Each neighborhood was a certain way,

539
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:34,620
right. Uh, you know, um, then jerseys like that very much. So also where you hearken from,

540
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:38,880
right. So a lot of ethnic, it's not extreme. No, it's not extreme. It's not warlords,

541
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:42,060
but you do have people that sort of run neighborhoods based on there's an ethnic,

542
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:47,740
uh, similarity between them and that this is their area. And, uh, yeah, no, exactly.

543
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:53,180
And the city that will be coming back when times get hard, because that's basically how,

544
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:59,400
when people get closer to the land and they're poor or enslaved, that's how they operate. There's

545
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:05,760
no castle doctrine, right. It's all, it's that type of grouping warlord stuff. But again, I just,

546
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:11,700
we kind of jumped around, got a little wonky again, but the emo stuff is just acknowledging

547
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:16,620
what the emotions are for. It kind of sounds crazy to say that the Greek is acknowledging,

548
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:23,440
or trying to tell people, uh, many things, but one thing is that, uh, emotions are not

549
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:29,020
acknowledged for what they are as a given sense and a given ability, but they are acknowledged

550
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:35,240
because look, uh, the only way that emotions are acknowledged is, uh, I cared enough to give

551
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:40,400
them the very best. That's the television moniker for Hallmark cards, right? The greeting cards.

552
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:46,000
And that's a weird thing with the younger generation actually is a lot of their,

553
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:53,420
a lot of their modality is now based on what their emotional experience is, right? Everything,

554
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:59,500
in fact, centers upon their emotional experience. Um, it's very warped. It's very disconnected.

555
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:05,020
It's very convoluted and artificial, but still it's like, look, well, the emo cons on the,

556
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:08,640
on the, uh, they changed the language, right? They're using abbreviations and the emo,

557
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:12,820
um, I don't know what they're called. The little images or something. Yeah. Well,

558
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:18,880
you got emojis and emojis used to be emoticons, but emojis now with the little smiley faces that

559
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:23,960
do this or that. So they are using them, but they're not, but people do. Oh yeah. That's it.

560
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:28,400
But they don't know that the actual facilitation of the emotion in the human body is a carrier

561
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:33,320
and a facilitator of all their actions potentially. Well, there's the natural version

562
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:37,340
of this and then there's the artificial. And what they've done is sort of taught these,

563
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:42,720
uh, younger people, the, the artificial version of it. But in reality, there is a

564
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:49,360
totally natural built in organic, uh, way of doing this. You know, the projection of like,

565
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:53,560
I can send you a smiley face right now, or I can send you one with boxing gloves or whatever.

566
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:57,940
It's synthetic. It's actually almost a, what do you call it when you're making fun of some mocking

567
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:03,600
it's mocking, um, anything that they, yeah, it's a mocking. Uh, like if, look, for example, banking,

568
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:08,720
if you look at banking, all those, you're being mocked, right. Uh, constantly, uh, you know,

569
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,760
read a credit card application, read a PayPal thing, read it, whatever it's all you, they're

570
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:18,300
mocking you right to your face, but you don't understand the language. Right. So, so when they

571
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:22,780
do these, uh, anything that has to do with emo is downplayed and mocked and childish, right.

572
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:27,100
Except for the, with the industries that are based on it, you know, and a lot of the holidays that

573
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:32,800
are based on it. But anyway, uh, the reason I'm bringing this up in the way, kind of in a roundabout

574
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:38,100
way is because people are trying to attach it to something and it's, it's, it's nothing. There's

575
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:41,640
nothing to attach it to other than everything that you're already doing that you just never

576
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:47,700
acknowledged it was there. It's the funniest thing. It's all based on distraction, right?

577
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:54,920
Because we have a tremendous amount of energy and robustness. For example, uh, when people go for

578
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:59,720
medical treatments, none of those medical treatments work, none of them. Uh, the only

579
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:03,660
things that work with the medical treatment is anesthesia and painkillers. And of course,

580
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:11,460
uppers and relieves like that. And the reason why people surviving surgeries, uh, is not really

581
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:16,660
because of hygiene is because the anesthesia is holding them down. If you woke up or were not able

582
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:23,540
to be put under for a surgery, you would die of shock. Most of the people that died back early

583
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:28,040
on before modern methods was several reasons. One was called poisoning of the teeth. They had really,

584
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:33,660
really bad teeth and they had infections in the blood from it. And the other thing was because

585
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:40,180
they died from a shock, right? So, um, because they, you know, they weren't able to be sedated.

586
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:44,740
So those are the two things really, all the other treatments are, they don't work. It's obvious

587
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:50,260
because, um, if you go study the pharmaceutical companies, any drug that's supposed to be

588
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:56,000
approved or put out has to show a report on how well it works against what placebo sugar pill.

589
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:59,520
It's very rare that you'll find any drug that can beat a placebo.

590
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:05,900
They're usually 50, 50. If it's 50, 50, yeah, it's good. It works. What does that tell you?

591
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:11,140
It's the power of what the human mind, how can it be that people have a specific illness and

592
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:16,580
they're designing a specific drug for that? They give half of the control of group, uh,

593
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:20,620
sugar pills and the other half, the drug. And they, and the most of the people that got the

594
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:25,760
sugar pill occurred or healed from it, or it has the same effect as a drug. How's that possible?

595
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:30,000
How do some or any of the people with the sugar pill get, get better? How is that possible?

596
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:34,920
Right, right. So, but they still tell you the drug, right? So you just go read the reports. How,

597
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:39,040
how does it fare against the placebo, any drug? And you'll notice that, Oh my gosh.

598
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:43,360
And so it's all right. So what's the problem with taking their medicines is this,

599
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:47,920
is that they always give you the side effects. You watch the TV commercials, right? Sometimes

600
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:52,360
the side effects are worse than what you're trying to treat. Yeah. What they never say on

601
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:57,320
any of the side effects ever is the effects that it has on what they'll give you the effects on the

602
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:03,000
kidney liver. It could cause sudden death, right? But they never, ever, ever, ever, ever tell you

603
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:09,400
the effects it has on the brain. Never, ever, ever. And I'm telling you right now, you, you just,

604
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:16,260
you know, suck on a, a chocolate bar or, uh, anything that you eat right now or take in,

605
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:19,640
even if you're thirsty, drink some water, it will affect the way your brain works immediately.

606
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:24,820
One of the main things that I've always discussed is if you want to see the effects of food,

607
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:28,580
sign your name or write something you're familiar with before you eat something,

608
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:32,540
eat something, wait 10 minutes, and then go ahead and sign your name. Again, you'll notice

609
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:36,900
how different it looks or write something or draw something, draw a circle, draw a line.

610
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:42,340
And you, and you cannot do it the same way. That's the effect it has on your motor skills,

611
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:48,060
right? This is something to do with children all the time. And, uh, you could see like as a child,

612
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:51,100
write your name and you know how they hold the pencil. Sometimes like they wrap all their

613
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:55,360
fingers around it, right? A real young child, right? Hold it upright. Like it's a hammer

614
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:59,740
and like it's a hammer and they write their name and then have some chocolate milk. They

615
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:04,600
couldn't even write their name. It was like, wow, that's the chocolate milk on what the brain.

616
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:09,480
So you're taking these strong pharmaceuticals. So anyway, the only things that work are the

617
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:15,940
the opium you mentioned earlier, right? For the women for menstrual. And, um, let's get off of

618
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:19,080
this for a moment. Cause I think whoever's listening, I might say, these guys are killing

619
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:27,540
this emo thing, uh, without really give furthering it again. It's kind of a defense in a way, uh, on

620
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:34,600
how maybe people are taking it. I've never presented it as, uh, something that's this new

621
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:39,920
thing that you can try or that may be this, or it might be that. No, no. I'm just saying,

622
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:46,460
Hey, guess what? I'm just visiting this planet and you humans, you don't acknowledge what emotions

623
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:51,180
are for. You know, your feet are for walking, your pinkies for picking your nose, your eyes

624
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:55,420
are for seeing yours or for hearing. But if you ask them what the emotions are for, I don't know,

625
00:53:55,500 --> 00:54:03,540
man, you know, my only purpose is he, my thought is survival really, because it gives you the

626
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:09,000
motivation to do all the things that are necessary. If you're paying attention to survive.

627
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:16,700
Yeah. Sort of depends on what you call survival. Yeah. That's a changes. I've heard people that

628
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:22,000
managed, uh, who's that? I know someone who manages like Larry King and Ivanka Ivana Trump's,

629
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:26,400
uh, personal funds. He had like a 3 billion portfolio. And when they did the financial

630
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,900
crash in 2008, he's like, I don't know how I'm going to survive. My portfolio went from like

631
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:35,620
whatever million down to 18. I'm like survival. You're going to survive on 18. What are you

632
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:40,400
talking about? Survival is like, if there's no food to eat and I see grass growing in the middle

633
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:44,560
of the road on the highway out of a crack in the asphalt, I know I could survive. Obviously the

634
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:49,580
word survival means two different things. Yeah, absolutely. Different people. Survival means food

635
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:54,560
and water, food, clothing, shelter in that order. Right. So, and I'm thinking that,

636
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:59,720
but that's the basic why, uh, you know, or maybe I'm missing the point. Let's get to it.

637
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:03,860
There's no point to miss. The thing is, these are broad, broad topics that are

638
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:07,860
not acknowledged. The thing is, if it's not acknowledged, how are you going to miss it?

639
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:11,440
Miss it means that, you know, something was there, there was an intention. And then now

640
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:16,460
for some reason you missed it, like missing the bus or missing a train or missing your ride or

641
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:21,980
missing the show or whatever. Right. Uh, yeah, you have to acknowledge it to order to miss it.

642
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:27,220
If something goes completely unacknowledged in purpose, there's nothing to miss, right? No,

643
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:31,000
you hear that also there. I didn't never miss. I didn't know. I never missed it because I didn't

644
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,460
know it existed. Right. Yeah. People say that you don't, you don't know what you had. If you never

645
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:39,700
had it in the first place. Well, what is the old, uh, if you didn't know it exists, how could you

646
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:45,080
know how could it matter? So, uh, you know, better to have loved and lost. Right. And that way you

647
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:48,440
would at least experience love. And then other people say, yeah, but if you never experienced

648
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:52,900
love at all, you don't know what you lost. So it's the better. Yeah. Well, some of those things

649
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:57,780
can work. Yeah. I think it's a, well, you know, when I hear the word love, you know, it means,

650
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:03,420
um, do the right thing. Right. Even if it's when, especially when it's inconvenient to work to,

651
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:08,720
to you, it's dedication. Speaking of which I want to do a short on sex that came up. We

652
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:15,000
never really taught. I do make lascivious comments. Um, but sex. Okay. The purpose of sex

653
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:20,440
is to have children, right? That's it. So if you're not planning on having children,

654
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:27,500
you don't need to have sex. Now, will him right. Put together a treatise for many years

655
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:35,100
that the purpose of the orgasm for biologicals is not only for procreation and the excretion

656
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:41,700
of fluids and whatever, but he noticed that certain people on his therapy couch, when they

657
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:46,660
would confess certain things and he would dig deep, they would have emotional body reactions

658
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:53,340
that mimicked what the movement and action that someone would have when they're having an orgasm.

659
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:58,320
So he figured that the two are correlated. You could take that where you want it. I have my

660
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:02,600
own ideas on that. That's probably going to be an entire sonic event because right. Can therapy is

661
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:07,540
very powerful, especially when you get into armory. Uh, and I'm not disagreeing with the

662
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:13,100
Wilhelm Reich treatise, but I'm just saying that sex is strictly for having children. Now,

663
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:16,960
the next thing about sex is depends on what culture you're brought up in.

664
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:22,600
Like, for example, uh, certain cultures, uh, like the American culture, Western culture,

665
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:27,080
they'll make fun of people. Oh yeah. He's a blue collar guy. Watch football has sex just once a

666
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:33,140
week, you know? Oh, well, it's like, what? It's like, you know, so they're over sex, right. Or

667
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:38,380
under sex, each culture, depending on how it's viewed, it gets to the point where they even

668
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:45,020
mutilate their bodies, right? Uh, uh, women, female genital mutilation and all that. So she

669
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:50,480
becomes a vessel to the man, all that. So it's really culture by culture. And I'm telling you,

670
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:54,640
the culture that you were raised in, if you accepted it and they're not, didn't see it

671
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:59,880
coming and you became part of the culture, it's very hard to change. It's very hard to change

672
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:05,460
that. Oh, you brought up a female circumcision. They call it sometimes. What about, uh, the,

673
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:10,220
the practice, the seemingly ancient practice of male circumcision. What are you saying?

674
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:15,640
It's a form of mutilation. Like, uh, so they used to say often is always circumcised.

675
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:22,960
The answer is no. Right. Cause we were made in their image. Right. It's just,

676
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:28,500
look, by the way, I don't believe any of that text. Right. I know it and I use it and I use

677
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:32,840
it as my guide. I use it. It's the laws. That's right. Fair enough. But I mean, it's part of that.

678
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:37,760
So it's part of that covenant though. Right. God's other God's circumcised. The answer is

679
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:45,140
if they're a male God with a penis. Right. Right. Right. Uh, are they circumcised? The answer is no.

680
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:51,360
Right. Because when we're born, we're not served. Right. Right. It's a covenant. It's a form of

681
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:55,460
mutilation to show that you're in covenant. It's a serious one too, by the way, because

682
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:59,640
while it's not reversible, I haven't seen too many press plastic surgeons offering.

683
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:05,860
No, I don't, I don't believe that they do reversal. I know, but yeah. Yeah. And, or, you know, uh,

684
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,820
you know, I, I was surprised at this day, modern day that the people that weren't uncertain,

685
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:13,700
they're not uncut. They call it, you know, don't, don't put a drawstring or something in it or

686
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:21,220
whatever, you know, but anyway, uh, draw skin for the foreskin. But anyway, um, yeah, that's what

687
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:25,620
it is. It's a covenant. It's, it's an intense, it's an intense covenant because, uh, if you read

688
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:31,160
in some places, they, before they crossed a certain part, all the adult men were circumcised

689
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:37,360
and imagine that. Right. So yeah. By the way, that was also in Egypt. It's a, it's a sign. It's a,

690
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:42,940
it's a sign. Right. So, uh, in other words, a covenant, you know, just like a bikers get a

691
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:50,620
tattoo, right. Well, whatever, you know, um, assassins, whatever. So is that, is that necessary

692
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:56,000
according to the biblical text? I mean, because yeah, no, it's a covenant. It's a voluntary

693
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,920
covenant. No, it's not necessary. Well, not very voluntary when it's a baby though. You know what

694
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:05,540
I mean? Because at that point your parents make that decision. Well, the baby, yeah,

695
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:09,100
it's supposed to do it at eight days old. Cause that's also the highest point of coagulative

696
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:14,320
ability in the male child, probably female also might be a little longer for the female

697
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:21,020
cause the peptides and things like that are, are a slower developing in a woman. Um, but

698
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:27,440
nonetheless, uh, the child is not considered to be alive until they're five years old. By the way,

699
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:31,560
in other words, you can't be counted until you're five. Right. You know, in other words,

700
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:37,260
you know, cause it was expected that the mother nursed the child till five. It was expected that

701
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:42,040
if the child lived past five, it's going to live right now. It's, we have crib death and all this

702
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:46,200
other stuff. By the way, us now is like the highest or second highest infant mortality rate

703
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:52,000
in the world. Every third world country, every third world country, except for one beats the

704
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:57,640
us and infant mortality. Look it up. Isn't that crazy? Yeah. You know what I mean by infant

705
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:02,060
mortality? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. So not only that mortality was, yeah, we also have women,

706
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:08,020
women die during childbirth more often here than a lot of other places too. Yeah. It's basically,

707
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:12,580
yeah, it's, it's a zoo. The U S is, but it was an experiment. It's an Illuminati experiment.

708
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:19,440
You know, the U S 17, how do you know? They, they tell you to go grill hot dogs and do fireworks on

709
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:23,980
July 4th. You know, most people don't even know why supposedly when the country was born, but

710
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:27,900
they never talk about how do you know it's an experiment because they never talk about March

711
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:35,300
the 9th, 1933. That's when the country died. Right. You know? So anyway, yeah. So 90 year delay,

712
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:42,780
the idiots will never figure it out. Never. But anyway, uh, where were we with the, uh,

713
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:47,120
well, we were talking, you said you were going to do the whole thing on sex and sex is for

714
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:52,600
that's another it's strictly for procreation by the way. And then there's the William Reich treatise

715
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:58,320
that certain people, when they get very deep emotional outlet or discharge, they exhibit a

716
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:03,000
physical condition that looks like an orgasm. So if you correlated the two that if you have an

717
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:08,640
orgasm, you'll have a good emotional, uh, and help get rid of some armoring was the idea. Um,

718
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:12,220
and then of course it's what culture you're brought in. Like the American, cause you know,

719
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:17,120
the sixties right now, it's like, if you don't have sex in a week or two or even a month,

720
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:20,200
something wrong with the relationship, right? You know, that's what they try to

721
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:27,020
say. And they found out that if you want to create due population control, you put an oversexed,

722
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:34,480
culture in. And you think like, wait a second. No, because, uh, if you have them become oversexed,

723
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:38,820
then they'll have more babies. No, the answer is no, because what you do is you squeeze in and you

724
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:44,520
narrow down the sex as for fun, not for having children. And occasionally there'll be one or two,

725
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:50,640
you know, like, oops, you know, I'm pregnant kind of thing. Uh, but actually you can stick in,

726
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:54,200
you could squeeze in all these contraceptive methods and all these other techniques

727
01:02:54,200 --> 01:03:01,240
to actually start disassociating sex with having children and just for fun. Right. And of course,

728
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:07,920
there are diseases that are due to transmit that way, by the way. Um, and that was the idea for

729
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:13,980
AIDS. AIDS was a big, it came after herpes. It was VD, right? And then there was herpes and then

730
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:21,780
AIDS, but the AIDS thing never really hit because as the herpes and the, um, uh, gonorrhea and

731
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:27,600
syphilis did. So they said, let's make it a real hit and kill them with the treatment. We'll tell

732
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:31,620
them that they have a very serious disease. And when they start taking the treatment, you know,

733
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:35,620
it'll trick the body that the epithelial cells have been replaced and they'll wither away and

734
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:39,320
die and they'll never figure it out because they respect this as an authority. By the way,

735
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:43,620
the statistics on people have died from AIDS is between 20 and 40 million people worldwide. That's

736
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:47,860
20 or 40 million people that have been deliberately killed by the medical establishment. You know that,

737
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:54,160
right? That's a pretty serious number. You know, you want to talk to the Holocaust, this or

738
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:59,760
genocide that, you know, tens of millions like that by the medical establishment. It's, and

739
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:05,080
guess what? Medical establishment, whatever doubt is going its way, it's still strong, right?

740
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:10,680
More people, more people have been killed by the medical establishment. Okay. In the past

741
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:18,820
300 years, then all of the wars combined and you could line them up next to each other and the

742
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:23,440
medical establishment outpaces every single one of those wars, conflicts, every one of them.

743
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:30,140
Everyone. But that's how they like it. That's how they want it. Because if you tell them that,

744
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:33,360
first of all, they don't believe it. Second of all, they sign up for a health plan, right? And

745
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:37,380
all this other bullshit. And they go to these medical people, medical technicians. I don't

746
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:41,340
even like calling them doctors. They don't deserve that. Because doctor means teacher

747
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:48,280
and they don't know anything. How can they teach if they know nothing? And the thing about doctors,

748
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:54,120
so where do they get their education from the state? The state education? Are you joking?

749
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:59,020
State approved? Anyway. Well, that's the thing about being a doctor is they automatically,

750
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:03,100
that means you were approved by the state if you are a doctor. Oh my gosh. That means it's

751
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:10,400
in the real universe. That means you're discredited, actually. So it goes the opposite.

752
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:14,100
It's backwards. But here's the thing about that. The people want it that way,

753
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:19,620
whether they know it or not. If you take a profile momentary screenshot of the situation,

754
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:23,740
do the people want the medical establishment to exist? Yes or no? And the answer is yes.

755
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:28,980
Emphatically. Right. Right. So there you go. That's why things ain't going to get better.

756
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:34,120
Um, well, you will have a better society, but not with the people that are here,

757
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:39,140
not the majority that are here. They got to go. You need it's one. It goes backwards. You can't

758
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:42,940
have a better society with the people here. And in order to have a better society, you can't have

759
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:50,380
these people. So it's a moot point to wish it upon. Right. So in either way, on that aspect of the

760
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:55,840
recovery, the email, I want to just do a quick shot on the yin and yang that we've been covering.

761
01:05:55,840 --> 01:06:01,360
By the way. Okay. And every time I bring this up, just like when I bring up anything biblical,

762
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:07,260
you know, I always have to qualify. There is no translation available in any language outside

763
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:12,340
of Hebrew and Greek and Aramaic. So if you understand the Bible, let's say from English

764
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:18,100
or Spanish or Chinese, those are versions. Right. So whenever I talk, that's how you know if there's

765
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:22,480
a valid conversation on the Bible, by the way, they have to start out by making that qualifier.

766
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:26,740
If you don't hear that qualifier, the person is just giving, you know, whatever a mixed bag

767
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:31,620
of whatever they think they want to talk about. Right. So when you bring that up like that,

768
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:39,260
you have to qualify. Also, when I say yin and yang, that is an Asian demonstrative

769
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:48,040
philosophy reasoning of how energies work. There is no counterpart. I'm looking for a

770
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:54,080
way to denote that subject in with a Western, let's say, lingo.

771
01:06:55,160 --> 01:07:00,380
Unfortunately, you've had to refer to Star Wars a few times because that's the closest thing to a

772
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:05,700
system that could be. Yeah. The force. Right. The force and balance and things like that.

773
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:12,520
That's almost a valid demonstration. Yeah, it is. It is very much. But here's the thing with that

774
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:17,160
also. Force may be close, but it's not it. This is what I wanted to bring up. I've been speaking

775
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:22,940
on the dietary aspect of it because the dietary aspect is very, very important.

776
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:30,320
Why? It's very important because it's what the body converts into the body, right? With the food

777
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:37,360
that you eat. And it's what everyone does. If you suggest someone do something for a health benefit,

778
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:43,220
they may or may not get to it. Right. But if you suggest that health benefit within the diet,

779
01:07:43,220 --> 01:07:50,380
guess what? They're going to eat. Right. Pretty soon after you tell them about it. Right. Very

780
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:55,800
often. That's why I used to say years ago, more often when I gave someone a suggestion,

781
01:07:55,940 --> 01:08:00,140
whether it was business or personal or do this before your next meal, I always say before your

782
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:04,500
next meal, do this. Right. Because it's like timing, because you're going to eat most of the

783
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:08,580
people to eat at least twice a day, morning and evening. Right. Right. Attaches urgency to the

784
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:14,260
Yeah, sure. It means it's going to be within that day. So when you make health suggestions

785
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:20,859
or improvement of one's qualitative improvement in their reality regarding food, you know,

786
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:24,399
they're going to approach the they're going to come across that at least once or twice a day.

787
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:29,899
Very important. Right now. That's what I've been stressing because it's very simple. Monkey see

788
01:08:29,899 --> 01:08:34,640
monkey do get yourself some Lundberg brown rice and some burdock root. Incorporate that what you

789
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:38,340
eat. But you have to learn how to cook the rice well and you have to learn how to cook the burdock

790
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:43,819
well. Right. And you start eating that, incorporating whatever else you eat,

791
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:47,520
more of that. And you'll see how you feel. It's going to change you. You can't help it.

792
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:52,960
Right. So get that going soon. Right. Like remember the changes we started off with here.

793
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:57,399
OK. The other thing that I have now, this is why I want to bring this up again that I have not

794
01:08:57,399 --> 01:09:05,200
stressed enough is the concept of yin and yang is balance. But these two energies are constantly

795
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:11,680
in flux. One moment it's a little yin. The next moment it goes to yang. It swings back and forth.

796
01:09:11,979 --> 01:09:22,220
Example. A heartbeat. Boom. Yang. Timing. Stop. Slow. Right. Quiet. Yin. Boom. Yang. Right.

797
01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:31,279
Contraction. Right. Open heart. It opens. That's the blood rushing. Yin. Boom. Contracts. Yang.

798
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:40,080
Inhale. Inhale. Right. Exhale. Yin. Yang. Right. Exhale. Yang. Right. You see how it works. The

799
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:46,939
pulse is yin, yang, yin. Expansive. Contractive. Yang. Everything is in flux like that. Right.

800
01:09:47,319 --> 01:09:54,640
You go out in the hot summer day in the sun. You walk next to a building or under an overpass.

801
01:09:54,640 --> 01:10:02,500
Shadow. Yin. Yang. Right. When you take a step, you know a step is a controlled fall.

802
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:08,340
No one knows how to walk. When you're walking, you know how to control a fall. How do you know

803
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:12,820
that walking is a controlled fall? When someone's walking forward, not paying attention, throw a

804
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:16,740
banana peel under one of the feet. They can't control the fall anymore. So what happens?

805
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:23,320
They continue to fall. You see? If you step on something slippery, it's not that you slipped.

806
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:28,720
It's that you didn't control the fall. You weren't able to put a braking action on it.

807
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:33,720
You see how it works. Right. So every time you take, every time you walk, no one knows how to

808
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:38,380
walk. Say if you were like, Oh, most people don't get it. No one knows how to walk. You want to say,

809
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:42,080
I teach your child how to walk, raise a baby, right? No, he just still doesn't know. You don't

810
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:46,960
even know how to walk. You don't walking. It's just a loose term. It's a controlled fall. You

811
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:52,840
lean forward, right? As if you're going to fall into the direction and then you put your foot to

812
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:58,620
stop it from falling. Right. Right. Proof of that is when you slip, you weren't able to,

813
01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:04,480
it's a controlled fall. Just like a crash. When I train people on a cycling, whether it's motorized

814
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:10,280
or non-motorized, I said, you know what a crash is? A crash is an indeliberate dismount. It's

815
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:14,960
getting off your bike when you didn't want to. Right. That's all it is. Stop looking at it as

816
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:19,140
a crash as this happenstance. That's something that we have no control. You have complete control

817
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:23,820
over that. So how do you remedy? How do you become good at crashing?

818
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:30,320
You figure out like a dozen ways to dismount quickly without even thinking about it. Dismount

819
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,780
off the right side, dismount off the left. You know, a lot of people with bikes,

820
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:35,980
they have what are called chocolate foot. They always like to dismount off of one side or the

821
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:41,480
other. I said, learn, you know, it's like lefty or righty, learn how to do both ambidextrous,

822
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:46,700
learn how to get off the bike from the back, learn how to get off the bike from the front,

823
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:53,200
learn how to get off the bike by rising over the bike and letting the bike roll from under you,

824
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:59,320
learn like four or five, 10 different ways to dismount quickly without thinking about it.

825
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:04,500
And the next time you crash, guess what? That was just another way that you learned,

826
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:09,540
right? It's not a crash anymore. They actually do teach us. They actually do teach us in advanced

827
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:16,100
motorcycle riding classes that they give to people. It's rare. Not a lot of people take

828
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:20,380
them or anything. A lot of the techniques that I used to discuss are very reasonable,

829
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:23,920
but you can't find them on the internet anywhere. There's no books written on them about cycling,

830
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:29,120
all this other stuff. You know, you know, you see people stand up next to a bike when they're not

831
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:33,700
riding, talking to someone. What you got to do is you put your hand on the brake, squeeze the brake

832
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:38,580
while you're talking most, right? Because the bike could still roll away and you could fall.

833
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:42,300
There's all these techniques, you know, how to manage something on two wheels. And there's no

834
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:49,120
information out there. So anyway, walking is no one knows how to walk. It's a controlled fall,

835
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:56,820
right? Yin and yang. The same thing with riding a bike, right? And dismounting. That's where it

836
01:12:56,820 --> 01:13:01,320
flips also. When you're moving, it's yang. When you're dismount, when you stopped, it's yin.

837
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:07,680
But at the point of dismount, it's yang. You see? So you have micro yin, micro yang that happens so

838
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:16,220
fast. Um, when your eyes are open, right? Uh, yang, when you close your eyelids to blink,

839
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:22,740
yin, right? So everything is going from yin to yang back and forth. It's, uh, like Trevor wrote

840
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:29,000
a book, the cosmic pulse of life. Trevor James Constable, one of my mentors, but it has more to

841
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:34,240
do with the sky preachers that live in the sky and other things of work of William Reich. But

842
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:40,260
what I wanted to say was the qualitative improvement for people by doing the brown

843
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:44,760
rice and Burdock, by the way, Burdock's really hard to find. I did find for two bucks a pound,

844
01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:52,420
a package of Burdock, non-organic, uh, Lili market here in Tucson. Uh, you might find it in Asian

845
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:58,760
markets called Gobo also, uh, or whatever. They have several names for it, but some people are

846
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:03,380
having problems finding it. It's the reason I suggest the Burdock route is because it's extremely,

847
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:08,340
it's the most young vegetable you could possibly have. Very bracing. If it does the same thing

848
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:13,960
that meet what meat does to you, people like to eat meat because it gives you instantaneous energy,

849
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:18,600
right? Is there anything else similar to it? Besides, I mean, let's just say you can't find

850
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:24,320
that particularly. No, there isn't that I know of it because it's a taproot. It's about three

851
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:29,120
feet long. It goes straight down into the ground, like a carrot, but it's got a white, a whitish

852
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:33,080
interior with a dark Brown, like bark on the outside. You have to peel that. You don't want

853
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:38,800
to eat that. Uh, and it's very, very bracing. Humans are attached to that. And it's a very go

854
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:46,260
back the most primal, primal, uh, food because it's energetic wise. It's the most attached to

855
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:51,400
the earth, the most earth energy vegetable you can get there. There are probably roots of certain

856
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:59,440
other plants that have very deep tap roots. Um, uh, and if you handle Burdock, it almost, if you've

857
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:03,620
ever done Arbor, Arboretum work with trees, like dig a tree out, it probably looks like a medium

858
01:15:03,620 --> 01:15:10,000
size tree root of any tree. Okay. And the Brown rice, which don't consider it a carb, it has the

859
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:16,220
shell on it and it's a loaded with, uh, everything the body needs, right? Like they say. No, I was

860
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:20,940
just thinking if there was an alternative, like a reasonably close alternative to it, that's all.

861
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:25,300
No, there isn't. And then someone, I got an email from, by the way, your ant powder is coming.

862
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:31,320
Uh, I had a delay cause I'm sending out these, uh, water devices to industry at the moment.

863
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:38,360
Uh, and just a, a, a short thing on that, uh, back on the yin and yang, because it's switching

864
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:43,220
back and forth, uh, on, uh, you know, yearly, you know, the seasons, yin and yang, right.

865
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:50,420
Uh, daily, monthly, the moon, right. Everything. And also momentary in your body, you have so

866
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:55,760
many opportunities. This is the thing, uh, because the yin and yang is constantly oscillating and

867
01:15:55,760 --> 01:16:02,380
try and balancing, uh, every moment is an opportunity to qualitatively increase, increase

868
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:07,820
your, uh, your life. And by the way, just to go back to the ant powder, what the hell is he,

869
01:16:07,940 --> 01:16:12,240
what the hell did he say? Uh, in the summertime, you have these, uh, soldier ants, they go out,

870
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:16,180
right. And you know, they, they leave a trail of formic acid and the other ones followed in

871
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:20,680
Right. So if you ever get that, okay. So what I did was I took a

872
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:27,240
borax, uh, well, you get an old coffee grinder or a new coffee grinder. It doesn't matter coffee

873
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:31,680
grinder, right. The kind with the high speed blade, let's say, and you can put some borax

874
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:37,300
powder in there, equal parts of everything that I'm going to mention, uh, borax. And then you put,

875
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:41,280
uh, silica dec desiccant, those little dry packs you see in things, you know,

876
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:46,420
a little, it was a hard to find, uh, and they're expensive. So if you're going to make a lot of

877
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:52,200
this stuff for five bucks at a pet store, you get the diet blue, but it's a food grade blue for kitty

878
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:58,560
litter. It looks like a crystals. It's desiccant silica gel. Yeah. Right. The kitty litter is

879
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:04,300
bright blue. Okay. That's the same stuff. Uh, that stuff you put anise in there in the coffee grinder,

880
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:11,020
also anise, uh, star anise, cinnamon and clothes, equal parts, either by volume or by weight.

881
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:15,620
And you grind that up and you make a very fine powder and you sprinkle that. You put it in a

882
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:18,720
little squeeze bottle. Like when I say squeeze ball, you don't go to the diner and they got

883
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:23,460
the mustard and ketchup. Mustard's in a red bottle and the ketchup, ketchup's in a red bottle. The

884
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:26,640
mustard's in a yellow squeeze bottle, right? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Get those squeeze, squeeze

885
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:31,560
bottles, small ones, big ones or whatever. And you put the powder in there. Don't start shaking

886
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:35,560
it around. If you have pets, you don't want dogs and cats and birds or whatever in it because of

887
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:39,960
the desiccant. Right. Right. Uh, so anyway, you put this around the edge of the door or whatever.

888
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:44,280
It creates a border. The bugs won't cross. I call it ant powder. And it's very, very,

889
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:49,100
very potent. And it's better than, uh, the killer chemicals that they do because it won't kill

890
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:53,760
anything really, you know? So I just wanted to bring that up and it's on your, it's on the way.

891
01:17:53,820 --> 01:17:57,920
I also included a squeeze bottle in there for you. Uh, I'll ship it out on Monday.

892
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:03,320
Sounds logical. And also, uh, it sounds a lot safer than using the diatomaceous earth,

893
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:08,160
which, uh, which I used to use borders. Well, it did. It does work to keep some things out,

894
01:18:08,380 --> 01:18:13,580
but the problem is yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A little bit. Well, what I do is if you have like a brick patio

895
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:18,320
or if you have a rough surface on the patio, uh, put some down and sweep it in with the broom,

896
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:22,920
push it down right into the crevices. Right. So the pets or whatever, don't walk on it

897
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:29,500
or just do a border under the threshold of the door. Yep. There you go. Yep. That sounds very

898
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:33,840
logical and sensible. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. That's, uh, that's the recipe for it. I'll go over it

899
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:39,720
again another time. So there's the ant powder. There's a little more on the emo, a touch more

900
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:46,540
on the, uh, the, the yin and yang of sex just a bit. Uh, is there anything else that we need to

901
01:18:46,540 --> 01:18:51,620
touch on? You think lots more? I'm going to be, like I said, doing the solo Sonics at Greek

902
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:58,880
speak.com. Right. It's just going to be me. Uh, our con is, uh, you guys know who it is and he's,

903
01:18:58,940 --> 01:19:04,120
uh, doing all the admin work behind the scenes, uh, hats off to him. Cause I don't do any of that

904
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:09,580
stuff. The only thing I know about computers is, uh, you know, power on, click on a browser,

905
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:13,680
send an email, get on Skype. That's it. That's all I want to know. Yep. Well,

906
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:17,260
you know more than that, but you don't want to involve it. You don't want to start taking up

907
01:19:17,260 --> 01:19:23,700
admin work. Oh my gosh. I set up the uncommon sense radio on common radio.com. Oh my gosh.

908
01:19:23,780 --> 01:19:27,720
I even know Charlie and the Greek.com. I did. I was like, Oh my gosh, five hours. And it's like,

909
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:32,240
what the hell is going on here? This is like a vacuum and a vampire, electronic vampire.

910
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:36,240
You only made a couple of pages there and you were like, screw this.

911
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:40,660
Yeah. This is vampirism and it's geekdom. It doesn't have to be that way. And never,

912
01:19:40,820 --> 01:19:45,840
never, I'll never do it. Yeah. I'd rather go back to the post, you know, go down to the

913
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:49,980
Kinko's and make copies and send them out in the mail and do a website. Listen, I would love that.

914
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:53,580
If we could go back to that, you know, the whole thing, let's just make this many copies of it

915
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:58,500
and, you know, give them the mail. I need to go to stamps. By the way, no matter how many stamps

916
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:02,200
you buy, unless you're doing a big operation, it's always going to be cheaper than buying a

917
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:08,380
computer and paying the internet fees, by the way. Oh yeah. Yeah. No, I, I, I love that. Uh,

918
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:12,180
I used to love the days of being able to mail stuff like that and have stuff going back and

919
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:17,320
forth, but you know, and flyers, remember flyers, flyers were great. Yeah. Make Xerox,

920
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:21,440
cut them down the middle of safe paper, right. Or sometimes four ways and just put them in

921
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:25,640
windshields, hand them out to people. Give someone that you trusted a stack of flyers to hang out,

922
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:30,980
hand out at work for parties or services or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. And the half sheet,

923
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:34,560
like you said, was the best, because I mean, you could get a lot of stuff on a half sheet of paper

924
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:39,580
and boom, you know, uh, you cut your 5 cents in half. You just get one paper cutter and you're

925
01:20:39,580 --> 01:20:43,980
good. Yep. Or you make the little phone number tabs on the bottom and you slice it. You put it

926
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:47,940
up on a cork board. Someone reads it right. And then they break off a little phone number tab off

927
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:53,520
the bottom. Oh yeah. I don't know. I don't think people do that anymore. No, no, that you'll,

928
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:57,520
you'll get back. Actually, you're going to have a pause. Uh, what'll happen is, you know, they asked

929
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:03,500
Einstein who was Einstein, by the way, means stupid in German. I'm means one and Stein means

930
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:09,600
stone. If you have one stone means you're, you're dumb. Right. But, uh, he said, they asked him and

931
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:16,940
others who's part of a collective that, uh, uh, he doesn't know how world war three will be fought

932
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:22,120
exactly, but he knows for sure. World war four would be fought with sticks and stones. Yeah.

933
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:28,520
Right. So I don't know. I think after the sticks and stones, maybe the flyers will come again,

934
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:32,320
three, 400 years or so, but this is it folks. It's what you got.
