1
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,260
Rated Y, Sonic Event 34.

2
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,120
That's the way we mark it.

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,820
And Greek, how are you doing?

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,300
Hey, pretty good.

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,480
You know, I was thinking about the 33 Freedom of Sonic reference, so I just want to bring

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:19,900
that up.

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,740
I think we're going to talk about sex, computers, and free energy.

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,340
That's what's on the mind.

9
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:26,940
Nice.

10
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:28,860
I saw in the chat.

11
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,900
I saw in the chat, somebody said, oh, you guys like they had the idea that you might

12
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,380
skip 33, like, like, you know, how they skip the 13th floor in hotels.

13
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,180
I always find that funny, by the way.

14
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,240
Yeah, they're actually they're well, yeah.

15
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,040
But that's another discussion.

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,320
The 13 there is OK, the 33, by the way, is free Masonic.

17
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,960
But there's really three levels in Freemasonry.

18
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,740
And I might have to be checked on this.

19
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,420
But once you become a master mason on the three levels, then you go over to what's called

20
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,440
Scottish Rite, where they have the 33 plus levels, right?

21
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,820
So it's really Scottish Rite when they talk about the 33, not Freemasonry in general or

22
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,180
the craft or what have you.

23
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,480
I just want to bring that up.

24
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:17,600
We didn't really touch on that much because, believe it or not, the most of them are just

25
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,840
there to get together and take photographs with stupid aprons and have pork in the springtime,

26
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,440
you know, big pork roast and all this other stuff.

27
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,280
It's just a social club now with the Freemasons, I've noticed typically we see a well-dressed

28
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,180
person or whatever.

29
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,940
It doesn't hold the door for anyone, doesn't ever smile in public.

30
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,540
You follow you notice to get into the car, don't follow them.

31
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,140
But if you notice they get into the car, they got the little G with the compass on the bumper

32
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:43,860
sticker, right?

33
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,220
Another Freemason, right?

34
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,320
So this is where it's become where it used to be helping people.

35
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,120
So well, to a certain degree, see, because years ago you had guilds.

36
00:01:53,180 --> 00:02:00,580
So if you're a carpenter or a plumber, painter, whatever, and you were hurt, you couldn't

37
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,240
work to support the family.

38
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,700
Everyone else chipped in the guild, right?

39
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,580
And it wasn't only for that.

40
00:02:07,639 --> 00:02:08,919
This is very commonly known.

41
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,480
What the guild also did was it upheld the reputation.

42
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,120
What I mean by that?

43
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,560
Let's say you're in the carpenter's guild and you hang a door falls off and you refuse

44
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,100
to go back and make it right.

45
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,720
It's not just that one carpenter or a mechanic or whatever that you hear now, watch out for

46
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,060
this guy.

47
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,220
It was actually a stain on the entire guild.

48
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,600
So when the guild got word that this carpenter didn't hang the door right and didn't go back

49
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:41,560
to make it right, they went back and made it right and admonished the one who didn't

50
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,020
do it.

51
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:42,280
Right?

52
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,180
Right.

53
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,300
It is cut both ways.

54
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,680
It's like a social insurance.

55
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:45,980
Yeah.

56
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,620
And it also cut both ways.

57
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,680
I mean, this is like I used to know guys who did house painting and they had a general

58
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,180
place where they would gather on occasion and you know what?

59
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,240
Some guys found more work than others for a while.

60
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,680
They might split work and go, okay, you know what?

61
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,960
I got jobs I can't do.

62
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:01,760
How about you do them?

63
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:06,460
And when you have extra jobs, you come back here and you drop those off here for other

64
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:06,980
guys too.

65
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,580
They would do that.

66
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,100
And that's like the more common use of something like that.

67
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,400
Well, this is different.

68
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,080
This is very, very, very different.

69
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:21,260
What's common now is just each man for himself because it's what people don't realize that

70
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,120
all the countries are running under state of emergency, right?

71
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:30,240
Because in their laws and bylaws and codes and statutes and rules, when there's a declared

72
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,700
state of emergency, they can bypass certain procedures and do certain things.

73
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:40,200
And the state of emergency is essentially that the, how would you say it?

74
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:48,020
All the government's ability to issue currency has gone over to a private group because the

75
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,960
government screwed up.

76
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,440
And it was, of course, deliberately.

77
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,660
Now, here's to go back to the guilds.

78
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,900
What's interesting about that is now, like you were doing some stuff with mechanics,

79
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,280
right?

80
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:00,700
Yeah.

81
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,040
Or I know someone who was doing stuff with plumbers.

82
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,000
And it didn't work out very well.

83
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,760
That would have been very different in certain societies in the past.

84
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,060
The guild would have made it well.

85
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:18,620
And that person who did whatever trade represented the guild would have been, let's say, sanctioned

86
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:18,980
for it.

87
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:19,240
Right.

88
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,160
So this is way, this is way off the way we think today.

89
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,060
Now we look for they have like Angie's list, you know, for hiring people, you know, go see

90
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,940
if this guy is good and who is and who's not, you know, Yelp or whatever.

91
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,900
You know, to rate tradesmen, let's say.

92
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,380
This was that system back in those days, but it was active, not passive.

93
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,040
What I mean now, the system is passive where, you know, you look up, like you mentioned

94
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,920
a painter, a guy's got one star and there's 20 people complaining.

95
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,700
People now say, oh, avoid that guy, right?

96
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,460
Avoid and find one that's rated higher.

97
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,760
But that's not.

98
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,820
And they ride.

99
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,320
They just let it ride out like that.

100
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:57,780
And it's OK.

101
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,200
People don't understand how these guilds had structures.

102
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,280
And they were indirectly associated with people who did the craft.

103
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:11,700
But you mentioned a couple of things that when you were speaking about the painters

104
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,680
and the work and all that, a few things flashed through the mind, by the way.

105
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,120
You know how I feel about attorneys or because I know them.

106
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:19,380
I.

107
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,520
Well, here's the thing.

108
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,760
Many people form opinions on things they've read, seen on TV, right?

109
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,120
That's why they have all those government and cop shows on TV.

110
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,360
You know, so people think that that's how it works or court shows.

111
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,520
Judge Judy, whatever.

112
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:34,980
Oh, yeah.

113
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:35,860
Of course.

114
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:36,720
Yeah.

115
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,800
And it's total opposite.

116
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,500
It's because they know that they're there.

117
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,780
They get impressions from that.

118
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:47,480
But long story made short, I know a billionaire growing up when he was growing up, he he's

119
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,880
actually an oil and gas and controls a large amount of helium production and other things

120
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,280
like that.

121
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:59,720
He was a depression baby, post-depression baby, like in the southern part of the U.S.

122
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,860
and to the point where they had to go through the garbage and find old shoes and boil the

123
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,000
leather to get something to eat.

124
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,240
And as he became adolescent, he decided to start doing some paint work.

125
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,860
So him and a friend of his and another friend of his, another friend of his restored this

126
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,840
big Victorian house.

127
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,460
They worked on it for three months and the job came out well.

128
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,840
And the the owner was an attorney.

129
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,080
And the day he came to settle with on the project, the attorney comes out, says, you boys did

130
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,960
a great job, greater, better than I expected.

131
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,200
But I'm not going to pay you one dime for what you did.

132
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,860
And I'm not going to pay you a dime for anything you did for it to be a lesson to you in life.

133
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,260
Hmm.

134
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:44,700
Interesting.

135
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,420
I just wanted to share that, by the way.

136
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,000
Yeah.

137
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:48,820
Yeah.

138
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,280
Because, right.

139
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,060
It doesn't make sense to most people today.

140
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:51,600
Right.

141
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,160
But back then it made sort of sense.

142
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,100
It's like, well, on several levels.

143
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:55,380
Right.

144
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,580
You could think about it.

145
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:58,840
Yeah.

146
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,180
Yeah.

147
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,240
No, I get it.

148
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:05,780
But like I said, you know, there were times I saw this, you know, some years ago, a couple

149
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:10,960
of decades ago that there was still kind of an active element commonly with people that

150
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,940
would share work, like I said, and actually did behave sort of like the guilds of old.

151
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,780
But they're not really the guilds of old.

152
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:21,140
They kind of had some of that stuff still going on, but I think it's been just about

153
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:25,560
completely eliminated now with the age of, like you said, Angie's List and Craig's List,

154
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,000
you know?

155
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,580
Well, before that, like you said, that age is over.

156
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,000
Yeah.

157
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:35,340
It was in The Mob when you had a problem with someone, you went, you didn't deal with it

158
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:35,820
on your own.

159
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:41,000
If a certain family organization had jurisdiction, you went to them.

160
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:41,260
Right?

161
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,780
You see it in the movie, The Godfather.

162
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,040
Right?

163
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,380
Yeah.

164
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,460
I used to see it in real life.

165
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,680
It was very simple.

166
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,320
Well, yeah, exactly.

167
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,460
I've been around it.

168
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,540
I'll give a story.

169
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,140
It's a true story.

170
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,800
I opened a bike shop in Brooklyn, and it was a high-end, whatever.

171
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,340
And of course, you need garbage disposal.

172
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,560
Here we go, right?

173
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,000
And waste disposal.

174
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:05,820
So I call up.

175
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,720
There's only one, you know, no matter who you call, they're all going to send the one

176
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,160
who does that neighborhood, right?

177
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:11,500
Right.

178
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:11,760
Yeah.

179
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,340
So this guy gets out of a car.

180
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,440
He's like six foot four.

181
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,540
It's springtime.

182
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,440
He's wearing a leather coat.

183
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,460
Goes down to his ankles.

184
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,600
Hair greased back.

185
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,040
Vinny bag of donuts.

186
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,620
Hey, Vinny, get the IROC, kind of guy, right?

187
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,080
Okay.

188
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,720
He stomps into the shop, and he says, it's 700 a month for garbage.

189
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,140
That's it.

190
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,040
And he stomps out.

191
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,080
And I'm like, oh, I remember the people before paying like 150.

192
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,000
Right.

193
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,179
So I knew someone who knew someone who knew someone, and I told him what was going on.

194
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:40,220
And he says, what kind of store?

195
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:40,700
A bike shop?

196
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:40,900
Yeah.

197
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:46,600
Listen, I got a I got I wanted to get back in and riding my bikes for my wife, my family

198
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:46,920
children.

199
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,060
I'm going to bring us some bikes over.

200
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,140
You take care of them for me.

201
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:53,100
So he brings over like four or five bicycles are completely dusty, like they haven't been

202
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,440
touched flat tires and everything.

203
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:54,760
Right.

204
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,440
So leave them here.

205
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,280
The next day, the tall guy with the leather trench coat storms in.

206
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,740
He says, OK, I'm really sorry.

207
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,080
It'll be one hundred and fifty.

208
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:03,920
One hundred and fifty.

209
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:04,720
OK, bye.

210
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:05,260
Yep.

211
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,080
Right.

212
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,760
So you see, like the typical, quote, unquote, America, oh, I got to call the Better Business

213
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,180
Bureau.

214
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:12,980
I got to.

215
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,580
Oh, whoa, whoa.

216
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,780
It doesn't work that way.

217
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,860
I was just thinking of that.

218
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,360
That used to be, again, when when you and I, I mean, again, we're similar in age.

219
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,560
So, you know, when when we were kids, that was a common thing.

220
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:22,780
Right.

221
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,800
Oh, you got to call the Better Business Bureau.

222
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,680
And yeah, that's not.

223
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:27,920
That's part of them.

224
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,560
You ever see.

225
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:32,920
What was the movie where the fight club where he goes to the police?

226
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,600
Oh, yeah.

227
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,820
And I don't know if you remember the film when he says, you got to stop this guy or

228
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,040
whatever.

229
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,260
And then the police run around.

230
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,120
They said they said you were going to say it, say this, whoever says this, we have to

231
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,020
cut off their balls.

232
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:43,260
Right.

233
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:43,480
Right.

234
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,660
Police now are holding them down.

235
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:44,880
Right.

236
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,720
This is an amazing sacrifice, sir.

237
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,320
We can't believe that you're doing this to test us.

238
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,500
Yes, we'll take care of it.

239
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:51,740
Yeah.

240
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,060
Yeah.

241
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:52,880
It's even the cops.

242
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,200
You see.

243
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,560
So this is exactly how it is.

244
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,660
The military is for hire.

245
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,060
Private.

246
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:56,900
You have enough money.

247
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,760
You could call the who runs the military bases.

248
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,920
Each military base has the oh, gosh, name escapes me.

249
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,560
It's not the big quartermaster or whatever, actually.

250
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:10,760
Yeah.

251
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,340
It's the provost.

252
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:13,980
Marshall.

253
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,080
There we go.

254
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:15,620
There we go.

255
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,060
That's it.

256
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,300
Yeah.

257
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:21,620
And and you give him enough money, he'll send an F-16 to drop a bomb on someone's house

258
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,120
or shoot it with a missile.

259
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,180
And then what you'll see on TV is there was a gas explosion.

260
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:31,140
And if the cameras get there too soon, you see the gas company unloading old, dumping

261
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,860
old pipes on the ground.

262
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,120
Right.

263
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,060
To make it look like.

264
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:35,500
Yeah.

265
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:40,980
And this is actually from a real event that happened in San Francisco more than a decade

266
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,400
ago.

267
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:46,000
Well, sometimes you get a warning like, you know, you could persist with this kind of thing.

268
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,500
Accidents do happen, you know.

269
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,280
Yeah.

270
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:48,860
Oh, yeah.

271
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,860
Speaking of accidents do happen, we're just talking about computers.

272
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,360
You know, you got a wonderful family.

273
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,660
It would be a shame if something ever happened to them.

274
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,800
You know, just saying.

275
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:58,960
Oh, no.

276
00:10:59,140 --> 00:10:59,540
Of course.

277
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,080
But speaking of accidents, computers, I wanted to just bring that up.

278
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:10,140
I was saying speaking people that are into computers don't get anything for the past

279
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:10,620
six years.

280
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,300
Don't get anything that has a hard drive.

281
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,220
You have an SSD solid state, all solid state.

282
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:15,480
Right.

283
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,120
That's the way to go.

284
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,560
Because the reason why is you mentioned also having backup.

285
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:26,880
Well, if the safety mechanisms and protocols sense that the hard drive is not up to snuff,

286
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,840
you won't won't be able to turn it on to access anything, the external drives or anything.

287
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:35,760
So the hard drive is the thing to avoid anyone buying computers or whatever.

288
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,620
And the other thing was data, how to protect it.

289
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,360
Well, many places in Europe, they don't send data through a different line.

290
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,700
They send it through the power plug.

291
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,960
It's called broadband.

292
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:47,440
Right.

293
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,720
I said, let's let's talk about this before we started recording.

294
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,600
So we are now.

295
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,240
Well, right.

296
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,400
Because actually, I just had to swap out the, you know, the little electrical plug that

297
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,300
I have for my mixer.

298
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,280
Well, it finally burned out, you know.

299
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,760
So I kept the past couple of times I bought new mixers.

300
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,740
I kept the old the power plugs that were never used.

301
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:08,900
So I just came in.

302
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,840
You're on the side.

303
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:10,660
Yeah.

304
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:11,220
Yeah.

305
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:11,400
Because.

306
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,180
OK.

307
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:12,980
The mains cord.

308
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,040
Every so often they burn out, you know.

309
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,620
So.

310
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,080
Yeah.

311
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,860
It means they're not.

312
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,400
Yeah.

313
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:17,760
Yeah.

314
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,360
You should always.

315
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,560
If they tell you you need a certain gauge wire, go one gauge heavier.

316
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,320
And also the equipment.

317
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:28,100
Last year, I see someone running a power tool, a thin extension cord that creates excessive

318
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,900
amount of arcing and damages the brushes and the motors.

319
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,420
It's even worse with electronics.

320
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:39,640
If you're into high end audio, there's a craze now with power plugs like just the six foot

321
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,140
power plug that goes from the wall to the amp.

322
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,760
There are four or five thousand bucks.

323
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,040
Right.

324
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,360
The way they're made.

325
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,400
Well, I don't have a bunch of those, but I do have the ones that are, you know, actually

326
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,440
matched up correctly to the manufacturer's specs and all that kind of stuff.

327
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,400
And I've got like three of them.

328
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,300
You got to do better than manufacturer's specs, usually is what I'm trying to say.

329
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,620
It's kind of like the nutritionist specs, right?

330
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:00,840
Oh, I got you.

331
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,520
Think of manufacturer's specs as like nutritional information.

332
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,860
But I've got them here so that one day I'm not just caught like, oh, that burned out.

333
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,760
Now I can't do anything.

334
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,300
You know what I mean?

335
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,520
So I do have backup parts, so to speak.

336
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,320
So I just had to get one of those off the shelf.

337
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:12,780
That's all.

338
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,080
Yeah.

339
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:13,460
Yeah.

340
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:19,420
So so on the computer thing, when the power sent broadband like that, I had found out

341
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:23,460
about that a long time ago when there was a big push for fiber optics.

342
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,560
And then they said, well, why do we need fiber optics?

343
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,100
We could just keep the old copper wires, just do broadband.

344
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:28,620
Right.

345
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:33,700
In other words, increase the frequency sees an actual and other things have to be increased

346
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,160
as well.

347
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,660
So this is the the aspect with computers.

348
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,680
It's very, very simple.

349
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,040
They're serving as garbage technology as usual.

350
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,500
And you have to make a choice.

351
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,720
Well, no, you have to make a decision.

352
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,860
Many people think decision is they have to make a choice.

353
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,600
It's the decision.

354
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,620
The choices are many.

355
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:55,320
The decision decisions are few or singular.

356
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:02,200
So I just wanted to put this out because I also have an SSD now laptop for about a year.

357
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,320
It's a pleasure.

358
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:07,000
You turn it off, goes off, turn it on five, four, three, two, one.

359
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,620
It's on.

360
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,320
Right.

361
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,640
Ready to go.

362
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,580
None of that stupid stuff with the magnetic hard drive and whatever.

363
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,420
So I just wanted to bring that up.

364
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,420
That would be, you know, instead of just looking for a computer like I am right now for someone

365
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,900
and maybe for you as well.

366
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,660
It's much harder.

367
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:30,420
You know, if I just wanted a computer, I would have had five of them for, you know, 50 bucks

368
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,900
each, you know, fairly new computers.

369
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:36,280
But they have hard drives and it's like shame on them for still putting that crap out.

370
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:36,500
Right.

371
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,960
So anyway, I'm looking for that.

372
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,540
The so I mentioned sex, didn't I?

373
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,820
I want to get into that again.

374
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:45,940
Well, you did.

375
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,720
I have a question about emo stuff, though, because it came up in an email, if you don't

376
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,040
mind.

377
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,660
Go for it again.

378
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,960
I like to feedback.

379
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,880
And by the way, we are checking the chat as well.

380
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,600
The chat's very interesting.

381
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,920
Somebody recently talking about the Sabbath and how they observe it and things like that.

382
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,340
A bunch of things going on.

383
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:07,860
And also, our friend who likes to cook potatoes on the stovetop appreciated that he was mentioned

384
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,560
in.

385
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:09,820
He said, Sonic.

386
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,380
Oh, cool.

387
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:10,860
Yeah.

388
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,840
He's been we've been in touch be through Skype texting and all that.

389
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,100
I enjoy him very much.

390
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:22,400
He did do the blue tape around the light and keeps the bugs away with a little bit of blue.

391
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:22,840
Yeah.

392
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,840
I don't know if you got that.

393
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:24,800
But yeah.

394
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,420
And also, I have got feedback from him and others regarding the driving.

395
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:33,060
When you pull on the steering wheel slightly, it changes the entire feeling.

396
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,520
One message was it went from an SUV to a sports car just by pulling a little on the steering

397
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:38,740
wheel.

398
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,940
Well, that's interesting.

399
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,720
I can't share that because I don't drive.

400
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:48,760
But anyways, the interesting thing, though, was that somebody asked about preparation

401
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,600
for emo work.

402
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,240
What do you do before you do the emo work?

403
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:57,880
Is there a general sort of way that someone should, you know, prepare?

404
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,140
Because most people that that's, you know, attempt to talk about this kind of stuff will

405
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:03,640
tell you about.

406
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,720
Well, first, you got to get yourself ready.

407
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,920
And this is what you do.

408
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,020
And they often tell you about meditation and blah, blah, blah.

409
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,040
You know, so it's not necessary.

410
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,040
I'll tell you why.

411
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:12,540
Oh, no.

412
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,920
I'm just relating what's in the email.

413
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,560
That's all.

414
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:14,980
But go ahead.

415
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:15,800
No, I get it.

416
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,280
I get it.

417
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:22,000
The the whole thing that I want to lean on very heavily, a double underscore emphasize

418
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,520
and air quotes, whatever you want to say is very important.

419
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:28,740
The way that I discuss the emo and what it is has absolutely nothing to do with anything

420
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,960
else out there at all.

421
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:35,000
The reason why is because what I'm trying to emphasize is the purpose of emotions.

422
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:35,720
That's it.

423
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,260
Now, if anyone wants to attach preparatory elements, ritual or whatever to it, that's

424
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:40,500
fine.

425
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:45,820
But what I'm saying is it's amazing how we live in a society that everyone sort of talks

426
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,180
about it.

427
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,900
But no one acknowledges its purpose.

428
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:52,160
And and it's and the way we do that is by looking at its effects.

429
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,420
I mean, I don't really know.

430
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,940
But what I've surmised is thus about the emo work.

431
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:02,920
Now, just to fast forward about prep, though, a lot of the techniques and things that I've

432
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:08,400
mentioned that you can implement when doing the emo work is independent of time, independent

433
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:14,220
of distance, right, independent of many, many things that we consider to be psychophysical

434
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,400
or just purely physical.

435
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:15,880
Right.

436
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:21,740
So if the emo works independent of time and distance, there is no preparation necessary.

437
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,599
It's sort of like prayer when you do it properly, right?

438
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:32,120
Prayer can be done ritualistically and also with intent to whatever deity you subscribe

439
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:32,560
to.

440
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,560
But it also could be done with none of that.

441
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:40,000
Like you fall off of a ship and you're drowning and you say, help, I'm perishing.

442
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:40,480
Right.

443
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,280
So it can go either way.

444
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,840
I wouldn't say, no, you don't have to prep on that.

445
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,840
But I'm saying that it's not necessary because it's it's it works beyond time.

446
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,980
It works beyond distance.

447
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:58,600
And it's sort of like it affects the psychophysical first, meaning the spirit, the mind physical

448
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,340
together first, then to the physical.

449
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:01,920
Right.

450
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,000
So we'll get more and more into it.

451
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:08,320
But I wanted to anything else on that, because I wanted to just fill in a couple of things

452
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,380
on the subject and bring up a new subject.

453
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,920
Yeah, there was one more thing and then and then I'll shut up.

454
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:16,740
But it was pretty simple about manifestation.

455
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:17,360
Right.

456
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:23,760
And, you know, look, sometimes emo is just about changing a general circumstance.

457
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,980
You create an atmosphere and you don't have a direct intent necessarily.

458
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,400
You just want to improve things.

459
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,840
They were saying.

460
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,380
And then in other cases, it's not going to work.

461
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,280
It's not going to work.

462
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,280
General general statements are generally ineffective.

463
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,020
OK.

464
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,320
It has to be very specific.

465
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,640
Once, you know, everyone is going around, you know, everyone's doing the emo work constantly.

466
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:51,040
If you watch like a frog trying to get a fly, right, he's like, I got to get that fly to

467
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,360
hold still just for one second.

468
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:52,660
Right.

469
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,080
So they're all everyone is doing.

470
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,300
It's just that no one is acknowledging it as it is.

471
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:58,740
Right.

472
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,760
It's much like water.

473
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,200
Water is involved in everything, even if you're not focused on it, you're dealing with.

474
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,340
You know what I mean?

475
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,860
So, yeah.

476
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,680
So back to it.

477
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,220
They were saying, you know, OK.

478
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,660
So general, you address done.

479
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:18,300
But when you're attempting to manifest something in particular and let's just say you're you're

480
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:26,640
you're wanting to attract a particular individual into your circumstances.

481
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,860
This is what they asked.

482
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,800
And this isn't about, you know, relationships or trying to, like, you know, cast the love

483
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,940
spells like there's a whole bunch of people on the Internet to try and tell you about that.

484
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,160
Right.

485
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,820
How do you attract the proper mate?

486
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,120
Well, here's what you do.

487
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,480
And they give you this whole, you know, very, very there is no attraction either.

488
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,640
That's the whole thing.

489
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,060
Everything is a push movement.

490
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:45,820
But go ahead.

491
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,740
Well, I'll get into that.

492
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:53,660
But that's the thing is, how do you push from a distance to sort of attract something, for

493
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:58,100
lack of a better word, to attract someone into your life from a distance?

494
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,460
How do you do that?

495
00:19:59,560 --> 00:19:59,820
Easy.

496
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,180
That's very easy.

497
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:05,800
Imagine that they're already there and you're feeling and living as if they're already there.

498
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,740
And that's that's very simple for a lot of people who are older.

499
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,140
Let's say they've been in several relationships or have more experience.

500
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,980
They infatuate, fall into infatuation with someone.

501
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,080
They feel great.

502
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,440
They're on cloud nine for whatever.

503
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,740
And then after a while, it's kind of like this person's annoying.

504
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:23,720
Right.

505
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,120
So or you don't think about them that much anymore.

506
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:28,640
Right.

507
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,840
On and on.

508
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:37,060
So when you understand that and you understand that possibility, let's say, when you want

509
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:42,460
someone to, let's say, attract to bring someone in, you imagine as if you're already living

510
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:46,560
that way with that person there without the annoyances, without the negative aspects that

511
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:51,820
would lead, you know, to another desire, which would be, you know, another person now.

512
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,080
Right.

513
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:59,800
So what what makes bringing another person into your life satisfying for you not only

514
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:05,300
momentarily, but also long term, how it has to do with how you live, what culture, your

515
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,860
mindset and what you're doing.

516
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:13,580
And the thing is, what you're doing should always be based on what your goals are and

517
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,660
your goals should be minimal.

518
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,680
By the way, I know this sounds crazy, but you know, it should be minimal.

519
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,460
You know, big goals like I want to make the world a better place.

520
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,020
That's that should be absolutely minimal.

521
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:23,800
Right. Right.

522
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:28,460
Of course. And that's the thing I'm trying to address this because they did ask a specific.

523
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:33,480
So I'll drop the last part of this with a specific piece where effectively there's

524
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:38,080
someone that they had in their life at one point and they are now no longer really in

525
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,780
contact with them, this kind of thing.

526
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,200
And what they want to do is draw them back.

527
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:46,260
And, you know, a lot of people experience that, as you say, you know, you get old enough,

528
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,240
you've had someone in your life, you've lost track.

529
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,520
There was a problem, whatever.

530
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:55,340
There was some sort of struggle between you or there was a difficulty and they've gone

531
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,240
away. Now they've been away for a while.

532
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,880
And you'd like to bring them back.

533
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,120
And they were talking about using the email to say, you know, reintroduce somebody who

534
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:08,200
was an old friend or who was a family member who now, you know, the two of you, because

535
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,200
of geographical changes or whatever, are drifted apart physically.

536
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:18,940
But you'd like to bring them back into your your sphere, your daily.

537
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,820
And I got you.

538
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,800
That's more extreme than someone that you don't know yet.

539
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:29,440
You try to stay in the middle, because when you get in touch with someone that you are

540
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,960
that is not with you deliberately, it'll get more extreme.

541
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,240
It could be extreme, like extremely subtle.

542
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:39,340
Like if you haven't spoken to them a long time, you get in touch with them like, oh, I

543
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,880
was thinking about you for weeks and months.

544
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,880
I'm glad you called. Or it could be I told you I'm with someone else.

545
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,900
Leave me alone. Right. It's no more this moderation in the middle.

546
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,840
Right. Like, hey, let's meet for coffee at three o'clock.

547
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,440
Right. It's not like that anymore at all.

548
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,080
Right. Oh, yeah. You know, we're just going to have a coffee, even though we have no

549
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,080
relationship anymore. We'll catch up, you know, this.

550
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,740
But yeah, once you've had a relationship, it's now it's going to be on the left swing or

551
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,980
right swing. It's not going to be in the middle.

552
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:08,120
You know, like when you first meet someone, you know, you try to be in the middle.

553
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,440
Right. So how about coffee?

554
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,900
What do you like when if you already know those things about that person?

555
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,980
So it's going to be extreme.

556
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:17,140
So the first question is, are you prepared for extremes?

557
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,040
The second thing is, what are your options?

558
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,140
Right. In other words, you have options, choices.

559
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:29,980
And one of the choices, have you decided on absolutely bringing this person in?

560
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,060
Right. Because here's the thing about the emo.

561
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:37,680
If you're wishy washy or doubtful, it doesn't work at all, at all.

562
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,360
You have to be very sure.

563
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,000
And sure is, again, more emo work.

564
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,620
In other words, when here's an example of it.

565
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:49,700
There's you know, if you've when certain perfumes and colognes were in vogue 20 years

566
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:53,840
ago or whatever, and someone now wears one and you smell it brings you right back to

567
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,820
20 years ago, listen to 80s music or whatever.

568
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,080
Right. Yeah. OK, so.

569
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,540
All right. So you have these attachments, that's all emo.

570
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:07,140
In other words, the the this remembrance of that scent is not the emo.

571
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:11,720
The what the what the remembrance does is the emo you see makes you feel like you're

572
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,020
back in that time. Oh, yeah.

573
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:17,000
Like, you know, every once in a while I catch a whiff of this is going to sound funny,

574
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,820
but I bet you you'll know what I'm talking about.

575
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:23,920
I catch a whiff of something that reminds me of remember that aquanet hairspray crap

576
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,780
that a lot of women had on, you know, in their hair in the 80s, like it seemed like it

577
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,600
was everywhere. I can't say for sure, but yeah, I get it.

578
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,020
Well, I was like a cellophane chemical kind of plastic smell, but it's sort of

579
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,600
fragrant. But it also had me.

580
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,620
Yeah. It also had like almost a fragrance to it that was almost perfumey also.

581
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:45,780
Well, what's weird about it is that that reminds me of, again, being in the late mid

582
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:49,460
to late 80s in Jersey, you know, women with big hair in Jersey in the 80s.

583
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,180
Yeah, of course. You know, also the sunrises.

584
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,800
So, you know, that was just the circumstance.

585
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,140
But I smell that every now and then I think back to that.

586
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,460
It throws me immediately emotionally back to being a teenager and going, oh, I remember

587
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:05,720
this when, you know, women wore sandals and, you know, you know, the example is not

588
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,060
remembering the smell.

589
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,100
Not at all. Right.

590
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,700
The example here is that the smell triggers the email, right?

591
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,380
And when the email is triggered, you're there.

592
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,640
Really? You're back. You're like, you know, whatever.

593
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,200
You know, Jersey in the 80s or whatever.

594
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,340
Yeah, I feel it all of a sudden.

595
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,380
It's like, yes, that's the email in reverse.

596
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,840
Right. So it's the email in reverse.

597
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,900
So you do it that way again in reverse.

598
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:30,580
So in other words, when you're doing the email, it's in reverse instead of, OK, you

599
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:35,220
get the smell, you remember the smell and the email takes you back to that era as if

600
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,220
you're living it again for a moment or whatever.

601
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:42,620
Now, when you do it the other way, when you do the email first, it has to create you

602
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:46,720
create the remembrance and then the presentation.

603
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:51,000
In other words, so you go email to remembering what you'd like to have.

604
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,420
Right. Because you could actually remember the future if you're structuring it.

605
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,980
Right. If you make plans for next week and you write them all out and I said, do you

606
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,440
remember what you wrote for next week?

607
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,680
That's still remembering, even though it hasn't happened yet.

608
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,980
Right. I don't I don't need to say that again.

609
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,680
It could be it could be confusing.

610
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:11,840
Right. And then once all that is set, then the manifestation occurs.

611
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,700
You don't have to worry about how it's going to manifest.

612
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,920
Just set up everything else for it.

613
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:22,100
Right. In other words, when you smell the whatever you did and you remembered the

614
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:25,280
smell, you didn't have to set up going back to the 80s.

615
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,200
It happens automatically.

616
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,500
Right. So you do it in reverse.

617
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:33,700
You set up, you see how it will be by remembering it, even though it hasn't

618
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,600
happened yet. And then it manifests.

619
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:42,780
If you over plan it detail by detail, it'll be sort of like, hey, you got this on

620
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:49,020
your own. You don't need the rest of the milieu that's out to do these things

621
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,060
because everything is manifested.

622
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,040
Right. By other beings and other things.

623
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,820
It has it takes life to manifest things.

624
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:58,540
Right. Even when the Grand Canyon is formed, it's living water that does it, you

625
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:02,900
know. So everything has to have some sort of life impotence to manifest something.

626
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,840
Yeah. We'll have to do more of the emo stuff.

627
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:10,620
The solo sonics are starting, by the way, at Greek speak dot com.

628
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:17,260
Right. And not necessarily want to plug those too much because people who already

629
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:21,480
found out, I think I just wanted to bring that up again because these things will go

630
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,760
into depth. But basically, I laid it all out in terms of an outline.

631
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,500
Hopefully it wasn't too confusing.

632
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,480
You could always hit pause and go back.

633
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,400
It's all in reverse.

634
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:36,980
And I think bringing up the smell to remembering the smell to reliving the past is

635
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,100
the emo in reverse.

636
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,480
The emo came last there.

637
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,940
So here the emo comes first, then the remembrance and then the manifestation.

638
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,480
Right. And that's basically how it works.

639
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:50,560
And don't be attached to it because here, you know, a lot of people get attached to

640
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,860
their hopes. I hope it comes.

641
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:52,960
Maybe it will. Maybe it won't.

642
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,800
All this stuff. Okay.

643
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:57,620
If you act as if it's already happened, what are you hoping for?

644
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,540
It's already done. Right.

645
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,640
There's no hope needed.

646
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,820
There's no belief needed.

647
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,100
Right. Well, I've never known how to articulate that.

648
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,920
That that is specifically like, no, you don't say you want this to come.

649
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,620
You say this is this is happening.

650
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,660
It is.

651
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,860
Well, well, you can only say you want this to come with the words in the cycle, cycle

652
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,080
materialistic. But in the emo, it's the feeling as if it's already come.

653
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,940
You see? Well, but that's the thing.

654
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,700
There's a huge difference between I want this to come.

655
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,540
I want this to come. Come on, bring it, bring it, bring it.

656
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,240
And yeah, that's not going to work.

657
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,260
This is already happening.

658
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,380
This is coming.

659
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:37,160
Like, in other words, if there's exactly so that that's done, it's already done.

660
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,320
That's the way you got to go with it.

661
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,680
That's always hard for me to kind of articulate.

662
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,360
But I think you just laid it out.

663
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,000
But it's not just saying it.

664
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,220
What does it actually feel like when it's actually done?

665
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,260
And then act accordingly.

666
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:53,760
Right. Because you must you must perform something in the psycho material world.

667
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,140
I see psycho meaning spiritual.

668
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:58,620
Right. That's funny, because most people, you know, say psycho.

669
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,940
What do you think keeps using that word psycho for you?

670
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,460
Well, spirit, spirit world, you know, either.

671
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:07,340
Right. But the ether is a substance used by the spirit,

672
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,600
just like we would use material here.

673
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,780
So fair enough.

674
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:15,600
So now that you've addressed that, let's see on your checklist sex.

675
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,820
Yeah, I wanted to bring that up because it's such a big deal.

676
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,480
And this is for immature audiences, not only.

677
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,800
But, you know, I say for mature audiences, right.

678
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,760
This is also for the immature.

679
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,920
And because you could be 90 years old and be immature, just look around you.

680
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:33,460
Right. Yeah. Well, maturity is also relative to what you consider to be mature.

681
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,720
You know, it depends on where they're stuck.

682
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:39,040
Most people, you know, in their later year, even till later on in life,

683
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,760
are still stuck in that high school mentality.

684
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,440
Yeah. Or lower. Very, very weird.

685
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,360
But but it is also in the eye of the beholder.

686
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,120
You know, I've had people tell me that somebody is very mature and all this kind

687
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,160
of thing. And I said and I look at him and I go, how?

688
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,960
I don't understand how exactly.

689
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,320
Well, sorry, I don't know if you heard that siren go by.

690
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,380
That was weird. But yeah, go ahead.

691
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,200
So it's just like, you know, I see people are dumbed down.

692
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,700
Well, look, even the most dumbed down, whatever.

693
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:07,800
Now, if you ask them what city or town or what month it is, they'll pretty much know.

694
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,380
There are plenty of plenty of authors and writers from the 16th, 17th, 18th,

695
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:17,540
19th centuries that made commentary on the public that if you were, let's say,

696
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:22,880
in the 1700s in Paris, France and asked anyone or the majority of the people,

697
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,620
the normies, let's say, what city you're not.

698
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:29,440
Well, I should say there were people that if you ask them what city you're in,

699
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,300
what country, what year is it? They wouldn't know.

700
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,400
That's how dumb you see.

701
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,280
So we're much better off in many aspects like that.

702
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:40,600
So in terms of maturity, it's possible that they're more mature

703
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,420
than the immature ones from back then.

704
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:47,380
It's something in scripture about, you know, don't romanticize the past

705
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,820
because things are actually getting better,

706
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,660
but they're going to get better for those that are not doing good.

707
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,080
And they're going to lead you into that.

708
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,020
And the whole thing has to be redone.

709
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,520
So with sex, this is also for the immature.

710
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:02,800
The reason I'm saying this is in age also is because,

711
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,400
you know, the food, clothing, shelter and all this other stuff.

712
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,440
Sex is one of the most powerful tools and motivators

713
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,620
that's used in society.

714
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:14,700
And what I mean by that is they're actually business deals

715
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,480
that are not, quote unquote, consummated until a certain, you know,

716
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,600
you have this businessman who wants to invest in a company

717
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:25,280
and he tells the person in the company, hey, your secretary's built like a B-52.

718
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,220
I'll have a night with her and you'll get your money.

719
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,680
Right. So it's not just between two people.

720
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,680
Now, the the boss has to convince the secretary

721
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,920
that if she doesn't have sex with this guy, the company doesn't.

722
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:37,600
You see what I mean?

723
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:43,060
Yeah, well, that's definitely a taboo thing nowadays.

724
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,100
Well, this is going on and on.

725
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,320
And also the children are used, you know, the pedophilia,

726
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,600
which is always talked about.

727
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,760
But there's not much talk about pederasty.

728
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:55,360
Pederasty is where older men with a younger man,

729
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,400
younger, usually adolescent pedophilia

730
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:03,520
usually means like infants, you know, very young, formative years.

731
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:07,080
But pederasty is when you would have a teenage boy with an old man.

732
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:11,620
Right. This was that's more common, believe it or not, in other cultures.

733
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:16,760
So this thing about sex is that it's a very strong power.

734
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,480
You know, they say, what do they say, sex?

735
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,260
And even in Scarface, first you get the money, then you get the power,

736
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,640
then you get the sex, right, or something like that.

737
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:29,660
So it's this thing that denotes it's more than just a bodily function.

738
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,260
It's more than just like I keep bringing up Wilhelm's Reich,

739
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,220
Wilhelm Reich's association with it, because he dealt on the function

740
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:40,180
of the orgasm much and on how it was very similar to people

741
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,140
discharging emotional armoring and such.

742
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:48,740
What I what I'm saying is that no matter how much the the society changes,

743
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,780
that seems to still remain the same.

744
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:55,100
There's still pederasty, pedophilia, a coercion, right?

745
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,860
Business deals being consummated, all this other things.

746
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,800
Relationships, relationships over sex.

747
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,860
Right. For example, personal relationships, husband and wife,

748
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,260
boyfriend, girlfriend, whatever, whatever.

749
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,920
They focus on it as a leverage point, pro or con or whatever. Right.

750
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,960
Too much sex, too little sex.

751
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,220
It's never just right. You know what?

752
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,900
What's at the party?

753
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,000
Healthy sex life.

754
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,320
Do you have a healthy sex life?

755
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,200
They all can do that, too. Right. Right.

756
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:25,340
And then there's you know, if you over sex a population,

757
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:32,900
the popular the you have less population growth, by the way.

758
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:36,420
Right. Because then you could start introducing other things

759
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:39,000
in it that focus more on not having children.

760
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,580
So what's interesting about this is

761
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,960
all of it is relevant to a level of spiritual immaturity,

762
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,360
because once someone decides what it's for,

763
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:53,460
even on the Wilhelm Reich aspect, what it's for is for having children procreating.

764
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:57,160
Even on the Wilhelm Reich side, he was kind of made fun of a little bit.

765
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:00,000
He was a little eccentric, a little actually.

766
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,180
Anyway, one of my mentors, Joe Blankenship, was his driver,

767
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,300
personal driver when Wilhelm Reich spent four years here in Tucson.

768
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,400
OK, I'll just give you a quick thing.

769
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,820
You'll never you won't see this on the Internet.

770
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,699
So Joe said, how was it being around Wilhelm Reich?

771
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:17,199
So I couldn't stand it because of this. I'll tell you what it is.

772
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:21,260
We go around town, pick up whatever he needed and we go back to the house.

773
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,380
So Wilhelm Reich gets out of the car, opens the door, goes into the house.

774
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:29,000
Joe Blankenship is unloading the car, you know, about a minute later,

775
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,900
walks into the house and there's Wilhelm Reich stark naked

776
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:35,739
laying down on the couch having a cigarette because he was he was a nudist.

777
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,219
He liked being naked all the time.

778
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:41,540
And, you know, I mean, you know, a guy in his 50s or 60s, you know,

779
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,560
I don't know any. I mean, I don't know.

780
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,340
I guess maybe it's personal taste or whatever.

781
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,739
It makes some people uncomfortable.

782
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,199
Others are just, you know, unfazed by it.

783
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,219
Everybody's got their own.

784
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:54,380
He didn't like that about him. You don't hear maybe this anyway.

785
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,700
So there's the Wilhelm Reich aspect.

786
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:00,240
But I'm suggesting that once you mature about it and

787
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,860
and you see what it's for, even from the Wilhelm Reich perspective,

788
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:07,160
he says it's important to the orgasm and the discharge

789
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,660
of discharges, extra energy so it doesn't create armoring and harm in the body.

790
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,260
Yes, I agree to that.

791
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:16,260
Many aspects, but also a brisk walk or jog around the block

792
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,720
about 3000 times might do it also. Right.

793
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:21,940
I'm just joking, but cold showers next.

794
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,900
Yeah. Well, here's the thing.

795
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,600
It's kind of like when you're fasting,

796
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:29,460
you get more hungry if you admit that you're fasting

797
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,120
than if you're having a busy day.

798
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,260
You'll say, I didn't eat today.

799
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,720
You don't even think about it. Right.

800
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,540
So if you're focusing on it, it'll become more difficult. Right.

801
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,400
Now, I'm not saying to abstain or whatever.

802
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,880
And this is other stuff on the Internet.

803
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:44,100
There's the piss drinkers, you know, drink urine therapy.

804
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,900
Then there's like semen retention.

805
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,580
Oh, yeah. The tantric.

806
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,940
Yeah, that has nothing to do that.

807
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,640
You look when you look at Buddhism and I've been saying this for 25, 30 years.

808
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:56,900
Actually, I found out about it in the 80s, what Buddhism was really about.

809
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,900
Everything that you hear about Buddhism is what Buddhism is not.

810
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,160
If you study the Buddhism, just like the scriptures, for example.

811
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,960
Right. Or just like anything.

812
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,520
I mean, like everything.

813
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:12,100
I was going to say, just like anything, it seems like whatever it's labeled as.

814
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,620
That's wrong. Period. Right.

815
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,340
So like, you know, like I've said, if you understand the Bible,

816
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,800
you'll never call yourself a Christian.

817
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:22,600
If you understand the Koran, you'll never call yourself a Muslim.

818
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,860
You see how it goes on and on and on.

819
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,540
So those are just labels.

820
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,820
Those are like catchphrases.

821
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,860
Those are things to identify

822
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,680
people and say, oh, this guy says he's a Christian means he knows

823
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,060
absolutely nothing about the Bible.

824
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,120
He's just following along what we set for him.

825
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,300
And the same with the Buddhist, same with them.

826
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:43,380
Right. And what's interesting was very refreshing.

827
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,420
There's a young man in his early 20s

828
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:49,160
who talks a lot about the Koran on YouTube by Congress.

829
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,880
And he says, don't I'm not Muslim.

830
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:54,020
But he knows more about the Koran than any right Muslim does.

831
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,540
Right. He has very good commentaries.

832
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,940
And I found out about him through the one of the archaic interviews.

833
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,280
You could look him up. OK.

834
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,320
Wonderful young man.

835
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,420
But he's not Muslim. I love that. That's great.

836
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,860
Like, you know, a true biblical scholar would never be considered Christian

837
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:11,500
himself. It would be insulting. Right. On and on. Right.

838
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:14,880
Someone who knows about the human body would never be called a medical doctor.

839
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,640
Never, ever.

840
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:19,460
Someone who knows about the law would never have been called an attorney.

841
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,100
Well, some of the best students study something objectively as well.

842
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,860
You know, they don't have an emotional attachment to anything.

843
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:30,340
So they actually look at things as they are, as opposed to trying to shape them

844
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:33,140
in a particular way to fit their particular belief. Right.

845
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,640
Well, it's not personal.

846
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,720
I'm saying the society is set up that if you're going to take on a trade

847
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,140
or a label like that, you have to do it their way.

848
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:42,940
And their way is always corrupt. Right. Of course.

849
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:44,920
It's very simple that way.

850
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:49,860
So with the aspect of the sex also, let's say within relationships,

851
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,560
when it becomes a point of contention,

852
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:58,520
it's sort of like it can go to the level I've seen people who are alcoholics.

853
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:02,360
It's the same way branded as society.

854
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,700
You know, go to AA or whatever you should. How about this?

855
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,960
You should never drive a car anymore because you are alcoholic.

856
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,660
Ten years ago, that doesn't make any sense. Right.

857
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,080
You're not right now. So so there's this aspect.

858
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,960
It's basically sex is also a form of communication.

859
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:23,960
Right. The better the communication, the better the interaction.

860
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:27,640
Now, here's the thing that most people, when you say sex, thinks what it's about.

861
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,860
It's not just the penetration and all this.

862
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,480
There's a level of when people are communicating well

863
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,820
and they feel close to each other.

864
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,320
It's just being close with each other. Is that sex or not?

865
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:44,320
You know, well, no, it's not because sex, again, is defined by procreation.

866
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,880
Right. And if there's no orgasm in the male

867
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,920
to deliver that, right, are they having sex?

868
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,400
You see. So intimacy.

869
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,660
I don't use the word romantic, by the way.

870
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,260
You know, that's a television thing, right? Yeah.

871
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,640
Because what does that even mean anyway? You know.

872
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,640
Yeah. So so there's that aspect as well.

873
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,520
I mean, there's people you can be

874
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,060
intimate and not have the penetration

875
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:14,580
and can be just as satisfying for many

876
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:18,000
if the emotion and the communication and spiritual level is there.

877
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,960
There's not much talk about it in a sense of how broadband this topic is,

878
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:27,160
because it's always this or it's always that or, you know, like we just mentioned,

879
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:30,500
all the modalities, even from urine drinking all the way, which is not sex.

880
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,620
But I'm saying it's kind of like they're with the semen retention on

881
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,240
whatever the tantric

882
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,040
or some level of your head spinning.

883
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:42,380
Yeah, it's some level of intimacy, but it doesn't mean that it's sex.

884
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:46,040
I mean, you know, so I mean, you can have different levels of intimacy

885
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,200
that are not necessarily sex, you know.

886
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:52,340
So, I mean, it's just there's many different ways to go with it, right?

887
00:39:54,860 --> 00:40:00,480
Well, it's no, it's not really because the actual basic sex is to procreate

888
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,400
for the sperm to reach the egg somehow.

889
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,880
And the thing is, that could be actually done without any intimacy.

890
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,940
Right. But the aspect of it, in other words, what I'm saying, it's like love.

891
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:15,180
Sex and love are not making love, making love.

892
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,720
Love is to do the right thing.

893
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,220
Right. Well, you should do the right thing.

894
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:23,020
But but either way, again, it has to be it's based on communication.

895
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:27,100
But you have to understand this topic is so heavily

896
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:30,540
subjectively dependent on the culture that you were raised in

897
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:33,760
or you have accepted because you could be raised in one culture,

898
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,860
transplant into another and fully adapt. Right.

899
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,080
So it's very much that way.

900
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:44,660
But but what it will lean on very heavily is the purpose of sex

901
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,460
is strictly to procreate.

902
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,320
That's it. And then there's all these other things that lean over.

903
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:53,360
Oh, we're making love or this or that or pornography.

904
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:56,460
Right. Which is the sale of sex or prostitution or whatever.

905
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,180
The sale, the commercial aspects of it. Right.

906
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,960
With one package, you can put it in. Yeah.

907
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,460
Yeah. So but in essence, it's strictly for having children.

908
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:08,320
The rest of it that they call sex is basically levels of communication,

909
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,980
intimacy, fellowship,

910
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,060
on and on all the way to Wilhelm Reich's idea where it discharges.

911
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,460
So there's this mixing.

912
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:19,040
Making love is one of the worst things that you could say

913
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:24,480
about sex is because, again, TV, you know, the word romantic, making love.

914
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:28,080
All this stuff is borrowed from the Western culture. Right.

915
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:31,800
Right. Because love is doing the right thing.

916
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,260
So then that can't happen unless there's communication.

917
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,540
All right. So communication and openness and the people have to be intimate

918
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,800
and all this other stuff.

919
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,860
So, again, I just want to lean on it again.

920
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:45,120
There's so many things that are attached to it that are really not

921
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,520
much to do with having babies, especially where I started off.

922
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,140
The man won't invest in the company until the company boss

923
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,880
has a secretary, have sex with him. Right.

924
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,500
This kind of like thing that goes on, it's still going on

925
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,480
and will always go on in this society.

926
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,920
It doesn't matter if it's Eastern or Western or whatever.

927
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:07,100
That seems to be a human thing.

928
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,980
So I just wanted to bring those things up again,

929
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,400
because I was thinking, you know, talking about sex, we're going to talk about.

930
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,740
I mean, it's just about having babies.

931
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:17,480
And the rest of it is intimacy, relationships, communication and culture.

932
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,240
That's pretty much it.

933
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,800
And then once discipline on it.

934
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:24,420
All right. Free energy was the next thing I wanted to get into. Right.

935
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:27,020
I think that's the last thing, if you will, on your agenda

936
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,380
as you laid it out at the beginning here.

937
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,800
Yeah, I was thinking about that.

938
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:33,420
You know, what's interesting about that?

939
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,260
It's again, another topic you see online

940
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,520
and it's just running all over the place or whatever.

941
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:42,560
I don't know. The popularity seems to have kind of slowed down as a blade.

942
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:45,860
It seems to me like about five or ten years ago, somewhere in there.

943
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:48,300
It was it was really everywhere.

944
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,700
Yeah. Nowadays. Yeah.

945
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:53,640
Very much like, I don't know, sort of suppressed in a real way.

946
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,960
Well, it's remember all this stuff, all this alternative stuff is not really

947
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,160
these people like if you meet people in the alternative media, you look at them

948
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,580
and they're just like me.

949
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,240
You know, oh, I woke up in such a year and I'm going, you don't know.

950
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,860
Anything, you know, they really don't.

951
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:11,660
I mean, yes, they might have a specialty in something that they're specialized

952
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:14,260
or no experienced in or studied or whatever.

953
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,060
But it's like, wow.

954
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,240
Overall, generally, it's like, oh, my gosh.

955
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:20,520
Can you know, it's just like, what do you do?

956
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,820
You're all saying the same thing.

957
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:25,100
So, you know, here's the thing with the Greek speak.

958
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:27,340
What I try to do is like, OK, just stop.

959
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,140
Everybody stop.

960
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:30,420
What's going on? Let's just start right here.

961
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,660
What's what's in your pockets?

962
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:34,120
You know what's in the room

963
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:37,420
when you walk down the street, what do you see?

964
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,920
You know, real basic stuff.

965
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,580
Just forget about everything for for a little while.

966
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:44,120
Let's pay attention to what things mean.

967
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,300
What? OK, all this.

968
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:49,240
All right. So there is no free energy in a sense.

969
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:53,140
But in other words, what you're actually talking about is hyper efficiency.

970
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:57,560
And here, actually, with this next little bit that we're going to get into here,

971
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:02,080
I'm going to show you how anybody listening to me can grasp these concepts

972
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:06,140
and move along and develop, quote unquote, what they're calling free energy.

973
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:06,900
Quite simply.

974
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:12,140
And if you've grasped the concepts of the pope's work schedule being false,

975
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:13,560
how the human body works.

976
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:15,300
I mean, it's pretty obvious.

977
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:18,300
You're looking at anatomy that nothing gets absorbed

978
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,340
and calories have nothing to do with it.

979
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,780
And those things are so obvious and regardless of,

980
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:26,480
you know, how many people don't think so or don't pay attention to it,

981
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,060
you're able to if you're listening to me, you're able to grasp this.

982
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:30,980
It's very simple.

983
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:36,600
So what they call energy, the energy is there's many definitions,

984
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:39,920
but generally it's the ability to do work. Right.

985
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:43,820
They very it's very difficult to define the word energy

986
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:45,980
without using the word energy again. Right.

987
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:49,640
Something providing an impetus force to do work. OK.

988
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:53,640
All right. So what what are we doing now

989
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,100
when we talk about energy?

990
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:59,520
Ninety nine percent of the time people are going to go to electricity, right?

991
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:02,640
Electric motor fan or whatever. Yeah. Turning that motor.

992
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:07,840
OK. And then from that, they think about an electrical generator.

993
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,600
Right. Go to a construction site, whatever.

994
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,280
Someone has an emergency backup. What's that?

995
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,120
Oh, it's an electrical generator where that thing doesn't generate

996
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:19,660
any electricity any more than a water pump generates water.

997
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,960
And what I mean by that,

998
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,720
you have here in your mind anyone, you know what electrical

999
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,580
what they call an electric generator is now put in your mind a water pump.

1000
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,400
Do you expect to go out and buy a water pump?

1001
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,000
Just leave it in the box. Plug it in.

1002
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:35,560
Just open the top. Pull the cord out. Right.

1003
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:39,300
Plug it in. Do you expect water to start shooting out of it?

1004
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,180
No, only if you're an idiot. But yeah. Right.

1005
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,240
Well, so that's why they're calling them generators.

1006
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:49,520
They're not what the water pump is designed to do is have an input and output.

1007
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:54,280
Right. And the input is a static body of water or a certain pressure or volume

1008
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:58,300
or rate. And depending on the design of the pump, how big it is,

1009
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:02,540
how fast it spins, the impeller is the output, how much pressure.

1010
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,180
Right. And all this.

1011
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,660
They all have different ratings, just like generators do.

1012
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,180
They all have different ratings.

1013
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,840
Now, simply what the generator is doing, it does need a prime mover.

1014
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,320
You could crank it by hand.

1015
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:16,840
You can have it to a gas driven engine or on a waterfall.

1016
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:22,060
You know how they do the the dams is to drop water on a spinner.

1017
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:26,520
The hydro hydropower or heat, you know, you boil water

1018
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:30,600
and you turn the steam turbine using whatever, you know, burn garbage, coal,

1019
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:31,680
oil, nuclear, whatever.

1020
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,780
OK, so what they're doing

1021
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:40,380
is that they're rotating a magnet with an electrical field coil.

1022
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:44,720
And as the magnetic poles, as they state,

1023
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,160
pass and cut the wire.

1024
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,320
In other words, the field of the of the

1025
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,700
the magnet goes through the wire.

1026
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:55,680
It generates an impulse is what they're telling you.

1027
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,960
It's actually what it's doing is the same thing that a water pump does.

1028
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:03,420
If the water pump isn't moving, how much water is moving right through it?

1029
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:07,980
Nothing. As you start to move the water pump faster, more water pumps

1030
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:11,460
through based on how it's designed, the same principles happening

1031
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:14,280
with the electric generator internally.

1032
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,040
Right. But it needs a prime mover.

1033
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:19,360
In other words, you have to turn the generator with something.

1034
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:23,900
OK, so the idea here is if you move a little bit further,

1035
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:27,320
while the easiest thing then, Chuck, would be to hook up that generator

1036
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,620
to a windmill, right?

1037
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:34,600
Or hook it up to a water, a river like the water wheels, you know.

1038
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:38,780
And back in the days, you know, the windmills were used to grind

1039
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:41,640
to make grain flour and grind things right.

1040
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:44,940
Or even as water pumps as as they turned.

1041
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:48,000
And the water wheel was used for whatever.

1042
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,900
It's been used for thousands of years, literally.

1043
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,580
OK, so that is the prime mover.

1044
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:57,500
But here's the concept now where we get into the free energy part,

1045
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:00,060
because it's very much in line

1046
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,520
with all these things and the metaphors and examples

1047
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,400
and analogies I just gave.

1048
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,220
It's exactly the same thing.

1049
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,760
It's not this mysterious whatever. Right.

1050
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:15,560
So here's the here's the you said it's died out a little bit.

1051
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:17,840
We go online, whatever, because it's always this mysterious thing

1052
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:18,700
that you're looking at.

1053
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:23,000
You have to lay out the premises of what you have, what's really going on

1054
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,660
and then move into that category. Right. Yeah.

1055
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,420
All right. So we have the idea

1056
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:34,720
that let's say if you go to this, the regular academic, academic science

1057
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:38,580
that everything is moving, you know, like magnets

1058
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:41,060
even have a rate, a little more frequency. Right.

1059
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,200
It's magnets are actually moving at a frequency.

1060
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,340
People talk about the speed of light.

1061
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:48,580
No one talks about the speed of magnetism. Right. True.

1062
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,940
You know, you could sense it. Right.

1063
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:55,200
So you have the idea of like they tell you these little electrons

1064
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,260
are running around the inside of an atom.

1065
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:03,820
You know, it's the proton and he's got a lazy cousin, the neutron. Right.

1066
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,800
And all this other stuff's moving.

1067
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,780
They tell you the planet's moving around the sun,

1068
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,540
the planet's spinning a thousand miles an hour,

1069
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:14,400
six thousand miles around the sun, but all these things, everything's in motion.

1070
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,640
Right. OK, so.

1071
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:21,400
But it seems to be static at the at this time.

1072
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,580
We don't sense all of these movements. Right.

1073
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,120
OK, what's happening is very simple.

1074
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:32,080
Let's say you have two cars on the highway

1075
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,140
and they're both going 50 miles an hour.

1076
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:38,920
As long as the windows are rolled up, I could look over at the car next to me

1077
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,040
and it doesn't look like they're moving at all, does it?

1078
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,760
I'm not looking at their surroundings, just the inside of the car.

1079
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,540
We're both moving at the same speed. Right.

1080
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,400
If you're traveling at the same rate of speed. Right. Yeah.

1081
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:51,840
But if I carefully open the door and drag my knuckles on the road.

1082
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,660
What happens? I'll tear my arm off.

1083
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:58,140
No kidding. I mean, look, you can see this in movies all the time, right,

1084
00:49:58,140 --> 00:49:59,540
where you see that a car is moving

1085
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:02,680
when they actually would drive a car next to a car so they could film

1086
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,660
people sitting in a car while they drive.

1087
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:06,560
That's the idea. They're usually on trailers.

1088
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:08,700
But yeah, of course, that's the way.

1089
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:12,380
But what I'm saying is the concept is the car is moving down the road.

1090
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:16,120
You put something next to it that is outside of the car and you can shoot

1091
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:19,040
from the outside of the car and move the car, move the surroundings.

1092
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:21,860
Yeah, it's the same sense of motion. Yeah. Yeah.

1093
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:25,240
Well, I'm giving the sense of motion because we're told that everything

1094
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,580
around us is moving.

1095
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,940
Right. Right. And but we don't sense it.

1096
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:33,140
I mean, do you sense that they're telling us, which I don't believe for a second,

1097
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:37,740
that we're moving 66,000 miles around the sun per hour

1098
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:40,260
and the earth is spinning a thousand miles an hour.

1099
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,980
Eight hundred to a thousand miles an hour.

1100
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:45,280
If you were on anything that was spinning at that rate of speed,

1101
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,420
you figure you'd feel it. But yeah, right.

1102
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,400
Yeah. But let's say it was true.

1103
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:53,220
Let's say all these things are in motion, which I suggest they are.

1104
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:56,380
In other words, another in previous Sonics, I've talked about another

1105
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:59,320
for something to appear solid in the matrix that we're in.

1106
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:02,840
The ether that we're in, it has to be in a state of motion,

1107
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:05,440
just like putting your hand through a fan or a bicycle wheel.

1108
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,100
If it's not moving, you can move freely.

1109
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,540
But once it's in motion, it appears to be solid.

1110
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:11,800
Right. The area that it would be moving it.

1111
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:16,140
And this is true. This has been shown many times with certain frequencies

1112
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:18,160
and impulses on materials.

1113
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:22,600
You can actually put a, you know, a regular lead pencil through a steel beam.

1114
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:26,500
Right. It's not very popular, but the stuff exists.

1115
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:30,500
You can see it. Also, people with the loud subwoofers in the car,

1116
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:34,020
you can see the window if the camera picks it up with the flicker rate.

1117
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:37,280
Much better. The glass is flexing like it's made of jello,

1118
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:40,380
but it doesn't break. Right. Right. Because of the sound waves.

1119
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:43,840
You could look up how car bodies ripple with subwoofers.

1120
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:48,000
It happens in real time, but you don't notice it until you put a camera

1121
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,520
that has a certain flicker rate on it.

1122
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:54,220
LEDs, if you ever look at a someone's YouTube of a new car,

1123
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:56,960
it looks like the headlights are on and they're always flicking, flickering.

1124
00:51:57,060 --> 00:52:00,700
But you don't notice the flickering with a regular high because the flicker rate

1125
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:02,860
the camera picks up.

1126
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,600
So there is evidence of oscillations and movements.

1127
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:09,400
Now, let's go back to the analogy where the two cars are

1128
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,800
next to driving next to each other at the same speed.

1129
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:16,260
There's no apparent relative movement until you somehow adjust or make

1130
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:20,840
an adjustment and notice how if you stick your knuckles down on the ground

1131
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:23,540
and drag them on the road, they're going to it's going to pretty much not just

1132
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,480
damage your knuckles, but rip your arm off. Right.

1133
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:29,360
That's an extreme example if you're going at highway speed.

1134
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,580
But relatively, as you're next to the other car,

1135
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:35,200
perceiving the inside of the car, there's no relative movement.

1136
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:38,600
By the way, I'm not this is not going to anything Einsteinian

1137
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:42,140
with his relativity garbage, which is a theoretical,

1138
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:47,160
philosophical, never science, because he he got that from Pankare,

1139
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:50,100
a French physicist way before his time, but

1140
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:53,320
actually not way before, but decades.

1141
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,680
So here's the other misnomer.

1142
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,960
Now, if you understand what the analogy I gave, that there's no movement,

1143
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:02,780
but you can actually feel the effects of it.

1144
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:08,060
We move forward into what if you why reinvent the wheel?

1145
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:11,720
This is a statement that's constantly being made.

1146
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,060
But, you know, is there anything that we need to do

1147
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:17,720
that hasn't been done by nature already?

1148
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,620
And the answer to that is no. Right.

1149
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,880
Because when I say that, let's say even to the stars,

1150
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:25,280
that's already everything is pretty much done naturally.

1151
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,920
So let's move to another analogy.

1152
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:32,560
And everyone, I'm sure, that's heard Greek speak is very well primed

1153
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:37,780
in this or primed enough that the heart does not pump any blood ever.

1154
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:40,960
It's a breaking mechanism. Right.

1155
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:45,080
So what is happening is that the there is a biological vacuum,

1156
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:49,840
a slight negative pressure right in the body that is

1157
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:54,800
a the condition, the overall scale or condition of the body.

1158
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,620
And the movement towards the heart

1159
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:02,780
is already provided by the capillaries. Right.

1160
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:07,860
And I don't know if I've ever gone into the biology of this very much,

1161
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,800
but essentially it's the capillaries that are moving everything

1162
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:14,200
because it's impossible for it to be the other way,

1163
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:17,740
because you have 2000 miles of blood vessels in the body.

1164
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:25,020
You're an adult, 50 percent solids, 98 degrees or 37 Celsius.

1165
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:27,320
Would it be that much, that length?

1166
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,880
2000 miles if you laid it out straight. Really?

1167
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,220
All the blood vessels. Yeah.

1168
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:33,900
A little bit more. It's more like 2400.

1169
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,320
I'm being conservative. Really?

1170
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:36,960
I don't know. I just see.

1171
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,920
I mean, I often remark about how, you know, the length of intestines

1172
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,160
are pretty extreme.

1173
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:44,440
You know, I tell people there's 50 feet of that on the one

1174
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:45,620
the one part of the intestine.

1175
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:48,500
Yeah. All the blood vessels in the body are around for an adult.

1176
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:49,440
Depends on the size.

1177
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:52,900
But between 2000 and let's say 3000. Wow. Right.

1178
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,880
OK, no, I just think it's kind of mind blowing to consider that.

1179
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,480
Yeah. Average diameter of half a millimeter.

1180
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:00,900
Right. There's you would need.

1181
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:04,880
We did this on a computer a long time ago, a university computer.

1182
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:08,640
It stated that you would need 1200 horsepower pump

1183
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,840
and it would only go 200 miles.

1184
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,360
So a 1200 horsepower pump only 10 percent. Right.

1185
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:20,040
So you would need 12000 horsepower to pump, you know, the blood.

1186
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:21,640
And this is totally ignored.

1187
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,140
In other words, they're giving you an engineering

1188
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:25,860
structural analogy of the heart.

1189
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:30,540
But if you go to engineering and structures, none of it makes any sense. Right.

1190
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:32,740
So here's the interesting thing.

1191
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:36,880
The heart is actually acting as a breaking mechanism. Right.

1192
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:41,520
So and this is already happening in nature. Right.

1193
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:44,240
Because when you have induction in anything,

1194
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:48,380
whether it's a plant, animal or human, there has to be regulation and control.

1195
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,940
This induction is happening from an energetic point of view.

1196
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:54,980
So we have glands and organs and circulatory systems, the heart

1197
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:57,360
and things like that, that move not to create movement.

1198
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:58,720
The movement's already happening.

1199
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:03,080
It's to constrict it and restrict it and regulate. Right.

1200
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:08,040
So in essence, if you look at the heart as a breaking mechanism

1201
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:11,580
and it's a it's a natural occurrence.

1202
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:15,600
Why don't we start applying breaking mechanisms

1203
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,500
to the energy modalities that you're seeking?

1204
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:21,900
In other words, if you're looking to make electricity

1205
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:27,500
instead of providing a prime mover to move a field coil and a magnet

1206
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:31,040
to pressurize the ether, the static. Right.

1207
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:36,700
You end up creating electricity of a certain type. Right.

1208
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:40,920
You know, for example, when you're producing, let's say, consumables like oils,

1209
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:44,340
you have cold press oil, regular pressed oil. Right.

1210
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:48,480
So the way that the oil is produced, how things are fermented,

1211
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:51,740
how things are prepared, you want it fried, baked or steamed. Right.

1212
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:53,220
The same thing.

1213
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:56,880
Different methods of preparation will yield a different almost thing.

1214
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:01,860
Like if I steamed a hamburger or I fried a hamburger or I grilled it on the fire.

1215
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:04,460
It's like having three completely different meals. Right.

1216
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:05,640
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

1217
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:09,480
So the type of electricity that we're used to, that we would like free energy

1218
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:13,240
to replace is for, let's say, a steamed hamburger.

1219
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:16,620
It's it's it's this type of electricity that's produced

1220
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:19,600
with a prime mover that moves a magnet or coil

1221
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:24,160
in a field situation to take the electrostatic field

1222
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,980
that it's static field again, like the water pump. Right.

1223
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:32,900
We're trying to find things that are static and get them moving at great expense.

1224
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:36,360
Why not looking at things that are already moving

1225
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:40,980
and instead of trying to get things that are static moving,

1226
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:45,540
why don't we get things that are already moving into a braking situation?

1227
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:49,820
What happens when you I don't know, I've done this several times.

1228
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:52,680
Someone pulls up to me to check out their car and it's about brakes

1229
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:57,020
and they just drove around and drove around and you take the wheel off.

1230
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,680
You want to check out the brake, touch the brake.

1231
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:01,380
Ah, really hot, like a really hot pan. Right.

1232
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,480
Lots of energy going into the brakes.

1233
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,880
The brakes uptake mechanical energy and dissipate it right into heat.

1234
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:09,520
Let's say typically it's more than just heat.

1235
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:13,100
There's a lot of torsion, internal torsion that develops as well and electricity.

1236
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:17,440
So instead of trying to create these prime movers to move things,

1237
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,520
to get something out of something that's static, that we won't be able

1238
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:23,420
to get it out of it unless we already start something moving.

1239
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:27,320
Why don't we look at all these things are already in extreme motion.

1240
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:30,660
The thing is that the if the motions are relatively,

1241
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:36,640
I would say, moderate, we already use them like running water or wind or whatever.

1242
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:40,020
What if we start going to motions that are extremely fast?

1243
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,820
Then we just need a subtle braking mechanism.

1244
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:44,940
We don't need such an extreme breaking mechanism

1245
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:46,740
because it's already very high energy.

1246
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,100
We just need a little bit of it. Right.

1247
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,560
Tesla talked about that when they told him about nuclear energy.

1248
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:54,240
He says, oh, that's nothing but an infant's

1249
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,040
consumptive breath compared to capacitive discharge.

1250
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:58,360
Now, I'm not preparing.

1251
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:00,460
I'm going into the technical aspects of this.

1252
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:04,020
But I just wanted to create an introduction to understand

1253
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:07,740
that what is being put out there again?

1254
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:10,080
I not at the fault. OK.

1255
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:12,300
You know how you have disinfo agents.

1256
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:16,180
I believe that the majority of these disinfo agents don't think

1257
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:17,980
that they don't know that they're disinforming.

1258
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:20,080
That has been led to do so. You know what I mean?

1259
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:23,220
Right. They're they're producing that they're producing disinformation.

1260
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:25,960
But to their minds, they're producing good information.

1261
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:27,900
They're doing the right thing. Yeah. Right.

1262
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:29,080
That's yeah.

1263
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:31,960
And I think you definitely would have seen that or realized that

1264
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:33,880
what the research you're doing with JFK.

1265
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:35,100
Well, I encounter it constantly.

1266
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:37,560
You think you're doing the right thing, but you're not.

1267
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,300
Yeah. I see it all the time.

1268
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:40,640
Look here. Yeah. Look at this.

1269
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:44,320
You know, this completely undoes what you've been promoting, let's say. Right.

1270
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:47,320
Right. So and then, you know,

1271
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:50,200
they either do two things, one, argue about it

1272
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,820
or they just completely negate it like you never told them. Right.

1273
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:57,220
So, right. It's either ignore or or possibly confront it.

1274
00:59:57,220 --> 00:59:58,840
And, you know, they yeah.

1275
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:03,200
And then, you know, hopefully hopefully there's a tie or or they prevail.

1276
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:07,540
So this is very much what's this is what people have.

1277
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:10,600
I mean, look, I've said this many, many, many, many years ago.

1278
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,180
If well, maybe just many years ago, not many.

1279
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:14,900
I'm not many, many, many years old.

1280
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:19,560
But if there's anything out there that, you know, worth listening,

1281
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:21,600
I wouldn't be doing Greek speak at all.

1282
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:23,900
It's just that I keep discovering things and looking at

1283
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:25,380
and thinking about things in a certain way.

1284
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:28,600
And I'm like, OK, let's go ask around and see who else is.

1285
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:30,000
And I find that no one else is.

1286
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:33,080
I'm like, OK, all right, I'm not going to keep it to myself.

1287
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,060
You know what I mean? Right.

1288
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:37,540
So, OK, just to go back to the free energy.

1289
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:39,360
So instead of looking for these prime movers,

1290
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:42,340
why don't we just go over and find things that are already moving

1291
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:44,600
and already have what's called a difference in potential?

1292
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,440
Here's a very simple way to look at it.

1293
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:49,960
Again, free energy.

1294
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:52,060
First thing that comes up is a light bulb electricity.

1295
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:54,960
The type of electricity that they're using, by the way,

1296
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:57,160
is not going to work with the free energy system.

1297
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,100
It's going to be different.

1298
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,840
If you're used to like a charbroiled hamburger

1299
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:03,120
and now you're going to only have a steamer,

1300
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:06,540
you'll never have a charbroiled hamburger again if you only have a steamer. Right.

1301
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:10,580
So the variety of preparations and the energy is going to be very different.

1302
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:12,660
But nonetheless, it will still be energy.

1303
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:16,420
So to give an example, when you think of free energy,

1304
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:18,040
the first thing that comes up is electricity.

1305
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:21,440
OK, well, how do we what are the most rudimentary things?

1306
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,020
You know, if you're a carpenter, you use a tape measure or a ruler. Right.

1307
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:25,740
Right. When you're working with electricity,

1308
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:28,800
the first thing you're going to have to get is a voltmeter. Right.

1309
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:32,240
So what is if you look up a definition?

1310
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:33,780
Actually, I haven't done this in a long time.

1311
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:35,940
Let's just just bear with me for a second.

1312
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:40,080
I'm going to open the browser and I'm going to put in how does a voltmeter work?

1313
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:43,100
Is that right? And I haven't.

1314
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:47,000
Let's let's see what they say, because it has to do with the.

1315
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:52,060
OK, I'll show you how they're showing what they want you to see.

1316
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:54,520
But and not not ask any questions.

1317
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:59,340
Let's see. Conceptually, this is why I used to like the concept of solar energy,

1318
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:01,940
because it's taking something that already exists,

1319
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:04,820
is already abundantly happening.

1320
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:10,640
And you just simply redirect it for now, redirect it and gather it.

1321
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:13,600
You know, I see nothing wrong with the concept.

1322
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,960
As long as your panels are less than 15 percent efficient,

1323
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:21,000
they had 30 and 40 percent efficient panels made with molybdenum

1324
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,900
and other alloys back in the 1800s.

1325
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:26,800
But you can't have those just like the 100 mile per gallon carburetor.

1326
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:28,580
You can't have that. OK, here we go.

1327
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,560
Voltmeters. How does a voltmeter work?

1328
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:35,200
Voltmeters operating on electrostatic principle use the mutual repulsion

1329
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:38,860
between two charge plates to deflect the pointer attached to a spring.

1330
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:40,560
OK, let's OK.

1331
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:44,420
OK, so here the the electrostatic electro, what is static mean?

1332
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:46,720
Not moving. Right. It's ever present.

1333
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:48,520
And electro. OK.

1334
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:51,220
Again, you see it's about electrostatics.

1335
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:54,640
But again, why is electrostatic not moving here?

1336
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:57,280
Here's let's see how does the electronic

1337
01:02:58,340 --> 01:02:59,480
that's going to have to do.

1338
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:03,020
Let's see if it talks about rectification on tronic

1339
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:07,080
because most of the voltmeters are electronic now, digital, right? Right.

1340
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:11,380
The electronic voltmeter uses amplification or rectification or both

1341
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:13,940
to measure either alternating or direct current voltages.

1342
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:17,460
The current needed to actuate the meter movement is not taken from the circuit

1343
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,800
being measured. OK, so these are all pressure devices.

1344
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:22,100
In other words, you have to give it power for it to work.

1345
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:26,140
The analog, sometimes the old analog ones didn't.

1346
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:28,520
They had Leyden jars. OK, but this is where I'm going with it.

1347
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:31,840
Let's say people have been playing around with the silver,

1348
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,360
the aqua Sargentum

1349
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:38,860
and or either way you want to say it.

1350
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:43,180
But it's not colloidal silver, but let's just call it the silver.

1351
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:45,800
Have you been getting feedback on that, by the way, since?

1352
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:47,560
Tremendous. OK. Tremendous.

1353
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:49,500
I've been getting feedback on that for decades.

1354
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:52,080
So no, I'm just recently from the rated Y.

1355
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:53,200
Yeah. From rated Y.

1356
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:55,260
Because I haven't gotten any on that.

1357
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:56,620
So I was just curious.

1358
01:03:57,140 --> 01:03:58,500
Fair amount in the chat.

1359
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:01,460
Fair enough for what it is. Yeah. OK. Fair enough.

1360
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:05,420
Yeah. It's you know, here's the thing, just like with anything.

1361
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:09,180
If you just learned how to cook, don't expect to be a chef right away.

1362
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:11,960
You know, the more you use it, the more you get and the more you use it

1363
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:14,780
and the more you make it, the more you'll discover about it.

1364
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,300
Right. Of course. Yeah.

1365
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:19,660
Especially if you have experience with commercial colloidal silver.

1366
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:21,560
It'll be radically different.

1367
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:26,080
So, OK, so people have been working with silver.

1368
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:28,160
You'll notice that if you do a little bit of experimentation

1369
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:30,700
with metals with a voltmeter, if you, let's say,

1370
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:35,340
put different metals, let's say copper and iron or whatever,

1371
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:38,220
two different metals in water and you put a voltmeter across it,

1372
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:39,220
that's just a voltmeter.

1373
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:42,380
You'll notice that there's a little bit of an electrical charge

1374
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:44,120
coming across the two dissimilar metals.

1375
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:48,080
And one always assumes a positive, one always assumes a negative. Right.

1376
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:52,240
Typically, the larger elements will tend to be more negative

1377
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:56,520
than the smaller metals, meaning on the periodic table will be more positive.

1378
01:04:56,780 --> 01:04:58,600
Right. Yin and yang. Right. Again.

1379
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:00,840
So what's interesting here?

1380
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:05,880
If you're going to take a level of potential differences,

1381
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:10,360
what about if you have access to the equipment or the materials,

1382
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:14,440
start collecting materials, all the elements you can

1383
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:16,680
on the periodic table that you know,

1384
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:21,260
let's say, divided, that will always show up positive.

1385
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,880
And then try to collect as many materials as you can

1386
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,940
that you always know will show up negative. Right.

1387
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:28,100
Because you need positive and negative

1388
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:30,940
to make the circuit for the type of electricity that you want to do.

1389
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:33,120
So you take all those metals

1390
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:37,560
and you grind them up into an extremely fine powder and then center them,

1391
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:40,220
which is compress the powder so much that, you know,

1392
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:42,560
in neodymium magnets are centered, by the way,

1393
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:43,920
you know, that they have the shiny coating.

1394
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:45,100
It's just compressed powder.

1395
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:48,620
That's why if they're in water, they just dissolve, they break up. Right.

1396
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:53,180
You know, when you have one aspect of

1397
01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:56,420
sintered material that, you know, usually strikes positive

1398
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:59,400
and another aspect of material that's always strikes negative

1399
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,780
in a powdered form, why a powdered form?

1400
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:05,540
You could do plates, but powder gives you tremendous surface area.

1401
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:07,520
Right. You grind everything together. Right.

1402
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:12,020
And what happens if you put those together in water or not?

1403
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:15,960
All of the elements you could possibly get on the periodic table,

1404
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:19,480
put a voltmeter across it, what's going to happen?

1405
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:21,700
You're going to blow up the voltmeter. OK.

1406
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:24,660
I was going to say, I don't know, but OK.

1407
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:27,940
Well, yeah, it will be so much current and voltage going through that.

1408
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:30,920
Right. So why? Why? What's going on?

1409
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:32,900
Well, why? What's the big mystery?

1410
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:35,460
We're going to get into more of this in the future.

1411
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,860
But at least the primer, I think we've laid out.

1412
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:39,360
Fair enough.
