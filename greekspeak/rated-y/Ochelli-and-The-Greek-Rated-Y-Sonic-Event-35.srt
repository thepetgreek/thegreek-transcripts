1
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,540
Sonic Event 35, Ocelli in the Greek, rated Y.

2
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:16,420
You know, it's almost got a rhythm to it, probably because I'm making that happen.

3
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:23,020
But anyway, it is as it is, and here we are in the evening when we record or after the

4
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,360
sun goes down where I'm sitting.

5
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,700
But what day is it?

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,520
What day is it?

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,740
That's always a large question.

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,860
Greek, we could start there.

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,840
I also always ask you how you're doing, but how are you?

10
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:39,940
And what about this day, this time, this moon that we were just talking about before we

11
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:40,560
started recording?

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,800
Well, look, we've been over the lawful timekeeping.

13
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,020
If there's a better way to keep time, I'd like to know.

14
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,920
In other words, you don't have to subscribe to something that is commercial.

15
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:59,040
So what do they call those ring binders, loose-leaf paper, punched in there?

16
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,040
Well, they got a three-ring binder, and then you could have loose-leaf paper that goes

17
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,540
into it.

18
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,700
Some people don't have that anymore.

19
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,860
But if you have one of those around or a reference circle, I'm not going to tell anyone to really

20
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,200
go and cut a perfect circle.

21
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:18,000
But those little ring binders line up with the cornea and all that, the paper, just hold

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,640
up paper with a hole punch in it to the moon and move it back and forth and see if it fills

23
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,080
the hole just right at the edge.

24
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,940
And you'll notice that before it's full, it's very evident to see that it's not full.

25
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,000
Slightly usually between 7 and 10 o'clock on the face of a clock would be slightly flat.

26
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,760
Now when it's full, most people mistake the biggest moon to be the fullest moon.

27
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:49,940
It's always larger the night after, let's say, or even the pre-dawn after.

28
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:58,840
It's not a matter of the biggest moon, it's the roundest and the brightest luminosity

29
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,760
for its size.

30
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:05,120
So you can have a really small moon that's full, you'll notice that it's very round and

31
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,720
very bright.

32
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:12,600
The next night after a full moon, you'll notice that it's much larger, 30-40% larger, but

33
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,360
it's not as bright.

34
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,460
It's like you got closer and you turned the dimmer down, right?

35
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,860
The night before the full moon, it looks very bright, but it's not round.

36
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:29,760
So you'll notice, look at a clock face, between 6.30, 7, 8 o'clock, depending on where you

37
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:36,680
are on the earth, until about 10, 11 o'clock on a clock face, the left side will look a

38
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,680
little straightened out, the curvature will be slightly different.

39
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:47,440
So that's pretty much, I got all this from an oldest farmer's almanac from the 1800s,

40
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:47,980
by the way.

41
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,660
It was not a farmer's almanac, it was a little pamphlet.

42
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,760
See, they made, people wore vests and they had vest pocket books, this might sound foreign

43
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:02,780
if you're not in your 6th decade or 5th decade, they had, I don't know, you probably remember

44
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,480
vest pocket edition books, right?

45
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:11,820
Well, I've seen those, they're kind of like skinny, you know, the rectangular shape is

46
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:17,100
that the vertical is much more extended than the horizontal, the aspect.

47
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,180
More like the proportions of a pack of cigarettes or something.

48
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,580
Yeah, I've seen them, and you know what, it's funny, things like bus schedules and what not

49
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,220
are still designed this way when they make them on paper.

50
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,240
Sure, for pockets, yeah.

51
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,840
It's really out of habit, but it's just because that's the way it's always been done, this

52
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,640
is why they do them.

53
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,220
I don't think there's an efficiency reason for it, but I think initially it was designed

54
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:43,520
to fit in those vest pockets when they were doing these mass transit schedules, yeah.

55
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:49,600
You wore a vest, you know, with clothing, we'll one day get into clothing, but you wore

56
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,000
several layers, not because it was cold, even in the summer you wore several layers for

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,500
protection.

58
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:00,800
Just like today, if you go through certain Asian cities, you'll see white gloves, people

59
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,620
wear white gloves.

60
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:06,360
You don't know what the person was touching before you opened the, touched the handle

61
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:06,920
or whatever.

62
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,860
That's the first place I saw the masks, too, to be honest with you.

63
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,620
People just wearing what I used to call a surgical mask in the street, it just sort

64
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,540
of emerged in Asia first.

65
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:23,460
It makes sense because they use a lot of small engines, not anymore, but places, other more

66
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:28,160
Pacific Rim countries, they use these little tiny scooters, and they don't really run,

67
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,980
the engines don't run hot, and they burn oil, and there's particulates in the air, literally,

68
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:38,780
if you wear a white shirt, you take it home, if you're walking through the neighborhood

69
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:43,140
for a couple of hours or even an hour, take a white shirt off and hang it up in the light,

70
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,800
you'll see these little tiny black spots all over it from the oil coming out of the exhaust

71
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,280
of the tiny little engines.

72
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,320
The smaller the engine, the less efficient, by the way.

73
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:57,700
But there's actually physical particles, you know, it reminds me directly when, again,

74
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:03,060
you and I, similar age, when we were kids, there was a popular commercial on TV where

75
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,440
it was for smokers' tooth polish, right?

76
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,960
And what they would do is, you know, toothpaste for somebody who smokes, they would take a

77
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,540
cloth, a white cloth, and take a hit off a cigarette and then breathe through the cloth,

78
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:21,080
like, you know, breathe out through the cloth and then show you what was deposited on the

79
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,420
cloth.

80
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,920
Anyway, it's the other way around.

81
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:28,020
This way, it's like what's going in as opposed to what's coming out.

82
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:34,760
I mean, I remember in New York back in the late 70s or so, I would experience that.

83
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,400
But yeah, they wear all the masks and all the clothing and the protection.

84
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:44,740
Back to the Vest Pocket Edition, it was a small little hardbook, hardbound leather book.

85
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,280
It was about how to use a farmer's almanac, right?

86
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,220
And that was quite interesting because, you know, you have books written about books, right?

87
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,820
So how to read a book, basically, a certain book or a manual or whatever.

88
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,580
And it was quite interesting, and it kind of all came together because I was studying

89
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:05,400
scripture at the time, and I knew there was no Pope's work schedule and all the religions

90
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:11,700
and from whatever, they're all on the Pope's work schedule except for certain things they

91
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,340
might profess.

92
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:18,600
And you have then the very religious people, whatever.

93
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,120
You know, yeah, it's a very duality.

94
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,820
When I say very religious are the ones that use the dark moon, right, and sundown.

95
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:35,220
You know, let's say the Jews, the Karaites, you know, I think, admit it's the full moon, perhaps.

96
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,980
They still do sundown.

97
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,120
I said, all this confusion, you're either keeping...

98
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,560
If you're keeping time or measuring, any kind of measuring system has to have accuracy.

99
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,000
In other words, it can't be ambiguous, right?

100
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,540
Even when, back before they had tape measures, they would use a finger width, a hand's width,

101
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,180
or an elbow, right?

102
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,400
No, the reason why a foot is called a foot.

103
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,000
Sort of, yeah.

104
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:05,520
And that's close, but yeah, whose foot, whose elbow, whose finger, whose hand?

105
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:06,320
Right.

106
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,920
So when you do sundown and all these other things, oh man, is it vague?

107
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,480
Like the dark moon is super vague.

108
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,380
You can't use it for measurement.

109
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,940
So I said, there has to be an accurate way to...

110
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,640
And there you go.

111
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:25,900
I think I'm the only one that's put together noon and full moon as the terminal points

112
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,680
for the day and the month.

113
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,500
And then there's the year, which is a little more expanded, but works on those luminaries as well.

114
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,560
You know what I'm thinking might work better than the loose leaf paper hole you were talking about,

115
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,220
but a similar idea, is they make clear plastic pages that go into those loose leaf books, right?

116
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:43,780
Oh.

117
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:48,540
And if you were to take a Sharpie, say, you know, a black Sharpie,

118
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:54,160
and color in the edges of just that particular thing a little bit,

119
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:58,480
you'd be able to see on either side, and that way you would know if you're centering that thing

120
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,380
and you're having some of it hang over on one side or the other

121
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,240
to see if it fits into the perfect circle, so to speak, right?

122
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,140
But if there's no loose... I was pondering.

123
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,980
Yeah, I think the white paper looks pretty dark.

124
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,920
Remember that it'll illuminate.

125
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,200
It doesn't have enough illumination, but that's...

126
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,500
In other words, anything prefabricated,

127
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,380
in other words, something that's made by a big honking machine

128
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:27,120
that they guarantee or they're looking for good tolerances

129
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,180
of something round and small like that.

130
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:35,200
But the reason I was concerned is how many people still have loose leaf binders

131
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,500
or three-ring, four-ring, five-ring, whatever binders and, you know, access to them.

132
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,620
I mean, I'm thinking, you know, all this paper stuff is gone by the wayside.

133
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,860
No, they exist. I mean, they're still out there,

134
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,360
and schoolchildren still actually use them.

135
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,100
Oh, those blister packs, I got...

136
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,420
Oh, no, they're not really round anymore.

137
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,680
You know how they punch a hole when you buy an item hanging on a hook?

138
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,780
Yeah, yeah, right.

139
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,380
They're not really round any day.

140
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,560
Sometimes they... because they're made for double hooks also,

141
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,120
so it's a rectangular slot.

142
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,660
Yeah, sometimes they make them sort of universal

143
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,480
because there's like a two-level thing.

144
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,860
No, but the loose leaf, like you're talking about,

145
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,380
I mean, I have some of those binders,

146
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,840
but then again, I have a bunch of things that are like older school in nature.

147
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,640
But spool people, yeah.

148
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,860
A small spool like something, a thread that's used for spooling up on a sewing machine.

149
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,840
Oh, yeah, the ones that go in a sewing machine, perfect.

150
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,900
That would be...

151
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,640
If they're round, yeah, clean out the hole, whatever,

152
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,780
a piece of tubing or something prefabricated that's laying around.

153
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,220
You might even find it in the bin or the trash, something.

154
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,260
Just be aware.

155
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,540
Speaking of being aware, I wanted to talk about...

156
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,700
Maybe talk about heuristics, discovery of things, ideas.

157
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,900
Because I said I'm working on a bunch of stuff

158
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,280
and I had some ideas and hunches and whatever,

159
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,060
and I built it and it works really well,

160
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,160
better than I thought it would.

161
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,960
And it makes me feel like it's surreal, right?

162
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,720
Imagine having an idea of something that doesn't exist

163
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,180
and you put it together in the mind, right?

164
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,520
You know how they do it on a computer,

165
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,880
CAD computer, and they rotate it and all this?

166
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,960
I could do that in my head.

167
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,740
It's just practice.

168
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,160
You know, some people have good memories

169
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,220
and some people are visual kinesthetic.

170
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,200
You have to show me.

171
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,180
Some people, telling them is enough, right?

172
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,860
You got to put it all together and use that as a model.

173
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,340
Like, for example, if you see when they design something

174
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,220
and they CAD and they show you the different views

175
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,580
and they rotate it and all this,

176
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,300
see if you could do that in your mind.

177
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,040
It saves a lot of time.

178
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,720
And Tesla did stuff like that.

179
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,220
He would design things in his head

180
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,020
and then come back a month later to check it for bearing wear.

181
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,720
So he would be running it in another dimension, right?

182
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,780
Why not? Sure.

183
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,460
Yeah, so I've been practicing that for a couple of decades now

184
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,660
and I'm getting good at it.

185
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,620
Someone asked me,

186
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,120
how did you design that on a CAD system?

187
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:49,940
Which one do you have?

188
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,140
The one in my, the biological one.

189
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:52,900
And he's like, huh?

190
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,680
Again, goes back to the loose leaf paper, you know?

191
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:57,660
Right?

192
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,920
So, you know, right?

193
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,020
See, it's not the way things are done anymore.

194
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,460
And here's the bottom line, okay?

195
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,900
How you conceive of something,

196
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,300
how you construct it in your mind and everything else,

197
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,600
you have different points at which,

198
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,000
and then you have to articulate this to someone else.

199
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,120
You have to communicate it.

200
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,700
And this is where communication becomes an issue.

201
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,120
And I remember in the very first early episodes,

202
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,580
after you and I did some basics on what time it is

203
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,580
and stopped looking for Atlantis,

204
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,140
I think was one of the very first things, you know,

205
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,140
because you're standing on it,

206
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,740
stuff like that, after we got through that.

207
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,620
One of the versions of it, the main version of Atlantis, yes,

208
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,500
but then there were many Atlantises.

209
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,240
But yes, go ahead.

210
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,860
Well, yeah, but again, you know,

211
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,200
study for another day.

212
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,240
I'm just referencing it.

213
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,020
But the point is...

214
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,160
It's just like New York and New York, but...

215
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:43,360
Yeah.

216
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:43,640
Yeah.

217
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,760
Let me just stop you short right there.

218
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,420
So if you're trying to communicate an idea,

219
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,380
and I'm trying to say this while you're speaking,

220
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,400
and I want to just say this.

221
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:53,740
Go ahead.

222
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,940
Do not try it across the board.

223
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:58,540
Okay.

224
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,420
There's probably one out of 50,

225
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,720
one out of 100 would put it at 1%,

226
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,440
one out of 50 is 2% of the people

227
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,320
that are actually communicatable

228
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,560
on the heuristic side.

229
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,900
In other words, Chuck, you got a new idea,

230
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,260
you want to go communicate a totally new idea

231
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,500
that's new to that person,

232
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,460
and it's new to you.

233
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,620
And even though you're a good speaker,

234
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,340
a good communicator, they're not going to get it.

235
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,560
It's not your fault, right?

236
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,660
They're just not here for that.

237
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,420
I mean, I think a while back,

238
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,720
you and I, maybe eight years ago,

239
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,780
we were on a Skype call,

240
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,080
and we had a bunch of people

241
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,820
that I wouldn't normally do Skype calls with,

242
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,880
and this one lady kept butting in,

243
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,140
and I said, what do you do for a living?

244
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,720
Oh, wait, don't tell me.

245
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,480
I bet you wear a reflective vest

246
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,880
and hold a plastic broom, huh?

247
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,820
Is that your job?

248
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,020
I don't know if you remember that.

249
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:52,020
I intentionally wanted to tell her,

250
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,820
like, grab your vest and your broom

251
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,640
and get to work.

252
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,260
Skype calls about these things

253
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,180
is not your cup of tea.

254
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,480
Really rude, in a way,

255
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,260
because that's, you know,

256
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,920
I let her speak her mind

257
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,740
for so long, I said,

258
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,180
this has got to be cleaned up.

259
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,320
Most people don't do that.

260
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,720
Most people will go along and yes you to death

261
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,700
and whatever, right?

262
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,120
Yeah, and some people would say,

263
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,080
look, you're just being rude if you do that,

264
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,780
but in a case like this,

265
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,860
it was about, look, let's be efficient.

266
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,540
Let's be efficient about this discussion.

267
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,060
What she was doing was throwing a bunch of things

268
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,200
there that were not useful.

269
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,980
Yeah, but I do that often

270
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,100
and the reason is because

271
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,100
the percentage of what is out there

272
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,040
in terms of bipedal,

273
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,140
vertical, surface-toiling earth inhabitants

274
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,100
are not for,

275
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,060
they're programs

276
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:44,680
put here

277
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,680
to do things, right?

278
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,720
Like if you were designing a video game of a city,

279
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,960
you wouldn't do an empty city.

280
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,400
You would have people walking around, right?

281
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,980
How do you put those people walking around

282
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,980
in a video game? You program them in.

283
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:56,560
Yeah, of course.

284
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,160
If you start looking at them like programs

285
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,900
and you're looking for another player,

286
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,940
versus an NPC,

287
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,840
that puts the communication aspect

288
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,280
more in perspective, right?

289
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,060
The other thing is a sense of immediacy.

290
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,020
If you're trying to communicate with someone,

291
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,220
this is my advice,

292
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,320
yes, I do give advice,

293
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,920
and they don't get it,

294
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,480
you show it another way, just like different facets

295
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,320
and if they just leave them alone, that's it,

296
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,440
they're done, finished,

297
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,480
off to the side, next, who's next?

298
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,320
You've got billions of people to go through

299
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,820
and that's harsh, right?

300
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,540
Otherwise you're just going to be spinning your wheels,

301
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,900
oh, let's just spend time together,

302
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,920
oh, whatever, I enjoy your smell,

303
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,040
or I enjoy the way you look,

304
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,320
or whatever, that's fine too.

305
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,200
Yeah, there's something to be said for that,

306
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,960
it's not like that's never to be done,

307
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:44,880
but, you know,

308
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,800
in the proper timing,

309
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,980
when it's time to do that, do that,

310
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:50,780
but when it's not,

311
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,420
the biggest lie is that

312
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,280
you've got rights and we're all equal

313
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,880
and this and that and whatever,

314
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,360
that's total rubbish,

315
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,760
the stuff that's put out by the authorities,

316
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,500
you've got rights,

317
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,360
when you speak to

318
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,120
any of the authorities,

319
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,040
an attorney general, an attorney, a judge,

320
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,460
a police, military provost,

321
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,720
whatever, marshal, whatever,

322
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,660
in private,

323
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,600
they'll say, no, you don't have any rights,

324
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,440
at all, you do what you're told,

325
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,760
but in public, on TV,

326
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,940
they're constantly telling you,

327
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,360
so you have this schizophrenia,

328
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,120
where I totally agree

329
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,020
the structure is

330
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:30,880
the way it is,

331
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,740
I call it a digital colony,

332
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,260
where there's an empire

333
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:38,080
and we're colonialists, colonists,

334
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,720
and a digital empire

335
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,540
is what they're transitioning to,

336
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,680
it's still physical, but the control

337
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,520
is digital, right?

338
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,140
And

339
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,440
there's no

340
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,060
aspect of what they're saying

341
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,600
that holds in reality,

342
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,660
what's in reality is humans have always

343
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,780
been futile, it's a futile system,

344
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,460
you have the slaves and the serfs,

345
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,560
right?

346
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,640
There's a slight difference between slave and

347
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,740
serf, like you could sell a slave

348
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,740
as property, but a serf is more

349
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,540
like a very

350
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,560
strict work contract, right?

351
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,100
There's a difference, right?

352
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,560
And then you have the real

353
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,960
menial aspect of population,

354
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,360
which is about 95%

355
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,580
of the population, you know, that's why

356
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,420
people complain, I was having a conversation

357
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,600
with someone recently, oh yeah, we don't have

358
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,460
a lot of this and that because of

359
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,520
compartmentalization, everyone said

360
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,400
yeah, that's what they do,

361
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,580
that's exactly how

362
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,900
they should be, compartmentalized, they can't

363
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,000
think outside of,

364
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,420
in other words, there's a deep

365
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,360
aspect of the hybrid,

366
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,160
the human hybrid that exists right now,

367
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,580
was severely dumbed down

368
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,640
a long, long time ago.

369
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,640
And until

370
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,200
that gene dies out,

371
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,180
unfortunately, the dumber they are, the more children

372
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,720
they have, so it's the opposite, right?

373
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,080
The ones that can handle

374
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,160
the more evolved spiritual

375
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,840
awareness, remember,

376
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,500
there is a limit to hardware,

377
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:05,200
in other words,

378
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,160
you try to put Windows 10 on a Windows

379
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,980
95 machine from 30 years ago,

380
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,400
it's not going to do it, right?

381
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,839
So there is hardware, I don't know exactly,

382
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,980
I definitely can tell you it's not DNA,

383
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:17,180
it's not DNA based, it's much more

384
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,940
on how the human body

385
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,220
relates to the cloud, the network,

386
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,240
right? Just like if you try to put

387
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,020
a 35, 40 year old computer

388
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,420
on the internet, what will happen, right?

389
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,000
Won't work. So you're

390
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,020
stuck with this population

391
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,080
that's here now, but

392
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,080
you know, I always talk, it's going to be cleaned up,

393
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,160
it's not going to be

394
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,180
pretty, but you know, I don't know if you've ever

395
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,920
been into a place like a junkyard,

396
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,100
cleaning it up, it's not pretty.

397
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,420
So in a sense,

398
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,240
back to communication,

399
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,900
do a rough

400
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,740
evaluation, a snap judgment,

401
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,080
snap decision making, and hold that as a

402
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,020
reference mark, I've always talked about

403
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:55,400
this,

404
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,160
you know, the alternative media, all the

405
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,000
new age people,

406
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,980
the love and light, or this and that, that's

407
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,920
they're completely, everything

408
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,980
they say is the opposite, right? Especially the health

409
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,960
people. You take these herbs,

410
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,280
it'll lower your blood pressure,

411
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,780
has low calories, excuse me,

412
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,860
what did you just say?

413
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,500
Ridiculous, right? So

414
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,040
the whole thing

415
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,180
about that is

416
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,780
how to keep people distracted,

417
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,880
and they do it themselves, just like we

418
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,760
had an idea of

419
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,340
let's say

420
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,640
we go into the, even

421
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,480
JFK research, a lot of people are

422
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,560
putting out false information, they think

423
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,620
they're doing the right thing,

424
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,480
they don't know that it's false, so they're

425
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,460
like useful idiots, but they don't know they're

426
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,500
a useful idiot, right?

427
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,520
So there's this thing that keeps going

428
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,380
on and on and on, and it'll change,

429
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,360
but again, back to

430
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,500
communication and heuristics, if you

431
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,460
are operating on a certain level, you must

432
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,480
find people that are operating on that level.

433
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,680
A very simple

434
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,480
analogy is when you play in a

435
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,600
band, right?

436
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,360
When you say you play in a band,

437
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,100
what do you play, guitar? Okay, that

438
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,500
doesn't mean, that says a lot,

439
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,560
because if you tell me

440
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,440
you play guitar in a band and how long you've been

441
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,360
playing, I know you didn't get guitar

442
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,240
lessons a week ago, right?

443
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,160
It is highly unlikely, right?

444
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,300
Highly unlikely, yeah, so

445
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,340
there's certain things that, metrics

446
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,380
you can look at people, you know,

447
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,580
and very quickly make snap decisions,

448
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,020
very quick judgment calls.

449
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,240
That's why I just did a tangent

450
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,340
about the new age people, I said, don't be judgmental,

451
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,160
don't be judgmental, I said, it's amazing

452
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,280
you said, do you drive a car?

453
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,080
I was once on a Skype call with a radio person

454
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,900
when he was new age, a while back,

455
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,000
you're so judgmental,

456
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,820
I said, do you drive a car? I said,

457
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,000
yeah, do they have stop signs there?

458
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,100
Yeah, I said, it's amazing you're still alive

459
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,020
if you're not judgmental, because you're supposed to

460
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,060
stop at a stop sign, make a

461
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,420
judgment call left and right,

462
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,800
should I go or not? Do you just drive through a

463
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,940
stop sign or a light, see someone

464
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,880
crossing, you just keep going, because you don't

465
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,360
want to judge what you have to do?

466
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,800
What are you talking about? Condemnation

467
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,340
is the point, right?

468
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,780
So, if you use good judgment

469
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,440
you never have to condemn, because

470
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,780
the good judgment, you walk away from

471
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,440
the situation that will

472
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,860
eventually lead you, either through

473
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,920
anger or whatever, because anger feels good, by the way,

474
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,620
it's a release, it's an emo, right?

475
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,000
To condemn someone, like, go to hell

476
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,880
or whatever, you know, you hear that often, right?

477
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,420
Well, it's good

478
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,980
in its proper time, okay?

479
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,840
If you're constantly...

480
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,880
I don't think we're here for that, there's too many...

481
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,720
But somebody who's constantly angry

482
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,780
is not doing themselves any good, if they're

483
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,900
constantly angry... Oh, yeah, it'll affect the body

484
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,840
Yeah, I mean... But it is a release,

485
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,600
it is a necessary release, I mean,

486
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,700
even the quacky

487
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,680
therapist, it's like, go punch a pillow,

488
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,660
that's Reikian, by the way,

489
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,840
you know, they get all these things from Reikian therapy

490
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,540
and they never, right, admit them.

491
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,620
By the way, William Reik, the reason, one of the

492
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,820
reasons they punished him, not the reason, is because

493
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,900
he lived during a time in the 50s

494
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,740
and... well, actually, in the 50s

495
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,600
and 40s, where they were starting to narrow

496
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,340
things down. If you got an education

497
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,840
and a degree as, let's say,

498
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,260
a psycho-psychiatrist,

499
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,180
you cannot do biology,

500
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,520
you cannot do engineering, you cannot do

501
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,700
meteorology, right? If you get a degree

502
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,400
as an architect, you cannot do

503
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,600
oceanography, you have to stick in

504
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,200
your field.

505
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,100
The authorities

506
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,160
do not want to show multi-talented

507
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,560
people that you're,

508
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,400
like a Walter Russell type, who was an architect,

509
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,180
a scientist, an alchemist, you know,

510
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,140
did 14, 15 different things.

511
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,200
They don't want that, so if you

512
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,720
get a degree from them,

513
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,120
and let's say

514
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,340
whatever the degree is, you better stick to that field.

515
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,980
You start operating as an expert

516
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,080
or professional outside of that field, uh-uh,

517
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,280
can't do that, because what you're doing

518
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,180
is setting an example, right?

519
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,860
Right. Well, when you do that,

520
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,160
that's a very bad thing. A specialist is

521
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,260
fine, because they stay in their

522
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,220
lane, you know. Well, it's actually a good

523
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,080
thing, because we can do anything. People

524
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,120
say, oh, Greek, you're a jack of all

525
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,200
trades. No, no, excuse me. No, I'm a master

526
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,480
of quite a few trades,

527
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,260
right? I'm on a master level

528
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,340
of quite a few things.

529
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,360
Not a jack at all.

530
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,120
You know, if I

531
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,980
appear to be a jack of a trade, it's very

532
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,240
temporary, because, I'll tell you

533
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,860
why. I'll either

534
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,160
start advancing towards mastering

535
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,080
that technique, or I will abandon

536
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,240
it, because it's not something I want to dedicate time

537
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,280
to, and have someone who is a master fill in

538
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,220
to do it for me, or with me. Right. You see?

539
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,240
That would be the most intelligent thing to do. So you don't want

540
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,580
to stay as a jack.

541
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:28,980
So, um,

542
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,160
but anyway, they borrow from right, they tell you

543
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,900
to punch a pillow, the anger and all that,

544
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,300
all the emo thing,

545
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,220
any emotional carrier

546
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,160
will always result in a

547
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,000
physical manifestation of your actions,

548
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,240
your speech, and then

549
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,000
eventually manifestations

550
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,540
in the body, right?

551
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,060
The body's formation, health, all this other

552
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,120
stuff, in terms of the

553
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,720
anger. But it is a

554
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,260
necessary,

555
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,660
I wouldn't say necessity,

556
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,860
but it's there as a

557
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,140
necessary aspect. In other words, to tell people

558
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,400
they can never be angry,

559
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,300
right,

560
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,100
is harmful.

561
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,860
But to manage it, and to

562
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,940
keep it, it's not

563
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,240
a necessary thing, right?

564
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,920
But it is a necessary part

565
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,500
of the toolbox. It's just there.

566
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,140
It's kind of like... Well, you don't fix everything

567
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,020
with a hammer, but sometimes you damn well need

568
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,980
a hammer. Yeah, or the fire

569
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,460
extinguisher, you know, in the building.

570
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,040
I remember going into buildings for years, and the same

571
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,000
old fire extinguisher's sitting there. It's there.

572
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,080
No one uses it, right?

573
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,240
You don't need it.

574
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,000
But essentially, back

575
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,720
to the heuristics and communication,

576
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,820
do a snap judgment.

577
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,560
If this person, for example,

578
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,380
you know, I play guitar

579
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,960
in a band for five years. Well, you know

580
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,780
a lot.

581
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,640
Not how well they play,

582
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,080
but you know that they consider themselves

583
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,900
an expert, enough that

584
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,780
other people...

585
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:58,040
There are many metrics you can use when you're speaking

586
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,020
to people, even if they're not

587
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,980
present. A lot of people say, yeah, look at their eyes if they

588
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,920
glaze off. Yeah, but sometimes with

589
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,660
the digital age, you don't have the convenience

590
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,860
of looking at their eyes, right? You could be just on the

591
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,940
phone. There's a certain... There's different types

592
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,620
of silence, by the way. You know, when

593
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,680
you're speaking to someone, let's say on a phone or

594
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,800
a device, and

595
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,160
they're silent, and when

596
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,880
you would expect a response, there's different

597
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,900
variations of that silence. How long

598
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,820
it is, how deep the silence

599
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,820
is. Sometimes you could feel people drifting

600
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,820
away on the phone.

601
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,940
It's a feeling. That's the emo

602
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,600
aspect of it.

603
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,680
Yeah, of course.

604
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,280
It goes beyond the audible.

605
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,260
But you'll notice

606
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,560
the different silences that

607
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,380
people give.

608
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,380
It's

609
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,440
almost as...

610
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,700
It's almost as...

611
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,520
When you focus on that, it's

612
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,580
almost as evident as when people can

613
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,540
raise their voice in laughter, they could

614
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,640
raise their voice in anger, or they could just raise their voice

615
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,640
because they think you're not hearing them. Different

616
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,380
elevated voices,

617
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,860
different levels of silence.

618
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:03,900
The

619
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,420
heuristics and the communication.

620
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,360
Heuristics

621
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,040
is basically discovery heuristic.

622
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,660
Eureka means found it.

623
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,640
And heuristics

624
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,500
is basically based around discoveries

625
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,380
and finding things, usually

626
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,900
things that are there always.

627
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,220
If you look at most inventions

628
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,400
and most contraptions or gadgets,

629
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,700
it's a combination of geometries

630
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,360
and materials and shapes

631
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,460
and functions of other things put together

632
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,020
to do something different

633
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,920
that makes it new. But nothing is

634
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,420
completely original.

635
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,500
They might look completely original, but obviously

636
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,680
you're going to have to build it from common materials

637
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,460
that are accessible or not so

638
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,520
common. Something that you can access

639
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,620
that anyone else can access.

640
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,320
The way of putting things together

641
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,220
when you're, let's say,

642
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,040
making a prototype of something

643
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,080
that you think doesn't exist or really

644
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,960
from searching notice doesn't exist,

645
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,060
and then trying to communicate

646
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,000
that to someone

647
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,880
is really the

648
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,680
point of the

649
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,480
communication of

650
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,760
the heuristics.

651
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,580
Otherwise, they have common communication.

652
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,380
Hello, goodbye.

653
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,420
My favorite is, have a nice day.

654
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,740
I'm sure you certainly will.

655
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:16,760
So,

656
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,920
speaking of having a nice day

657
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,200
without getting too deep into other things,

658
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,840
in America here, it's

659
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,700
the 4th of July. They're celebrating. You said

660
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,880
there might be fireworks and dogs barking or something.

661
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,540
It could be.

662
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,940
Do you think they're going to...

663
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,160
Notice how it's backwards.

664
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,760
March the 9th, 1933 passed

665
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,340
already and it wasn't a peep.

666
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,980
Nobody talked about it.

667
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,700
That was the day the country

668
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,040
died. But they're still celebrating.

669
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,620
Oh, but wait a second.

670
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,540
That seems to be part of the custom because

671
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,720
they have George Washington's

672
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,580
birthday and whatever, right?

673
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,360
Don't they celebrate birthdays still of people

674
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,180
that are long dead?

675
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,760
Of course. There's still holidays built around it.

676
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,760
We have President's Day now, but at one point

677
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,220
there was celebrating what?

678
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,560
Washington's birthday and Lincoln's birthday too.

679
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,640
Yeah, right.

680
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,880
But they tend to forget that

681
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,620
it's really strange

682
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,340
that they're dead. But does anyone

683
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,340
know when they died

684
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,600
or remember that day? That seems to be customary.

685
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,540
I can't fault them too much for not knowing

686
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,780
what March the 9th, 1933

687
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,840
means. Maybe that's why

688
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,940
they just, if you ask them what the 4th of July

689
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,540
Independence Day for the Americans is,

690
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,760
what was that guy that goes

691
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,560
on the beach with a microphone? Dice?

692
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,700
Mark Dice?

693
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:32,880
Yeah.

694
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,640
Dice, right? What's the

695
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,720
July 4th mean? I don't know. It's a day for

696
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,680
hot dogs and fireworks.

697
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:40,820
Mark Dice.

698
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,760
I was going to say Andrew Dice Clay, but it's not

699
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,960
Andrew Dice Clay. It's Mark Dice.

700
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,840
Andrew Silberstein, the Andrew Dice Clay character.

701
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,960
That's a stand-up comedian, but it's very funny

702
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,720
to watch him ask some common questions,

703
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,340
and sometimes he does things like, you know,

704
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,900
can you find this place on a map?

705
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,020
Sometimes it's the place they're standing in.

706
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,460
I don't think

707
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,900
he ever did it in Jersey, but one time

708
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,780
he did it in a place where it was like, can you find

709
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,140
this state on the map?

710
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,700
It's the place they're supposed to be in, and they

711
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,480
cannot find it.

712
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,780
Most Americans, if you show them a map

713
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,380
of the world to point to the U.S.,

714
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,740
90% of the time they point to

715
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,200
Australia.

716
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,500
It kind of sticks out, right?

717
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,780
I've never seen that.

718
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,700
They always

719
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,620
point to Australia. Not always, but the majority

720
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,680
of them, yeah. 90% point

721
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,900
to Australia. It's the world map, you know, the flat one, right?

722
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,560
The Mercator

723
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,340
or whatever it is.

724
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:33,920
Strange.

725
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,660
I thought it was crazy that people would not be able to

726
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,800
find the state. Because I remember, again,

727
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,800
being taught, even the things

728
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,760
that we were taught in school at the time that you and I

729
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,720
were of school age, one of the things

730
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,840
they always made sure we knew is where the state

731
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,780
was that we were in.

732
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,140
I just thought it was...

733
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,400
You could at least find that.

734
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,900
You might not know where Wisconsin is,

735
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,540
but you knew where...

736
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,200
Here's the state for the Americans.

737
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,060
Have you seen the film Goodfellas?

738
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:02,600
Of course.

739
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:03,980
If you remember it?

740
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,880
There's a whole part of the

741
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,740
film where the mobsters go to a

742
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,780
restaurant and they keep racking

743
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,760
up the bill, the tab on the liquor and the

744
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,840
food, and they never pay it.

745
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,800
The restaurant owner goes to one

746
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,660
of the mobsters and says, look, I got this big bill

747
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,420
or whatever. He's never going to pay it.

748
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,920
He says, all right, make me a partner.

749
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,360
I'll take care of it.

750
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,760
As soon as he makes him a partner, the other guy comes in

751
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,780
and sells everything that he has,

752
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,940
all the liquor and whatever on the black market.

753
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,680
He can't pay the bill. They have to torch

754
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,680
the place for insurance,

755
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,800
right? That's exactly what's going

756
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,640
on in America.

757
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,080
By 1933

758
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,880
is when they went into full

759
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,920
partnership with the other mobsters

760
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,740
full on.

761
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,220
Before that,

762
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,840
it was just a group

763
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,920
that was sick, private bankers

764
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,620
and others that were put on the Americans,

765
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,480
the government to

766
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,980
change its policy, 16th Amendment,

767
00:29:59,160 --> 00:29:59,960
all this other stuff.

768
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:03,080
When they bankrupted it on March 9, 1933,

769
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,080
if you go read the...

770
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,920
They prominently post it on Google,

771
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,720
by the way. It's only like two paragraphs.

772
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,860
You can read it. You won't understand what it means

773
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,880
unless you start defining what

774
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,920
the word discount rate and all these things really

775
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,580
mean legally.

776
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,520
That's when...

777
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,080
If you remember the restaurant scene,

778
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,880
that's what's going on

779
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,120
in this country right now.

780
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,600
It's going on in other countries

781
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,840
in a different way.

782
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,500
Hollywood showed...

783
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,840
You know how they showed the movie The Matrix?

784
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,020
The Goodfellas restaurant escapade

785
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,020
is exactly what's going on politically

786
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,340
and lawfully

787
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,060
with law and money.

788
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,660
If nobody ever saw it,

789
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,580
to summarize the whole thing, by the way,

790
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,820
he's got a problem getting paid from one guy.

791
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,220
He goes to somebody to,

792
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,920
help me solve this. I want to get paid for this one bill.

793
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,820
He goes, okay, I'll come in

794
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,440
and be a partner.

795
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,360
He reluctantly says, I don't know.

796
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,700
I don't know about the restaurant business,

797
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,620
but okay, I'll help you out.

798
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,000
He comes in and now the next part is

799
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,320
every week this guy's got to come up with his money.

800
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,320
He pays his new partner

801
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,140
every week, but any problems

802
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,020
he has are now supposedly solved.

803
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:12,840
However,

804
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,020
the problem

805
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,060
is that during all this, the bills are being

806
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,080
run up, stuff is coming in the front

807
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,100
door, going out the back, being sold at a discount

808
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,720
rate, on and on.

809
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,700
Sure, he got his problem solved,

810
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:25,920
so to speak.

811
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:29,080
It's kind of like if you

812
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,860
bump your shin and it hurts, then you get

813
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,740
punched in the nose. That hurts a little more, so you

814
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,260
don't feel it on the shin now, right?

815
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,820
Right. It's the whole, well, let me, what was it?

816
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,860
The movie Major Pain.

817
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,680
Somebody hurt themselves, they fell on their face.

818
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,060
Oh, my nose is, exactly.

819
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,820
Here, I'll fix that for you. Let me see. And he breaks his

820
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,280
finger.

821
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,960
You don't care about the nose anymore

822
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,960
because the finger's busted. That's what you're paying attention

823
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,280
to.

824
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,660
All of this is where it all started.

825
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,140
I mean,

826
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,880
it's kind of like a long story made short.

827
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,940
Is that people

828
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,040
came over to this side of the

829
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,980
world to get away from what was going on

830
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:07,060
on the other side of the world, but it followed them, right?

831
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:07,900
Yeah, of course.

832
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,700
So that's essentially what's going on.

833
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,040
But back to heuristics and communication.

834
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,860
The snap judgment,

835
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,280
a very rapid, quick judgment

836
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,540
of the situation.

837
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,640
Just like when you stop at a traffic light

838
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,800
or an intersection in a car, or walking

839
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,440
even, right? Let's say you're crossing the street.

840
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,880
I'm not going to judge.

841
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,800
I'm just going to keep walking.

842
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,800
You stop and you look at if it's going to bring

843
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,020
any danger to yourself.

844
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,880
You can also judge on what brings

845
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,580
pleasure to you.

846
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,540
We've given the analogy

847
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,420
often the lunch menu.

848
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,760
You go to have lunch. You look at the menu.

849
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,660
You're going to pick what's going to give you

850
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,000
the most pleasure at that time.

851
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,960
That's a judgment call.

852
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,040
It's the same thing I told this

853
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,680
Love and Life person. When you go to order food at a

854
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,820
restaurant, do you

855
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,480
make choices?

856
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,740
Do you make those choices using judgment?

857
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:57,600
Right?

858
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,980
I had him say,

859
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,380
this guy's the most judgmental.

860
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,100
He's telling me that I'm too judgmental.

861
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,040
I just showed everyone on the call, this guy's the most judgmental

862
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,020
guy who's making judgment calls all the time.

863
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,300
I've only

864
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,840
ever known one guy that was weird

865
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,200
like that, who basically

866
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,780
would pick exactly, no matter what restaurant

867
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,900
you took him to, the very first meal

868
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,740
on the menu was what he would buy.

869
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,240
That was it.

870
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,680
Sometimes it depends on the house

871
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,900
special. The house special

872
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,200
is usually

873
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:28,920
whatever.

874
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,780
Whether you took him to a diner or a burger joint

875
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,780
or whatever, what he would say is the first complete

876
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,080
meal on the menu, that was it.

877
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,160
Whatever that is.

878
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,580
Maybe he just had two brain cells

879
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,340
to rub together.

880
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,120
I don't want to know.

881
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,620
I'm saying this

882
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,740
was a guy who was a very good specialist in one

883
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,760
particular area. He knew exactly what he was

884
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,840
doing with one particular thing. When it came

885
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,600
to food, though, very arbitrary.

886
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,600
The first full meal on the menu, that's it.

887
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,760
That got to be

888
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,160
strange at diners or whatever.

889
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,720
We don't have those

890
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,160
here in the Southwest.

891
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,280
I missed that, by the way.

892
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,540
You're ready for this. There were Greek

893
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:08,960
diners.

894
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,800
The Greek

895
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,659
diners were the best in New York.

896
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,719
Cheeseburger Deluxe was the way

897
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,400
to go. It was just five bucks

898
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,440
and you got a fairly decent meal.

899
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,400
That's when I ate meat.

900
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,800
I went several years,

901
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,280
from 1988 to 1993,

902
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:26,840
being

903
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,659
what they call macrobiotic

904
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:32,639
or whole food

905
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,239
and mostly veggie, some fish.

906
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,600
No dairy, no eggs.

907
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,400
Which is good because

908
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,400
I adjusted

909
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,620
very well to it.

910
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,580
I learned how to cook it properly. That's the whole thing.

911
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,540
Again, with heuristics,

912
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:48,659
if you discover something

913
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:50,780
you want to cook at home to make

914
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,440
for yourself, don't just

915
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,520
try to make it. Try to figure out what is the

916
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,560
best way to prepare it because you can have

917
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,680
a really good ingredient and make a really crappy

918
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,060
meal.

919
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,380
It doesn't work the other way around.

920
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,480
If you got crappy ingredients, it's hard to

921
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,400
make a good meal.

922
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,200
That's what ketchup is for.

923
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,540
Or hot sauce.

924
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,580
Hot sauce. A lot of people

925
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,840
just drown things in hot sauce.

926
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,900
In the military, army, infantry,

927
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,480
the hot sauce is used as money because of the

928
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,640
MREs. Everything starts

929
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,520
to taste the same. Chicken a la king

930
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,440
and burritos and all this. They give you

931
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,120
these little bottles of hot sauce.

932
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,500
If you don't have that or the more you

933
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,400
put, the better it tastes, they trade

934
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,300
that as money. I got three bottles of hot sauce

935
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,340
for a cigarette or something or a couple

936
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,760
of cigarettes. Yeah, I'll take that.

937
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,840
Have you ever actually eaten MREs yourself?

938
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,060
Yeah, I've had a few.

939
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,060
Yeah, I mean,

940
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,920
I even got a hold of some of the older ones

941
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,920
that literally still had the cigarette in them.

942
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,660
At one point.

943
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:48,940
Very interesting.

944
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,740
Steve1989, I used to

945
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:54,060
like watching stuff. He would

946
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,040
pull out 70-year-old

947
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,020
MREs and taste them. I think he ended up

948
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,000
in the hospital several times with food poisoning.

949
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,000
I did that a few times

950
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,320
in the 90s just to see what it was like.

951
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,060
It didn't send

952
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:06,640
me to the hospital.

953
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,520
You have to use

954
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,340
the sniffer test, by the way. If it smells,

955
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,080
there's a reason why things smell foul.

956
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,400
There's a reason why.

957
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,520
Well, there's certain types of

958
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,460
fruits and foods.

959
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,480
I like

960
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,300
natto, which is fermented soybeans.

961
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,540
When I go to

962
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,520
a hardcore Japanese restaurant, not here,

963
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,360
but there aren't any, but sometimes

964
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,480
I'll order natto and they're like, oh, not for white

965
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,340
people, not for white people. I'm like, no,

966
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,460
I want natto. Give it to me with some green onion

967
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,600
and mustard. Oh, really? You like it?

968
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,380
I say, wow, that's great. It's fermented

969
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,280
soybeans and it smells like old, dirty

970
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,440
gym socks. It's

971
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,380
really sticky and kind of

972
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,120
gross-looking, but it's full of

973
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,280
positive intestinal flora and fauna.

974
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,540
People that have problems with digestion,

975
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,100
if you eat some natto,

976
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,120
it will reset

977
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,340
your entire digestion. In other words,

978
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,100
number two

979
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,400
will reset for

980
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,260
what it should be for you. It's got

981
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,480
this interesting

982
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,520
quality where

983
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,280
it's loaded with intestinal flora and

984
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,440
fauna, the microbes,

985
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,300
but it

986
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,220
adjusts itself to the individual. So if you

987
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,220
need more or less of another

988
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,180
thing or more of another thing, it will do that

989
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,300
naturally. It's amazing.

990
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,980
Better than yogurt. You know how the people

991
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:24,100
who are antibiotics, they have some yogurt

992
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,240
or something to get the

993
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,240
acidophilus. That's

994
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,200
nothing compared to certain fermented

995
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,840
foods like natto. Another

996
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,900
really funky, bad-smelling

997
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,660
food is fermented

998
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,840
tofu. That's really stinky.

999
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,320
I can't handle that. But anyway,

1000
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,000
there are certain things that

1001
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,940
smell foul if you understand

1002
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:46,080
that they shouldn't be and you shouldn't eat them.

1003
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,140
But if you think you have

1004
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,200
food poisoning, by the way, it's the same thing

1005
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,140
that was used

1006
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,260
during the Spanish

1007
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,780
flu, the American army flu

1008
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:58,040
in 1918, that people

1009
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,940
that knew was coming around because it wasn't

1010
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,480
like anything experienced.

1011
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:03,820
You could

1012
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,840
get up in the morning and be dead

1013
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,200
by the next morning.

1014
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,800
It was hemorrhagic fever.

1015
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,840
In other words, you basically got

1016
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,020
a really bad fever and pieces of your lungs

1017
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,920
broke off and you coughed up your lungs.

1018
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,820
But the people that didn't get sick

1019
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,860
is where the mom

1020
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,020
would give everyone

1021
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,060
in the morning a glass of water and soda

1022
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,380
and soda is baking soda.

1023
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,100
She would put a teaspoon

1024
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,040
of baking soda in a pitcher of water,

1025
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,820
stir it up, and then

1026
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:36,000
maybe dilute it again and give it to

1027
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,060
whoever was in the family. Whoever took that

1028
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,100
didn't get the

1029
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:40,900
hemorrhagic fever.

1030
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,160
Which is what they're trying to do

1031
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,040
again, by the way, but the people that are

1032
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,980
in the, I think I've said this before,

1033
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:48,640
they're morons.

1034
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,920
They killed off all the really

1035
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,780
good ones, by the way. I don't know if you remember

1036
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,700
during the Obama years, like every

1037
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,740
week there was a microbiologist that was found

1038
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,660
dead, right?

1039
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:02,020
Every week, crazy stuff

1040
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,900
like he tied a noose

1041
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,760
around his neck, around a tree

1042
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,720
and then drove the car to break his neck

1043
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,600
but he also had a bullet wound in the head.

1044
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,380
Anyway, crazy stuff.

1045
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:13,720
So they got rid of all the

1046
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,480
ones that are left are idiots.

1047
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,520
So when you hear about someone that does

1048
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,140
microbiology

1049
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,640
research or whatever, they're morons.

1050
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,460
All they do is they play video games,

1051
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,840
watch porn or

1052
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,560
tell them to go over experiments. There's nobody

1053
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,480
left, really. They don't know how to do it.

1054
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,780
They really don't know how to create

1055
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:32,660
plagues anymore.

1056
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,440
I'm sure someone will pop up.

1057
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,640
I don't think it'll be in the

1058
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,740
recruitment center of any government

1059
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,500
office, but someone will pop up

1060
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,520
because they're trying to work on hemorrhagic fevers

1061
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,780
again, by the way.

1062
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,400
Hemorrhagic fever also is relatable to the

1063
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,600
Ebola's and the Hantavirus and that kind

1064
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,360
of stuff anyway. I mean, that's what I thought of immediately.

1065
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,560
That's what they're calling it, yeah. They've experimented

1066
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,200
with how to put it, but they don't know how to do it.

1067
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,520
It's a combination, and what you were talking about there is like

1068
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,580
a combination of tuberculosis and

1069
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,780
Ebola together.

1070
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,340
It's that sudden hemorrhagic thing

1071
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,760
that you're talking about.

1072
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,040
Most of them don't understand.

1073
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:09,620
The thing is, once you understand

1074
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,340
how the body works and how these diseases

1075
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,500
really work, you won't

1076
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,640
see anything that they're telling you or teaching you

1077
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,560
in school or even

1078
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,500
in industry as being relevant. It's not,

1079
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,620
right, at all.

1080
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,420
But anyway,

1081
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,580
the soda water is the simplest

1082
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,680
way for food poisoning also, if you

1083
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,380
have an inkling. By the way,

1084
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,680
I think I might have had it once, maybe

1085
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,580
40 years ago from eating

1086
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,480
something, and you feel this

1087
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,700
thing like you just ate something

1088
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,540
and it's not really, it went down into

1089
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,380
your stomach, but it doesn't want to stay down,

1090
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,640
and you're not sure if you want to throw up

1091
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,260
and you're kind of gurgly or whatever,

1092
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,280
and you kind of get this

1093
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,100
wet feeling inside

1094
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,220
and you just don't feel it. It zaps

1095
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,300
your energy immediately.

1096
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,200
And throwing up doesn't always

1097
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,200
prevent it. If you have

1098
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,160
that situation, a little bit of baking

1099
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,060
soda and water should knock it out

1100
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:03,400
and prevent it, because once it sits in the body,

1101
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,160
you know, your body

1102
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,220
will reproduce it in the bloodstream,

1103
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,300
right? And then

1104
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,120
it could kill you. It could be from

1105
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,260
several days' illness to several

1106
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,220
weeks' illness, and even when you

1107
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,320
recover, you're not right for another few weeks, right?

1108
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,260
You've got to get your digestion back up, or it could

1109
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,620
kill you. So,

1110
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,060
baking soda and water, go figure, right?

1111
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,280
Yeah, well, that's been offered

1112
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,420
up as a solution to a bunch of things, actually.

1113
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,400
People have talked about fighting cancer

1114
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,060
with it, too.

1115
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,220
Well, look, the cancer thing I've brought

1116
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,380
up, when I hear someone's got cancer

1117
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:37,140
the first thing, I'm like, okay, your body's

1118
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,240
working well. It's working right.

1119
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,160
Right? What I mean by

1120
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,300
that is like, you know, when there's an accident

1121
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,160
on the road, and within five minutes

1122
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,200
the police are there, and they start directing

1123
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,220
traffic, and they block the road with the

1124
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:51,160
cones and the flares, but

1125
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,040
you know, nothing's, the streets, hardly

1126
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,260
anything's moving anymore. You can't get through.

1127
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,640
Right? That's what cancer is.

1128
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,540
Right. You get it?

1129
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,280
Mm-hmm. Instead of the

1130
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,120
wreck being there, and everybody driving around

1131
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,220
it and making more of a wreck, or a

1132
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,040
mess, right? So, cancer is

1133
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,120
actually a block.

1134
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,200
You know,

1135
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,080
the body regulating and saying, hey,

1136
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,280
this is getting so bad that if we don't make a block

1137
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,800
here, you're going to die. So, you know what?

1138
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,380
We're going to make a blockage here.

1139
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,580
Right? Okay.

1140
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,660
That's why, years ago, when I was

1141
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,920
speaking with people, I've said this before, as you got cancer,

1142
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,760
I was like, oh, good. And they're like, what? What do you mean, good?

1143
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,300
You're wishing negative? No, no, it's the connotations

1144
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,000
that you have. That's why there's never going to be a

1145
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,780
cure for it.

1146
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,040
Oh, if you want to know who you're

1147
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,880
going to communicate with, by the way, they have

1148
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,360
this thing like breast cancer,

1149
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,000
fight for the cure, or run for the cure,

1150
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,620
or walk for the cure. Yeah, of course.

1151
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,060
Millions of people show up, or thousands

1152
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,080
of people. Each one of them is an idiot.

1153
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:47,840
All of them, with no exception.

1154
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,960
Oh, there might be someone there

1155
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:51,440
collecting,

1156
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,040
counting the cash, obviously,

1157
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,880
right? And might

1158
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,860
know what's going on. But, yeah, if you

1159
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:59,100
want to know who a moron is,

1160
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:01,700
yeah, the fight for whatever,

1161
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,720
the cure, you know, look for the cure. There's no

1162
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,360
cure for that.

1163
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,840
There's never going to be a cure for it

1164
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,720
because it's

1165
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,660
like curing

1166
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,700
accident recovery. It's not

1167
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,640
ever going to happen. So people that

1168
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,380
think about it that way,

1169
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,660
you know

1170
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,680
how to think about them now, very, very

1171
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,500
easily, right?

1172
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,560
See, we're actually

1173
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,300
talking about heuristics without even

1174
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,860
talking about heuristics, generally.

1175
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:31,660
But the baking

1176
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:32,380
soda and water

1177
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,580
is the easiest

1178
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,520
to acquire if you can. Now, I'm

1179
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,460
not so familiar with other

1180
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:41,280
alternatives if you can't get baking soda,

1181
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:43,620
but certain

1182
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:45,880
things

1183
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,500
might be similar. That

1184
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,520
would be independent research. I have not gone down

1185
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,380
that road because I'm kind of spoiled.

1186
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,460
You know, I'm not living out

1187
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,520
in the jungle, right? I know I can get

1188
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,840
baking soda pretty much anywhere.

1189
00:43:59,000 --> 00:43:59,440
Okay,

1190
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,300
so what do you think?

1191
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:02,840
Where should we go?

1192
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,320
Well, you know, I'm thinking that

1193
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,480
we're still striking on

1194
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,860
this whole thing about communication.

1195
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:10,640
You brought up NPCs.

1196
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:13,120
I think it's interesting

1197
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,260
the idea that, you know, look,

1198
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,140
just because it stinks doesn't necessarily

1199
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:19,380
mean it's not a good thing.

1200
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:21,040
It could be a good thing that has a powerful

1201
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,060
smell, but there are certain

1202
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,000
types of powerful bad smells that

1203
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,060
are directly indicative, and that's

1204
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,420
one of those things that's built in,

1205
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,300
just like

1206
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:32,960
the emo stuff is built into everything,

1207
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:35,060
right? Well, yeah.

1208
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,140
Like I said, there are certain foods

1209
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:39,000
that should smell bad, and that's

1210
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,020
what they're made for, but if you know that it

1211
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,980
shouldn't smell bad, then, you know, it

1212
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,200
shouldn't be taken.

1213
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,180
Yeah, but okay.

1214
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,900
Communication. Very simple.

1215
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,040
You're going to be wasting...

1216
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,080
If the person doesn't get it within the first

1217
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,940
three or four minutes or show signs

1218
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:56,820
of extreme enthusiasm

1219
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,740
or eagerness, you're wasting your time.

1220
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,340
You're wasting your time.

1221
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:02,660
Unless you want to practice.

1222
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,480
I've gone through many years

1223
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,520
of having conversations with people,

1224
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,500
Skype, fortunately, and I don't have to be

1225
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,960
face-to-face, but face-to-face,

1226
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,880
pressing on certain matters

1227
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:14,540
that they may or may not have been

1228
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:16,720
interested in, and I kind of

1229
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:17,980
read that, and I was like, you know what?

1230
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,160
Just keep talking, because you could practice.

1231
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:22,240
Practice your oration skills.

1232
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,960
You know, how are you going to speak?

1233
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:26,000
Right? You've got an audience, because you could

1234
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,640
practice being an orator

1235
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,180
on your own, but it's always easier

1236
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:31,500
when you have someone else there, right?

1237
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:33,640
And once you notice that they're

1238
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,140
not paying attention or they're

1239
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:37,780
just yessing you to death, because some people

1240
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:39,000
want to be polite, right?

1241
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:41,800
Or whatever,

1242
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:44,120
just keep speaking if you plan

1243
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:46,280
on speaking more and more and more on things,

1244
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:48,120
right? If you want to be a communicator,

1245
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,940
you must speak, and it's easier to

1246
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,860
speak when someone's there or

1247
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:53,920
other people are there. Well, I've always thought of it this

1248
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,940
way, too, is that if you can't elicit the

1249
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:58,000
enthusiasm from the

1250
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,960
person that you're presenting to,

1251
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:01,760
sometimes, you know,

1252
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:03,960
you go through a few different things, and you'll find that

1253
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,140
they pick up on one out of ten things that you

1254
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:07,780
were speaking about, right?

1255
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:09,920
And you

1256
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,700
start to learn, oh, well, if

1257
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:13,640
this person can pick up on that

1258
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,960
and actually understand it, even though they're

1259
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,020
not enthusiastically seeking the knowledge,

1260
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:20,000
you're not getting through because they're

1261
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,320
not really open to communication, they're not

1262
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,180
able to understand

1263
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:25,740
what you're saying, for the most part.

1264
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:27,980
You come across a couple things, and you're like, but they

1265
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:29,840
got that. Hmm. Well, they

1266
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,960
all have, okay, most of, okay,

1267
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:34,080
let's say it's the MPCs, like the lower tier,

1268
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:35,980
which is 90% of the population,

1269
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,100
the base,

1270
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:38,660
let's say.

1271
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,980
They already have been shown

1272
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:43,900
all of the choices of the things they can do,

1273
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:44,820
and they have decided

1274
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:46,780
on being

1275
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:48,880
a certain way. And what

1276
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,880
happens then is it becomes habitual,

1277
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:52,780
right? And

1278
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:53,720
that's why you lead,

1279
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,800
well, you lead to the conclusion

1280
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,920
that humans are futile creatures, right?

1281
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:00,780
You, proof

1282
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:03,000
of, when you think of your average

1283
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,960
Joe idea,

1284
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:06,720
blue collar

1285
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,920
or whatever, I don't think the reason is blue collar

1286
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,280
anymore in the U.S.

1287
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,880
It still exists, it's just not

1288
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,540
as popular as it once was. Yeah,

1289
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,940
they told everyone in the 60s and 70s

1290
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:18,820
they were going to shut down all the factories, but no

1291
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:19,540
one listened, right?

1292
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:22,800
Yeah, it was actually, there's plenty

1293
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,060
of articles and people speaking about it,

1294
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:27,140
pre

1295
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:28,600
what is it, programming or

1296
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,220
predictive programming or whatever.

1297
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:32,960
It's not even predictive programming, it's just flat out tell you, right?

1298
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:34,920
When

1299
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,920
you look at the actual life

1300
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,460
of how it's portrayed,

1301
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,740
almost like a Homer Simpson type thing, so

1302
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:42,580
you work at a job that you hate,

1303
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:44,640
you do the absolute minimum,

1304
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,900
you try to do whatever you can get away

1305
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:47,620
with, right?

1306
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,020
There's no consciousness there.

1307
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,900
And when you're not at work, you're either

1308
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:54,920
watching sports, drinking beer

1309
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,120
or thinking about sex.

1310
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,720
We just narrowed it down

1311
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,860
to about 90% of the population.

1312
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:02,980
I had

1313
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,100
once met a woman

1314
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:06,180
a while back and she

1315
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,520
said she was psychic, right?

1316
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:09,760
And she actually was pretty good.

1317
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,380
She said she doesn't like it

1318
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:14,520
because most people's thoughts are pretty

1319
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,680
bad thoughts, you know?

1320
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:18,320
And

1321
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,460
it's pretty interesting and I kind of stuck

1322
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:22,440
with this back almost 35 years ago

1323
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,300
and it kind of stuck with me and

1324
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:25,340
when you start

1325
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,160
learning how people think in private

1326
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,460
or when you get to know someone, let's say like a roommate

1327
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:31,340
or a co-worker,

1328
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:34,620
let's say a co-worker situation, they put on a certain

1329
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,040
facade because they're at work, right?

1330
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,120
But then you get to know them,

1331
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,880
you go to the bar, you have a few drinks

1332
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,480
after a few weeks or months, they start

1333
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:43,900
telling you things of what they think about you.

1334
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:45,680
You're like, wait a second, I would have never...

1335
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:46,640
Wow, you know?

1336
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:48,940
Things that are just

1337
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,100
very unusual or immoral

1338
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:53,260
or unethical or

1339
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:56,000
not fitting that type of person, right?

1340
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:57,840
So whenever

1341
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,280
I would hear that from people,

1342
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:01,940
yeah, I used to...

1343
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:04,000
I hung out with a co-worker a few months, the guy's a real

1344
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,080
sicko, but he seems... everybody loves him at work

1345
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,020
but in real life, his personal life,

1346
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:10,140
he's a sicko. I'm like, yeah, that sounds about right

1347
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:10,920
for most people.

1348
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:14,020
And they were like, what do you mean Greek sounds about right for most people?

1349
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:15,860
Yeah, yeah, don't be naive.

1350
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,960
I know, the private thoughts that most

1351
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,660
people keep to themselves are

1352
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,980
far from what it is that

1353
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:23,840
they present, you know?

1354
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:26,000
Exactly. Regardless of whether they're

1355
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,820
the Homer Simpson type and they seem pretty

1356
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:29,820
simple and you go, okay, I got this guy

1357
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:31,760
all the way around. The twisted

1358
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,720
and insane things that could be going on

1359
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:34,700
inside of that skull.

1360
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:37,600
And usually, for the majority,

1361
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,720
that's what's going on. But they have it under

1362
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,760
control, they call it repressed whatever

1363
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,740
to a certain point and they go

1364
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:45,600
to their grave with this duality,

1365
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:47,620
which we've talked about. They think, you know, they're being

1366
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:49,960
led that way. But here's

1367
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,540
the interesting part. The

1368
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,700
real interesting part is there's a

1369
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,240
filter that has to be employed

1370
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,780
both ways. In other

1371
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:59,660
words, with those really bizarre

1372
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:01,500
thoughts, whatever you want to call them,

1373
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:03,560
that people have, they have to filter that when they're

1374
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,360
at work and the facade they put on.

1375
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:07,420
Right? But also

1376
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:09,580
when they're not at work, they have

1377
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:11,580
to put a filter because they have to

1378
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:13,480
go back to work. They don't want to be seen

1379
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,420
somewhere by a co-worker out in public

1380
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:17,180
doing something again.

1381
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,480
So there's a two-way filter. So they're

1382
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,100
using so much energy

1383
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:23,720
just by filtering the different

1384
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:25,300
aspects of their

1385
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:27,620
thoughts. Well, it goes to different levels,

1386
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:29,600
right? They behave a certain way in front of, say,

1387
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:31,580
their wife, but when they're out with

1388
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:33,380
their buddies, that's a different person.

1389
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,660
Yeah. You have to filter it both

1390
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,560
ways. Because when

1391
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,600
they're out with their buddies, if they start acting like

1392
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,580
they do with their wife, oh, you're a real pussy, man.

1393
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,460
What's wrong with you? Right. But if he acts the

1394
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:45,440
other way, so it's like a

1395
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,640
two-way filter. So think about all the energy

1396
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,660
that people are wasting just by not, quote

1397
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:51,480
unquote, being honest with themselves, number

1398
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,520
one. Number two, not

1399
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,160
being honest with anyone else.

1400
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,060
Right? And

1401
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:58,220
number three,

1402
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,240
what do you think they

1403
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:03,120
would do if they were actually found out that

1404
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,100
that voice in their head is not really them, and it's

1405
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:06,900
an external influence? Well,

1406
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:09,080
I've tried to explain this to people, and they

1407
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,140
don't like it at all. Where I say,

1408
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,140
somebody will tell me, well, this person's very

1409
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:15,000
honest with me all the time. And I go, no, they're not.

1410
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:16,520
They're not.

1411
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,160
I guarantee you they're not. What do you mean

1412
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,080
you guarantee they're not? Think about this from

1413
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,100
your side of it. All the things that

1414
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,060
go on in your head. Do you speak every

1415
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:27,140
single thing that goes on in your head? Do

1416
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:28,580
you communicate that at all?

1417
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,960
Well, yes, I do. Well,

1418
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:32,880
okay, good. Yeah. To communicate

1419
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,300
it, like you said, to communicate

1420
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,040
it is people say, what do you mean?

1421
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:39,080
That's not my thought. I think about these crazy things

1422
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,020
or whatever I say, but check it out. I'll show you

1423
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:42,600
how it's not your own head.

1424
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,980
We said this before is all you do

1425
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:47,120
is when you have that crazy thought, whatever it is

1426
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,040
as the thought

1427
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,660
is in the head,

1428
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,520
tell yourself,

1429
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:54,560
okay, this is this crazy thought

1430
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,380
coming. Tell me more like anticipated

1431
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:57,780
and it'll stop.

1432
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,320
It'll stop.

1433
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:01,860
Because it's busted, right?

1434
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,980
You see what I mean? So

1435
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:06,360
if you have a, let's say you,

1436
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,420
anyone, these thoughts that

1437
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:10,220
are unusual, you shouldn't

1438
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:12,380
you morally or ethically, civilly

1439
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:14,420
or whatever, shouldn't be thinking about this about another

1440
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:16,700
person or situation or whatever. Anticipate

1441
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,400
the thought. Ask yourself

1442
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,980
to, okay, I see the thought.

1443
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,960
It's not very good. Tell me more.

1444
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,420
Ask the thought to continue.

1445
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:26,580
And if it stops

1446
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:27,380
and pauses,

1447
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:29,380
you just busted

1448
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,380
the outer voice

1449
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:34,340
on outer voice. Yeah, because there's

1450
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:35,840
there, they don't want it. They

1451
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:38,260
want to have you convinced that it's your thought.

1452
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,340
You see, it's kind of like

1453
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:42,020
the clock in a retail

1454
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:43,880
store, right?

1455
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,420
It's a, it's very

1456
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:48,440
subtle. It's actually, it's not very subtle to tell

1457
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:49,500
yourself continue

1458
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,500
internally with a thought. It's not very, it's not subtle.

1459
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:54,000
It takes quite a

1460
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,340
quite, it's

1461
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,620
pretty overt internally.

1462
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:00,360
But the clock, by the way, on a retail

1463
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,400
store is, these, a lot

1464
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,260
of small, I've mentioned this many times, I think

1465
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,360
it's pertinent. Yes, Ivan, I'll let you

1466
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:06,520
out.

1467
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,240
It's very pertinent because let's say

1468
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,960
in, you'll see the analogy.

1469
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:14,360
Small retail shops, they

1470
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,420
have a problem with point of sale items being lifted,

1471
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,440
right? Right. And they rely on those

1472
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,260
to whatever, because they're usually high

1473
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:22,340
markup, whatever, you know, you don't want anything lifted

1474
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:23,960
in a store. And I remember

1475
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,380
having a meeting with all the shop owners, let's say

1476
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:28,140
on a block or two. And

1477
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:30,540
the thing that came up is how do we stop this

1478
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:32,040
whatever

1479
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,460
shoplifting is, oh, I put them behind a glass case,

1480
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,240
but I don't sell as many when they're like that, right?

1481
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:38,320
Right. Well, but none of

1482
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,220
it gets stolen. So I'm like, yeah, okay. So it's

1483
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:42,360
what you do. When someone, most people

1484
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:44,740
I'll give you a good

1485
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:46,800
for instance, convenience stores

1486
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,720
used to put lighters right on the

1487
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,800
counter. And in a lot of places

1488
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,000
they would just be there and people would just grab

1489
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,060
them as they were going because they were there to buy cigarettes

1490
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:56,980
and they would sell a lot of them because it was

1491
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:58,920
right there. It was a good

1492
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,260
point of sale. So

1493
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:02,900
percent got lifted. Seventy percent were

1494
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,800
sold. Yeah, something like that would start

1495
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,720
to happen. One out of three were lifted.

1496
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:08,980
Okay. So I said, well, instead of you have

1497
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:10,900
to do it psychologically. And what that is

1498
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,000
is that when someone's going to

1499
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:14,180
lift something, steal something

1500
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:16,760
they're conscious of time. In other words, they

1501
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,780
want to do it as fast as possible and not be

1502
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:20,740
seen, right? You

1503
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:22,860
cannot really do

1504
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:24,440
much about the not be seen

1505
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,700
part, right? Because I've seen some shops

1506
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,840
where I drive by or walk

1507
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,740
by and there was no one in the

1508
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:32,660
shop. I mean, there was no customers and no one

1509
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:34,820
minding the store. It's like I could walk in. Still

1510
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:36,760
no one came out. I could have picked up the

1511
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,280
cash register and walked out, right?

1512
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,000
Because the person was

1513
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,340
on a break in the back on the phone in the

1514
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:44,420
back in the bathroom and they didn't lock the door, right?

1515
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:46,400
That's the physical aspect.

1516
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:47,820
You can't do anything about that.

1517
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:50,420
But the time aspect, what you do is

1518
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,400
right opposite the entrance door

1519
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,380
when the first thing you see when you walk

1520
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:56,440
in the shop, put a big ass clock, the

1521
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,240
biggest clock you could fit in the wall

1522
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,140
space or whatever. And

1523
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:01,700
at the time there was like a

1524
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:04,100
deco movement where these fancy old

1525
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,900
antique clocks were being sold real cheap.

1526
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,820
You know, like a foot, two foot diameter

1527
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:09,740
clock, doesn't matter, a functional

1528
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:11,940
clock. Put it right opposite the door

1529
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:13,800
and what that does subconsciously,

1530
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,920
I don't even like the word subconscious, Freudian

1531
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,780
stuff, but what it does is

1532
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:19,780
it gives everyone

1533
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:21,920
who comes into the shop the impression

1534
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,160
of time

1535
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:26,060
signaling. And it messes

1536
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:27,900
up the one who's coming

1537
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:29,660
in thinking that they're going to lift something.

1538
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,780
It really messes them up and they don't

1539
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:33,940
know why. This is actually

1540
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:36,020
why you'll see in a lot of stores, they place

1541
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:38,040
a screen so you can

1542
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:40,060
see yourself on camera.

1543
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,080
So that you're aware that you're

1544
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:42,780
being seen.

1545
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:45,920
But that's the other aspect of it. You said

1546
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,080
time and being seen, these are the two aspects.

1547
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,900
This was before, because back in those

1548
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:51,920
days, if you wanted to do a security system like

1549
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,000
that with the CRT TVs and all

1550
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
that, it was real expensive. Yeah, it was a pain

1551
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,180
in the neck, but they did it in some places

1552
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:00,020
because it was worth it. And if you

1553
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:01,900
put up that screen, it would automatically

1554
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,680
reduce the shoplifting because people

1555
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,860
were now being shown that

1556
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:07,940
someone is watching. Yeah, but the

1557
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:09,780
thing is, some people don't give a

1558
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:11,540
you-know-what and they'll do it anyway.

1559
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,540
That's another thing. Yeah, it's the

1560
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:15,920
subtle psychological part. So anticipating

1561
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,880
the aspect of time. So there's

1562
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,800
something about filtering out

1563
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:21,880
a lot of the external

1564
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,780
influences if you anticipate them.

1565
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,020
If you know what I mean.

1566
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:29,660
With the internal thought.

1567
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:31,660
In other words, if you want to judge

1568
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:33,200
the thoughts that you're entertaining,

1569
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,500
when the thought comes up,

1570
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:37,320
assess it out. Is it

1571
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,720
something that came into the mind?

1572
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,700
Is it really running a thought pattern

1573
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,740
right now? And then ask it to continue.

1574
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:44,560
Simple.

1575
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:47,240
And then you'll see

1576
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,780
what's really going on in the head.

1577
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:53,700
not much about heuristics on the

1578
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:55,880
material end, but I guess we talked about

1579
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:57,560
enough about heuristics on various

1580
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:58,240
other things.

1581
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,460
And we'll continue that.

1582
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:03,060
Fair enough.
