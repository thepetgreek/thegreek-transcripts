1
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:14,760
Sonic Event 36, Ocelli in the Greek rated Y, and why oh why does your computer work the

2
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,420
way it does?

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,600
Maybe we'll get into that.

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,300
Maybe we'll talk about the intrusive nature of the intrusive things that are, can I say

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:21,920
intrusive again?

6
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,640
No, I'm not going to keep repeating myself because I'm not going to talk that much.

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,560
I'm going to talk with the Greek and that's what you're here for, the conversation that

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,080
ensues.

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,140
How are you doing tonight?

10
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,520
I'm doing, doing as I always do.

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,020
We spoke earlier.

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,200
Maybe we'll talk about the news.

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,760
I'm like, oh, I can't do that.

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,140
Anything.

15
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:40,900
Oh my gosh.

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,840
You said it's comedy.

17
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:49,640
Yeah, it's comedy, but it's just there's an underlying something there that I don't know.

18
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,180
You know, I did an interview recently with the guys at Forbidden Knowledge News.

19
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,220
This is really a mellow cat.

20
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,680
Chris I think is his name.

21
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,800
And it's interesting that, you know, it's a totally new group, new person, let's say.

22
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:09,680
And I come out now, let's say speaking someone for the first time, new group, new audience.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,060
It's very different than it was 10 years ago, bringing up, just showing people a lot of

24
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,660
stuff that they've been missing because that lot of stuff is a list of 5,000 things, right?

25
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:26,080
They've missed out on that's in front that they should know or be aware of or have passed

26
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,140
through the gray matter.

27
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,120
And I didn't quite do that.

28
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:35,380
I just sat back and try to address his questions in a Greek speak kind of way, in a way that,

29
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,380
you know, no one would, you know, no one else does.

30
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:42,160
So so yeah, being it's not not for the sake of being different.

31
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,820
You know, some people want to be different, right?

32
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:48,040
For the sake of being different, you know, you know, this is different considering your

33
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,860
normal patterns.

34
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:53,200
I mean, lately, a theme between you and I privately, especially is breaking the patterns.

35
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:53,520
Right.

36
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,920
Which is a good thing to do in general.

37
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,060
And you've been doing that personally, it seems like.

38
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,780
So, you know, the fact that you conducted yourself differently in that interview, I did one on

39
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:07,400
the infinite fringe recently, which was a repeat because apparently he had problems with

40
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,639
his recording device the last time that we sat down.

41
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:15,880
And and I noted how different things were, you know, as far as information gathering and

42
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,120
stuff.

43
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,880
There's a theme lately, though.

44
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,140
And this this was the thing that we actually discussed real quick before we started recording

45
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,620
here is, look, cocaine is a theme.

46
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:26,420
OK.

47
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,940
And I'm finding it funny.

48
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,220
You know, we've had Cocaine Bear is a movie.

49
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,760
I don't know if you took note of that because you're not Mr. Movie Guy.

50
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:37,240
But no, apparently was a popular movie for a minute.

51
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,760
And it was about cocaine getting dropped in the woods and then a bear getting a hold of

52
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:40,900
it.

53
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:45,180
And of course, it is based partially on a true story at the height of the Iran-Contra thing.

54
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,880
There was a bear that ate a bunch of cocaine and went crazy in the woods.

55
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:50,180
Right.

56
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,500
Well, too much of anything, too much of anything will make you crazy.

57
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:53,800
Right.

58
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,700
Well, of course.

59
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,140
But I mean, you know, bears are really not designed to be taking cocaine.

60
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,360
As far as I understand them, I mean, we are humans.

61
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,120
I guess I use it loosely.

62
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,000
I don't know.

63
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,620
I don't know.

64
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,800
But I am saying that I'm sure the drug.

65
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:12,560
I'm sure that bears are not designed to take cocaine for anyone that hasn't done it.

66
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:17,980
If the first time you've ever done it, it's what it feels like is like you ever get some

67
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,000
really good news.

68
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,920
Anybody tell you like really good news.

69
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,540
Oh, that's what it feels like.

70
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:22,820
Right.

71
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:23,640
Oh, yeah.

72
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:28,440
Not the kind of news that lifts weight off of you, but like a surprise good thing that

73
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,500
just kind of sort of shows up and you're like, yeah, you didn't expect it.

74
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:31,780
Yeah.

75
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,120
Yeah.

76
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,280
In a very good way.

77
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:39,000
And I can see how people always want to continue doing it to reminisce that that initial feeling.

78
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,300
Most drugs are like that.

79
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,440
And that's what they always said.

80
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,920
Most relationships are like that.

81
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,280
Oh, yeah.

82
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,600
And that's what they always said was most dangerous about crack.

83
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,680
And it's funny you say relationships, because that's what I thought is that's like, you

84
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,660
know, when you first start up with a girl or a woman and you're really, really super

85
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:57,140
excited to see them and they're just everything about them is absolutely captivating.

86
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:02,280
And, you know, that high you're sort of on, it reminds me of that place to be because

87
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,180
it's going to go down.

88
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,020
There's no way you can maintain that.

89
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,300
Yeah.

90
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,460
It's why you want to start low and build up and learn to love the person or whatever.

91
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,800
You know, even when you end up in a situation where you're like, I would never be with this

92
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,060
person.

93
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,780
What am I doing?

94
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:20,800
You still you still have to make it work because of the world that you live in is that you're

95
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:20,980
right.

96
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,000
You know, lately I've been working with industry and various design things and on my own getting

97
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,760
my my, you know, act together and, you know, for being firm and what's known about these

98
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,240
particular subjects, let's say.

99
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:42,660
And it's kind of like everything seems they always all all scientific data that when you're

100
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,740
designing things in any industry always says it's compromises.

101
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,880
If you want to do this with the thing, this is the compromise, right?

102
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,940
If you want to go this way with the same thing, you're going to compromise that.

103
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:53,420
Right.

104
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,480
So everything is full of compromises.

105
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,220
And that's just how this reality is.

106
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:03,180
Well, like, for instance, if you want to make something mobile as opposed to it being, you

107
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,900
know, a place where it's just built in and set in one location, well, then you've got

108
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,660
to give up this or that part of it.

109
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,360
That's for sure.

110
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,400
Like an audio.

111
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,280
It's called Hoffman's Iron Law.

112
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,020
There are three things and you can only have two out of the three things.

113
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,240
Right.

114
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,180
You can't do them all.

115
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:18,580
Interesting.

116
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:18,960
Right.

117
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:19,460
So.

118
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,220
But yeah.

119
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:21,880
OK.

120
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,580
The cocaine is a no is a no.

121
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,440
No issue.

122
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,000
I mean, the distractions they put out.

123
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,760
I mean, the white powder thing is a meme, by the way.

124
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,540
It's not that it's cocaine.

125
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,220
The white powder.

126
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:37,280
I remember the this white powder a few weeks ago, again, being sent to what is it, GOP

127
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:37,740
people.

128
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,900
And then there was the white powder in nine around nine eleven.

129
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:45,160
Well, see, that's what was most interesting about this most recent news story.

130
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,900
And I brought up Cocaine Bear because, again, it was a comedy, but also based on some elements

131
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,780
of a real story.

132
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,140
What I found fascinating is, you know, people going, oh, it's a shocker.

133
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,700
There's cocaine in the White House.

134
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,180
And I'm like, it's a shocker if there isn't cocaine in the White House, first of all.

135
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,180
Secondly, the idea that I actually think, yeah, well, yeah, they know that the White

136
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,440
House is not part of this country.

137
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:05,820
Yeah.

138
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,280
Well, you know, look, do you really want to go there?

139
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,400
I mean, yeah, that's that's yeah, go there.

140
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,500
That's where it really is.

141
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,060
I got you.

142
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,560
But let's build off of this story for a second, because you brought up something interesting.

143
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,060
They found it in the White House.

144
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,380
Why is it that we're hearing about it was my question.

145
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,040
You know, couldn't this be just handled privately?

146
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,100
But apparently the Secret Service encountered it.

147
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,340
And I'm thinking to myself, well, the Secret Service had surveillance on this.

148
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,280
So they probably know exactly where it came from, when it happened.

149
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:35,860
I mean, 24 hour surveillance, you know, at a 7-11, you can figure out if somebody dropped

150
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,680
something on the floor.

151
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,540
It's the white powder.

152
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,200
See, I don't even it's the what is it?

153
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:40,900
It's white powder.

154
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,160
Right.

155
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,660
So they bring up the white powder.

156
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,700
Trying to get to that point.

157
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,820
The thing is that initially they had to call in, like the fire department and all this

158
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,380
other nonsense.

159
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,400
Why was that response there?

160
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:54,240
Because of the procedures put in place after what?

161
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,180
Remember the anthrax attacks that went after 9-11 and the fake anthrax stuff.

162
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:04,520
Now, I know that you were aware of the Northeast at that time, you know, around 2001.

163
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,080
I don't know if you were living there still, but no, I was not.

164
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,480
Well, in the Northeast, there were a bunch of events that, you know, have been sort of

165
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:11,860
scrubbed.

166
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,780
Nobody thinks about them.

167
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,460
I don't see references to them, but I do recall them happening where people were doing messed

168
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:17,920
up stuff.

169
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,360
I mean, I was at a retail location, which was part of my job.

170
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,320
Just one part of the many retail locations I was in charge of.

171
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:31,380
Across the street from me, some lunatic got pissed off at the, you know, the Wawa's.

172
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,280
You remember the Wawa convenience store?

173
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:34,420
Yeah.

174
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,420
I heard of it.

175
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,600
I've never seen one though.

176
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,060
Okay.

177
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,100
Well, it's, you know, it's a nice chain of convenience stores.

178
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,460
It's actually a fairly efficient model for convenience stores.

179
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,780
But anyways, they were across the street from me and somebody ran into that store, got pissed

180
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:51,140
off at the place apparently, and just dumped a bunch of white powder on the counter.

181
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:51,840
Right?

182
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:51,940
Right.

183
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,680
Because it was the thing.

184
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,460
It was the theme.

185
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:54,920
Right.

186
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,200
This was back in around 9-11.

187
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:56,520
Yeah.

188
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,740
This is, you know, early 2002.

189
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,540
So this is, you know, a few months after and people were still talking about the anthrax

190
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,700
attacks, which occurred immediately after.

191
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:10,520
By the way, if you do get a reliable report that it is weaponized anthrax, it's from the

192
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,120
military, what do you call it, where the cash, where they keep the weapons.

193
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:14,820
Oh, yeah.

194
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,100
Well, no.

195
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,160
It's always from-

196
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,660
You can't make that.

197
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,160
Yeah.

198
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,260
You can't make that at home.

199
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:18,960
No.

200
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,760
So, you know, not the good stuff.

201
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,940
And if it is a certain grade, if it's ground a certain way and it's very scientifically,

202
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,980
you know, consistent, then you're looking at Fort Detrick being a source.

203
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:27,540
Yeah.

204
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:27,800
Potent.

205
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,080
Yeah.

206
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:28,440
Exactly.

207
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,100
There's only a few places that could do that.

208
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:30,860
Right.

209
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,200
And it's the effort.

210
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:37,140
For what it does, it's not worth the effort, but they have it on hand, you know?

211
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:37,960
Well, yeah.

212
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,960
So, anyways, it's just interesting to me that because it was just commonplace, this freaked

213
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,540
everybody out.

214
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,600
Hazmat showed up.

215
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,060
You know, they cordoned off the area and all this other stuff.

216
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,420
I got caught up in it.

217
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,400
So, it was-

218
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:50,580
It's a show.

219
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,900
I mean, how much distraction is necessary is very little if the people were never aware

220
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,660
of what they should be distracted from.

221
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,520
So, when the distraction comes, it seems like it's the real thing, you see?

222
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:03,660
So, yeah.

223
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,340
That was kind of a confusing statement, but-

224
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:05,780
It's okay.

225
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:09,680
But this week, it just turns out that, you know, there was some powder discovered at

226
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,180
the White House.

227
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,400
So, they had this reaction to it, which did harken back to the whole, you know, anthrax

228
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:15,720
scare.

229
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,280
And I found it funny because people were like, why are they calling up other people?

230
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,380
They forgot that that was part of the justification.

231
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,200
It's a Freemasonic thing, by the way.

232
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,220
It's because in the Freemasons, you know, they go back to a lot of the ancient rites

233
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,580
and rituals from Egypt.

234
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:34,480
Whenever an ancient site was found, there was white, like they uncover what they call

235
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,800
a tomb or an underground place, there's white powder in vases and things like that.

236
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,460
And sometimes it's strewn about from earthquakes, you know, that'll shake, something will fall

237
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,300
over and break.

238
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:46,320
Right?

239
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:52,100
Are you familiar with, they call it monoatomic gold, and it's a very fine white powder.

240
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:52,700
It's a powder, yeah.

241
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:57,180
Whenever, you know, whenever tombs are opened and found in ancient Egypt and other places,

242
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,300
they find, if there's been an earthquake, it's on the ground.

243
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:05,840
If it's not on earth, if it's been intact, it's still in vases, you know, lots of vases

244
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,740
with it, you know.

245
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:12,960
So, it's the Freemasons, I think, make suggestions like that to signal, when I say Freemasons,

246
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,620
you know what I mean?

247
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,300
The secret societies.

248
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:15,800
Right.

249
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:21,680
The Freemasons are just a bunch of guys, drive around and whatever, and wear pressed slacks

250
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,440
and have a sticker on their car.

251
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:29,020
Not the guys that are trying to network and raise money for the local kids hospital.

252
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:29,560
No, no, no.

253
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,520
Not those guys that have the public barbecues.

254
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,080
Well, those guys, too, are pretty scumbaggy, by the way, believe it or not.

255
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,740
But they're not in control of anything too big.

256
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,480
No, no, no.

257
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:37,680
Yeah.

258
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,720
This is a secret society communication.

259
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:46,200
Just like everybody's looking at the 1333, they communicate with the 5-1 from Mayday.

260
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:54,380
So you'll see, like, this person, it's $51 million, or $15, or $1.5, or $5.1, however

261
00:10:54,380 --> 00:11:00,620
you see the 1-5 or the 5-1, is that they're a form of communication, you know, like with

262
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,360
the COVID thing.

263
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:07,920
Remember, it was like 33 million people, 13, or 51, or Area 51.

264
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:08,840
Right.

265
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:15,520
So they have their own little stuff, and it's really a shitshow in terms of, I don't know

266
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,140
how you feel about, you're around youngsters, but you know, when you deal with the culture

267
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:25,400
they put on, you know, like toys, and games, and stuff for quote-unquote kids, that's not

268
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,120
as bad as what they're putting out for adults, you know?

269
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,560
No.

270
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,520
Like the Fisher-Price stuff is not as bad as the, yeah.

271
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,160
No, it's got hints and suggestions of things with the toys, but the other stuff is a lot

272
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,760
more direct and just blunt, you know?

273
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:43,840
Yeah, it's, well, one thing I spoke about in the interview, Chuck, is that the universe

274
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,040
abhors imbalance.

275
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,500
It always tries to make balance.

276
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:52,240
So if, I said about 90% of the society is NPC, it depends on its relative, right?

277
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:00,580
How many people are not NPCs, 1 out of 10, and how many out of those are actually worth

278
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,600
talking to in any capacity, maybe 1 out of 1,000, or 1 out of 10,000?

279
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:11,100
Believe it or not, from a societal, moral, ethical perspective, lawful perspective, that

280
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,500
seems like society's out of whack.

281
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,860
It's totally imbalanced, and I'm telling you it's balanced.

282
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:20,420
It only takes one individual out of, what, maybe 10,000, or 100,000 to balance the rest.

283
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,560
You know, that knows, let's say, to a point is aware, let's say, and somewhat intelligent

284
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,160
and knowledgeable.

285
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,000
You see what I mean?

286
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,520
Yeah, well, based on the level of maturity, for lack of a better word, of the majority,

287
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,540
they do require a leader, right?

288
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:42,140
So I mean, a lot of them do, because they don't know how to operate without one, effectively,

289
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:42,460
right?

290
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:47,340
They always need, well, who do I turn to for leadership on this or that?

291
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,540
You know, like you talk about all the time.

292
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:55,340
Well, yeah, on the other end, yeah, the 0.1% or 0.001 don't require, that's, they're the

293
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:55,840
anarchists.

294
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,460
They don't need anyone on top.

295
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:57,740
Yeah.

296
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,020
Right, and by anarchists-

297
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,440
As long as you have food, clothing, and shelter, you're fine.

298
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:01,820
Right.

299
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,900
By anarchist, you do mean those that are, you know, are leaderless, and therefore, you

300
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,780
know, there's no-

301
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,800
Yeah, it's castle doctrine.

302
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,100
Right.

303
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:16,140
Yeah, it's what, it's what this country supposedly, see, the, you have a representative and then

304
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:16,980
direct government.

305
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:23,860
This was really set up initially to be direct through representation, not just completely

306
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,040
representative, right?

307
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,320
Right now, it's all representative.

308
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:33,360
There's no, there's no, let's say, influence or whatever, like if you, people want to influence

309
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,280
the government, for example, there's a group you have to go and sign up for, right?

310
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:38,680
Right.

311
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,440
The lobbyists.

312
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,440
You can't do it directly.

313
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:45,360
There's nothing direct anymore, which tells you that this place has been run a certain

314
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,720
way and that's how this place is run, and, you know, get used to it or keep it to yourself.

315
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,580
So, anyway-

316
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,640
Yeah, because otherwise, there'd be, you know, a hundred people that would run for an office

317
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,420
as opposed to the two parties, and you would see, you know, people with different individual

318
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:04,720
ideas that actually were, you know, offering up their differences and they would go and

319
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,620
represent those differences, but you don't see that.

320
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,000
It gets funneled into a very, a very small group of individuals that are allowed to continue

321
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,240
long enough in the process.

322
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,040
I mean, and that's just the selective process of the representative.

323
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:21,140
Then you get into the process of what happens once that representative is installed and

324
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:25,740
And yeah, you're disconnected at every level, and your only chance of participation, allegedly,

325
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,600
is to become part of a party.

326
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:31,940
Well, we could go on what you, on that subject that you brought up, but I always have to

327
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:32,600
stop myself.

328
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,760
I want to stop you also.

329
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:40,040
The reason why is because in their laws many years ago, they stated that it's all commercial,

330
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,140
and commercial means you need money, and there's no money.

331
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,280
So the fact that there's no money, it's all credit, right?

332
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:55,200
And ledgers, until money comes back, undoes the commercial, and because the government's

333
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:00,280
undone and it's become commercial, you know, if you read the annotations to the codes,

334
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,000
the federal codes, it says that all crimes are commercial crimes, right?

335
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,440
So commerce means you need money, and there's no money, so that if there's no money, there's

336
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:07,900
no commerce.

337
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:11,800
If there's no commerce, the commerce part tells you there's no government, so there's

338
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,200
none of it.

339
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:12,780
None of it exists.

340
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,060
It's amazing how it's working.

341
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:20,140
So how it's really working is the way that it worked back before we knew anything about

342
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,260
how things worked.

343
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:26,680
That's why I always talked about the revived goddess religion, and what's coming is a system

344
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,420
that is revived from pre-flood times, right?

345
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:34,800
That we know nothing about, where nothing's been preserved, and by the way, when you look

346
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,060
at ancient documents, one thing I put in the chat, I don't know if you picked it up, any

347
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:43,960
ancient document that you, like the Bible or anything else, you know, you have all the

348
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:48,780
other books, Bhagavad Gita, the Mahabharata, the Koran, whatever, all that stuff is very,

349
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,580
very, very, very highly controlled.

350
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:56,280
So when you read an ancient text, whether you know it or not, or read it or study it, in

351
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,540
the back of your mind, I didn't say this years ago, but this is important to say now as time

352
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:05,780
progresses, in the back of your mind, you should always be asking yourself when you're studying

353
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:10,420
anything that's ancient, why are they letting this out?

354
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,160
Why are they, you know, why is it not illegal?

355
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,440
Why has it not been squashed?

356
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,320
Because here's the thing, this is a hard statement for most, well, if you understand Greek-speak

357
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:25,300
and have been around Greek-speak for a while, you'll see this right away, but nothing has

358
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:25,920
been lost.

359
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:32,140
There are ancient documents from 5,000, 6,000 years ago that still exist that are not open

360
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:36,040
to the public, and if you saw the documents, you'd say it can't be more than 100 years

361
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,120
old, it's in perfect condition, right?

362
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:43,080
That's the level of preservation of knowledge that there is, but not for the public, and

363
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,160
not even for the academics.

364
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:50,400
I had someone recently email me and say, Greek, I know a lot of academics, and I bring up,

365
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:55,380
you gave a whole example of things that I've said, they can't find it, not even on JSTOR,

366
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,140
which is their academic bank or whatever information.

367
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:03,960
I said, the academics are part of the system, they're like social rank, they're like the

368
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,740
sergeants in the enlisted, you know, they're not there to, you think they're going to give

369
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:12,760
the academics real information and give, you know, they're part of the, how do you become

370
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,300
an academic?

371
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:18,900
Just some schmuck in regular society decides to stay in school, because, you know, if you

372
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:24,540
get a student loan and you keep re-enrolling in school, as long as you're in school, you

373
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:28,660
don't have to start paying back the loans, that's how they incentivize these professors,

374
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,480
by the way, anyway, to stay in school.

375
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,860
But anyway, I don't think we've drifted too much off the subject, because we haven't really

376
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:41,820
started on a subject tonight, other than what we, the white powder, I think I'll lay it

377
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,220
to rest.

378
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:50,680
But the computer aspect, yes, you should be savvy about your machines, but you don't want

379
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:57,480
to go to great lengths, you know, the, what do they call it, the VIP, whatever it is, to

380
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,620
hide your virtual...

381
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,220
Or the VPN.

382
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,360
VPN, yeah, yeah, and all this other encrypted stuff.

383
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,740
When you do that, all that's put out by intelligence agencies, like, for example, there's a phone

384
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:10,440
service called Cricket, monthly bill, no contract, years ago.

385
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,020
It turned out that the local police started that, why?

386
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,840
Because they found that the people that were attracted to, like, the prepaid or not, it's

387
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:23,140
not really prepaid, were ones that they would like to use as, you know, for charges, right?

388
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:29,720
So they found out if the police own the cell phone company, they don't have to get a warrant

389
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,280
to listen to you, right?

390
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:31,800
You get it?

391
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,080
So...

392
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,460
Oh, yeah, same thing with the pager companies years ago, I mean, all of a sudden, they sprung

393
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,740
up with a whole bunch of independent pager companies, and you could go to a pawn shop,

394
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:44,880
and your pawn shop guy might have a pager service, and you could go and, you know, literally

395
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,100
get a pager from the pawn shop, buy it, and have it running right as you walk out, and

396
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:49,500
boom, yeah.

397
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,140
You don't need a...

398
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,580
If they're using your stuff, you don't need a warrant for it.

399
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:58,520
So here's the interesting part about computers, is just stay under the radar, just look like

400
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,160
everybody else.

401
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,320
Like, for example, what I do occasionally, I'll do searches, like, for a Barbie doll,

402
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:12,260
or canned beans, right, or, you know, something at Kmart, or, not Kmart, Target, or something,

403
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:12,600
right?

404
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,940
I can't imagine why you'd be searching for a Barbie doll, but go ahead.

405
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:20,860
Yeah, but you know what I mean, just to throw off the, you know, because if I'm using the

406
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:25,280
computer for referencing, they're trying to sell me, like, you know, EC meters, you know,

407
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,540
for laboratories, right?

408
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:27,540
Oh, yeah.

409
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,500
You know what I mean, electro-conductivity meters, because I'm using it for research

410
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,620
and other things like that, and for Skype and calls.

411
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,120
But, like, I'm getting ads right now for every kind of flashlight in the world, because I

412
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,400
wanted a magnifying glass with a light on it, you know, I wanted a magnifier with a

413
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,680
light, and I wanted to find a new one, and now I'm getting flashlights constantly injected

414
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,460
into my ads.

415
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:49,820
Yeah, yeah.

416
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,120
But they could...

417
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,780
If you think about buying a new couch, here's the scary part.

418
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,640
Well, it's not scary.

419
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,140
It's...

420
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:56,820
We...

421
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,720
You understand the reality is ephemeral.

422
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,060
It's...

423
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,340
Anyway, if you start thinking, I assure you, if five out of ten people or half the people

424
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:08,780
start thinking about buying a new couch, you'll see an ad for a couch, even though you don't

425
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,600
type anything in or say anything to anyone.

426
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,820
It'll show up.

427
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,360
It's funny how that happens.

428
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,380
Well, I haven't seen it through direct thought.

429
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,860
I mean, you're telling me that now it's up to the point of direct thought?

430
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,080
They could read your mind, yeah.

431
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,100
Because I've seen it...

432
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,100
Brain waves are like language, right?

433
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:22,900
So...

434
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,660
Because I've seen it directly with conversations.

435
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:28,780
Even if I have a conversation in the proximity of a computer about a product or something,

436
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,880
I'll see an ad for it just a short time later.

437
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,200
You know, like, say I'm talking to the wife about, I don't know, meatballs.

438
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:41,180
Next thing I know is I'll see that there is a sale on ground beef at whatever store.

439
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,060
Sure.

440
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:42,760
It'll come up, you know.

441
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,320
Or I'll have a conversation...

442
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,800
I'll Skype in Spanish with someone for a little while, and then I'll go into the living room

443
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,720
and turn YouTube on the Roku, and I'll get ads in Spanish.

444
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,860
Oh, and YouTube gives you the Spanish commercials, too?

445
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:53,420
Oh, okay.

446
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,820
I thought that was just me.

447
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,100
I guess.

448
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,040
Oh, no, no, no.

449
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,280
But it'll be specific in that vein.

450
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,140
Yeah, but...

451
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:06,360
Oh, I wanted to just mention, I use Mac, by the way, as a browser, I recommend Maxton,

452
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,060
M-A-X-T-H-O-N.

453
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,420
It's the most efficient that I've found, and it has an ad blocker.

454
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,120
I've never seen a YouTube ad, literally.

455
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:15,960
I've never...

456
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:22,540
Well, I have on the Roku out in the living room, but not on the computer because of Maxton.

457
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,480
M-A-X-T-H-O-N.

458
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,080
If you want to clean your computer, you clear...

459
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,900
This is, I've found, you don't have to do these fancy...

460
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,800
This is what these fancy programs that they want you to buy for keeping your computer running

461
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,940
efficiently do, anyway.

462
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,600
What you do...

463
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,280
Because I used to subscribe to iobit, it was like 20 bucks a year, whatever.

464
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,280
I don't do any of that anymore.

465
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,920
You do Ccleaner, which is real basic, it's free, Ccleaner.

466
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:52,280
And what I do is you go to the start menu, and you type in run.

467
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:54,900
I should do it.

468
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,500
It's probably easier to...

469
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,620
Let's see if I can do it from memory.

470
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,980
I don't want to mislead anyone.

471
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,060
But you go to...

472
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:00,920
You type in run.

473
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,080
You know what?

474
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:07,280
I'm going to do it right now because sometimes when you do this, you might miss a step.

475
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,340
Yeah, if you're in the middle of doing it, you'll be like, oh, yeah, that's right.

476
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,360
You got to click on this, too.

477
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,280
Yeah, go do it.

478
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,660
You go to the start menu, and you type in run, and then you select run.

479
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,560
It's known as Windows 10 app.

480
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:19,960
And then you...

481
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,560
It says open.

482
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,760
A little window opens up.

483
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,080
Type in the name of program, folder, document, or internet resource, and Windows will open

484
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:25,500
it for you.

485
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:32,420
Type in cleanmgr, clean manager, which is C-L-E-A-N-M-G-R, okay.

486
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:38,260
And then it opens another window, and it says files to delete, and check everything on the

487
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:38,580
left.

488
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,100
It's about seven or eight things.

489
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,020
The other computer I had is only like five or six.

490
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,300
And then you hit okay.

491
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,020
And it says, are you sure you want to permanently delete these files?

492
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,800
And you hit delete files, and it'll clean up the drive.

493
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:57,340
And basically, it's all temporary files, cookies, all the stuff that you normally...

494
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:02,100
These other programs don't get because it's directly what's been laid on the...

495
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:06,800
Through the Windows, where if you have a separate program, it has to go and prompt, you know,

496
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,860
what the program has.

497
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,140
It's not going through Windows, but this is through Windows.

498
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:20,420
So run, and then type cleanmgr, and just select all the empty boxes, and yes, delete that.

499
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,240
And the computer will run really well.

500
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,900
And back in the day, I know a guy who works for Microsoft, and when the computers were

501
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:33,860
slow, he'd come over for 75 bucks and do stuff.

502
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,260
And I'd say, hey, listen, I got this thing.

503
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,220
You do this, this, and that.

504
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,320
And he's like, well, you don't need me.

505
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:37,980
That's what I do.

506
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:38,840
I'm like, great.

507
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,660
For 75 bucks?

508
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,000
Yeah, sure.

509
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:40,600
I'll do it myself.

510
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:41,600
So...

511
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,380
Save you 75 bucks.

512
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,420
Yeah, to make your computer run fast.

513
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,640
So that's what make...

514
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,060
And then if your computer is running slow, you got to go in and start deleting anything

515
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,700
that's not being used.

516
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:56,640
But the run, cleanmgr, select everything, and yeah, that's been a saver.

517
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,260
I've helped quite a few people with slow computers or whatever.

518
00:23:59,580 --> 00:23:59,820
So...

519
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:03,340
Yeah, because you end up retaining a ton of stuff, especially if you surf the net, you

520
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:07,260
know, you have temporary internet files and things that you don't even use anymore, yeah.

521
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:11,280
The other thing, some of the programs on the computer, well, the computers are set up,

522
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:17,860
when you shut the computer down and turn it on, it doesn't necessarily reset itself.

523
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,540
Sometimes it starts where you, internally, where you left off.

524
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,660
If you want the computer to reset and be more healthy, do restart.

525
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:30,580
Restart will prompt more of a clean slate on a start than a shutdown.

526
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,020
It's kind of counterintuitive because you think a shutdown is, you know, right?

527
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:42,400
But a restart actually resets the computer internally much better than just a shutdown.

528
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:47,720
So yeah, that's why very often when you install a new program, it says, do you want to restart

529
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,640
the computer now?

530
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,140
You see, it doesn't say shut down, right?

531
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,820
And restart, and then start.

532
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,060
Yeah, it's always restart, yeah.

533
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,280
Yeah, so do a restart also.

534
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:01,840
And if you do the clean run, cleanmgr, yeah, your computer should run faster.

535
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:06,620
So that's all I can suggest for computers tonight, because really, the thing makes me

536
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:06,900
sick.

537
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:12,360
Like, what I mean, well, it doesn't make me sick, but I mean, the stupid rectangle that

538
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:17,180
I've been using now for about a month, I use MaxTon, and I only use it as a phone.

539
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:22,300
I don't do whatever on it, but it's an iPhone 7, but supposedly it's a very old one.

540
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,900
I've talked about this before.

541
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:32,900
The operating system, regardless if it's Apple or Android or whatever, it has the mentality

542
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:37,780
and the ideology of a nine-year-old or 12-year-old girl with a credit card, right?

543
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,040
So I can't stand that.

544
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:44,580
I mean, well, I'm not saying that a nine-year-old or 12-year-old girl with a credit card is

545
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,680
a bad place to be, right?

546
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,680
But that's the mentality behind it, right?

547
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,360
So anyway, the computer thing.

548
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,900
The other thing I wanted to maybe entertain, just to segue back into it, is how everything

549
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,760
is in balance.

550
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:08,200
No matter how bad we see a situation, there's a balance that has to be made very quickly.

551
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,560
Give an example.

552
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,240
Very often it's unintuitive.

553
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,160
You don't see it.

554
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:18,820
Like, where's the balance in World War II or World War I or these plagues?

555
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,040
We don't know, always.

556
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:27,340
There's always something beyond our capability to perceive and even understand.

557
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:33,400
But what we do know is the mechanism—this sounds like Daoism or Daoist philosophy—

558
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,820
But wouldn't some people say that the baby boom would be the balance for World War II

559
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:41,740
because, you know, you have a population reduction based on the conflict, and then you have a

560
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:47,580
population refill, kind of in a quick-time sense, a culling, and then a restocking.

561
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,060
It's basically a culling.

562
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,380
Well, it's for different reasons.

563
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:55,820
World War I and World War II, from the research that I've done—by the way, I don't endorse

564
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:59,520
him, but Douglas Dietrich, if you want to know about World War II, go to his older stuff,

565
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,880
if you could handle his insanity.

566
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,760
And I'm not calling him insane.

567
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,500
He calls himself insane.

568
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,780
Just like with Ken Wheeler.

569
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:12,660
I love the guy, but he's a fat, ugly, bald guy, not because I'm calling him—he calls

570
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,260
himself that.

571
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,300
Fair enough.

572
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:14,560
Anyway.

573
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:15,880
Fair enough.

574
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,180
Douglas Dietrich on that.

575
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:24,480
But from speaking to some old heads decades ago, World War I was about going after the

576
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,180
Germans because the Germans were synthesizing everything—synthetic ink, synthetic oil,

577
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:28,860
synthetic fuel.

578
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,260
As a matter of fact, you know Mobil 1, that really good engine oil, by the way?

579
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:32,580
Yep.

580
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,400
Heard of it.

581
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,020
It used to be advertised a lot in the 80s.

582
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,340
I got some recently.

583
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,320
I put it in the engine room.

584
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,120
It was really quiet.

585
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,120
I was like, oh my gosh, that's such a wonderful oil.

586
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,640
Well, years ago, from someone that worked in the gas industry, we were talking about

587
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,680
how the Germans were using plant-based motor oils that lasted forever.

588
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,980
You don't have to keep changing the oil.

589
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:56,240
And he said that Mobil developed their Mobil 1 oil from leftover World War II barrels of

590
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,200
oil they absconded with from Germany, from the market or whatever, and they tried to

591
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:05,940
technically figure out how it maintained its lubricosity and its viscosity, heat resistance

592
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,800
and all that, and they tried to emulate that.

593
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,520
So yeah, World War I was overstopping the Germans.

594
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,120
The Morgenthau's pastoral policy, it's called pastoral because he said Germany, everyone

595
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,920
should be killed, and Germany turned into a pasture, right?

596
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,740
Back in those days, they didn't mince words.

597
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,500
They would easily tell you you should eliminate these people in public documents.

598
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,600
People went with it, you know?

599
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:34,340
World War II was basically calling the population, I think it's 90% of the people that died in

600
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:38,480
World War II were not on the battlefield, it was civilian, it's all civilian, right?

601
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:47,120
So yeah, and then we have another main, the main calling that's coming is not going to

602
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,500
be through war, but it's going to be through cosmic, you know, calling.

603
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,800
That's still somehow a balance.

604
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,760
I don't understand that fully, but I do see it and I do comprehend it, right?

605
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:07,460
But excuse me, something that's unintuitive is from doing computer modeling, actually

606
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:14,740
advanced computer modeling from, not here, but someone in Switzerland that was modeling

607
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:18,800
pressure devices, and it made total sense.

608
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:25,040
Most people, so for example, when you have a piston moving forward, you think that there's,

609
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,540
you know, or a speaker moving forward or a hammer moving forward or something, the front

610
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:34,000
of the face of that device that's moving forward, compressing the air is going to have a positive

611
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,400
pressure against it, right?

612
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,060
That's of course, right?

613
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:41,280
You're moving, if I push you, if I punch you in the chest, there's a positive pressure,

614
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:41,500
right?

615
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:47,600
Okay, well, these devices that move very quickly like that, the moment they stop moving, a very

616
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,300
strong negative pressure builds up in front of it.

617
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,040
And it's not counted for in engineering.

618
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:56,640
And that's why they have a lot of problems with things that they don't foresee, because

619
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,980
they don't foresee this negative pressure.

620
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,460
And this engineer was going around telling people, there's actually a negative pressure

621
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,280
on the front of that piston.

622
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,060
And they're like, no way, it can't be, because it's all, you know, it's a tremendous amount

623
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,080
of positive pressure building.

624
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,620
It has to be positive on the front of it.

625
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,720
And he was showing them that it's actually for a very finite period of time, a small

626
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,480
negative pressure.

627
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:19,940
And I said, well, like a mushroom cloud, when a very powerful detonation goes off, it doesn't

628
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,880
just keep expanding outward and outward.

629
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:25,800
What happens is you have the initial energy and then what happens, it contracts completely

630
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,300
into a vertical column, right?

631
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,500
And then you form the cloud atop, makes total sense.

632
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:37,740
The only way a tremendous force like that would do that is if there's a negative pressure

633
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,140
in the middle.

634
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:42,000
Why would the column go straight up and not completely outward like the shockwave?

635
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:47,000
In other words, when a detonation of an atomic device goes off, all the material and everything

636
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,580
on the smoke and gas and all should follow the shockwave.

637
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,320
But it doesn't.

638
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,160
You would think, yeah.

639
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:52,380
It doesn't.

640
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:58,480
It forms a negative area where that's the only way you could form a column.

641
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:03,500
And it rises very, it shoots up very quickly and then where it slows down, it forms the

642
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,180
mushroom head.

643
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:04,640
Right.

644
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,000
Make total sense.

645
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,180
And he's like, oh, I never thought of that analogy before, but anyway, that's what I

646
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,040
mean by unintuitive.

647
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,500
There are so many things that are going on that can be modeled.

648
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:19,480
If someone wants to sit down with a computer and figure these things out or because they

649
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,740
are really good engineer doesn't need a computer, but he does it intuitively.

650
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,740
But what if something is unintuitive?

651
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,780
What kind of intuition do you need?

652
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,600
You see, if it's unintuitive, right?

653
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,860
Because I think even the best engineer would imagine if something creates a pressure front,

654
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,320
it's going to maintain the pressure front.

655
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,800
You won't see a negative pressure emerging on it ever.

656
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,020
You see?

657
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,740
So there are things that are, we're constantly learning.

658
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,300
And by the way, what I just mentioned is not going to be accepted by the main engineering

659
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:49,780
community.

660
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,640
I don't see in the near future at all.

661
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,740
No, you bring this to an engineer, they're going to tell you you're wrong, you're crazy

662
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,100
or, you know, that makes no sense.

663
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,160
It's a matter of either is a, you know, forced or there is no force and that's it, right?

664
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:01,700
That's right.

665
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,540
There's the mushroom cloud is an excellent example for that, right?

666
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:08,960
Because the material in the cloud and the smoke and the fire doesn't follow the shockwave.

667
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,060
It just goes up vertically.

668
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:13,140
So so this is in front of everyone again.

669
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:19,340
So what does this do when you start going and discovering the unintuitive, you put gives

670
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,720
you a little bit of an edge, doesn't it?

671
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:26,480
It puts you a little bit, uh, ahead of many things, you know, uh, in situations if it's

672
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:32,540
applicable or, you know, I can't see this very specific engineering part of the reality

673
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:36,160
and they haven't accounted for it, then it is a useful thing.

674
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,520
And it's an advantage because now you understand something that they're not accounting for

675
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:39,800
ever.

676
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:46,140
And, you know, uh, again, if it's something that consistently emerges, you have a definite

677
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:49,260
advantage because, uh, they're not accounting for it again.

678
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:55,780
You know, so yeah, but see, the thing is the part about intuition is supposed to supersede

679
00:32:55,780 --> 00:33:01,820
now what you know about something that's supposed to work on a feeling and the people

680
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:05,140
that I've mentioned is the pressure, negative pressure building up in front of something

681
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:05,680
that's pushing.

682
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,540
They can't see it at all.

683
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,340
They just rather say, no, that can't happen, right?

684
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:16,060
So there's an interesting part of defending their ignorance, um, which is very interesting.

685
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:22,080
The other thing about intuitive is that's where, um, the, you know, we've been talking

686
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,020
about the emo a lot, right?

687
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:27,180
A lot of people, I've gotten some messages about the emo.

688
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,640
Some people think it's very powerful.

689
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:29,700
It is very powerful.

690
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,160
Some people still kind of like on the sideline with it.

691
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,560
Some people are kind of wrestling with it.

692
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,720
What, you know, what is it really?

693
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,320
Here's the thing.

694
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:41,220
And I came up with this analogy for someone I was speaking to recently.

695
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,980
The what the emo is, it's the energy.

696
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,560
When you have a thought, right?

697
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:51,780
And you want to perform that the thought, or let's say you have idea, idea comes before

698
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,360
thought, right?

699
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,640
Cause an idea is a flash, right?

700
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,400
I got this idea.

701
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:54,880
What is it?

702
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,420
And then the thought comes out, right?

703
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:56,760
Right.

704
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,560
Idea, thought.

705
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,220
And then the, the action, let's say there's even a few more steps there.

706
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,540
You have planning and action, right?

707
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,620
So yeah, I can give many analogies and that unnecessary.

708
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:07,500
It's pretty simple.

709
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:15,420
So what the emo does, it's the energy that provides, uh, that after the, the, uh, idea

710
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:19,639
and the thought come out, once you understand how to engage the emo, that provides the

711
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,760
energy for the rest of it.

712
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,340
And it sets up the energy.

713
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:27,100
That's why I was calling it a motivator, uh, in certain parts of that discussion, because

714
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:30,739
that's what it seems like, you know, motivator as in motive force.

715
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:30,960
Yeah.

716
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:36,080
It's a motive as in what is motive mean moves, but you need energy to move somehow, whether

717
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:41,659
it's, you know, free energy or any kind of, it's a fuel, but it's not, it doesn't in the

718
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:45,500
fuel to keep it, the emo going is the conviction.

719
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,840
Well, like look at it this way.

720
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,980
You can know how to do something.

721
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:53,840
You can have the idea to do it, but unless you have the desire to execute it, let's just

722
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,880
say, you know, you're, you're okay.

723
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:00,160
You're working in a room in the house and you discover that I should have something

724
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,380
here which would help me do it.

725
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:05,480
Uh, you know, and you have the idea, you have a practical application.

726
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:11,560
You have a concept, but unless you have a desire to create the thing and put it up in

727
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:18,540
that room, whether it's a shelf or it's a desire, I would say is beyond idea would be in the

728
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,640
thought category.

729
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:20,340
Okay.

730
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,340
You still need energy.

731
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:21,680
Yeah.

732
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:21,900
Right.

733
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,680
I'm thinking that that desire is in and of itself serves as part of the emo.

734
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,000
No.

735
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:26,580
Yeah.

736
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:32,400
The emo, I would say is more of the battery power that you need to fulfill the desire without,

737
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,680
without going physical.

738
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,160
Right.

739
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:37,940
So when, in other words, when you hit the juice on a light switch or a battery or whatever,

740
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,020
you don't really see it, you, but you, you don't see the juice, you just see what the

741
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:41,580
juice does.

742
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,060
Okay.

743
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:42,320
Right.

744
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,800
You don't see, nobody sees electricity even with a volt meter.

745
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,780
It's just seeing the volt meter.

746
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,320
So it's really the juice, uh, give me an example.

747
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,580
You have a desire to do something, you have a thought and you're working, you want to

748
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:52,980
do it, right?

749
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:53,740
And you get distracted.

750
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:54,180
Right.

751
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,580
And you, and then what was I doing?

752
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,660
Well, I need to go back to this.

753
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,260
But when you set up the emo, the distractions don't work.

754
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:05,160
You could actually keep doing what you're doing and handle the distraction better because

755
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,900
the emo controls the body.

756
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,780
Like we've given initially the example of mild mannered guy kills 15 people.

757
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:11,600
How is that possible?

758
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,680
Well, it's the emo that fueled it.

759
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,180
You see the power, right?

760
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,780
The power doesn't mean the actual, uh, physical manifestation.

761
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:23,300
It's just the power, you know, the battery doesn't provide or the hitting the light switch

762
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:23,560
on there.

763
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,720
There's nothing physical there.

764
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,500
But what do you mean?

765
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,180
There's nothing physical.

766
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:26,500
Greek.

767
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:26,980
It was dark.

768
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:27,900
Now it's light.

769
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,880
See, but there's nothing physical there.

770
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,580
In a way though, emo is always present though, in any of these actions, right?

771
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:37,560
Because again, if you have a desire to create something and then you do it, like I said,

772
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,680
and you have an idea.

773
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,980
I mean, I give a very general thing there, but at some point the emo is built into this.

774
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:48,940
Even if you're not thinking about it, it has, well, here's the thing, uh, like I've said

775
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:54,080
before many times with you and others, everyone is doing it anyway.

776
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:54,500
Right.

777
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:54,960
Right.

778
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,900
But here's the thing.

779
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,980
Uh, someone's not happy at their job and they've got an emo that they're not happy, but they're

780
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:00,940
still doing that job.

781
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,980
It's going to show them what they're doing and it's going to show on their health.

782
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:08,640
But if they somehow get it to the point where they can discipline themselves where the emo

783
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,940
is in line with what result they want, guess what's going to happen, right?

784
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,100
So in other words, you cannot avoid the emo.

785
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,840
It's just that we have it repressed and ignored and unacknowledged, right?

786
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:25,600
So there's a way to enhance your use of it, even though you're currently using it, whether

787
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:30,840
you have decided to or not bring up, bring it up, bring it up and specify what emo you

788
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,080
want.

789
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,300
We create a menu, right?

790
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:36,520
Make a menu for it and set yourself up.

791
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:41,460
It's like almost deliberately, uh, you know, when people are asked, why do you do this?

792
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,780
And they don't, you can't give you a straight answer or a clear answer or why they do something,

793
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:47,640
whether it's a custom or a belief or whatever.

794
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,420
Right, right.

795
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,140
Yeah.

796
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:52,760
It's, uh, it's kind of like, uh, it's that emo is the opposite of that.

797
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:56,700
It's like, cause if you ask someone why you believe this and they say, I'll tell you,

798
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:01,680
and they're very specific and cautious and everything is very detailed and if it's a

799
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,800
short amount of time or a long amount of time, they could, they could support what they're

800
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,720
telling you or their belief is, right?

801
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,380
The emo is like that support also.

802
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:14,780
So when you're going to do something, what emo it requires, you build in, you, you, you

803
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:18,620
discover or because it's a learning process because we live in a society where this is

804
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:23,680
not acknowledged at all other than, you know, happy, sad or angry or whatever, right?

805
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,700
Or affectionate, the rest, they, they don't discuss once you understand, uh, you're going

806
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,520
to perform a task.

807
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,240
What is the emo?

808
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:34,520
What is the best emotional state to be in to do this task?

809
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:39,500
Um, if you're distracted and the thoughts are distracted or your desire is distracted,

810
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,660
the emo still cannot be distracted.

811
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,500
It's, it's going to still, you could come back to it.

812
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:50,300
You see, if you don't, if you're not conscious of the emo, when you're distracted and the

813
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,760
distraction is over, you end up saying, well, what was I doing again?

814
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:53,620
What was I saying?

815
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,560
What was I supposed to be doing?

816
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:54,780
Right.

817
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,800
But once you have the emo in line at that, that power that carries, it's like leaving

818
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,260
the light, you leave, you leave the house and the lights are on, oh, I got to go back

819
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,060
and turn off the light.

820
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:10,140
It's very, it's very much in very, um, easy to perceive once you work with the emo, that

821
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,920
you're setting it up for yourself.

822
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,860
In other words, you're setting up your state that it's more than just what you're thinking.

823
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:20,180
See, and some people would use the word attitude to describe it, right?

824
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:24,940
Because your, your attitude while you're performing whatever task or while you're participating

825
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:30,520
in whatever activity or going to work or whatever, your attitude in and of itself changes the

826
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,320
way that that task goes, right?

827
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:32,920
Okay.

828
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,820
You've got a mindless, repetitive job.

829
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:39,880
If your attitude about it is not, this is mindless, repetitive, grinding me down.

830
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,440
If it's like that, it's going to be very exhausting.

831
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,700
It's going to be difficult to do.

832
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:48,920
You might even get it, but if you ask them what is attitude, they can't, people usually

833
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,580
don't answer.

834
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,460
It's an emotional state.

835
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,560
It's an emotional state.

836
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:57,220
It's how you're set when you go into this, how you're set when you're going through it.

837
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,840
It does change the nature of that thing.

838
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,880
It does change the results.

839
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,540
It changes the experience altogether.

840
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:03,400
Right?

841
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:08,740
Well, it makes it, it, it, what it does, it's, um, it's really, this is a very interesting.

842
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,520
Here's the sad part.

843
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,060
And here's, here's the good part that we're discussing is the sad part.

844
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:13,660
There's nothing.

845
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:19,440
I've been looking around for this and the whole emo subject and it's, you can't find a discussion

846
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,180
anywhere on it.

847
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,560
Here, you know, it's in spatterings here or there.

848
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:27,240
In other words, where you separate and acknowledge that your emotional state that you choose

849
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:35,140
that you set yourself up for is a major part of, um, your, your manifestation in the world,

850
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,080
whatever you're doing.

851
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:36,340
Yeah.

852
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:40,860
Some of these like encouragement business people, you know, the life coach type people will

853
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:41,540
tell you this.

854
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:46,280
It may be, you know, your Tony Robbins type people, not necessarily him, but maybe he does.

855
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,180
I can't sit through it.

856
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,220
But it's attitude again.

857
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,300
But it's about the attitude.

858
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,160
But that's not emo though.

859
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:50,980
Is it?

860
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:51,620
Is it emo?

861
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,580
It's 50, 50.

862
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:53,340
I think it is.

863
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,180
It's kind of watered down.

864
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:54,500
Really?

865
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:54,860
Okay.

866
00:40:54,940 --> 00:41:00,360
I think it is because look, if you go into, they tell you, set yourself this way, you

867
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,000
know, uh, perceived this way, feel this way.

868
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,440
But that you can be distracted from that though.

869
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,820
Well, it's different.

870
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,440
Like you're going to, the most, the basic example is when people say, send, you want

871
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,700
to send healing energy to this person and not doing well.

872
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:13,580
Okay.

873
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,900
So how do you send healing energy?

874
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,260
Well, you know, you set yourself up to feel like you're, you know, when you give someone

875
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:24,040
a hug, you only feel that giving feeling when you're giving us, if you know how to trigger

876
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,940
that feeling, that is the giving energy in the body.

877
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:28,760
You actually feel it.

878
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,920
Think about emo work your butt.

879
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:32,280
You can actually feel it in your body, right?

880
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:38,680
Then the energy, then it's now you're powering that thought and it has, and it actually will

881
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:43,060
carry over just like a wifi, for example, a very similar.

882
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:47,660
So these, I'm glad you brought up cause in the back, it was really in the far distance.

883
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:51,680
Like the, the, the life coaches, like Anthony Robbins stuff, they tell you have a positive

884
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,660
attitude, don't think negative, but that's not really emo, is it?

885
00:41:54,660 --> 00:42:01,260
They don't tell you set yourself up for giving energy or guarding energy or, or an energetic

886
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,200
state, right?

887
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:05,760
No, they, their thing about energetic state is if you, if you believe you're going to

888
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,440
be successful, if you're just deciding you're going to be successful, you'll be successful,

889
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,620
which I think is an aspect of this.

890
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:11,940
It does.

891
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:14,620
Well, it does work on some levels, right?

892
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,020
They don't tell you how to do it.

893
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,160
They don't tell you how to do it.

894
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:23,260
That's why, but you know how you do that, by the way, and here's the thing, uh, you,

895
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:27,500
let me just preface this years ago, uh, and I have many witnesses, some more than a decade.

896
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,900
So I'm not doing anything anymore.

897
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,800
I have no desires here.

898
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,400
This is, I'm in the wrong freaking place.

899
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:36,460
I'm telling you, if I find out who sent me here, I'm going to kick them in the nuts.

900
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,380
Even if it's me and I have to kick myself in the nuts, right, somehow, right?

901
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,240
If they have nuts.

902
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:48,620
So that's how upset I am about being here, uh, in this reality, the way it is, um, and

903
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,760
the way it has been in the way it will be too, by the way.

904
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:57,240
Uh, but here's the, uh, part when you want something, and this works for everyone, by

905
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:57,560
the way.

906
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,920
Uh, and I've seen it happen many, many times.

907
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:02,100
I could give a hundred examples unnecessary.

908
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:09,080
When you want something, set yourself up as if you already have it and not never think

909
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,180
about how you're going to get it right.

910
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:17,460
Just set yourself emotionally as if you already there, right now, if you want to be the richest

911
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:22,420
man in the world, let's say, which is a stupid thing, whatever, uh, you, it may not work for

912
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:26,460
you at all because you see it's outside of the scope because the richest man in the world

913
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:28,180
is not the richest man in the world at all.

914
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:28,560
Really?

915
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:29,480
It doesn't exist.

916
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,660
So you have to be real things.

917
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:38,860
Um, I found this to be true where things came out of nowhere, um, and three months later

918
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:43,080
or six months later, I find myself in exactly a situation that I never imagined that would

919
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:43,260
be.

920
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:48,660
And you know, in terms of what I wanted to do, the main thing that people usually want

921
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:51,860
because they, this society is based on money.

922
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:57,520
If you just say, I want money, you're never going to get it because there is no money.

923
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:02,800
But if you got the money, what you're going to do with it, right?

924
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:05,380
Let's say you want a car, you want a house, you want this or that.

925
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:10,120
You just focus on the things that money will get you, not the money itself, and then you'll

926
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:10,480
get it.

927
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,100
You'll get those things.

928
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:12,800
Cause why?

929
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,480
Because you think the universe is dumb to think that there's money.

930
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:21,480
The universe knows that there's no money, but you, when you don't pay, let's say a bill

931
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:26,040
and they shut off the water, that's because he didn't have money, but there is no money.

932
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:31,640
So ignore that, that the, so you just want to, for example, someone who's having a hard

933
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:36,120
time, let's say just getting by, uh, the thing you would be set up as if you had infinite

934
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:39,420
amount of water, gas, power, whatever, whatever it was, what you call bills, right?

935
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:43,500
Infinite amount, not, not paying the bills cause you can't pay it.

936
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,560
No one's ever paid a bill in 70 years.

937
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,680
It's having an infinite supply and those things are ever present and you'll find it happening.

938
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:53,500
Somehow it'll be like, Oh my gosh, I can't believe it.

939
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,260
You know how it's all coming together.

940
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,720
I'm not worried about these things anymore.

941
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:03,300
So things that don't exist in reality, if you want them, guess what's going to happen

942
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:03,820
in reality.

943
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,020
They're not going to come because they don't exist in reality.

944
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:11,140
And if someone is, most of the people listening are not new, there is no such thing as the

945
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:13,240
richest man in the world cause there's no money in riches.

946
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:15,020
It's just who has more control or whatever.

947
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:17,340
And we don't even know who they are or what to model.

948
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:17,960
Right?

949
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:21,700
So something like that to the average person, this would sound insane.

950
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:22,660
What do you mean?

951
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:25,460
This guy on time magazine was the richest man in the world, right?

952
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,540
See, if you focus on that and you're never, you know, you're going to get it.

953
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:29,380
It's very simple.

954
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:34,460
Just more than imagination, the emo that you already have it or exist in that.

955
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:35,380
How would you feel?

956
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,300
Let's say you wanted something materialistic.

957
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:44,100
You only know most people when they say they want something, they only have the emo of

958
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:45,120
wanting that thing.

959
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:48,460
They don't never experienced the emo as if they already got it.

960
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,240
You know, that is a big difference there.

961
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,880
That's what the emo is about.

962
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:58,740
That's why, for example, again, the most rudimentary example I give on the emo, Oh, send healing

963
00:45:58,740 --> 00:45:59,740
energy to that person.

964
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:00,080
Will you?

965
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,580
Everybody on this call or whatever.

966
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:02,480
You hear that all the time.

967
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:02,700
Right?

968
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:02,940
Right.

969
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:03,920
Okay.

970
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:10,760
When you set the emo up as if you are giving or receiving a hug, which you feel that rise,

971
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,780
even just now, if I stand up, I'm going to stand up and gesture giving someone a hug.

972
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:19,200
I feel a tingling sensation that goes up to the solar plexus and my legs are almost like

973
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:19,840
a warm feeling.

974
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,680
My legs feel really light, right?

975
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:26,620
That triggering, that's the, so when you have, you can trigger the body by just gesturing

976
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:26,940
a hug.

977
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,960
Even if you're alone, if you do that exercise enough, you can bring that up without doing

978
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:32,920
the physical gesture.

979
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:37,400
When you feel that in the body, that's like turning on the wifi, right?

980
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,380
Turning on making a cell phone call to that person.

981
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,840
And once you have an identifier for them, right?

982
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,580
And I said, you don't even know team.

983
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:48,560
So they are just asked the person that I'm sending this to, do they have anything that

984
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:49,420
makes them them?

985
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:50,920
Of course their spirit is unique.

986
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,160
And do they have any identifiers?

987
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:58,180
That's the one, the person that I was told to, you see, so, and then it works, right?

988
00:46:58,680 --> 00:46:59,680
Then you have it.

989
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:06,180
Uh, I still get maybe once every 10 days or so, someone will give me a situation, uh,

990
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:07,140
with the emo.

991
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:09,300
They, and I want to, I'm just so happy.

992
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:10,800
The emo stuff worked for me.

993
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:11,580
This is what happened.

994
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:12,640
And this is what I did.

995
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:14,800
And this is, this is what I wanted to happen.

996
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:15,620
This is what I did.

997
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,640
And this is how it came out.

998
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:19,920
You know, it was like, great, great, great.

999
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:20,060
Yeah.

1000
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:20,760
I'm glad it worked.

1001
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:28,360
So, so anyway, the situation that people are in is because the general society is, well,

1002
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,180
that call them the mushroom people, right?

1003
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:30,840
You know what that is?

1004
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:32,320
Keep them in the dark and feed them shit.

1005
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:32,580
Right.

1006
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:32,920
Yeah.

1007
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:37,960
And, uh, then the other part of that is unacknowledged.

1008
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:43,600
All the things that are unacknowledged, it's, it's, it's, um, something else to say that

1009
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:48,960
they're ignorant of, because when I don't say they're ignorant of it, because let's say

1010
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,920
you take someone who is ignorant and someone, this guy's not ignorant and he's got a doctorate

1011
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,360
and whatever, you know, post whole digger PhD, right?

1012
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:55,660
Whatever.

1013
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,580
He's not ignorant, but he doesn't know about it either.

1014
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:00,560
So it's not about ignorance for smarts.

1015
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,460
It's about, is it acknowledged or not?

1016
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:02,940
Right.

1017
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,740
There's a big difference there.

1018
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:09,880
Kind of like a lot of people mix up choices and decisions, right?

1019
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,000
They interchange them.

1020
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:13,120
They're not the same thing, right?

1021
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:13,700
Very different.

1022
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,080
You know, you go to a menu, they got 10 different sandwiches.

1023
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:16,880
Those are your choices.

1024
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:17,860
What do you decide?

1025
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:18,180
Right?

1026
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:27,480
People say, Oh, I'm even when you choose something, there's a big difference to deciding, right?

1027
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:27,980
You see?

1028
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,540
So all of these things tie in together.

1029
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:36,640
By the way, before we go, there was someone I'm fond with also left a message.

1030
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:40,880
He emails me frequently, left a message on the chat about flatbread.

1031
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,440
I posted some pictures of food.

1032
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,660
I messaged back on the flatbread.

1033
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,040
Look up recipes.

1034
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:53,640
And the thing is, look up recipes on making the Greek pitas and add yogurt and less yeast

1035
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,020
if you're going to use yeast or no yeast.

1036
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:55,820
But okay.

1037
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:57,220
Now, here's the thing.

1038
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:58,700
I like giving recipes and stuff.

1039
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:01,700
But I also want people to be flexible and give feedback.

1040
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:07,700
So in other words, when I say make something, I know there's some critical parts that if

1041
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:09,320
you don't follow, it won't come out well.

1042
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,240
I give those, right?

1043
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:15,040
But I also like to see some feedback on another way of doing things, right?

1044
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:22,900
So when you make the flatbread, by the way, you can just do water and flour and cook it

1045
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:23,680
very quickly.

1046
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,760
You may have a delicious flatbread, you know, non-yeasted.

1047
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:31,460
And then you have all the other recipes in between that you could find online, which

1048
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:32,800
most of them are pretty good.

1049
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,260
I'm a no-knead.

1050
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:35,800
I don't knead the bread at all.

1051
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:36,900
I just mix it initially.

1052
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:38,320
When everything's mixed, I let it sit.

1053
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:45,640
Here's the critical part about anything that is going to have some rise to it, right?

1054
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:47,100
This is not for Passover bread.

1055
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:53,900
But you start it between 2 and 3 a.m. in the morning.

1056
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:56,460
The atmosphere starts to expand, right?

1057
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:02,200
It's at maximum expansion by noon or 1 o'clock, and by 2 or 3 o'clock in the afternoon, the

1058
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,140
atmosphere does what?

1059
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:04,220
It starts to contract, right?

1060
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:05,480
It starts to go down, right?

1061
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:15,000
So if you want whatever leavening you're using, a rising agent, to be most effective, start

1062
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,920
your bread first thing you get up in the morning, right?

1063
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:20,480
Presuming you get up early.

1064
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:23,320
And then for lunch or for dinner to have it.

1065
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:28,000
Because then, as the atmosphere is expanding, guess what your dough is going to do?

1066
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,500
Naturally expand more, you see?

1067
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:35,360
And that's the best way that I would suggest making anything that would have some rise

1068
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:39,120
to it, is very early in the morning or very late at night.

1069
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:43,840
This is why the real reason, you know, in the Northeast, again, where you and I spent

1070
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:48,480
a bunch of time, this is why the bakeries always started to operate early in the morning.

1071
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:52,900
They would begin baking, you know, because that's just the best time of day to do that.

1072
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,020
Well, mainly it was commercial.

1073
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,800
You want it to be as fresh as possible.

1074
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,440
The people are going to start coming in the morning.

1075
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:02,280
But it's happened to coincide with this phenomenon, which most people, you know, most people spend

1076
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:02,900
their whole lives.

1077
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:08,260
They don't think that, you know, in the middle, you know, let's say pre-dawn all the way to

1078
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:09,900
noon, everything's expanding.

1079
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:12,500
And then afternoon, in the afternoon, it starts contracting.

1080
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:13,560
No one thinks that way.

1081
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:17,420
Well, it seems to me that somebody might have thought that way to begin with, because I think

1082
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:22,880
the commercial circumstance emerged after the natural circumstance just became, look, this

1083
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,860
is commonly just the best time to do this.

1084
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:28,700
And therefore, the commercial circumstance emerged around that, I think.

1085
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:29,120
Oh, yeah.

1086
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:29,500
Yeah.

1087
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:32,280
Just like breakfast is at the end of the day.

1088
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:32,600
Yeah.

1089
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,820
It's the last meal of the day.

1090
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:34,180
Right.

1091
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:34,820
Right.

1092
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,580
When you fast for a day, you break your fast with breakfast because, right.

1093
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,420
So yeah, very simple.

1094
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:43,980
All right.
