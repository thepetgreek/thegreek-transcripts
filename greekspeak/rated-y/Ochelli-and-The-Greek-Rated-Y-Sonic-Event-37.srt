1
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,600
Sonic Event 37, Ocelli in the Greek, Rated Y.

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,680
So, a lot of things could be going on, a lot of things are going on.

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,160
How are you being trained?

4
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,420
Are we going to get into that tonight?

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:20,220
I don't know.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,320
Let's find out.

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,880
There's a bunch of things we could get into.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,760
Greek, how are you doing, first off?

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,140
I'm doing all right.

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,040
I was wondering how you were doing.

11
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,740
You sound a little congested, but I asked you about are you eating too much ice cream

12
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:34,280
and you laughed.

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,440
I guess I take that as a no, but this is something I haven't brought up.

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,880
This has been very well known for a long time, but dairy, by the way, the more dairy consumption

15
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:53,640
you see in a society, other than people growing really large, is occurrences of people with

16
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,320
depression, in terms of depression, not like your belly button, if it's in any, but depression

17
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,800
as in the psychological condition that they dub.

18
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:03,880
Right?

19
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:04,379
Right.

20
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:08,860
The way that it's been described to me about the use of dairy, because what is the sense

21
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,440
of taking the milk, which practical purpose, right?

22
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,800
Let's look at its practical purpose.

23
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:17,900
You take the milk from the cow, which is meant for the baby cow, okay, nature has a use for

24
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:18,120
this.

25
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,500
Why would you do it?

26
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,860
I imagine that it initially was developed as a way of just being able to survive at

27
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,620
a time of year when you weren't able to harvest as much, and that would be the practical point

28
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,280
of it, and then it becomes something else, right?

29
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,600
You could say ovolactic, eggs and milk, you don't have to kill the animal.

30
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:45,060
You can harvest from the animal, you don't have to kill them, so you have a resource

31
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,960
which is, I hate to say this, but sustainable, right?

32
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:53,760
Because you can continuously harvest from it something, and also, it's not necessary

33
00:01:53,760 --> 00:02:01,440
to grow an entire other calf or whatever to harvest the animal directly, so you get it.

34
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,280
Well, as long as you, like people, if you keep milking them, they're going to keep

35
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,280
producing milk, right?

36
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,760
But there's the thing.

37
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:08,800
There were women that went around, right?

38
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,720
Back in the days.

39
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,060
They continue to be wet nurses even after the time of them feeding their babies because

40
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,700
they keep the process going.

41
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,200
Yeah, exactly.

42
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:17,940
It's an impulse.

43
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:18,880
Induction.

44
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:24,020
So you need, you know, Wilhelm Reich talked about when you have mechanical movement creates

45
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,360
an electrical charge, and then you have a biological discharge.

46
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,260
Yeah, and you know, that's another level of induction and that process that could be

47
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:37,380
talked about at some point, you know, because look, the body takes in and then creates through

48
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,860
induction certain things and then is able to put something back out.

49
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,640
You know, I'm talking about the practical process.

50
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,300
So there's something about the functionality of the body.

51
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,760
Of course, only women do this, although there is a weird thing that happens sometimes to

52
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,860
men where they kind of produce a little milk or whatever because their hormones are off,

53
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:55,300
right?

54
00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:00,840
But there was a South Park one when they were looking for semen, and Eric Cartman says,

55
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,120
if I go into the alley, I can drink it out of a, to get it out of a straw.

56
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,780
Yeah, this fool gave it to me for free.

57
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,840
I just had to go in the alley and suck it out of a straw.

58
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,200
Oh my gosh.

59
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:09,800
Oh my God.

60
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,940
That's pretty bad.

61
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:15,900
I never, just cut that part out, you know, later, maybe, yeah.

62
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,540
So the, the induction, you have the prime mover, which is the mechanical one, but then

63
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:26,040
most of the stuff that's going on in the body does not require a prime mover other than

64
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,260
the presence of the soul, the metabolism.

65
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:39,260
Now initially it's very easy to, let's say, hmm, implement examples of the induction

66
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,260
implementing useful, uh, by the mechanical stuff, even to the point where you graph trees,

67
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,160
you can have a tree that has various fruit on it where they graph branches from other

68
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:54,460
trees and it heals up and it, uh, it takes to the original tree.

69
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:59,120
So, but then there's the induction that is very subtle and it's like the ether base

70
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,280
that's in the soul, meaning a living being does like, you know, you know, you're not,

71
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,040
you know, people talk about it.

72
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,620
If you're eating a meal, they say, yeah, I'm digesting, but you're not really taking part

73
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,280
in digesting.

74
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,100
You, you know, you just say you are, right?

75
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,080
You're not really functioning in that way.

76
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,760
It's just functioning and you trust it, right?

77
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,300
Well, it's an automated, it's a process that has nothing to do with you about the decisions

78
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,060
beyond what you've decided to put into the equation.

79
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,460
Then the body just takes over and does what it does, right?

80
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,000
Autonomous.

81
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,560
Yeah, exactly.

82
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,040
That's when you start learning that and how to create impulses on that.

83
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,460
Now you go to the next, like I was speaking with someone in engineering and he's like

84
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,680
another octave or two octaves up, right?

85
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:44,380
And that is, requires very subtle thinking and it requires a group effort, meaning not

86
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,840
group with people, but grouping into the environment.

87
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:53,000
Speaking of which, this was really what I was thinking about venting and ranting about

88
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,560
tonight.

89
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,200
Regarding the dairy stuff, right?

90
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,660
No, not dairy.

91
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,360
Actually, it might, might tie in eventually, but people buying new stuff instead of fixing

92
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,100
old stuff.

93
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,520
Yeah.

94
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,880
I brought this before.

95
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:05,740
Don't buy.

96
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,440
If you can avoid buying new stuff, avoid fix it.

97
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,180
If you've got it.

98
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:11,800
Here's the thing.

99
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,540
Most people are, okay, this, well, I'll just finish the sentence.

100
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,220
Most people are disencouraged because they say it's not worth the money to invest to

101
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:21,580
fix it.

102
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,360
Buy a new one, right?

103
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,220
That's the common.

104
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,440
Yeah.

105
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,100
A lot of times.

106
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:25,360
Right.

107
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,080
Yeah.

108
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:32,000
I suggest not even if it caught, if you think it costs more, it stay with that and go ahead

109
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,640
and fix it.

110
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,680
Number one.

111
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,380
Number two.

112
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,560
Again, from speaking with an engineer today, kind of hit me and it was like the 10th person

113
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,060
that said this in a few months, I wanted to talk about it.

114
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,280
Planned obsolescence.

115
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:50,000
When you have a problem in industry that makes parts wear out or break down, manufacturer

116
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,020
won't address that because he wants you to buy another one.

117
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,020
Right.

118
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,660
So the assumption is they won't make something good enough to last.

119
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:03,940
You know, they could make a screw, anything from a screw to a complex machine that could

120
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:04,580
last forever.

121
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,640
But why do that if you can sell somebody 10 of them in the course of their lifetime

122
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,160
instead of just the one, right?

123
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:14,900
Or let's say, for example, with pumps and valves, you have, instead of offering one

124
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:22,240
pump and one valve to everyone, let's say you offer two types, one for, let's say, sweet

125
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,640
water and one for hard water, right?

126
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,500
One that builds up minerals and has got a lot of salts and then one that doesn't.

127
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:33,780
So this way, it's more custom tailored to their situation and it'll last longer where,

128
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:39,600
let's say you make one pump and you sell it to the public, you'll notice that the ones

129
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,120
that have hard water keep coming back broken.

130
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,760
Well, you know, why don't you address that?

131
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,780
And they're like, oh no, that's how we make our money.

132
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,700
That's how we up our production, you see?

133
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,100
So this is already built in.

134
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:56,980
Now, most of the people below mid-level management don't know this.

135
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:57,920
They do.

136
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:04,140
It's spoken throughout the whole field, it's known, but no one presses about doing anything.

137
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:11,220
So when I was growing up in the 60s and 70s, I think I was already grown up in the 80s,

138
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:18,480
I would say that there was something going on called boycotts and strikes, right?

139
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,060
Okay.

140
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,120
And you don't see that anymore.

141
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,800
And two reasons.

142
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,440
One is the society has changed in terms of the programming, the brainwashing.

143
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,060
And the other thing is, I believe that those were not organic movements.

144
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,760
I think those were also co-opted.

145
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,400
They were engineered, you know?

146
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,900
Well, a lot of times it is by some people that are looking to compete in a corporate sense.

147
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,120
And we've seen that revealed before, right?

148
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:51,860
Where somebody causes a boycott, a sort of an outrage of the moment, not like the idiotic

149
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,000
things we see today where it's just something that's triggered based on a public statement,

150
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,200
but literally there's something going on, right?

151
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,580
A company has a backlash because they knew, and somebody else makes sure that people know

152
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:06,580
that that company knew that they were releasing a product that would do harm, right?

153
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,700
So their competitor turns around and releases information to show that that company knew

154
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:11,980
it.

155
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:17,520
Well, workers strike because they're not happy with wages, let's say, was the main one.

156
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:17,820
Right.

157
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,200
I think people are too apathetic.

158
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,720
But there were whisper campaigns that went on there with the workers too, you know?

159
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,780
And that's another way, like not just engaging with the public and trying to manipulate their

160
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,200
responses, but maybe specifically targeting workers, right?

161
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,980
And saying to yourself, well, look, I want to disrupt this manufacturer over here because

162
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,059
that way they'll have a harder time competing with me.

163
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:46,900
And if I knock out part of their human resource department, so to speak, they'll have delays

164
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:52,100
and issues, in which case my company comes in, fills the gap there where people still

165
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,060
need said product or think they need it.

166
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,260
I think it's beyond the companies.

167
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,360
I learned this a long time ago.

168
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:06,320
So maybe now it's more, but if you have a company, by the way, if you have a company

169
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,780
and you want to shut it down, it's more work to shut it down than to start one.

170
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,640
Oh, yeah.

171
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:10,920
Always.

172
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:11,400
Anything.

173
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,020
It's more work to shut it down.

174
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,040
Because you're taking their monetizing it.

175
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,080
They have that as collateral.

176
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:16,520
Right.

177
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:16,960
The collateral.

178
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,100
Anyway, you actually signed it over to them.

179
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,800
That's why here I'll give something out.

180
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,120
If you want to really set something up, you could do a C-Corp.

181
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,860
Don't do the LLCs like they say.

182
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,540
Whenever they tell you something's in vogue, don't do that, because then that holds you

183
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,360
personally culpable.

184
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,140
You do like a C-Corp, even an S-Corp, and you have more than one person in there.

185
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,460
Never have just one person.

186
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,920
Set it up just like a trust, right?

187
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:49,340
And then you have a trust involved in it, and the beneficiary of the trust is the United

188
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,360
States of America.

189
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,160
So if they want to come and attack you, guess who else you see?

190
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,360
Oh, they have to attack themselves, which.

191
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:58,760
Yeah.

192
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,720
So you're actually.

193
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,200
Well, no.

194
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:00,720
They're not.

195
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,300
They're foreign.

196
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,980
All attorneys with a bar card.

197
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,740
This is the truth.

198
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,620
You could look this up.

199
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,920
Well, it might be hard to find.

200
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,740
All attorneys, bar none, no pun intended, with a bar card, are unregistered foreign agents,

201
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,740
which is a no-no, by the way.

202
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:16,940
Yeah.

203
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:20,520
I was just going to say, technically speaking, that would be one of those things that's illegal.

204
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:21,840
Yeah.

205
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:27,380
That's why I keep saying there is no one legally in prison, especially no one is lawfully in

206
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,040
prison at all.

207
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,840
That's for sure.

208
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,440
Using any kind of system.

209
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:38,700
So yeah, I'm not saying that a typical idiot would say, Greek, you're saying no one should

210
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,060
be in prison?

211
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:39,800
No, I'm not saying.

212
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,880
Yeah, actually, I am saying that no one should be in prison because there's no reason for

213
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,220
prison.

214
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,380
Right?

215
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:44,880
Right.

216
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:45,940
So yeah.

217
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,640
You know, the laws already has provisions for that.

218
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,340
But it's a legal function, not a lawful function.

219
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,220
Right.

220
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,100
Which is money.

221
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:54,620
Yeah.

222
00:10:54,620 --> 00:11:00,300
So if you make the United States of America very important, the America part, a beneficiary

223
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:05,500
of anything you're doing, it's going to take like balls the size of Mount Everest to come

224
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,580
and try to penetrate what you're doing.

225
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:07,900
Right.

226
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:12,880
And also, if you try to do everything with private contract, you're not operating under

227
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,440
privilege.

228
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,420
So these are other discussions.

229
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,460
These are long discussions.

230
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,380
I do have not as much as I used to.

231
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:24,380
I talk to people in the corporate world and I have conversations and I bring these things

232
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,560
up and they're like, oh, my gosh, I never heard that before.

233
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,400
It makes total sense.

234
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,700
I said, yeah, because it's so simple.

235
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,900
So anyway, what they're doing with the corporations, if you're more than one hundred and fifty

236
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,780
million, you get infiltrated.

237
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,260
In other words, there's divisions.

238
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,180
Yes, there's divisions.

239
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:46,500
And when you most people use the word CIA, they don't know that that broke off from the

240
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:46,740
army.

241
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,800
That was a division of army intelligence that broke off after the Roswell event.

242
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,480
And people don't know that the Air Force is a break off from the Army Air Corps.

243
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,140
There's plenty of people that do if you live in a military town.

244
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,080
But after Roswell, they wanted to hide that there were Japanese prisoners of war flying

245
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,320
their advanced craft, see their craft.

246
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:15,200
Americans and white people had a hard problem flying their their craft because you laid

247
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,460
in a supinated position.

248
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:21,580
In other words, you laid flat on your stomach and you had two joysticks and the whole cavity

249
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,120
of that for you to squeeze in was less than 18 inches.

250
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,600
And these people were small.

251
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,640
You know, the average Japanese person was five foot zero back then.

252
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,080
And, you know, an adult Caucasian couldn't even get in there, you know.

253
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,020
So anyway, they flew those things around Roswell and they crashed them deliberately.

254
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,420
Suicide run to get away from the American prisoners.

255
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,740
By the way, the Americans are playing really dirty during World War Two.

256
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,920
You know, you've seen movies about American prisoners of war in Japan.

257
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,060
What was the thing about the bridge River Kwai or something like that?

258
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,380
But the Americans hardly had any Japanese prisoners.

259
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,860
So they went to the largest populated city of Japanese outside of Japan, which is Sao

260
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,480
Paulo, Brazil.

261
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:08,700
And they started kidnapping Japanese people, really dirty, really dirty, very, very dirty.

262
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,420
But anyway, all these imperial powers play very dirty.

263
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,700
The Turks played very dirty.

264
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,980
The Romans, the Greeks.

265
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:19,500
So, you know, whenever you hear of an empire, imperial, you know, yeah, well, hopefully nobody's

266
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,060
getting offended.

267
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,100
But here's the bottom line.

268
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:24,260
I mean, in Brazil, you can pay off anybody to do anything just about.

269
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,780
So it's you know, that makes it easier here, too.

270
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:31,000
I think I heard the prices for the 80s.

271
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,660
It was 10 grand to get a hit, man.

272
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,020
And then it went up by the 2000s to 50.

273
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:36,520
I hear it now.

274
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,800
It's below 10 grand again.

275
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,560
So, yeah.

276
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,980
It's apparently gone cheaper.

277
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,620
That's what I hear.

278
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,140
It's like 1970s prices.

279
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:42,920
My gosh.

280
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,340
Right.

281
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,100
Don't ask me how I hear these things.

282
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,480
But, you know, I look at what is in the head, right?

283
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,520
The voices in your head.

284
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,140
Oh, yeah.

285
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,800
You know, I'm imagining this, but I'm not imagining it.

286
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:51,980
Yeah.

287
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:52,420
I got you.

288
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,000
Yeah.

289
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:54,560
That's right.

290
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:54,860
So.

291
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,880
So, yeah, they take control the way I've seen it firsthand.

292
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:05,420
The public cable access TVs, they they put an army intelligence person in there, usually

293
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:13,360
a woman because the least suspected because, you know, when you see certain people, you

294
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,480
presume they have a military when they say they have a military career, you kind of presumed

295
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:17,860
it anyway.

296
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,180
Right.

297
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:18,700
Right.

298
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,000
Very rarely do people presume women have military careers.

299
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,180
Very rarely.

300
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,880
There are different presumptions for women anyway, if you notice.

301
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:30,900
I mean, in any in any circumstance, I've noted often that, you know, like, say, homeless

302
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,920
women are treated differently than homeless men.

303
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,140
You know, for instance, people spend a little more time talking to them.

304
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,480
They don't dismiss them as easily.

305
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,500
They're a little more sympathetic.

306
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,860
You know, there are automatic ideas about women.

307
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:47,060
And I also have noticed that homeless women typically are in much worse shape than homeless

308
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:47,460
men.

309
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,200
Yeah.

310
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,120
Typically, most of them are true, true.

311
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:55,060
But they also are given more by the general public.

312
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:55,740
You know what I mean?

313
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,300
There's just a more sympathetic default position.

314
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,580
Women are just treated differently, is all I'm saying.

315
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:00,740
Yeah.

316
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,280
So what I've witnessed is despite what politically correct idiots want to tell you about how

317
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,100
we're all, you know, exactly.

318
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:06,760
No, we're not.

319
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,020
And the thing is that there are certain defaults to that.

320
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,240
And one of the things you're talking about here regarding the military background.

321
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:12,600
Yes.

322
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,700
The first assumption is that women don't automatically have a military background.

323
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,320
People don't presume that they do.

324
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,740
They don't make that presumption.

325
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:25,860
And the other thing is they're also seen as less threatening because, you know, matter

326
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,700
of fact, point of fact, the general population.

327
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:33,380
A man is a little more capable of violence with the better upper body strength.

328
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,320
And here's the interesting thing.

329
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:38,600
And this has been written about for many, many years ago as well.

330
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:43,140
Centuries ago, women make a better army because they would go in and get the job done.

331
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,900
They won't rape and pillage like men do.

332
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:45,400
Right.

333
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:46,240
Right.

334
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:46,880
There's that.

335
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,120
So they're actually more efficient, more of a threat because of these things.

336
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,060
We've also noted that they more efficiently use like things like water.

337
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:00,820
You know, a certain circumstances, you can find that their their bodies are just better

338
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,180
set up for certain things.

339
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,180
Yeah.

340
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,220
Their attitude.

341
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,060
There are two races.

342
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,100
The two races are there's man and woman.

343
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:08,680
Right.

344
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,040
OK.

345
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:10,380
So.

346
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,340
So anyway, we're not getting into the story.

347
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,520
There's no necessary for it.

348
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,920
They do plug these people in corporations, usually mid-level management, where the jobs

349
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,580
don't get rotated and things like that.

350
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,920
And they could make or break a company.

351
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:28,680
In other words, you go along with the plan like a perfect example is the the coviditis

352
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,640
or the crony, the crony virus.

353
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:30,980
Right.

354
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:31,440
Yeah.

355
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,160
It just happened.

356
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:32,460
Right.

357
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,720
One hundred and twenty CEOs quit in January.

358
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,080
Right.

359
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,960
They announced it in March.

360
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,280
Right.

361
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,140
Exactly.

362
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,340
And one hundred and twenty or something, maybe more, maybe less around there.

363
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:41,780
Quit.

364
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,780
Big companies quit in January.

365
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,200
They knew it was coming and how all the companies were in on it.

366
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,400
Right.

367
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:47,940
Yeah.

368
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,200
Like as if they were on lockstep.

369
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:50,420
Right.

370
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,600
It's a heads up phenomenon where it seems like, gee, you see a trend where a whole bunch

371
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,840
of people got out of a certain business right before it crashes.

372
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,540
You know, this kind of thing.

373
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,680
There's a heads up circumstance.

374
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,020
Yeah.

375
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:01,320
Yeah.

376
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:01,760
Yeah.

377
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,500
They didn't want to.

378
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,160
They didn't want to play.

379
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:03,599
They gave it.

380
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,060
Well, those guys got the option.

381
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,380
You play along or you leave.

382
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,359
And they said, I'm leaving.

383
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:07,980
Yeah.

384
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,380
You know, they get certain.

385
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,700
Some people don't get options.

386
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,200
It depends on how they start with you.

387
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:12,420
Right.

388
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,460
Well, I think sometimes they also just get told, listen, this is the way things are

389
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:15,800
going to be.

390
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:16,520
You do what you want.

391
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,640
And some people make a calculation.

392
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,160
Hey, listen, I don't want to be involved in this.

393
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,720
I got to go.

394
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,920
So I think all these people like the richest people in the world, people think that, you

395
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,260
know, who's the richest man where there is none.

396
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,720
These people are told what to do consistently.

397
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:35,820
I did some work for a woman a long time ago and her sister recommended her sister.

398
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,840
I did some mural work, artwork, restoration of plaster work.

399
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,620
And I get there like eight, eight thirty nine in the morning, start working.

400
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,200
And she's already having some wine and reading a book.

401
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,480
Right.

402
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,740
And it's very quiet.

403
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,800
And I asked her what she did.

404
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,000
And basically, she goes, she want to tell me.

405
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,660
But her sister was there one day and she says, tell him, you know, it's cool.

406
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,060
And basically, the sister told me the whole story, which I'll make it really short.

407
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,040
She punched a few numbers on a keyboard.

408
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:02,580
This is in the 90s, the wrong numbers for some reason.

409
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,180
And because of that, she doesn't you know, she got fired, but she also is going to be

410
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:07,880
taken care of.

411
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,200
She doesn't have to get another job once you're fired.

412
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:10,960
Right.

413
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,820
But it's not going to be like what she was basically what she was doing was I've mentioned

414
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,760
this many times before.

415
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,780
You got a guy like Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos or the really other rich people you hear about.

416
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,040
Right.

417
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:21,560
Right.

418
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,260
They have influence, public influence.

419
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,760
And they're told they should go and talk about this policy change in whatever light they

420
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,660
want it spoken on.

421
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,680
If they don't agree, their bank account goes to zero.

422
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,800
And the way they do that is there's someone on a keyboard that does that.

423
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,060
Right.

424
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,460
And the intelligence agencies, by the way, you know, have control over the banks.

425
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,280
They're a function of the bank.

426
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,760
And then so what they know when, you know, they're even back then when you check a bank

427
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:55,000
balance on the phone or whatever, they know you just checked it and then the moment you

428
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,760
check it and Jeff Bozo, let's say, goes down to zero, he gets a phone call right away.

429
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,700
And all they have to say is, are you going to reconsider now?

430
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,240
What do you think he's going to say in this?

431
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,380
Here's more proof of that.

432
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,580
I think less than a year ago, Bozo came out and said he's going to give all his money away.

433
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,180
Something like that.

434
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:13,400
Right.

435
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:17,920
It was really after the divorce, because he's worth like one hundred and fifty billion.

436
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:22,500
I'm going to give it all away because he wants to get another one was Prince.

437
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:26,240
You know, he was packing up a bag and all this stuff to buy an island or go somewhere

438
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:26,920
far away.

439
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,420
Right.

440
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,320
And he gets a call.

441
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,760
What do you think you're doing?

442
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,420
You can't do any.

443
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,000
Yeah.

444
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:37,480
None of these people that are rich and famous have any control over their finances at all.

445
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,600
They're given some cash, some cash, you know what I mean?

446
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,080
And this and that.

447
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,460
Here's another example.

448
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,940
There's something that came out a few years ago, 50 cent everything he has, jewelry, car

449
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,860
house, everything's rented.

450
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:51,440
Yeah.

451
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,440
Do you remember that?

452
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:52,780
I don't know.

453
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:53,540
Maybe.

454
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,340
I just want to ask you if you remember these things.

455
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,840
I wonder if I'm imagining it or Mandela effect or whatever.

456
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,100
Right.

457
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,860
You're not imagining it at all.

458
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,040
You know, there was even if you want to go to something a little more current, you know,

459
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,680
Kanye West.

460
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:04,980
Right.

461
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,880
People forget about this part of the story because they focus on, you know, the whole

462
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,100
thing.

463
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:09,640
He showed up.

464
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,980
Oh, you know, I like Hitler.

465
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:11,600
Blah, blah, blah.

466
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:12,360
Right.

467
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,140
They did all that.

468
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,520
But that was, you know, Kanye saying that with a mask over his face.

469
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,400
But when they when they did all that, there was part of the story where they said, you

470
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,880
know, something like, I don't know, five hundred million dollars or whatever or what he had

471
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,700
just suddenly disappeared, was gone like bank accounts were just taken.

472
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,020
Yeah.

473
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:28,440
Yeah.

474
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:28,740
There is.

475
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,700
There's nothing there.

476
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,100
Yeah.

477
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:30,960
Well, just digital.

478
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,580
We're in the worst kind of situation we've ever been in.

479
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,380
But at the same time, it seems like we're not.

480
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:35,760
Right.

481
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,860
So he did something that was not according to what he was told.

482
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,880
And therefore, they said, hey, you know, why don't you check your circumstance again and

483
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,460
see if you still want to keep doing that?

484
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:49,680
And, you know, I'm pretty sure, actually, he stopped whatever it was.

485
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,900
Everybody's focusing on, you know, as per usual, look, a distraction.

486
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:54,600
But yeah.

487
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:59,360
But what I'm saying about they have nothing and at any moment they could go down to zero

488
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,980
is not a presumption.

489
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,360
It's been shown many ways.

490
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:09,160
I mean, we don't need more concrete, let's say, evidence or beyond, you know, because

491
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:15,360
when I when I first heard this 30 years ago, almost now, it made total sense to me, made

492
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,160
total sense, because, you know, I knew back then we're living in a fake world or, you

493
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,640
know, controlled world.

494
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,660
I just didn't think it was that fake because how much energy it takes to control so many

495
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,040
people and you really don't have to.

496
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,140
You just have you control a few people that control others, right?

497
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,580
A whole mass of others.

498
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,640
And you keep them peaceful until it's not right to be peaceful.

499
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:41,200
But back to the theme that I wanted to discuss, stop buying things, fix it.

500
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,080
Don't even a car.

501
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,140
I hope you're doing well with your car there.

502
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,400
Got all the parts.

503
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,920
And I'm trying to encourage people to work on most.

504
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,360
If you don't live in a major city, you're probably going to need some kind of engine

505
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,100
driven wagon.

506
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:56,380
Right.

507
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:56,960
Oh, yeah.

508
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,540
I guarantee you.

509
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,300
Yeah.

510
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:58,400
Yeah.

511
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,740
Or yeah.

512
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,460
Or someone in the family or someone nearby or a community car.

513
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,720
We once had a community car when I lived in New York.

514
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:10,000
It was a car that we between three or four different people we shared.

515
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:10,400
Right.

516
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:16,700
That worked out really well because it was a beater, you know, and it just worked.

517
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:21,420
So yeah, everybody goes in with the right if everybody goes in with the right attitude,

518
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,460
you can easily do that.

519
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,580
By the way, I would certainly recommend that if you can arrange it.

520
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,680
You know, if you've got a couple of neighbors that can cooperate on something, that's a

521
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:34,240
great thing to arrange for, because this way there's always a vehicle available.

522
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:35,240
Right.

523
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,980
So actually, that's what I was about to say.

524
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,000
It's not when they wanted to go to a bike race.

525
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,920
It was not available.

526
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,380
Just almost like clockwork.

527
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,040
Well, see, but you got to you got to arrange for it in Jersey and stuff like that.

528
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,200
So you got to arrange things.

529
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,120
It's sort of like, you know, waiting to shoot pool at a bar.

530
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:48,360
Right.

531
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,940
As long as everybody follows the rules and you use the you know, they did follow the

532
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:52,140
rules.

533
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,320
It just when they did.

534
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:53,660
You're right.

535
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,640
They didn't follow the rules.

536
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:54,840
They didn't follow the rules.

537
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,840
You're supposed to call each other when someone uses the car or call two people out of the

538
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,620
four or five.

539
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,560
And there was no call.

540
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,500
The car wasn't there.

541
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,740
I called the pound.

542
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,300
You have alternate side of the street parking.

543
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:06,960
Oh, yeah.

544
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:07,300
Yeah.

545
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,560
You know, tow it.

546
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:08,820
Right.

547
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,800
And you call the pound.

548
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,580
No, it's not the pound.

549
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,720
I called the pound three times.

550
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,820
Is he sure it's not there?

551
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:13,940
Yeah.

552
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,760
So anyway.

553
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:15,940
Yeah.

554
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:16,820
Stop buying things.

555
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:20,940
And by the way, if I can encourage anyone to work on things, most things, OK, let's

556
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:26,420
say cars, cars, bicycles, dishwashers, washing machines, dishwasher.

557
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,480
I would forego.

558
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,140
I have one.

559
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:28,820
I never use it.

560
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:33,680
I store all the, you know, what do you call left over the plastic containers and lids

561
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,520
in the dishwasher.

562
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:34,860
Right.

563
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,800
I never use it because it's so slow and inefficient.

564
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,360
Now, restaurant dishwashers work really well.

565
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,060
They're three minutes.

566
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,000
Yeah.

567
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,880
But that's an entirely that's an entirely different machine from what you get at home,

568
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,100
though.

569
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,460
It doesn't have to be, though.

570
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:46,840
Yeah.

571
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,460
You could read.

572
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,680
You could design it to be very much like that.

573
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,500
But but any washing machine, all these car, bicycle.

574
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,820
If you can change a light bulb, here's the encouragement part.

575
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,460
It's true.

576
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,700
If you can change a light bulb, you could pretty much work on any of these machines.

577
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,700
But instead of holding the bulb in your hand, you're going to be holding a tool.

578
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:06,800
Right.

579
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:07,400
Right.

580
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,340
So, right.

581
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,120
A wrench or something.

582
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:10,660
Yeah.

583
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,580
Hopefully it's not.

584
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,380
You could use a hammer, but not too much.

585
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:18,340
Don't use hammers if you can avoid them on machines.

586
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,260
Wrench, screwdriver.

587
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:19,580
Sure.

588
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:19,920
Good.

589
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:20,440
Yeah.

590
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,020
If you could work a light bulb.

591
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:22,600
Right.

592
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,940
If you can operate replacing a light bulb or, you know, that's why years ago when I used

593
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,960
to get people and people chose, do you know how to operate a screwdriver?

594
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:35,480
And, you know, and the ones that are comfortable, of course, you know, yes.

595
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,920
The ones that weren't confident would laugh and laugh and laugh, said, you haven't answered

596
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,760
the question yet.

597
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:40,200
Right.

598
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:45,960
So, yeah, you prove this with me recently where, you know, you basically instructed me about

599
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,720
a couple of things.

600
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:53,100
And that's all I really needed to know is how to thread and unthread things a bit until

601
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:57,320
I got up to a point where I had to replace a belt because, you know, to actually get

602
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,480
that done, that's a little different.

603
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,500
You know, it requires.

604
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,200
Did you get the tool and the serpentine belt tool?

605
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,240
You know what?

606
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:09,720
I tried to do that, but I had problems visually, so I had to, I sought somebody's assistance.

607
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,220
I mean, that's another limitation.

608
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:11,700
It's complicated.

609
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,440
You got to follow.

610
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,640
Sometimes they have a little sticker on the hood that shows you the path the belt has

611
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,180
to follow.

612
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:17,760
Yeah.

613
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,280
I was having trouble with that.

614
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,840
So I had somebody, you know, but that's a visual limitation.

615
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:27,120
I think if somebody is, you know, generally about common as to their visual acuity, they

616
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:27,680
would be fine.

617
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:32,020
I say the other thing, by the way, folks, if you're working on a car and one of the

618
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:36,220
wheels are removed, do me a favor and stick the wheel underneath the chassis of the car

619
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:36,540
somewhere.

620
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:40,940
So in case the jack fails or it's the car slides, the wheel will stop.

621
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,340
It'll knock you out, but it won't crush you.

622
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,520
And that way the car doesn't go all the way to the ground.

623
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:45,820
Yeah.

624
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,400
Yeah.

625
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,140
Yeah.

626
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,080
So that's a good idea.

627
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,260
Yeah.

628
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:53,180
And even if you think I'm going to scratch the nice five star alloy rim, it's, but you're

629
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,060
better off doing that.

630
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:58,440
But anyway, it's sometimes I do feel, let me just go outside, remove the wheel and get

631
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,200
under the car and drop the jack anyway.

632
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,820
But anyway.

633
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,880
No, I try and slide like a cinder block under there just to make sure that there's a guaranteed

634
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:10,140
amount of, you know, pretty much a guaranteed amount of space that you're changing a flat

635
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:13,020
or something, you know, and you take the wheel comes off, throw it under the car somewhere,

636
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:13,600
you know?

637
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:13,900
Yeah.

638
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,320
That's, that's the most practical way.

639
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,540
And then just in case or whatever.

640
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,300
See, sometimes you don't have cinder blocks and things like that.

641
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:20,920
Of course.

642
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,120
That's, that's something you'll have.

643
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,220
Use the wheel.

644
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:23,780
Yeah.

645
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:24,320
Yeah.

646
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:29,180
Because the, I've seen jacks fail, not because the jack failed, but they, they just weren't

647
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,340
on good footing or the car slid or whatever.

648
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,140
Yeah.

649
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:37,920
So, um, start fixing, start learning how to fix things, sewing machines, washing machines,

650
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:44,560
uh, cars, um, you know, goes on and on and on anything, uh, anything you could fix the

651
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,320
next level.

652
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:45,980
Okay.

653
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,840
Here's the thing I discussed a while back.

654
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,660
Very important in the near future.

655
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:55,400
Not so near, but near enough, uh, get to know your neighbors, not because you need to whatever

656
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,140
I believe in good fences, make good neighbors, right?

657
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:03,820
But, uh, figure out what people are good at and start using that and use the barter

658
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,780
system if you can.

659
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,080
Right.

660
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:11,940
In other words, um, find out, uh, not a re not what they call a certified, you know,

661
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:16,100
the, the, the doctors with permission or whatever, cause they're, they don't do much, but someone

662
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:20,600
who's good at whatever they're, you know, you'll find people like, Oh, this guy on the

663
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,820
block, he's good with cars or this guy's a plumber, this guy's an electrician, but very

664
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,500
rarely do you find someone that's a good at medical stuff.

665
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,020
Right.

666
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,780
People have been shied away and scared away from that, right?

667
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:33,800
So when I say fixing stuff, I'm just fast forwarding to the end here.

668
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:39,500
One thing that you're always going to find lacking in any community is other than going

669
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,340
to what they call a licensed doctor is someone who's good at medical stuff.

670
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:48,900
So if there's a lack of that, that needs to be developed, someone in every community needs

671
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,760
to start learning.

672
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,920
It also, there's a, there's a knack for it, right?

673
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:57,180
If you're too squeamish, you know, it's not going to work.

674
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:02,180
There is a knack there, there, there, there are natural attributes that certain people

675
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:06,580
have towards the healing arts and medicine and even surgery, right?

676
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,240
There are natural attributes to that.

677
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,220
So that's one thing that I just fast forwarded because that's lacking.

678
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,460
For me, I'll tell you, I'll do most of it.

679
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:21,580
Most of the medical stuff, minor surgery and dental, or, you know, pretty much all that

680
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:21,880
stuff.

681
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:27,820
So, uh, like the old barbers, you know, uh, back in the days, the barber was the hospital,

682
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,960
the, uh, well back then, if you said you're going to the hospital, it was hospice, you

683
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,980
were going to die, right?

684
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,820
And it was for quarantining people with contagions and, uh, things like that.

685
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,120
Right.

686
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,980
And, uh, yeah.

687
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,240
Uh, or, yeah.

688
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,300
And they got a bad name because they were, uh, kidnapping.

689
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:50,640
The church was kidnapping people to do a medical experimentation on just like today, uh, simulated

690
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,400
heart attacks.

691
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,540
Uh, yeah.

692
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,080
Anyway.

693
00:28:54,600 --> 00:29:00,640
Uh, I can get into the horror stories, but yeah, it's the, most of the people in the

694
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,620
medical professional that have clout are similar to the, most of the people that work in the

695
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,460
animal testing.

696
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:12,620
In other words, you don't have to pour hydrochloric acid in a rabbit's eye a hundred times of

697
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,800
the hundred rabbits to know that it's bad for the rabbit.

698
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,440
Yeah.

699
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,540
So there's a certain personality.

700
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,160
Just take it this way.

701
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:25,240
The kind of one that, uh, uh, goes out as a child and burns ants and bugs with a magnifying

702
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:25,580
glass.

703
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,440
You know that, right?

704
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,380
Those people.

705
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:27,740
Yeah.

706
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:31,940
And unfortunately, most of the community, the medical community that those, I'm talking,

707
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,120
I'm not talking about the people that do all the grunt work.

708
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,180
I'm talking about the people more up top are like that.

709
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:40,740
I hate to say they're pretty sick, uh, individuals.

710
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:46,400
Uh, so no pun intended there actually, there should be a pun, get it sick medical anyway.

711
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,420
Uh, yeah.

712
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:54,040
So one thing I would suggest is people learning how to do the healing arts, which, uh, when

713
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,360
it comes to fixing stuff.

714
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:59,880
And here's the thing right now is the most practical time to do it because if it's not

715
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:04,580
working out well, you can always go to the conventional, you know, a clinic or a hospital

716
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,820
to back, you know, whatever.

717
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,160
Right.

718
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,920
But whenever I've done anything and they ended up going, it was an emergency situation to

719
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,340
a hospital and they said, who did this?

720
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,580
Whoever, there's a doctor, right?

721
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,800
Whoever did this, you know, set it up or blah, blah, blah.

722
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:23,120
So many situations I've done, uh, say, well, this must've, you went to another hospital

723
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,200
like no.

724
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,760
I don't know.

725
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:31,120
So in other words, and it's, it's, it's learn how to demystify these things.

726
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:35,760
There's nothing mystical about it and that would, that would be like the end of the fix.

727
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,080
Right.

728
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:41,120
But back to the, the, the more practical fixing stuff, people are, you're going to always

729
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,900
encounter fixing stuff and most of the time it's either leave it alone or hire someone

730
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,360
or buy something new.

731
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:48,120
Right.

732
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:54,680
Uh, everyone that's listening or anyone that could possibly listen has enough time to learn

733
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,580
to fix things.

734
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:56,660
You're right.

735
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:01,860
I mean, unless you're really put it this way, if you're working 20 hours a day or 12 hours

736
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:06,360
a day and you have no days off, well, you might be one of the exceptions that you might,

737
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:10,520
maybe you should hire someone you see, but most people don't have that kind of rigor.

738
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,160
Most people have enough free time to do other things.

739
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,100
And I would suggest learning how to fix stuff.

740
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:19,620
And uh, I think the, the shenanigans that they pulled three years ago, it's been three

741
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:24,920
years already, should be a little bit of a wake up call on what's coming.

742
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,840
So learn how to fix stuff.

743
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,100
And again, most things that you're going to fix machines are like changing the light bulb.

744
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,040
Just keep reminding yourself of that.

745
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:39,220
And when you, uh, the more you do, the more confidence you'll develop.

746
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:44,780
Now, most people think that if you're doing something and it ends up in failure, let's

747
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:48,180
say even catastrophic failure, you should lose your confidence.

748
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,120
No.

749
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:54,100
What it does there is you'll be confident if you have a good memory on how not to do.

750
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:59,680
Uh, if something fails or doesn't work, you must retain the memory of everything that

751
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,140
you did.

752
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,940
Uh, and that is just as valuable, right?

753
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,440
Because now you have caveats.

754
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:08,180
So when you're instructing or doing it again, make sure you don't do this, right?

755
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:08,420
Right.

756
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,040
Yep.

757
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:09,260
Right.

758
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:09,540
Okay.

759
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:15,200
So, so anything that you do should develop confidence, no matter if it works out the

760
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,900
way you thought or not is what I'm trying to say.

761
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:21,540
And I'm not trying to give a pep talk here, but this is just really how it works.

762
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,000
Right.

763
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:28,460
Um, the really good, the old learn from your mistakes, uh, adage, you know, well, actually,

764
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,760
well, no, no, no.

765
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:34,100
My point, this is my point I was going to say next, you just, uh, you got it for try

766
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,340
to learn from other people's mistakes because it's cheaper.

767
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:37,780
Right.

768
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,800
They paid, they paid, they flipped the bill.

769
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:40,200
Right.

770
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:44,440
Cause usually if you, if you learning from your mistakes, guess who gets the bill?

771
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:45,360
You do.

772
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,400
Oh, right.

773
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,640
So it's good to know.

774
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,680
You're in a store, you break it, you buy it.

775
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,020
Yeah.

776
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:50,140
Yeah.

777
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,240
Yeah.

778
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,440
So try to learn from other people's mistakes.

779
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:56,860
And unfortunately, when you go to YouTube university, I actually keep saying YouTube

780
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,200
university.

781
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,680
Some people say, I looked up YouTube university.

782
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,460
There's nothing like that.

783
00:32:59,700 --> 00:32:59,880
No.

784
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,380
I said, I mean, you go to YouTube for how to DIY stuff.

785
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,380
That's what I mean by that.

786
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:07,320
But there is no such thing as YouTube, but there is Google scholar there, but Google

787
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,580
right now is like, Oh my gosh.

788
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:08,880
Yeah.

789
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,040
That's another thing though.

790
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:15,040
But yeah, no, you can learn from people just showing you how things work, how they, yeah,

791
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:15,520
exactly.

792
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:20,260
But they very rarely video themselves screwing up and what the screw ups are very rarely.

793
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:20,940
Right.

794
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,220
Right.

795
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,500
They don't do that.

796
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:25,460
Then I think that would make a better video because they, they're, you know what?

797
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,200
It's very popular.

798
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,080
They have these fail videos, right?

799
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:28,700
Right.

800
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,740
Fails and things.

801
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,240
And those things get millions of views.

802
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:35,000
You just pop up, you know, sometimes I was like, what the hell, like 7.8 million views

803
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,480
on fails.

804
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:40,020
And it's just somebody that gathered videos from everybody else.

805
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:44,360
Didn't know production costs, you know, and they're 7.3 million videos.

806
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,840
If it's monetized, that's $7,300, right?

807
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,080
It's a penny per view, right?

808
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:57,300
So yeah, there's very little, um, don't so much on the dues, I suggest, uh, you know,

809
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,580
here's the interesting part.

810
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,340
And just to go back about fixing, to learn how to fix stuff yourself.

811
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,660
One of the things I was known for back in the day for speaking, I was speaking on scripture

812
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:09,760
and the Bible and it basically saying, you're all doing it wrong or everything that you

813
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,199
think is in there is not in there.

814
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:11,960
And what's in there.

815
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,440
You don't know anything about, right.

816
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,300
That was like one of my main things, right?

817
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:15,679
Right.

818
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,500
Now here's the thing.

819
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:22,040
And, and, and I always shied away from religion and I always shied away.

820
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,679
What are religious people do with the Bible?

821
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,320
Biblically?

822
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,840
Oh, you got to read your Bible every day.

823
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,060
Right.

824
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:26,880
And what do I say?

825
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,239
Read the Bible.

826
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,000
Are you joking?

827
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:29,920
Put it away.

828
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:31,860
You shouldn't read the Bible.

829
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,280
Why?

830
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:32,640
Why?

831
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:33,540
Why shouldn't I read it?

832
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:35,540
Cause you're not going to understand a thing in it.

833
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,239
That's why.

834
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,460
Why waste your time?

835
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,120
Right.

836
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:43,120
So for some that worked out really well because you know, when you tell, uh, let's say you

837
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:46,960
have a child and you say, you're going to spend the day in this house, you got to have everything

838
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,000
in this house, but you can't go in the drawer in this room, right?

839
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,760
20 rooms in the house, arcade pool, everything, right?

840
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,219
TV.

841
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,560
The moment you leave, you know where he's going, right?

842
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:56,980
Yeah.

843
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:57,620
Of course.

844
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,920
Right to that drawer because it's a, yeah, of course.

845
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:04,480
So what this did was it actually, by telling people not to read the Bible, and this is

846
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,740
in genuine, I've said this, it actually got the people that were more inclined in being

847
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,780
curious to actually go and read it.

848
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,940
And when you read something, don't read it because it's popular.

849
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,940
You read it because you're really curious about it.

850
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,320
You're going to get so much more out of it.

851
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:21,900
Most of the people that have ever gone back and read the Bible after hearing Greek speak

852
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:25,800
have gotten so much more out of it because of that.

853
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,520
And it's not this, I'm not doing this reverse psychology stuff that they call whatever at

854
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:29,660
all.

855
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:35,480
I just know how the human mind works and how it's wired to, uh, you prepare the mind.

856
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:41,280
In other words, you put something out that seems very unprepared, that only those that

857
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,120
are more inclined to be prepared, even though they're not prepared to do it.

858
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,040
Right?

859
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:51,720
So that's why I said earlier, very important just to fix things.

860
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,280
The ultimate thing to fix is the human body, right?

861
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,420
I say, fix machines about, you know, don't buy anything, just fix it.

862
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,940
You know, if they tell you the car in blue book is worth a thousand bucks and you need

863
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:03,840
2000 bucks for new transmission, do the $2,000 transmission.

864
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:04,400
You know why?

865
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:09,180
Because you're going to spend, let's say three, 4,000, 5,000, 10,000 on another car and you're

866
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:12,200
still going to need the transmission anyway, eventually the liability, right?

867
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:19,640
But here's the thing about the body and remember, uh, there are some people that are more inclined

868
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:23,560
to be quote unquote, a doctor or a surgeon or a healer, you know, when in the healing

869
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:28,420
arts, let's say, right then, then all, you know, if you got everyone in the neighborhood

870
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:32,860
together and said, everyone's got to learn this basic first aid stuff, some people would

871
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,740
be like, why am I here?

872
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,560
I hate this stuff.

873
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:34,800
Right.

874
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,240
And other people that give me more.

875
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:36,920
Right.

876
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,500
So how do you sort them out?

877
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,900
I think they need to be sorted out just by putting the word out and it happens naturally

878
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,580
again.

879
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:49,420
So many of the things that I started with was biblical stuff because the Western society

880
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:55,100
leans very heavily on it and there's a lot of misunderstanding and misdirection and misconstruing

881
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,240
of what it's about.

882
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:00,920
The second thing I always talked about is just learning about, uh, what's in front of

883
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,540
you, uh, paying attention and being objective about it.

884
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:03,760
Right.

885
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,420
And paying attention.

886
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:10,460
I mean like really, really, really listening to what things mean and what they're saying.

887
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,200
Yeah.

888
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,480
And, and all this stuff comes together by the way.

889
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:16,300
Right.

890
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:21,760
And if you hear me now saying, don't buy anything new, fix the stuff if you have it all right.

891
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,320
Well, when I say don't buy anything new, I don't mean like if you need something, don't

892
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:25,720
go buy.

893
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,440
Like if you don't have a hammer and you need a hammer, as Greek says, don't buy anything.

894
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,800
Don't go ahead and buy the hammer.

895
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:35,820
But if the head falls, let's say a wooden handle and it falls off and it doesn't work,

896
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,580
you know, it's dangerous.

897
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,640
Fix it.

898
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,760
Don't buy another hammer.

899
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,020
Make sure that's a function.

900
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:40,680
You see what I mean?

901
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,020
Right.

902
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:45,980
So if you need to replace something, think about it.

903
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,980
If you need to acquire something, acquire it.

904
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,440
But here's the point.

905
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:56,520
If you need to acquire something, get it used, get it pre-owned, find, um, this is what I

906
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:56,740
do.

907
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:03,160
Find a, I'm looking around in the house here, uh, and let's say 75% of the stuff I've had

908
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:08,060
I bought, uh, either at a thrift store or used on Craigslist or one of these offer up sites

909
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:08,500
or whatever.

910
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:08,780
Right.

911
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:08,960
Yeah.

912
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:09,440
Okay.

913
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,600
So, right.

914
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,080
Anything.

915
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:16,380
Uh, and things that have been handed, uh, given to me, hand-me-downs and things like

916
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:16,640
that.

917
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:24,200
I very rarely buy anything, uh, new first, seek to buy it new, uh, first, um, buy it,

918
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:32,040
uh, pre-owned if you can, is the point, uh, it has, it has, look, it's beyond economics.

919
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,640
There are a lot of quote unquote, cover your ears, white people that think that if they

920
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:41,760
have something, uh, they, that costs a $40 brand new, they could sell it for 35 and

921
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,960
they even sat on Craigslist.

922
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,340
Well, it's $5 less and less the tax.

923
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,400
I'm like, no jerk off.

924
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:50,860
The moment something leaves the store, it's worth about half, right?

925
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:57,660
You know, they even say this with cars, you know, you drive a car 30% 40% right.

926
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:03,500
So you got a lot of these white people, uh, cause I was looking for a washing machine recently

927
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:10,260
and the guy has a washing machine, you know, it's $700, it's $900 at home Depot, 700 for

928
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,640
me or 800 or something like that.

929
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,840
It's a hundred dollars less and less the tax.

930
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:15,780
I'm like, jerk off.

931
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:21,680
The moment you took that washing machine home, the same, the next day it's, it's $400.

932
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,440
It's 450 if it's 900.

933
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,660
So yeah, yeah.

934
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,140
450.

935
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:30,440
And he's, but here's the thing, there's all these other white people that are going and

936
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,140
buying it cause they're buying that line.

937
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:37,660
They're buying the line that, Oh, it's a hundred dollars less than, uh, you see, and

938
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,820
then they go ahead and it's telling the wife, they just goes, yeah, but they'll actually

939
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,460
go and buy it.

940
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,200
They fall for that.

941
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:47,280
So you can't make everyone savvy is what I'm trying to say, but there's a good percentage

942
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,700
of the population, depending on where you are, they're not very savvy at all, but that could

943
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,960
also be used to your advantage.

944
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,400
So why am I saying this?

945
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,720
Why, why fix everything?

946
00:39:55,820 --> 00:40:02,120
Why do industry is gotten to the point now where it's pretty, it should be pretty obvious

947
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,180
that they don't know how to make anything anymore.

948
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:09,740
In other words, many of these hard goods like cars, refrigerators, washing machines, these,

949
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:15,240
these things, if you see a new model every year, the simple reason is that they're appealing

950
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,340
to your ego and some sense of fashion and trend.

951
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:25,120
And they really haven't figured out the only logical reason is the reason that it's different

952
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,520
every year for a car is because they really haven't figured out how to make it yet.

953
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:28,980
Right?

954
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,080
Right.

955
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:30,320
Right.

956
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,880
Because if you look at shoes or other things or clothing that change, it's based on fashion

957
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:38,920
and trends, but shoes are, we've already established, by the way, don't take shoes for granted because

958
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,300
only up until about a little more than a hundred years ago, you didn't have a left and right

959
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:42,820
shoe, right?

960
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,380
It was a straight shoe and you had to break it in.

961
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:51,600
That's why there was so many, uh, if you growing up maybe long time ago or whenever you met

962
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,720
someone very old and you've got new shoes, Oh, be careful.

963
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,980
They could hurt your feet, you know, because shoes were straight.

964
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,780
They were no, there was no left or right.

965
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,100
Yeah.

966
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,560
And there you had to break it in.

967
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,100
And, oh boy, oh boy, was that painful.

968
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:07,220
But anyway, many of the things that we see, like I've mentioned hardware stuff, uh, if

969
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:12,880
you have a shovel, uh, or whatever, it's this growing up, it's the same right now because

970
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,700
they figured out, right?

971
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:18,420
A hammer or anything, a saw, it's the same thing because this is how it should be.

972
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:22,400
So when you see things like cars that they change every, that is not, it has nothing to

973
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,220
do with what you think you need a car for.

974
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:31,900
That is appealing to some strange distraction, some strange fashionable things, some bizarre

975
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:35,300
that should not exist in my, in my opinion, of course.

976
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,540
It works the same.

977
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,380
It's built the same.

978
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:41,020
They just changed the color because nowadays it's more fashionable to wear bright color

979
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,620
as opposed to a muted color or whatever.

980
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:43,720
You know, that's it.

981
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,520
But I got it.

982
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,520
But here's the, yeah.

983
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,100
But here's the thing.

984
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:51,800
Are people that shallow and that stupid that they think that because they have a newer

985
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,160
car that makes things better or them better somehow.

986
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,780
And don't answer that because we know the answer to that.

987
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,740
We know that if it wasn't, if it wasn't true, it wouldn't be happening.

988
00:41:59,840 --> 00:41:59,980
Yeah.

989
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,660
Some people think that directly, by the way.

990
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:05,800
I mean, we're like no, no in between, no practical practicality to it at all.

991
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,320
It's just a matter of, Oh, it's better.

992
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:07,960
Things are better.

993
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,040
I can prove that because I have a new car.

994
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:13,180
I mean, literally that's, they're directly, yeah, better than the Joe.

995
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:18,180
He got a Cadillac, you know, I've got the iPhone 15, but you only have the 10, you know?

996
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:18,520
Yeah.

997
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,020
Yeah.

998
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:19,700
So, yeah.

999
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,580
So, so the way you get, uh, you know, one of my things is don't you want to kick them

1000
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,540
in the shins at least once before you leave here?

1001
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:26,800
Right.

1002
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:31,480
Meaning those that are running this thing, which we don't know who they are directly.

1003
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:37,960
The way you kick them in the shins is by example, if you start fixing things and becoming savvy,

1004
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:45,860
uh, uh, dwell in the used market, uh, by the way, uh, all of the washing machines that I've

1005
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:46,700
ever gotten are used.

1006
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:51,580
And if I put a photograph of it, you know, let's say that's a brand new machine that

1007
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,440
you have to be savvy.

1008
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:52,800
Right.

1009
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:53,740
Right.

1010
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:58,420
So, I mean, uh, just got one cause that's changed the bearing on another one and I figured

1011
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:59,080
get a backup.

1012
00:42:59,080 --> 00:42:59,500
Right.

1013
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:06,100
And, uh, it looks brand new and there's a hundred bucks, you know, uh, uh, anyway, and

1014
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:11,320
there were other ones similar for 350 and 400, but I just happened to get the right

1015
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:12,300
email.

1016
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,040
Right.

1017
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:13,460
Anyway.

1018
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:19,740
So, um, let's, let's just do it this way, uh, fix it.

1019
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:23,220
But when I say let's do it this way, you fix it, be savvy.

1020
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,720
It has nothing to do with, with saving money or making money or whatever.

1021
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:30,780
What it has to do is it's called contracting the economy.

1022
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,660
You've heard of that, right?

1023
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,940
When they contract the economy, there's less demand.

1024
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:41,820
Um, uh, look, if they say people are going to be losing jobs, no one will ever be out

1025
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:42,480
of a job.

1026
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:48,220
What you do is you ban them, uh, weed killers and you have people picking weeds for food

1027
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:48,820
and shelter.

1028
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,540
That's not a big deal.

1029
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:55,380
Hey, do I have to show that as there's no place I can go to do that as an example, let's

1030
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:56,960
say, say, well, Greek, you'd be the first one to do it.

1031
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:57,360
I'll do it.

1032
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:01,740
I'll pick weeds for the rest of my life and just for food and shelter room and board.

1033
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:02,560
Sure.

1034
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:06,440
Do I have to, do I have to like prove that there's no place I can go and apply for that.

1035
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,800
So these things need to be created.

1036
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:14,260
Um, by the way, most of the doctors and attorneys will be first runners up for, you know, for,

1037
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:15,600
for that job, by the way.

1038
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:15,920
Right.

1039
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:23,680
Uh, uh, and judges and, uh, a lot of the movie actors too, cause they haven't, they'd

1040
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,280
be suck.

1041
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:29,040
But anyway, if you have no skills at all and you can be told to take care of a job and

1042
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,300
you can be instructed about it in less than a day, I mean, that's the kind of thing that

1043
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,440
anybody can do as long as you're physically capable.

1044
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:35,420
So sure.

1045
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,380
And the story, it doesn't require any background.

1046
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,440
You don't have to know anything.

1047
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,400
You don't have to be able to read.

1048
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,420
Just look, you see this thing?

1049
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,220
It's this color, right?

1050
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:41,960
You understand that?

1051
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:48,720
I'm saying that indirectly too, because what you would be as a herder, I wouldn't, I wouldn't,

1052
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:51,460
uh, it wouldn't be practical for a human to do it.

1053
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:56,240
What you do is you raise some goats or, and sheep and you just become a herder and they,

1054
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:56,960
they clean up.

1055
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,320
They took, they eat everything.

1056
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:06,160
Now, uh, if you have too many sheep grazing, they could make the land a little barren because

1057
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:11,220
they pull everything out of the ground where the goats only eat the top usually, you know,

1058
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,460
each animal is characteristic.

1059
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,420
So the soil might stay a little more moist with the goats.

1060
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:17,920
But anyway, I'm using that as this is all metaphor.

1061
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,260
Everything is metaphor by the way.

1062
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,400
So yeah.

1063
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,500
How do people become savvy?

1064
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:28,160
Uh, you retract another first thing that's going to happen.

1065
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:31,540
Let's say you hear this and you're, it sparks something in you that I'm going to start fixing

1066
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:33,240
stuff or whatever.

1067
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:38,020
Uh, don't worry about the mechanics or the repairmen and all that.

1068
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:44,140
They've got, the reason why is because I assure you even not good repairmen or for machines

1069
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:46,500
or mechanic car mechanics, they're always busy.

1070
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,180
You're never going to find one that isn't right, right?

1071
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,860
So they could taper down a little bit.

1072
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:58,780
But what I mean by this is if you start doing this and you're known to do it, not just,

1073
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,700
you'll have maybe one out of a hundred people that would try to follow your example, but

1074
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:06,220
you're going to have to also learn how to vocalize it and speak on it to inspire others

1075
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:06,740
to do it.

1076
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:11,860
Because I have learned after all these years that most people do not learn by example.

1077
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,520
That is an old adage that people will learn by example.

1078
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:18,280
I am telling you, they do not, they do not learn by example.

1079
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:23,900
So you, you, you're going to have to somehow have come some kind of spiel to go with it,

1080
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:29,260
which is Yiddish for speak, I guess, uh, that will inspire them some kind of, uh, whatever,

1081
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:30,780
uh, to go along.

1082
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:35,980
What this will do again, contract the economy and it'll put things into perspective.

1083
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:39,580
It actually will raise the value of the notes that you're using, right?

1084
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:40,160
Right.

1085
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:41,440
And, uh, yeah.

1086
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:46,580
And, and best thing is you'll become more self-sufficient in a direct, in a direct sense.

1087
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:50,320
You get to raise the value of the notes that you possess immediately because after all,

1088
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:53,660
you're able to get more life out of something than you were before.

1089
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:58,580
Again, repurpose, reuse and re rehabilitate anything you can.

1090
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:01,320
That way you're not having to go buy another one.

1091
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:06,240
It doesn't matter if it's a plate or if it's a complex machine, right?

1092
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:11,140
Um, because you're, you're just getting more for your money, more bang for your buck, so

1093
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:11,740
to speak.

1094
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:13,560
Well, also you're not, yeah, yeah.

1095
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:17,380
There's many, many, I mean, there's lots of discussion you can get into as an end up in

1096
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:18,360
a landfill or whatever.

1097
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:23,300
Go, go look at these recycling places like for, they got recycling for all kinds of things.

1098
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,220
They are jam packed.

1099
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,500
There's mountains of stuff there.

1100
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:32,340
And, uh, every recycling place has a place set off to the side where the good stuff,

1101
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,720
it's like they're actually selling it.

1102
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:38,020
All I had to do was like fix something really minor and they're, you know, they're selling

1103
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:39,260
it as a used thing, right?

1104
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:41,020
That was given to be recycled.

1105
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:41,740
You see what I mean?

1106
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:42,080
Right.

1107
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:43,740
So yeah.

1108
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:49,160
Uh, so none of the, in other words, don't be concerned about servicemen, repairmen, mechanics,

1109
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:54,160
recycling places, or refurbishing places being compromised because you're, everyone's fixing

1110
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:54,900
stuff on their own.

1111
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:58,200
And they're not, they have their hands full more than, more than they could.

1112
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:58,880
You can imagine.

1113
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,480
Also, there's no guild around them.

1114
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:08,040
They, uh, all of these people that work in labor, uh, have no dedication, uh, to society

1115
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:08,440
at all.

1116
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:09,900
I think I've gotten over that.

1117
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:14,920
If you hired a carpenter years ago and he hung a door for you and it fell off and you

1118
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:17,380
called him and he didn't come back to fix it, make it right.

1119
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:23,520
You go to the guild and you say, Hey, uh, this guy, so-and-so one of your carpenters, uh,

1120
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:25,280
did a lousy job.

1121
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,280
Well, Oh, I'm sorry.

1122
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:29,420
They would, the guild would sit, would come and fix it for you.

1123
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:33,980
And then they would go and admonish the guy for giving out all the carpenters a bad name.

1124
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:34,380
You see?

1125
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:34,760
Right.

1126
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:42,420
So where are the mechanics when there's a bad mechanic going and making the car right

1127
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:46,260
and admonishing and telling the guy who did a bad job, you're giving us mechanics a bad

1128
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:46,460
name.

1129
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:47,520
Is that going on at all?

1130
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:49,040
No, never, never.

1131
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:49,320
Yeah.

1132
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,460
No, not never.

1133
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:51,640
It did at one point.

1134
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:52,240
Well, never.

1135
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,240
That was the norm.

1136
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,800
Well, you said, is it going on now?

1137
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:55,600
I'm saying never.

1138
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:56,060
Not at all.

1139
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,180
It's not at all.

1140
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:58,580
It's, it's even unheard of actually.

1141
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:02,020
If you, I've brought this up to several people in the trades and they laugh and then a couple

1142
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:06,400
of the old heads said, yeah, I remember my grandfather, this guy's already a grandfather.

1143
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:11,140
My grandfather told me about something like that, like ancient, like it's ancient history

1144
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:11,700
or something.

1145
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:12,240
And it's not.

1146
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:18,760
So in other words, they have no, um, dedication to you, right at all.

1147
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:22,000
So why don't you reciprocate by fixing your own stuff?

1148
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:22,700
True.

1149
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:23,160
Okay.

1150
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,720
I got you.

1151
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:26,700
Yeah.
